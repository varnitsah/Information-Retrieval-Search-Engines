57719024	english literature  its history and its significance for the life of the englishspeaking world  a textbook for schools  by william j long phd heidelberg                                       to my friend c h t in gratitude for his continued help in the preparation of this book                                       preface  this book which presents the whole splendid history of english literature from anglosaxon times to the close of the victorian era has three specific aims the first is to create or to encourage in every student the desire to read the best books and to know literature itself rather than what has been written about literature the second is to interpret literature both personally and historically that is to show how a great book generally reflects not only the authors life and thought but also the spirit of the age and the ideals of the nations history the third aim is to show by a study of each successive period how our literature has steadily developed from its first simple songs and stories to its present complexity in prose and poetry  to carry out these aims we have introduced the following features  1 a brief accurate summary of historical events and social conditions in each period and a consideration of the ideals which stirred the whole nation as in the days of elizabeth before they found expression in literature  2 a study of the various literary epochs in turn showing what each gained from the epoch preceding and how each aided in the development of a national literature  3 a readable biography of every important writer showing how he lived and worked how he met success or failure how he influenced his age and how his age influenced him  4 a study and analysis of every authors best works and of many of the books required for collegeentrance examinations  5 selections enoughespecially from earlier writers and from writers not likely to be found in the home or school libraryto indicate the spirit of each authors work and directions as to the best works to read and where such works may be found in inexpensive editions  6 a frank untechnical discussion of each great writers work as a whole and a critical estimate of his relative place and influence in our literature  7 a series of helps to students and teachers at the end of each chapter including summaries selections for reading bibliographies a list of suggestive questions and a chronological table of important events in the history and literature of each period  8 throughout this book we have remembered roger aschams suggestion made over three centuries ago and still pertinent that tis a poor way to make a child love study by beginning with the things which he naturally dislikes we have laid emphasis upon the delights of literature we have treated books not as mere instruments of researchwhich is the danger in most of our studiesbut rather as instruments of enjoyment and of inspiration and by making our study as attractive as possible we have sought to encourage the student to read widely for himself to choose the best books and to form his own judgment about what our first anglosaxon writers called the things worthy to be remembered  to those who may use this book in their homes or in their class rooms the writer ventures to offer one or two friendly suggestions out of his own experience as a teacher of young people first the amount of space here given to different periods and authors is not an index of the relative amount of time to be spent upon the different subjects thus to tell the story of spensers life and ideals requires as much space as to tell the story of tennyson but the average class will spend its time more pleasantly and profitably with the latter poet than with the former second many authors who are and ought to be included in this history need not be studied in the class room a textbook is not a catechism but a storehouse in which one finds what he wants and some good things beside few classes will find time to study blake or newman for instance but in nearly every class there will be found one or two students who are attracted by the mysticism of blake or by the profound spirituality of newman such students should be encouraged to follow their own spirits and to share with their classmates the joy of their discoveries and they should find in their textbook the material for their own study and reading  a third suggestion relates to the method of teaching literature and here it might be well to consider the word of a great poetthat if you would know where the ripest cherries are ask the boys and the blackbirds it is surprising how much a young person will get out of the merchant of venice and somehow arrive at shakespeares opinion of shylock and portia if we do not bother him too much with notes and critical directions as to what he ought to seek and find turn a child and a donkey loose in the same field and the child heads straight for the beautiful spots where brooks are running and birds singing while the donkey turns as naturally to weeds and thistles in our study of literature we have perhaps too much sympathy with the latter and we even insist that the child come back from his own quest of the ideal to join us in our critical companionship in reading many textbooks of late and in visiting many class rooms the writer has received the impression that we lay too much stress on secondhand criticism passed down from book to book and we set our pupils to searching for figures of speech and elements of style as if the great books of the world were subject to chemical analysis this seems to be a mistake for two reasons first the average young person has no natural interest in such matters and second he is unable to appreciate them he feels unconsciously with chaucer      and as for me though that my wit be lytë     on bookës for to rede i me delytë  indeed many mature persons including the writer of this history are often unable to explain at first the charm or the style of an author who pleases them and the more profound the impression made by a book the more difficult it is to give expression to our thought and feeling to read and enjoy good books is with us as with chaucer the main thing to analyze the authors style or explain our own enjoyment seems of secondary and small importance however that may be we state frankly our own conviction that the detailed study and analysis of a few standard workswhich is the only literary pabulum given to many young people in our schoolsbears the same relation to true literature that theology bears to religion or psychology to friendship one is a more or less unwelcome mental discipline the other is the joy of life  the writer ventures to suggest therefore that since literature is our subject we begin and end with good books and that we stand aside while the great writers speak their own message to our pupils in studying each successive period let the student begin by reading the best that the age produced let him feel in his own way the power and mystery of beowulf the broad charity of shakespeare the sublimity of milton the romantic enthusiasm of scott and then when his own taste is pleased and satisfied a new one will ariseto know something about the author the times in which he lived and finally of criticism which in its simplicity is the discovery that the men and women of other ages were very much like ourselves loving as we love bearing the same burdens and following the same ideals      lo with the ancient     roots of mans nature     twines the eternal     passion of song     ever love fans it     ever life feeds it     time cannot age it     death cannot slay  to answer the questions which arise naturally between teacher and pupil concerning the books that they read is one object of this volume it aims not simply to instruct but also to inspire to trace the historical development of english literature and at the same time to allure its readers to the best books and the best writers and from beginning to end it is written upon the assumption that the first virtue of such a work is to be accurate and the second to be interesting  the author acknowledges with gratitude and appreciation his indebtedness to professor william lyon phelps for the use of his literary map of england and to the keen critics teachers of literature and history who have read the proofs of this book and have improved it by their good suggestions  william j long stamford connecticut                                         contents

shakespeares henry v   the shell and the book a child and a man were one day walking on the seashore when the child found a little shell and held it to his ear suddenly he heard soundsstrange low melodious sounds as if the shell were remembering and repeating to itself the murmurs of its ocean home the childs face filled with wonder as he listened here in the little shell apparently was a voice from another world and he listened with delight to its mystery and music then came the man explaining that the child heard nothing strange that the pearly curves of the shell simply caught a multitude of sounds too faint for human ears and filled the glimmering hollows with the murmur of innumerable echoes it was not a new world but only the unnoticed harmony of the old that had aroused the childs wonder  some such experience as this awaits us when we begin the study of literature which has always two aspects one of simple enjoyment and appreciation the other of analysis and exact description let a little song appeal to the ear or a noble book to the heart and for the moment at least we discover a new world a world so different from our own that it seems a place of dreams and magic to enter and enjoy this new world to love good books for their own sake is the chief thing to analyze and explain them is a less joyous but still an important matter behind every book is a man behind the man is the race and behind the race are the natural and social environments whose influence is unconsciously reflected these also we must know if the book is to speak its whole message in a word we have now reached a point where we wish to understand as well as to enjoy literature and the first step since exact definition is impossible is to determine some of its essential qualities  qualities of literature the first significant thing is the essentially artistic quality of all literature all art is the expression of life in forms of truth and beauty or rather it is the reflection of some truth and beauty which are in the world but which remain unnoticed until brought to our attention by some sensitive human soul just as the delicate curves of the shell reflect sounds and harmonies too faint to be otherwise noticed a hundred men may pass a hayfield and see only the sweaty toil and the windrows of dried grass but here is one who pauses by a roumanian meadow where girls are making hay and singing as they work he looks deeper sees truth and beauty where we see only dead grass and he reflects what he sees in a little poem in which the hay tells its own story        yesterdays flowers am i     and i have drunk my last sweet draught of dew     young maidens came and sang me to my death     the moon looks down and sees me in my shroud       the shroud of my last dew     yesterdays flowers that are yet in me     must needs make way for all tomorrows flowers     the maidens too that sang me to my death     must even so make way for all the maids       that are to come     and as my soul so too their soul will be     laden with fragrance of the days gone by     the maidens that tomorrow come this way     will not remember that i once did bloom     for they will only see the newborn flowers     yet will my perfumeladen soul bring back     as a sweet memory to womens hearts         their days of maidenhood     and then they will be sorry that they came         to sing me to my death     and all the butterflies will mourn for me         i bear away with me     the sunshines dear remembrance and the low         soft murmurs of the spring     my breath is sweet as childrens prattle is     i drank in all the whole earths fruitfulness     to make of it the fragrance of my soul       that shall outlive my death1  one who reads only that first exquisite line yesterdays flowers am i can never again see hay without recalling the beauty that was hidden from his eyes until the poet found it  in the same pleasing surprising way all artistic work must be a kind of revelation thus architecture is probably the oldest of the arts yet we still have many builders but few architects that is men whose work in wood or stone suggests some hidden truth and beauty to the human senses so in literature which is the art that expresses life in words that appeal to our own sense of the beautiful we have many writers but few artists in the broadest sense perhaps literature means simply the written records of the race including all its history and sciences as well as its poems and novels in the narrower sense literature is the artistic record of life and most of our writing is excluded from it just as the mass of our buildings mere shelters from storm and from cold are excluded from architecture a history or a work of science may be and sometimes is literature but only as we forget the subjectmatter and the presentation of facts in the simple beauty of its expression  the second quality of literature is its suggestiveness its appeal to our emotions and imagination rather than to our intellect it is not so much what it says as what it awakens in us that constitutes its charm when milton makes satan say myself am hell he does not state any fact but rather opens up in these three tremendous words a whole world of speculation and imagination when faustus in the presence of helen asks was this the face that launched a thousand ships he does not state a fact or expect an answer he opens a door through which our imagination enters a new world a world of music love beauty heroismthe whole splendid world of greek literature such magic is in words when shakespeare describes the young biron as speaking          in such apt and gracious words     that aged ears play truant at his tales  he has unconsciously given not only an excellent description of himself but the measure of all literature which makes us play truant with the present world and run away to live awhile in the pleasant realm of fancy the province of all art is not to instruct but to delight and only as literature delights us causing each reader to build in his own soul that lordly pleasure house of which tennyson dreamed in his palace of art is it worthy of its name  the third characteristic of literature arising directly from the other two is its permanence the world does not live by bread alone notwithstanding its hurry and bustle and apparent absorption in material things it does not willingly let any beautiful thing perish this is even more true of its songs than of its painting and sculpture though permanence is a quality we should hardly expect in the present deluge of books and magazines pouring day and night from our presses in the name of literature but this problem of too many books is not modern as we suppose it has been a problem ever since caxton brought the first printing press from flanders four hundred years ago and in the shadow of westminster abbey opened his little shop and advertised his wares as good and chepe even earlier a thousand years before caxton and his printing press the busy scholars of the great library of alexandria found that the number of parchments was much too great for them to handle and now when we print more in a week than all the alexandrian scholars could copy in a century it would seem impossible that any production could be permanent that any song or story could live to give delight in future ages but literature is like a river in flood which gradually purifies itself in two waysthe mud settles to the bottom and the scum rises to the top when we examine the writings that by common consent constitute our literature the clear stream purified of its dross we find at least two more qualities which we call the tests of literature and which determine its permanence  tests of literature the first of these is universality that is the appeal to the widest human interests and the simplest human emotions though we speak of national and race literatures like the greek or teutonic and though each has certain superficial marks arising out of the peculiarities of its own people it is nevertheless true that good literature knows no nationality nor any bounds save those of humanity it is occupied chiefly with elementary passions and emotionslove and hate joy and sorrow fear and faithwhich are an essential part of our human nature and the more it reflects these emotions the more surely does it awaken a response in men of every race every father must respond to the parable of the prodigal son wherever men are heroic they will acknowledge the mastery of homer wherever a man thinks on the strange phenomenon of evil in the world he will find his own thoughts in the book of job in whatever place men love their children their hearts must be stirred by the tragic sorrow of oedipus and king lear all these are but shining examples of the law that only as a book or a little song appeals to universal human interest does it become permanent  the second test is a purely personal one and may be expressed in the indefinite word style it is only in a mechanical sense that style is the adequate expression of thought or the peculiar manner of expressing thought or any other of the definitions that are found in the rhetorics in a deeper sense style is the man that is the unconscious expression of the writers own personality it is the very soul of one man reflecting as in a glass the thoughts and feelings of humanity as no glass is colorless but tinges more or less deeply the reflections from its surface so no author can interpret human life without unconsciously giving to it the native hue of his own soul it is this intensely personal element that constitutes style every permanent book has more or less of these two elements the objective and the subjective the universal and the personal the deep thought and feeling of the race reflected and colored by the writers own life and experience  the object in studying literature aside from the pleasure of reading of entering into a new world and having our imagination quickened the study of literature has one definite object and that is to know men now man is ever a dual creature he has an outward and an inner nature he is not only a doer of deeds but a dreamer of dreams and to know him the man of any age we must search deeper than his history history records his deeds his outward acts largely but every great act springs from an ideal and to understand this we must read his literature where we find his ideals recorded when we read a history of the anglosaxons for instance we learn that they were sea rovers pirates explorers great eaters and drinkers and we know something of their hovels and habits and the lands which they harried and plundered all that is interesting but it does not tell us what most we want to know about these old ancestors of oursnot only what they did but what they thought and felt how they looked on life and death what they loved what they feared and what they reverenced in god and man then we turn from history to the literature which they themselves produced and instantly we become acquainted these hardy people were not simply fighters and freebooters they were men like ourselves their emotions awaken instant response in the souls of their descendants at the words of their gleemen we thrill again to their wild love of freedom and the open sea we grow tender at their love of home and patriotic at their deathless loyalty to their chief whom they chose for themselves and hoisted on their shields in symbol of his leadership once more we grow respectful in the presence of pure womanhood or melancholy before the sorrows and problems of life or humbly confident looking up to the god whom they dared to call the allfather all these and many more intensely real emotions pass through our souls as we read the few shining fragments of verses that the jealous ages have left us  it is so with any age or people to understand them we must read not simply their history which records their deeds but their literature which records the dreams that made their deeds possible so aristotle was profoundly right when he said that poetry is more serious and philosophical than history and goethe when he explained literature as the humanization of the whole world  importance of literature it is a curious and prevalent opinion that literature like all art is a mere play of imagination pleasing enough like a new novel but without any serious or practical importance nothing could be farther from the truth literature preserves the ideals of a people and idealslove faith duty friendship freedom reverenceare the part of human life most worthy of preservation the greeks were a marvelous people yet of all their mighty works we cherish only a few idealsideals of beauty in perishable stone and ideals of truth in imperishable prose and poetry it was simply the ideals of the greeks and hebrews and romans preserved in their literature which made them what they were and which determined their value to future generations our democracy the boast of all englishspeaking nations is a dream not the doubtful and sometimes disheartening spectacle presented in our legislative halls but the lovely and immortal ideal of a free and equal manhood preserved as a most precious heritage in every great literature from the greeks to the anglosaxons all our arts our sciences even our inventions are founded squarely upon ideals for under every invention is still the dream of beowulf that man may overcome the forces of nature and the foundation of all our sciences and discoveries is the immortal dream that men shall be as gods knowing good and evil  in a word our whole civilization our freedom our progress our homes our religion rest solidly upon ideals for their foundation nothing but an ideal ever endures upon earth it is therefore impossible to overestimate the practical importance of literature which preserves these ideals from fathers to sons while men cities governments civilizations vanish from the face of the earth it is only when we remember this that we appreciate the action of the devout mussulman who picks up and carefully preserves every scrap of paper on which words are written because the scrap may perchance contain the name of allah and the ideal is too enormously important to be neglected or lost  summary of the subject we are now ready if not to define at least to understand a little more clearly the object of our present study literature is the expression of life in words of truth and beauty it is the written record of mans spirit of his thoughts emotions aspirations it is the history and the only history of the human soul it is characterized by its artistic its suggestive its permanent qualities its two tests are its universal interest and its personal style its object aside from the delight it gives us is to know man that is the soul of man rather than his actions and since it preserves to the race the ideals upon which all our civilization is founded it is one of the most important and delightful subjects that can occupy the human mind  bibliography note each chapter in this book

earliest and the greatest epic or heroic poem in our literature it begins with a prologue which is not an essential part of the story but which we review gladly for the sake of the splendid poetical conception that produced scyld king of the spear danes2  at a time when the spear danes were without a king a ship came sailing into their harbor it was filled with treasures and weapons of war and in the midst of these warlike things was a baby sleeping no man sailed the ship it came of itself bringing the child whose name was scyld  now scyld grew and became a mighty warrior and led the spear danes for many years and was their king when his son beowulf3 had become strong and wise enough to rule then wyrd fate who speaks but once to any man came and stood at hand and it was time for scyld to go this is how they buried him      then scyld departed at word of wyrd spoken     the hero to go to the home of the gods     sadly they bore him to brink of the ocean     comrades still heeding his word of command     there rode in the harbor the princes ship ready     with prow curving proudly and shining sails set     shipward they bore him their hero beloved     the mighty they laid at the foot of the mast     treasures were there from far and near gathered     byrnies of battle armor and swords     never a keel sailed out of a harbor     so splendidly tricked with the trappings of war     they heaped on his bosom a hoard of bright jewels     to fare with him forth on the floods great breast     no less gift they gave than the unknown provided     when alone as a child he came in from the mere     high oer his head waved a bright golden standard     now let the waves bear their wealth to the holm     sadsouled they gave back its gift to the ocean     mournful their mood as he sailed out to sea4  and no man says the poet neither counselor nor hero can tell who received that lading  one of scylds descendants was hrothgar king of the danes and with him the story of our beowulf begins hrothgar in his old age had built near the sea a mead hall called heorot the most splendid hall in the whole world where the king and his thanes gathered nightly to feast and to listen to the songs of his gleemen one night as they were all sleeping a frightful monster grendel broke into the hall killed thirty of the sleeping warriors and carried off their bodies to devour them in his lair under the sea the appalling visit was speedily repeated and fear and death reigned in the great hall the warriors fought at first but fled when they discovered that no weapon could harm the monster heorot was left deserted and silent for twelve winters grendels horrible raids continued and joy was changed to mourning among the spear danes  at last the rumor of grendel crossed over the sea to the land of the geats where a young hero dwelt in the house of his uncle king hygelac beowulf was his name a man of immense strength and courage and a mighty swimmer who had developed his powers fighting the nickers whales walruses and seals in the icebound northern ocean when he heard the story beowulf was stirred to go and fight the monster and free the danes who were his fathers friends  with fourteen companions he crosses the sea there is an excellent bit of ocean poetry here ll 210224 and we get a vivid idea of the hospitality of a brave people by following the poets description of beowulfs meeting with king hrothgar and queen wealhtheow and of the joy and feasting and storytelling in heorot the picture of wealhtheow passing the mead cup to the warriors with her own hand is a noble one and plainly indicates the reverence paid by these strong men to their wives and mothers night comes on the fear of grendel is again upon the danes and all withdraw after the king has warned beowulf of the frightful danger of sleeping in the hall but beowulf lies down with his warriors saying proudly that since weapons will not avail against the monster he will grapple with him bare handed and trust to a warriors strength      forth from the fens from the misty moorlands     grendel came glidinggods wrath5 he bore     came under clouds until he saw clearly     glittering with gold plates the mead hall of men     down fell the door though fastened with fire bands     open it sprang at the stroke of his paw     swollen with rage burst in the balebringer     flamed in his eyes a fierce light likest fire6  at the sight of men again sleeping in the hall grendel laughs in his heart thinking of his feast he seizes the nearest sleeper crushes his bone case with a bite tears him limb from limb and swallows him then he creeps to the couch of beowulf and stretches out a claw only to find it clutched in a grip of steel a sudden terror strikes the monsters heart he roars struggles tries to jerk his arm free but beowulf leaps to his feet and grapples his enemy bare handed to and fro they surge tables are overturned golden benches ripped from their fastenings the whole building quakes and only its iron bands keep it from falling to pieces beowulfs companions are on their feet now hacking vainly at the monster with swords and battleaxes adding their shouts to the crashing of furniture and the howling war song of grendel outside in the town the danes stand shivering at the uproar slowly the monster struggles to the door dragging beowulf whose fingers crack with the strain but who never relaxes his first grip suddenly a wide wound opens in the monsters side the sinews snap the whole arm is wrenched off at the shoulder and grendel escapes shrieking across the moor and plunges into the sea to die  beowulf first exults in his nights work then he hangs the huge arm with its terrible claws from a crossbeam over the kings seat as one would hang up a bears skin after a hunt at daylight came the danes and all day long in the intervals of singing storytelling speech making and gift giving they return to wonder at the mighty grip of grendel and to rejoice in beowulfs victory  when night falls a great feast is spread in heorot and the danes sleep once more in the great hall at midnight comes another monster a horrible halfhuman creature7 mother of grendel raging to avenge her offspring she thunders at the door the danes leap up and grasp their weapons but the monster enters seizes aeschere who is friend and adviser of the king and rushes away with him over the fens  the old scenes of sorrow are reviewed in the morning but beowulf says simply      sorrow not wise man it is better for each     that his friend he avenge than that he mourn much     each of us shall the end await     of worldly life let him who may gain     honor ere death that is for a warrior     when he is dead afterwards best     arise kingdoms guardian let us quickly go     to view the track of grendels kinsman     i promise it thee he will not escape     nor in earths bosom nor in mountainwood     nor in oceans depths go where he will8  then he girds himself for the new fight and follows the track of the second enemy across the fens here is hrothgars description of the place where live the monsters spirits of elsewhere as he calls them                      they inhabit     the dim land that gives shelter to the wolf     the windy headlands perilous fen paths     where under mountain mist the stream flows down     and floods the ground not far hence but a mile     the mere stands over which hang deathchill groves     a wood fastrooted overshades the flood     there every night a ghastly miracle     is seen fire in the water no man knows     not the most wise the bottom of that mere     the firmhorned heathstalker the hart when pressed     wearied by hounds and hunted from afar     will rather die of thirst upon its bank     than bend his head to it it is unholy     dark to the clouds its yeasty waves mount up     when wind stirs hateful tempest till the air     grows dreary and the heavens pour down tears9  beowulf plunges into the horrible place while his companions wait for him oh the shore for a long time he sinks through the flood then as he reaches bottom grendels mother rushes out upon him and drags him into a cave where sea monsters swarm at him from behind and gnash his armor with their tusks the edge of his sword is turned with the mighty blow he deals the merewif but it harms not the monster casting the weapon aside he grips her and tries to hurl her down while her claws and teeth clash upon his corslet but cannot penetrate the steel rings she throws her bulk upon him crushes him down draws a short sword and plunges it at him but again his splendid byrnie saves him he is wearied now and oppressed suddenly as his eye sweeps the cave he catches sight of a magic sword made by the giants long ago too heavy for warriors to wield struggling up he seizes the weapon whirls it and brings down a crashing blow upon the monsters neck it smashes through the ring bones the merewif falls and the fight is won  the cave is full of treasures but beowulf heeds them not for near him lies grendel dead from the wound received the previous night again beowulf swings the great sword and strikes off his enemys head and lo as the venomous blood touches the sword blade the steel melts like ice before the fire and only the hilt is left in beowulfs hand taking the hilt and the head the hero enters the ocean and mounts up to the shore  only his own faithful band were waiting there for the danes seeing the ocean bubble with fresh blood thought it was all over with the hero and had gone home and there they were mourning in heorot when beowulf returned with the monstrous head of grendel carried on a spear shaft by four of his stoutest followers  in the last part of the poem there is another great fight beowulf is now an old man he has reigned for fifty years beloved by all his people he has overcome every enemy but one a fire dragon keeping watch over an enormous treasure hidden among the mountains one day a wanderer stumbles upon the enchanted cave and entering takes a jeweled cup while the firedrake sleeps heavily that same night the dragon in a frightful rage belching forth fire and smoke rushes down upon the nearest villages leaving a trail of death and terror behind him  again beowulf goes forth to champion his people as he approaches the dragons cave he has a presentiment that death lurks within      sat on the headland there the warrior king     farewell he said to hearthcompanions true     the goldfriend of the geats his mind was sad     deathready restless and wyrd was drawing nigh     who now must meet and touch the aged man     to seek the treasure that his soul had saved     and separate his body from his life10  there is a flash of illumination like that which comes to a dying man in which his mind runs back over his long life and sees something of profound meaning in the elemental sorrow moving side by side with magnificent courage then follows the fight with the firedrake in which beowulf wrapped in fire and smoke is helped by the heroism of wiglaf one of his companions the dragon is slain but the fire has entered beowulfs lungs and he knows that wyrd is at hand this is his thought while wiglaf removes his battered armor      one deep regret i have that to a son     i may not give the armor i have worn     to bear it after me for fifty years     i ruled these people well and not a king     of those who dwell around me dared oppress     or meet me with his hosts at home i waited     for the time that wyrd controls mine own i kept     nor quarrels sought nor ever falsely swore     now wounded sore i wait for joy to come11  he sends wiglaf into the firedrakes cave who finds it filled with rare treasures and most wonderful of all a golden banner from which light proceeds and illumines all the darkness but wiglaf cares little for the treasures his mind is full of his dying chief he fills his hands with costly ornaments and hurries to throw them at his heros feet the old man looks with sorrow at the gold thanks the lord of all that by death he has gained more riches for his people and tells his faithful thane how his body shall be burned on the whale ness or headland      my life is well paid for this hoard and now     care for the peoples needs i may no more     be with them bid the warriors raise a barrow     after the burning on the ness by the sea     on hronesness which shall rise high and be     for a remembrance to my people seafarers     who from afar over the mists of waters     drive foamy keels may call it beowulfs mount     hereafter then the hero from his neck     put off a golden collar to his thane     to the young warrior gave it with his helm     armlet and corslet bade him use them well     thou art the last waegmunding of our race     for fate has swept my kinsmen all away     earls in their strength are to their maker gone     and i must follow them12  beowulf was still living when wiglaf sent a messenger hurriedly to his people when they came they found him dead and the huge dragon dead on the sand beside him      then the goths people reared a mighty pile     with shields and armour hung as he had asked     and in the midst the warriors laid their lord     lamenting then the warriors on the mount     kindled a mighty bale fire the smoke rose     black from the swedish pine the sound of flame     mingled with sound of weeping  while smoke     spread over heaven then upon the hill     the people of the weders wrought a mound     high broad and to be seen far out at sea     in ten days they had built and walled it in     as the wise thought most worthy placed in it     rings jewels other treasures from the hoard     they left the riches golden joy of earls     in dust for earth to hold where yet it lies     useless as ever then about the mound     the warriors rode and raised a mournful song     for their dead king exalted his brave deeds     holding it fit men honour their liege lord     praise him and love him when his soul is fled     thus the geats people sharers of his hearth     mourned their chiefs fall praised him of kings of men     the mildest and the kindest and to all     his people gentlest yearning for their praise13  one is tempted to linger over the details of the magnificent ending the unselfish heroism of beowulf the great prototype of king alfred the generous grief of his people ignoring gold and jewels in the thought of the greater treasure they had lost the memorial mound on the low cliff which would cause every returning mariner to steer a straight course to harbor in the remembrance of his dead hero and the pure poetry which marks every noble line but the epic is great enough and simple enough to speak for itself search the literatures of the world and you will find no other such picture of a brave mans death  concerning the history of beowulf a whole library has been written and scholars still differ too radically for us to express a positive judgment this much however is clearthat there existed at the time the poem was composed various northern legends of beowa a halfdivine hero and the monster grendel the latter has been interpreted in various wayssometimes as a bear and again as the malaria of the marsh lands for those interested in symbols the simplest interpretation of these myths is to regard beowulfs successive fights with the three dragons as the overcoming first of the overwhelming danger of the sea which was beaten back by the dykes second the conquering of the sea itself when men learned to sail upon it and third the conflict with the hostile forces of nature which are overcome at last by mans indomitable will and perseverance  all this is purely mythical but there are historical incidents to reckon with about the year 520 a certain northern chief called by the chronicler chochilaicus who is generally identified with the hygelac of the epic led a huge plundering expedition up the rhine after a succession of battles he was overcome by the franks butand now we enter a legendary region once morenot until a gigantic nephew of hygelac had performed heroic feats of valor and had saved the remnants of the host by a marvelous feat of swimming the majority of scholars now hold that these historical events and personages were celebrated in the epic but some still assert that the events which gave a foundation for beowulf occurred wholly on english soil where the poem itself was undoubtedly written  the rhythm of beowulf and indeed of all our earliest poetry depended upon accent and alliteration that is the beginning of two or more words in the same line with the same sound or letter the lines were made up of two short halves separated by a pause no rime was used but a musical effect was produced by giving each half line two strongly accented syllables each full line therefore had four accents three of which ie two in the first half and one in the second usually began with the same sound or letter the musical effect was heightened by the harp with which the gleeman accompanied his singing the poetical form will be seen clearly in the following selection from the wonderfully realistic description of the fens haunted by grendel it will need only one or two readings aloud to show that many of these strangelooking words are practically the same as those we still use though many of the vowel sounds were pronounced differently by our ancestors                                 hie dygel lond     warigeath wulfhleothu

wanderer is in part at least probably the oldest in our language the author and the date of its composition are unknown but the personal account of the minstrels life belongs to the time before the saxons first came to england14 it expresses the wandering life of the gleeman who goes forth into the world to abide here or there according as he is rewarded for his singing from the numerous references to rings and rewards and from the praise given to generous givers it would seem that literature as a paying profession began very early in our history and also that the pay was barely sufficient to hold soul and body together of all our modern poets goldsmith wandering over europe paying for his lodging with his songs is most suggestive of this first recorded singer of our race his last lines read      thus wandering they who shape songs for men     pass over many lands and tell their need     and speak their thanks and ever south or north     meet someone skilled in songs and free in gifts     who would be raised among his friends to fame     and do brave deeds till light and life are gone     he who has thus wrought himself praise shall have     a settled glory underneath the stars15  deors lament in deor we have another picture of the saxon scop or minstrel not in glad wandering but in manly sorrow it seems that the scops living depended entirely upon his power to please his chief and that at any time he might be supplanted by a better poet deor had this experience and comforts himself in a grim way by recalling various examples of men who have suffered more than himself the poem is arranged in strophes each one telling of some afflicted hero and ending with the same refrain his sorrow passed away so will mine deor is much more poetic than widsith and is

wonderful poem of the seafarer seems to be in two distinct parts the first shows the hardships of ocean life but stronger than hardships is the subtle call of the sea the second part is an allegory in which the troubles of the seaman are symbols of the troubles of this life and the call of the ocean is the call in the soul to be up and away to its true home with god whether the last was added by some monk who saw the allegorical possibilities of the first part or whether some sealoving christian scop wrote both is uncertain following are a few selected lines to show the spirit of the poem      the hail flew in showers about me and there i heard only     the roar of the sea icecold waves and the song of the swan     for pastime the gannets cry served me the kittiwakes chatter     for laughter of men and for mead drink the call of the sea mews     when storms on the rocky cliffs beat then the terns icyfeathered     made answer full oft the sea eagle forebodingly screamed     the

of my heart now are throbbing     to test the high streams the salt waves in tumultuous play     desire in my heart ever urges my spirit to wander     to seek out the home of the stranger in lands afar off       there is no one that dwells upon earth so exalted in mind     but that he has always a longing a seafaring passion     for what the lord god shall bestow be it honor or death     no heart for the harp has he nor for acceptance of treasure     no pleasure has he in a wife no delight in the world     nor in aught save the roll of the billows but always a longing     a yearning uneasiness hastens him on to the sea       the woodlands are captured by blossoms the hamlets grow fair     broad meadows are beautiful earth again bursts into life     and all stir the heart of the wanderer eager to journey     so he meditates going afar on the pathway of tides     the cuckoo moreover gives warning with sorrowful note     summers harbinger sings and forebodes to the heart bitter sorrow       now my spirit uneasily turns in the hearts narrow chamber     now wanders forth over the tide oer the home of the whale     to the ends of the earthand comes back to me       eager and

deserve mention the fight at finnsburgh is a fragment of fifty lines discovered on the inside of a piece of parchment drawn over the wooden covers of a book of homilies it is a magnificent war song describing with homeric power the defense of a hall by hnæf19 with sixty warriors against the attack of finn and his army at midnight when hnæf and his men are sleeping they are surrounded by an army rushing in with fire and sword hnæf springs to his feet at the first alarm and wakens his warriors with a call to action that rings like a bugle blast      this no eastward dawning is nor is here a dragon flying     nor of this high hall are the horns a burning     but they rush upon us herenow the ravens sing     growling is the gray wolf grim the warwood rattles     shield to shaft is answering20  the fight lasts five days but the fragment ends before we learn the outcome the same fight is celebrated by hrothgars gleeman at the feast in heorot after the slaying of grendel  waldere is a fragment of two leaves from which we get only a glimpse of the story of waldere walter of aquitaine and his betrothed bride hildgund who were hostages at the court of attila they escaped with a great treasure and in crossing the mountains were attacked by gunther and his warriors among whom was walters former comrade hagen walter fights them all and escapes the same story was written in latin in the tenth century and is also part of the old german nibelungenlied though the saga did not originate with the anglosaxons their version of it is the oldest that has come down to us the chief significance of these waldere fragments lies in the evidence they afford that our ancestors were familiar with the legends and poetry of other germanic peoples   ii anglosaxon life  we have now read some of our earliest records and have been surprised perhaps that men who are generally described in the histories as savage fighters and freebooters could produce such excellent poetry it is the object of the study of all literature to make us better acquainted with mennot simply with their deeds which is the function of history but with the dreams and ideals which underlie all their actions so a reading of this early anglosaxon poetry not only makes us acquainted but also leads to a profound respect for the men who were our ancestors before we study more of their literature it is well to glance briefly at their life and language  the name originally the name anglosaxon denotes two of the three germanic tribesjutes angles and saxonswho in the middle of the fifth century left their homes on the shores of the north sea and the baltic to conquer and colonize distant britain angeln was the home of one tribe and the name still clings to the spot whence some of our forefathers sailed on their momentous voyage the old saxon word angul or ongul means a hook and the english verb angle is used invariably by walton and older writers in the sense of fishing we may still think therefore of the first angles as hookmen possibly because of their fishing more probably because the shore where they lived at the foot of the peninsula of jutland was bent in the shape of a fishhook the name saxon from seax sax a short sword means the swordman and from the name we may judge something of the temper of the hardy fighters who preceded the angles into britain the angles were the most numerous of the conquering tribes and from them the new home was called anglalond by gradual changes this became first englelond and then england  more than five hundred years after the landing of these tribes and while they called themselves englishmen we find the latin writers of the middle ages speaking of the inhabitants of britain as anglisaxonesthat is saxons of englandto distinguish them from the saxons of the continent in the latin charters of king alfred the same name appears but it is never seen or heard in his native speech there he always speaks of his beloved englelond and of his brave englisc people in the sixteenth century when the old name of englishmen clung to the new people resulting from the union of saxon and norman the name anglosaxon was first used in the national sense by the scholar camden21 in his history of britain and since then it has been in general use among english writers in recent years the name has gained a wider significance until it is now used to denote a spirit rather than a nation the brave vigorous enlarging spirit that characterizes the englishspeaking races everywhere and that has already put a broad belt of english law and english liberty around the whole world  the life if the literature of a people springs directly out of its life then the stern barbarous life of our saxon forefathers would seem at first glance to promise little of good literature outwardly their life was a constant hardship a perpetual struggle against savage nature and savage men behind them were gloomy forests inhabited by wild beasts and still wilder men and peopled in their imagination with dragons and evil shapes in front of them thundering at the very dikes for entrance was the treacherous north sea with its fogs and storms and ice but with that indefinable call of the deep that all men hear who live long beneath its influence here they lived a big blond powerful race and hunted and fought and sailed and drank and feasted when their labor was done almost the first thing we notice about these big fearless childish men is that they love the sea and because they love it they hear and answer its call       no delight has he in the world     nor in aught save the roll of the billows but always a longing     a yearning uneasiness hastens him on to the sea22  as might be expected this love of the ocean finds expression in all their poetry in beowulf alone there are fifteen names for the sea from the holm that is the horizon sea the upmounding to the brim which is the ocean flinging its welter of sand and creamy foam upon the beach at your feet and the figures used to describe or glorify itthe swan road the whale path the heaving battle plainare almost as numerous in all their poetry there is a magnificent sense of lordship over the wild sea even in its hour of tempest and fury      often it befalls us on the oceans highways     in the boats our boatmen when the storm is roaring     leap the billows over on our stallions of the foam23  the inner life a mans life is more than his work his dream is ever greater than his achievement and literature reflects not so much mans deed as the spirit which animates him not the poor thing that he does but rather the splendid thing that he ever hopes to do in no place is this more evident than in the age we are now studying those early sea kings were a marvelous mixture of savagery and sentiment of rough living and of deep feeling of splendid courage and the deep melancholy of men who know their limitations and have faced the unanswered problem of death they were not simply fearless freebooters who harried every coast in their war galleys if that were all they would have no more history or literature than the barbary pirates of whom the same thing could be said these strong fathers of ours were men of profound emotions in all their fighting the love of an untarnished glory was uppermost and under the warriors savage exterior was hidden a great love of home and homely virtues and a reverence for the one woman to whom he would presently return in triumph so when the wolf hunt was over or the desperate fight was won these mighty men would gather in the banquet hall and lay their weapons aside where the open fire would flash upon them and there listen to the songs of scop and gleemanmen who could put into adequate words the emotions and aspirations that all men feel but that only a few can ever express      music and song where the heroes sat     the gleewood rang a song uprose     when hrothgars scop gave the hall good cheer24  it is this great and hidden life of the anglosaxons that finds expression in all their literature briefly it is summed up in five great principlestheir love of personal freedom their responsiveness to nature their religion their reverence for womanhood and their struggle for glory as a ruling motive in every noble life  in reading anglosaxon poetry it is well to remember these five principles for they are like the little springs at the head of a great riverclear pure springs of poetry and out of them the best of our literature has always flowed thus when we read      blast of the tempestit aids our oars     rolling of thunderit hurts us not     rush of the hurricanebending its neck     to speed us whither our wills are bent  we realize that these sea rovers had the spirit of kinship with the mighty life of nature and kinship with nature invariably expresses itself in poetry again when we read      now hath the man     oercome his troubles no pleasure does he lack     nor steeds nor jewels nor the joys of mead     nor any treasure that the earth can give     o royal woman if he have but thee25  we know we are dealing with an essentially noble man not a savage we are face to face with that profound reverence for womanhood which inspires the greater part of all good poetry and we begin to honor as well as understand our ancestors so in the matter of glory or honor it was apparently not the love of fighting but rather the love of honor resulting from fighting well which animated our forefathers in every campaign he was a man deserving of remembrance was the highest thing that could be said of a dead warrior and he is a man deserving of praise was the highest tribute to the living the whole secret of beowulfs mighty life is summed up in the last line ever yearning for his peoples praise so every tribe had its scop or poet more important than any warrior who put the deeds of its heroes into the expressive words that constitute literature and every banquet hall had its gleeman who sang the scops poetry in order that the deed and the man might be remembered oriental peoples built monuments to perpetuate the memory of their dead but our ancestors made poems which should live and stir mens souls long after monuments of brick and stone had crumbled away it is to this intense love of glory and the desire to be remembered that we are indebted for anglosaxon literature  our first speech our first recorded speech begins with the songs of widsith and deor which the anglosaxons may have brought with them when they first conquered britain at first glance these songs in their native dress look strange as a foreign tongue but when we examine them carefully we find many words that have been familiar since childhood we have seen this in beowulf but in prose the resemblance of this old speech to our own is even more striking here for instance is a fragment of the simple story of the conquest of britain by our anglosaxon ancestors  her hengest and Æsc his sunu gefuhton with bryttas on thaere stowe the is gecweden creccanford and thær ofslogon feower thusenda wera and tha bryttas tha forleton centlond and mid myclum ege flugon to lundenbyrig at this time hengest and aesc his son fought against the britons at the place which is called crayford and there slew four thousand men and then the britons forsook kentland and with much fear fled to london town26  the reader who utters these words aloud a few times will speedily recognize his own tongue not simply in the words but also in the whole structure of the sentences  from such records we see that our speech is teutonic in its origin and when we examine any teutonic language we learn that it is only a branch of the great aryan or indoeuropean family of languages in life and language therefore we are related first to the teutonic races and through them to all the nations of this indoeuropean family which starting with enormous vigor from their original home probably in central europe27 spread southward and westward driving out the native tribes and slowly developing the mighty civilizations of india persia greece rome and the wilder but more vigorous life of the celts and teutons in all these languagessanskrit iranian greek latin celtic teutonicwe recognize the same root words for father and mother for god and man for the common needs and the common relations of life and since words are windows through which we see the soul of this old people we find certain ideals of love home faith heroism liberty which seem to have been the very life of our forefathers and which were inherited by them from their old heroic and conquering ancestors it was on the borders of the north sea that our fathers halted for unnumbered centuries on their westward journey and slowly developed the national life and language which we now call anglo saxon  it is this old vigorous anglosaxon language which forms the basis of our modern english if we read a paragraph from any good english book and then analyze it as we would a flower to see what it contains we find two distinct classes of words the first class containing simple words expressing the common things of life makes up the strong framework of our language these words are like the stem and bare branches of a mighty oak and if we look them up in the dictionary we find that almost invariably they come to us from our anglosaxon ancestors the second and larger class of words is made up of those that give grace variety ornament to our speech they are like the leaves and blossoms of the same tree and when we examine their history we find that they come to us from the celts romans normans and other peoples with whom we have been in contact in the long years of our development the most prominent characteristic of our present language therefore is its dual character its best qualitiesstrength simplicity directnesscome from anglosaxon sources its enormous added wealth of expression its comprehensiveness its plastic adaptability to new conditions and ideas are largely the result of additions from other languages and especially of its gradual absorption of the french language after the norman conquest it is this dual character this combination of native and foreign of innate and exotic elements which accounts for the wealth of our english language and literature to see it in concrete form we should read in succession beowulf and paradise lost the two great epics which show the root and the flower of our literary development   iii christian writers of the anglosaxon period  the literature of this period falls naturally into two divisionspagan and christian the former represents the poetry which the anglosaxons probably brought with them in the form of oral sagasthe crude material out of which literature was slowly developed on english soil the latter represents the writings developed under teaching of the monks after the old pagan religion had vanished but while it still retained its hold on the life and language of the people in reading our earliest poetry it is well to remember that all of it was copied by the monks and seems to have been more or less altered to give it a religious coloring  the coming of christianity meant not simply a new life and leader for england it meant also the wealth of a new language the scop is now replaced by the literary monk and that monk though he lives among common people and speaks with the english tongue has behind him all the culture and literary resources of the latin language the effect is seen instantly in our early prose and poetry  northumbrian literature in general two great schools of christian influence came into england and speedily put an end to the frightful wars that had waged continually among the various petty kingdoms of the anglosaxons the first of these under the leadership of augustine came from rome it spread in the south and center of england especially in the kingdom of essex it founded schools and partially educated the rough people but it produced no lasting literature the other under the leadership of the saintly aidan came from ireland which country had been for centuries a center of religion and education for all western europe the monks of this school labored chiefly in northumbria and to their influence we owe all that is best in anglosaxon literature it is called the northumbrian school its center was the monasteries and abbeys such as jarrow and whitby and its three greatest names are bede cædmon and cynewulf   bede 673735  the venerable bede as he is generally called our first great scholar and the father of our english learning wrote almost exclusively in latin his last work the translation of the gospel of john into anglosaxon having been unfortunately lost much to our regret therefore his books and the story of his gentle heroic life must be excluded from this history of our literature his works over forty in number covered the whole field of human knowledge in his day and were so admirably written that they were widely copied as textbooks or rather manuscripts in nearly all the monastery schools of europe  the work most important to us is the ecclesiastical history of the english people it is a fascinating history to read even now with its curious combination of accurate scholarship and immense credulity in all strictly historical matters bede is a model every known authority on the subject from pliny to gildas was carefully considered every learned pilgrim to rome was commissioned by bede to ransack the archives and to make copies of papal decrees and royal letters and to these were added the testimony of abbots who could speak from personal knowledge of events or repeat the traditions of their several monasteries  side by side with this historical exactness are marvelous stories of saints and missionaries it was an age of credulity and miracles were in mens minds continually the men of whom he wrote lived lives more wonderful than any romance and their courage and gentleness made a tremendous impression on the rough warlike people to whom they came with open hands and hearts it is the natural way of all primitive peoples to magnify the works of their heroes and so deeds of heroism and kindness which were part of the daily life of the irish missionaries were soon transformed into the miracles of the saints bede believed these things as all other men did and records them with charming simplicity just as he received them from bishop or abbot notwithstanding its errors we owe to this work nearly all our knowledge of the eight centuries of our history following the landing of cæsar in britain  cÆdmon seventh century      now must we hymn the master of heaven     the might of the maker the deeds of the father     the thought of his heart he lord everlasting     established of old the source of all wonders     creator allholy he hung the bright heaven     a roof high upreared oer the children of men     the king of mankind then created for mortals     the world in its beauty the earth spread beneath them     he lord everlasting omnipotent god28  if beowulf and the fragments of our earliest poetry were brought into england then the hymn given above is the first verse of all native english song that has come down to us and cædmon is the first poet to whom we can give a definite name and date the words were written about 665 ad and are found copied at the end of a manuscript of bedes ecclesiastical history  life of cædmon what little we know of cædmon the anglosaxon milton as he is properly called is taken from bedes account29 of the abbess hilda and of her monastery at whitby here is a free and condensed translation of bedes story  there was in the monastery of the abbess hilda a brother distinguished by the grace of god for that he could make poems treating of goodness and religion whatever was translated to him for he could not read of sacred scripture he shortly reproduced in poetic form of great sweetness and beauty none of all the english poets could equal him for he learned not the art of song from men nor sang by the arts of men rather did he receive all his poetry as a free gift from god and for this reason he did never compose poetry of a vain or worldly kind  until of mature age he lived as a layman and had never learned any poetry indeed so ignorant of singing was he that sometimes at a feast where it was the custom that for the pleasure of all each guest should sing in turn he would rise from the table when he saw the harp coming to him and go home ashamed now it happened once that he did this thing at a certain festivity and went out to the stall to care for the horses this duty being assigned to him for that night as he slept at the usual time one stood by him saying cædmon sing me something i cannot sing he answered and that is why i came hither from the feast but he who spake unto him said again cædmon sing to me and he said what shall i sing and he said sing the beginning of created things thereupon cædmon began to sing verses that he had never heard before of this import now should we praise the power and wisdom of the creator the works of the father this is the sense but not the form of the hymn that he sang while sleeping  when he awakened cædmon remembered the words of the hymn and added to them many more in the morning he went to the steward of the monastery lands and showed him the gift he had received in sleep the steward brought him to hilda who made him repeat to the monks the hymn he had composed and all agreed that the grace of god was upon cædmon to test him they expounded to him a bit of scripture from the latin and bade him if he could to turn it into poetry he went away humbly and returned in the morning with an excellent poem thereupon hilda received him and his family into the monastery made him one of the brethren and commanded that the whole course of bible history be expounded to him he in turn reflecting upon what he had heard transformed it into most delightful poetry and by echoing it back to the monks in more melodious sounds made his teachers his listeners in all this his aim was to turn men from wickedness and to help them to the love and practice of well doing  then follows a brief record of cædmons life and an exquisite picture of his death amidst the brethren and so it came to pass says the simple record that as he served god while living in purity of mind and serenity of spirit so by a peaceful death he left the world and went to look upon his face  cædmons works the greatest work attributed to cædmon is the socalled paraphrase it is the story of genesis exodus and a part of daniel told in glowing poetic language with a power of insight and imagination which often raises it from paraphrase into the realm of true poetry though we have bedes assurance that cædmon transformed the whole course of bible history into most delightful poetry no work known certainly to have been composed by him has come down to us in the seventeenth century this anglosaxon paraphrase was discovered and attributed to cædmon and his name is still associated with it though it is now almost certain that the paraphrase is the work of more than one writer  aside from the doubtful question of authorship even a casual reading of the poem brings us into the presence of a poet rude indeed but with a genius strongly suggestive at times of the matchless milton the book opens with a hymn of praise and then tells of the fall of satan and his rebel angels from heaven which is familiar to us in miltons paradise lost then follows the creation of the world and the paraphrase begins to thrill with the old anglosaxon love of nature      here first the eternal father guard of all     of heaven and earth raisèd up the firmament     the almighty lord set firm by his strong power     this roomy land grass greened not yet the plain     ocean far spread hid the wan ways in gloom     then was the spirit gloriously bright     of heavens keeper borne over the deep     swiftly the lifegiver the angels lord     over the ample ground bade come forth light     quickly the high kings bidding was obeyed     over the waste there shone lights holy ray     then parted he lord of triumphant might     shadow from shining darkness from the light     light by the word of god was first named day30  after recounting the story of paradise the fall and the deluge the paraphrase is continued in the exodus of which the poet makes a noble epic rushing on with the sweep of a saxon army to battle a single selection is given here to show how the poet adapted the story to his hearers                          then they saw     forth and forward faring pharaohs war array     gliding on a grove of spearsglittering the hosts     fluttered there the banners there the folk the march trod     onwards surged the war strode the spears along     blickered the broad shields blew aloud the trumpets     wheeling round in gyres yelled the fowls of war     of the battle greedy hoarsely barked the raven     dew upon his feathers oer the fallen corpses     swart that chooser of the slain sang aloud the wolves     at eve their horrid song hoping for the carrion31  besides the paraphrase we have a few fragments of the same general character which are attributed to the school of cædmon the longest of these is judith in which the story of an apocryphal book of the old testament is done into vigorous poetry holofernes is represented as a savage and cruel viking reveling in his mead hall and when the heroic judith cuts off his head with his own sword and throws it down before the warriors of her people rousing them to battle and victory we reach perhaps the most dramatic and brilliant point of anglosaxon literature   cynewulf eighth century  of cynewulf greatest of the anglosaxon poets excepting only the unknown author of beowulf we know very little indeed it was not till 1840 more than a thousand years after his death that even his name became known though he is the only one of our early poets who signed his works the name was never plainly written but woven into the verses in the form of secret runes32 suggesting a modern charade but more difficult of interpretation until one has found the key to the poets signature  works of cynewulf the only signed poems of cynewulf are the christ juliana the fates of the apostles and elene unsigned poems attributed to him or his school are andreas the phoenix the dream of the rood the descent into hell guthlac the wanderer and some of the riddles the last are simply literary conundrums in which some wellknown object like the bow or drinking horn is described in poetic language and the hearer must guess the name some of them like the swan33 and the storm spirit are unusually beautiful  of all these works the most characteristic is undoubtedly the christ a didactic poem in three parts the first celebrating the nativity the second the ascension and the third doomsday telling the torments of the wicked and the unending joy of the redeemed cynewulf takes his subjectmatter partly from the church liturgy but more largely from the homilies of gregory the great the whole is well woven together and contains some hymns of great beauty and many passages of intense dramatic force throughout the poem a deep love for christ and a reverence for the virgin mary are manifest more than any other poem in any language the christ reflects the spirit of early latin christianity  here is a fragment comparing life to a sea voyagea comparison which occurs sooner or later to every thoughtful person and which finds perfect expression in tennysons crossing the bar      now tis most like as if we fare in ships     on the ocean flood over the water cold     driving our vessels through the spacious seas     with horses of the deep a perilous way is this     of boundless waves and there are stormy seas     on which we toss here in this reeling world     oer the deep paths ours was a sorry plight     until at last we sailed unto the land     over the troubled main help came to us     that brought us to the haven of salvation     gods spiritson and granted grace to us     that we might know een from the vessels deck     where we must bind with anchorage secure     our ocean steeds old stallions of the waves  in the two epic poems of andreas and elene cynewulf if he be the author reaches the very summit of his poetical art andreas an unsigned poem records the story of st andrew who crosses the sea to rescue his comrade st matthew from the cannibals a young shipmaster who sails the boat turns out to be christ in disguise matthew is set free and the savages are converted by a miracle34 it is a spirited poem full of rush and incident and the descriptions of the sea are the best in anglosaxon poetry  elene has for its subjectmatter the finding of the true cross it tells of constantines vision of the rood on the eve of battle after his victory under the new emblem he sends his mother helena elene to jerusalem in search of the original cross and the nails the poem which is of very uneven quality might properly be put at the end of cynewulfs works he adds to the poem a personal note signing his name in runes and if we accept the wonderful vision of the rood as cynewulfs work we learn how he found the cross at last in his own heart there is a suggestion here of the future sir launfal and the search for the holy grail  decline of northumbrian literature the same northern energy which had built up learning and literature so rapidly in northumbria was instrumental in pulling it down again toward the end of the century in which cynewulf lived the danes swept down on the english coasts and overwhelmed northumbria monasteries and schools were destroyed scholars and teachers alike were put to the sword and libraries that had been gathered leaf by leaf with the toil of centuries were scattered to the four winds so all true northumbrian literature perished with the exception of a few fragments and that which we now possess35 is largely a translation in the dialect of the west saxons this translation was made by alfreds scholars after he had driven back the danes in an effort to preserve the ideals and the civilization that had been so hardly won with the conquest of northumbria ends the poetic period of anglosaxon literature with alfred the great of wessex our prose literature makes a beginning   alfred 848901      every craft and every power soon grows     old and is passed over and forgotten if it     be without wisdom this is now to be     said that whilst i live i wish to live nobly     and after life to leave to the men who come     after me a memory of good works36  so wrote the great alfred looking back over his heroic life that he lived nobly none can doubt who reads the history of the greatest of anglosaxon kings and his good works include among others the education of half a country the salvage of a noble native literature and the creation of the first english prose  life and times of alfred for the history of alfreds times and details of the terrific struggle with the northmen the reader must be referred to the histories the struggle ended with the treaty of wedmore in 878 with the establishment of alfred not only as king of wessex but as overlord of the whole northern country then the hero laid down his sword and set himself as a little child to learn to read and write latin so that he might lead his people in peace as he had led them in war it is then that alfred began to be the heroic figure in literature that he had formerly been in the wars against the northmen  with the same patience and heroism that had marked the long struggle for freedom alfred set himself to the task of educating his people first he gave them laws beginning with the ten commandments and ending with the golden rule and then established courts where laws could be faithfully administered safe from the danes by land he created a navy almost the first of the english fleets to drive them from the coast then with peace and justice established within his borders he sent to europe for scholars and teachers and set them over schools that he established hitherto all education had been in latin now he set himself the task first of teaching every freeborn englishman to read and write his own language and second of translating into english the best books for their instruction every poor scholar was honored at his court and was speedily set to work at teaching or translating every wanderer bringing a book or a leaf of manuscript from the pillaged monasteries of northumbria was sure of his reward in this way the few fragments of native northumbrian literature which we have been studying were saved to the world alfred and his scholars treasured the rare fragments and copied them in the westsaxon dialect with the exception of cædmons hymn we have hardly a single leaf from the great literature of northumbria in the dialect in which it was first written  works of alfred aside from his educational work alfred is known chiefly as a translator after fighting his countrys battles and at a time when most men were content with military honor he began to learn latin that he might translate the works that would be most helpful to his people his important translations are four in number orosiuss universal history and geography the leading work in general history for several centuries bedes history37 the first great historical work written on english soil pope gregorys shepherds book intended especially for the clergy and boethiuss consolations of philosophy the favorite philosophical work of the middle ages  more important than any translation is the english or saxon chronicle this was probably at first a dry record especially of important births and deaths in the westsaxon kingdom alfred enlarged this scant record beginning the story with cæsars conquest when it touches his own reign the dry chronicle becomes an interesting and connected story the oldest history belonging to any modern nation in its own language the record of alfreds reign probably by himself is a splendid bit of writing and shows clearly his claim to a place in literature as well as in history the chronicle was continued after alfreds death and is the best monument of early english prose that is left to us here and there stirring songs are included in the narrative like the battle of brunanburh and the battle of maldon38 the last entered 991 seventyfive years before the norman conquest is the swan song of anglosaxon poetry the chronicle was continued for a century after the norman conquest and is extremely valuable not only as a record of events but as a literary monument showing the development of our language  close of the anglosaxon period after alfreds death there is little to record except the loss of the two supreme objects of his heroic struggle namely a national life and a national literature it was at once the strength and the weakness of the saxon that he lived apart as a free man and never joined efforts willingly with any large body of his fellows the tribe was his largest idea of nationality and with all our admiration we must confess as we first meet him that he has not enough sense of unity to make a great nation nor enough culture to produce a great literature a few noble political ideals repeated in a score of petty kingdoms and a few literary ideals copied but never increasedthat is the summary of his literary history for a full century after alfred literature was practically at a standstill having produced the best of which it was capable and england waited for the national impulse and for the culture necessary for a new and greater art both of these came speedily by way of the sea in the norman conquest  summary of anglosaxon period our literature begins with songs and stories of a time when our teutonic ancestors were living on the borders of the north sea three tribes of these ancestors the jutes angles and saxons conquered britain in the latter half of the fifth century and laid the foundation of the english nation the first landing was probably by a tribe of jutes under chiefs called by the chronicle hengist and horsa the date is doubtful but the year 449 is accepted by most historians  these old ancestors were hardy warriors and sea rovers yet were capable of profound and noble emotions their poetry reflects this double nature its subjects were chiefly the sea and the plunging boats battles adventure brave deeds the glory of warriors and the love of home accent alliteration and an abrupt break in the middle of each line gave their poetry a kind of martial rhythm in general the poetry is earnest and somber and pervaded by fatalism and religious feeling a careful reading of the few remaining fragments of anglosaxon literature reveals five striking characteristics the love of freedom responsiveness to nature especially in her sterner moods strong religious convictions and a belief in wyrd or fate reverence for womanhood and a devotion to glory as the ruling motive in every warriors life  in our study we have noted 1 the great epic or heroic poem beowulf and a few fragments of our first poetry such as widsith deors lament and the seafarer 2 characteristics of anglosaxon life the form of our first speech 3 the northumbrian school of writers bede our first historian belongs to this school but all his extant works are in latin the two great poets are cædmon and cynewulf northumbrian literature flourished between 650 and 850 in the year 867 northumbria was conquered by the danes who destroyed the monasteries and the libraries containing our earliest literature 4 the beginnings of english prose writing under alfred 848901 our most important prose work of this age is the anglosaxon chronicle which was revised and enlarged by alfred and which was continued for more than two centuries it is the oldest historical record known to any european nation in its own tongue  selections for reading

normans the name norman which is a softened form of northman tells its own story the men who bore the name came originally from scandinaviabands of big blond fearless men cruising after plunder and adventure in their viking ships and bringing terror wherever they appeared it was these same children of woden who under the danes raven flag had blotted out northumbrian civilization in the ninth century later the same race of men came plundering along the french coast and conquered the whole northern country but here the results were altogether different instead of blotting out a superior civilization as the danes had done they promptly abandoned their own their name of normandy still clings to the new home but all else that was norse disappeared as the conquerors intermarried with the native franks and accepted french ideals and spoke the french language so rapidly did they adopt and improve the roman civilization of the natives that from a rude tribe of heathen vikings they had developed within a single century into the most polished and intellectual people in all europe the union of norse and french ie romangallic blood had here produced a race having the best qualities of boththe will power and energy of the one the eager curiosity and vivid imagination of the other when these normanfrench people appeared in anglosaxon england they brought with them three noteworthy things a lively celtic disposition a vigorous and progressive latin civilization and a romance language42 we are to think of the conquerors therefore as they thought and spoke of themselves in the domesday book and all their contemporary literature not as normans but as franci that is frenchmen  the conquest at the battle of hastings 1066 the power of harold last of the saxon kings was broken and william duke of normandy became master of england of the completion of that stupendous conquest which began at hastings and which changed the civilization of a whole nation this is not the place to speak we simply point out three great results of the conquest which have a direct bearing on our literature first notwithstanding cæsars legions and augustines monks the normans were the first to bring the culture and the practical ideals of roman civilization home to the english people and this at a critical time when england had produced her best and her own literature and civilization had already begun to decay second they forced upon england the national idea that is a strong centralized government to replace the loose authority of a saxon chief over his tribesmen and the worlds history shows that without a great nationality a great literature is impossible third they brought to england the wealth of a new language and literature and our english gradually absorbed both for three centuries after hastings french was the language of the upper classes of courts and schools and literature yet so tenaciously did the common people cling to their own strong speech that in the end english absorbed almost the whole body of french words and became the language of the land it was the welding of saxon and french into one speech that produced the wealth of our modern english  naturally such momentous changes in a nation were not brought about suddenly at first normans and saxons lived apart in the relation of masters and servants with more or less contempt on one side and hatred on the other but in an astonishingly short time these two races were drawn powerfully together like two men of different dispositions who are often led into a steadfast friendship by the attraction of opposite qualities each supplying what the other lacks the anglosaxon chronicle which was continued for a century after hastings finds much to praise in the conquerors on the other hand the normans even before the conquest had no great love for the french nation after conquering england they began to regard it as home and speedily developed a new sense of nationality geoffreys popular history43 written less than a century after the conquest made conquerors and conquered alike proud of their country by its stories of heroes who curiously enough were neither norman nor saxon but creations of the native celts thus does literature whether in a battle song or a history often play the chief role in the development of nationality44 once the mutual distrust was overcome the two races gradually united and out of this union of saxons and normans came the new english life and literature  literary ideals of the normans the change in the life of the conquerors from norsemen to normans from vikings to frenchmen is shown most clearly in the literature which they brought with them to england the old norse strength and grandeur the magnificent sagas telling of the tragic struggles of men and gods which still stir us profoundlythese have all disappeared in their place is a bright varied talkative literature which runs to endless verses and which makes a wonderful romance out of every subject it touches the theme may be religion or love or chivalry or history the deeds of alexander or the misdeeds of a monk but the authors purpose never varies he must tell a romantic story and amuse his audience and the more wonders and impossibilities he relates the more surely is he believed we are reminded in reading of the native gauls who would stop every traveler and compel him to tell a story ere he passed on there was more of the gaul than of the norseman in the conquerors and far more of fancy than of thought or feeling in their literature if you would see this in concrete form read the chanson de roland the french national epic which the normans first put into literary form in contrast with beowulf which voices the saxons thought and feeling before the profound mystery of human life it is not our purpose to discuss the evident merits or the serious defects of normanfrench literature but only to point out two facts which impress the student namely that anglosaxon literature was at one time enormously superior to the french and that the latter with its evident inferiority absolutely replaced the former the fact is too often ignored says professor schofield45 that before 1066 the anglosaxons had a body of native literature distinctly superior to any which the normans or french could boast at that time their prose especially was unparalleled for extent and power in any european vernacular why then does this superior literature disappear and for nearly three centuries french remain supreme so much so that writers on english soil even when they do not use the french language still slavishly copy the french models  to understand this curious phenomenon it is necessary only to remember the relative conditions of the two races who lived side by side in england on the one hand the anglosaxons were a conquered people and without liberty a great literature is impossible the inroads of the danes and their own tribal wars had already destroyed much of their writings and in their new condition of servitude they could hardly preserve what remained the conquering normans on the other hand represented the civilization of france which country during the early middle ages was the literary and educational center of all europe they came to england at a time when the idea of nationality was dead when culture had almost vanished when englishmen lived apart in narrow isolation and they brought with them law culture the prestige of success and above all the strong impulse to share in the great worlds work and to join in the moving currents of the worlds history small wonder then that the young anglosaxons felt the quickening of this new life and turned naturally to the cultured and progressive normans as their literary models   ii literature of the norman period  in the advocates library at edinburgh there is a beautifully illuminated manuscript written about 1330 which gives us an excellent picture of the literature of the norman period in examining it we are to remember that literature was in the hands of the clergy and nobles that the common people could not read and had only a few songs and ballads for their literary portion we are to remember also that parchments were scarce and very expensive and that a single manuscript often contained all the reading matter of a castle or a village hence this old manuscript is as suggestive as a modern library it contains over forty distinct works the great bulk of them being romances there are metrical or verse romances of french and celtic and english heroes like roland arthur and tristram and bevis of hampton there are stories of alexander the greek romance of flores and blanchefleur and a collection of oriental tales called the seven wise masters there are legends of the virgin and the saints a paraphrase of scripture a treatise on the seven deadly sins some bible history a dispute among birds concerning women a love song or two a vision of purgatory a vulgar story with a gallic flavor a chronicle of english kings and norman barons and a political satire there are a few other works similarly incongruous crowded together in this typical manuscript which now gives mute testimony to the literary taste of the times  obviously it is impossible to classify such a variety we note simply that it is mediæval in spirit and french in style and expression and that sums up the age all the scholarly works of the period like william of malmesburys history and anselms46 cur deus homo and roger bacons opus majus the beginning of modern experimental science were written in latin while nearly all other works were written in french or else were english copies or translations of french originals except for the advanced student therefore they hardly belong to the story of english literature we shall note here only one or two marked literary types like the riming chronicle or verse history and the metrical romance and a few writers whose work has especial significance  geoffrey of monmouth d 1154 geoffreys historia regum britanniae is noteworthy not as literature but rather as a source book from which many later writers drew their literary materials among the native celtic tribes an immense number of legends many of them of exquisite beauty had been preserved through four successive conquests of britain geoffrey a welsh monk collected some of these legends and aided chiefly by his imagination wrote a complete history of the britons his alleged authority was an ancient manuscript in the native welsh tongue containing the lives and deeds of all their kings from brutus the alleged founder of britain down to the coming of julius cæsar47 from this geoffrey wrote his history down to the death of cadwalader in 689  the history is a curious medley of pagan and christian legends of chronicle comment and pure inventionall recorded in minute detail and with a gravity which makes it clear that geoffrey had no conscience or else was a great joker as history the whole thing is rubbish but it was extraordinarily successful at the time and made all who heard it whether normans or saxons proud of their own country it is interesting to us because it gave a new direction to the literature of england by showing the wealth of poetry and romance that lay in its own traditions of arthur and his knights shakespeares king lear malorys morte darthur and tennysons idylls of the king were founded on the work of this monk who had the genius to put unwritten celtic tradition in the enduring form of latin prose  work of the french writers the french literature of the norman period is interesting chiefly because of the avidity with which foreign writers seized upon the native legends and made them popular in england until geoffreys preposterous chronicle appeared these legends had not been used to any extent as literary material indeed they were scarcely known in england though familiar to french and italian minstrels legends of arthur and his court were probably first taken to brittany by welsh emigrants in the fifth and sixth centuries they became immensely popular wherever they were told and they were slowly carried by minstrels and storytellers all over europe that they had never received literary form or recognition was due to a peculiarity of mediæval literature which required that every tale should have some ancient authority behind it geoffrey met this demand by creating an historical manuscript of welsh history that was enough for the age with geoffrey and his alleged manuscript to rest upon the norman french writers were free to use the fascinating stories which had beenfor centuries in the possession of their wandering minstrels geoffreys latin history was put into french verse by gaimar c 1150 and by wace c 1155 and from these french versions the work was first translated into english from about 1200 onward arthur and guinevere and the matchless band of celtic heroes that we meet later 1470 in malorys morte d arthur became the permanent possession of our literature  layamons brut c 1200 this is the most important of the english riming chronicles that is history related in the form of doggerel verse probably because poetry is more easily memorized than prose we give here a free rendering of selected lines at the beginning of the poem which tell us all we know of layamon the first who ever wrote as an englishman for englishmen including in the term all who loved england and called it home no matter where their ancestors were born  now there was a priest in the land named layamon he was son of leovenath may god be gracious unto him he dwelt at ernley at a noble church on severns bank he read many books and it came to his mind to tell the noble deeds of the english then he began to journey far and wide over the land to procure noble books for authority he took the english book that saint bede made another in latin that saint albin made48 and a third book that a french clerk made named wace49 layamon laid these works before him and turned the leaves lovingly he beheld them pen he took and wrote on bookskin and made the three books into one  the poem begins with the destruction of troy and the flight of Æneas the duke into italy brutus a greatgrandson of Æneas gathers his people and sets out to find a new land in the west then follows the founding of the briton kingdom and the last third of the poem which is over thirty thousand lines in length is taken up with the history of arthur and his knights if the brut had no merits of its own it would still interest us for it marks the first appearance of the arthurian legends in our own tongue a single selection is given here from arthurs dying speech familiar to us in tennysons morte darthur the reader will notice here two things first that though the poem is almost pure anglosaxon50 our first speech has already dropped many inflections and is more easily read than beowulf second that french influence is already at work in layamons rimes and assonances that is the harmony resulting from using the same vowel sound in several successive lines      and ich wulle varen to avalun  and i will

gan glide  metrical romances love chivalry and religion all pervaded by the spirit of romancethese are the three great literary ideals which find expression in the metrical romances read these romances now with their knights and fair ladies their perilous adventures and tender lovemaking their minstrelsy and tournaments and gorgeous cavalcadesas if humanity were on parade and life itself were one tumultuous holiday in the open airand you have an epitome of the whole childish credulous soul of the middle ages the normans first brought this type of romance into england and so popular did it become so thoroughly did it express the romantic spirit of the time that it speedily overshadowed all other forms of literary expression  though the metrical romances varied much in form and subjectmatter the general type remains the samea long rambling poem or series of poems treating of love or knightly adventure or both its hero is a knight its characters are fair ladies in distress warriors in armor giants dragons enchanters and various enemies of church and state and its emphasis is almost invariably on love religion and duty as defined by chivalry in the french originals of these romances the lines were a definite length the meter exact and rimes and assonances were both used to give melody in england this metrical system came in contact with the uneven lines the strong accent and alliteration of the native songs and it is due to the gradual union of the two systems french and saxon that our english became capable of the melody and amazing variety of verse forms which first find expression in chaucers poetry  in the enormous number of these verse romances we note three main divisions according to subject into the romances or the socalled matter of france rome and britain51 the matter of france deals largely with the exploits of charlemagne and his peers and the chief of these carlovingian cycles is the chanson de roland the national epic which celebrates the heroism of roland in his last fight against the saracens at ronceval originally these romances were called chansons de geste and the name is significant as indicating that the poems were originally short songs52 celebrating the deeds gesta of wellknown heroes later the various songs concerning one hero were gathered together and the geste became an epic like the chanson de roland or a kind of continued ballad story hardly deserving the name of epic like the geste of robin hood53  the matter of rome consisted largely of tales from greek and roman sources and the two great cycles of these romances deal with the deeds of alexander a favorite hero and the siege of troy with which the britons thought they had some historic connection to these were added a large number of tales from oriental sources and in the exuberant imagination of the latter we see the influence which the saracensthose nimble wits who gave us our first modern sciences and who still reveled in the arabian nightshad begun to exercise on the literature of europe  to the english reader at least the most interesting of the romances are those which deal with the exploits of arthur and his knights of the round tablethe richest storehouse of romance which our literature has ever found there were many cycles of arthurian romances chief of which are those of gawain launcelot merlin the quest of the holy grail and the death of arthur in preceding sections we have seen how these fascinating romances were used by geoffrey and the french writers and how through the french they found their way into english appearing first in our speech in layamons brut the point to remember is that while the legends are celtic in origin their literary form is due to french poets who originated the metrical romance all our early english romances are either copies or translations of the french and this is true not only of the matter of france and rome but of celtic heroes like arthur and english heroes like guy of warwick and robin hood  the most interesting of all arthurian romances are those of the gawain cycle54 and of these the story of sir gawain and the green knight is best worth reading for many reasons first though the material is taken from french sources55 the english workmanship is the finest of our early romances second the unknown author of this romance probably wrote also the pearl and is the greatest english poet of the norman period third the poem itself with its dramatic interest its vivid descriptions and its moral purity is one of the most delightful old romances in any language  in form sir gawain is an interesting combination of french and saxon elements it is written in an elaborate stanza combining meter and alliteration at the end of each stanza is a rimed refrain called by the french a tail rime we give here a brief outline of the story but if the reader desires the poem itself he is advised to begin with a modern version as the original is in the west midland dialect and is exceedingly difficult to follow  on new years day while arthur and his knights are keeping the yuletide feast at camelot a gigantic knight in green enters the banquet hall on horseback and challenges the bravest knight present to an exchange of blows that is he will expose his neck to a blow of his own big battleax if any knight will agree to abide a blow in return after some natural consternation and a fine speech by arthur gawain accepts the challenge takes the battleax and with one blow sends the giants head rolling through the hall the green knight who is evidently a terrible magician picks up his head and mounts his horse he holds out his head and the ghastly lips speak warning gawain to be faithful to his promise and to seek through the world till he finds the green chapel there on next new years day the green knight will meet him and return the blow  the second canto of the poem describes gawains long journey through the wilderness on his steed gringolet and his adventures with storm and cold with wild beasts and monsters as he seeks in vain for the green chapel on christmas eve in the midst of a vast forest he offers a prayer to mary mildest mother so dear and is rewarded by sight of a great castle he enters and is royally entertained by the host an aged hero and by his wife who is the most beautiful woman the knight ever beheld gawain learns that he is at last near the green chapel and settles down for a little comfort after his long quest  the next canto shows the life in the castle and describes a curious compact between the host who goes hunting daily and the knight who remains in the castle to entertain the young wife the compact is that at night each man shall give the other whatever good thing he obtains during the day while the host is hunting the young woman tries in vain to induce gawain to make love to her and ends by giving him a kiss when the host returns and gives his guest the game he has killed gawain returns the kiss on the third day her temptations having twice failed the lady offers gawain a ring which he refuses but when she offers a magic green girdle that will preserve the wearer from death gawain who remembers the giants ax so soon to fall on his neck accepts the girdle as a jewel for the jeopardy and promises the lady to keep the gift secret here then are two conflicting compacts when the host returns and offers his game gawain returns the kiss but says nothing of the green girdle  the last canto brings our knight to the green chapel after he is repeatedly warned to turn back in the face of certain death the chapel is a terrible place in the midst of desolation and as gawain approaches he hears a terrifying sound the grating of steel on stone where the giant is sharpening a new battleax the green knight appears and gawain true to his compact offers his neck for the blow twice the ax swings harmlessly the third time it falls on his shoulder and wounds him whereupon gawain jumps for his armor draws his sword and warns the giant that the compact calls for only one blow and that if another is offered he will defend himself  then the green knight explains things he is lord of the castle where gawain has been entertained for days past the first two swings of the ax were harmless because gawain had been true to his compact and twice returned the kiss the last blow had wounded him because he concealed the gift of the green girdle which belongs to the green knight and was woven by his wife moreover the whole thing has been arranged by morgain the faywoman an enemy of queen guinevere who appears often in the arthurian romances full of shame gawain throws back the gift and is ready to atone for his deception but the green knight thinks he has already atoned and presents the green girdle as a free gift gawain returns to arthurs court tells the whole story frankly and ever after that the knights of the round table wear a green girdle in his honor56  the pearl in the same manuscript with sir gawain are found three other remarkable poems written about 1350 and known to us in order as the pearl cleanness and patience the first is the most beautiful and received its name from the translator and editor richard morris in 1864 patience is a paraphrase of the book of jonah cleanness moralizes on the basis of bible stories but the pearl is an intensely human and realistic picture of a fathers grief for his little daughter margaret my precious perle wythouten spot it is the saddest of all our early poems  on the grave of his little one covered over with flowers the father pours out his love and grief till in the summer stillness he falls asleep while we hear in the sunshine the drowsy hum of insects and the faraway sound of the reapers sickles he dreams there and the dream grows into a vision beautiful his body lies still upon the grave while his spirit goes to a land exquisite beyond all words where he comes suddenly upon a stream that he cannot cross as he wanders along the bank seeking in vain for a ford a marvel rises before his eyes a crystal cliff and seated beneath it a little maiden who raises a happy shining facethe face of his little margaret      more then me lyste my drede aros     i stod full stylle and dorste not calle     wyth yghen open and mouth ful clos     i stod as hende as hawk in halle  he dares not speak for fear of breaking the spell but sweet as a lily she comes down the crystal streams bank to meet and speak with him and tell him of the happy life of heaven and how to live to be worthy of it in his joy he listens forgetting all his grief then the heart of the man cries out for its own and he struggles to cross the stream to join her in the struggle the dream vanishes he wakens to find his eyes wet and his head on the little mound that marks the spot where his heart is buried  from the ideals of these three poems and from peculiarities of style and meter it is probable that their author wrote also sir gawain and the green knight if so the unknown author is the one genius of the age whose poetry of itself has power to interest us and who stands between cynewulf and chaucer as a worthy follower of the one and forerunner of the other  miscellaneous literature of the norman period it is wellnigh impossible to classify the remaining literature of this period and very little of it is now read except by advanced students those interested in the development of transition english will find in the ancren riwle ie rule of the anchoresses c 1225 the most beautiful bit of old english prose ever written it is a book of excellent religious advice and comfort written for three ladies who wished to live a religious life without however becoming nuns or entering any religious orders the author was bishop poore of salisbury according to morton who first edited this old classic in 1853 orms ormulum written soon after the brut is a paraphrase of the gospel lessons for the year somewhat after the manner of cædmons paraphrase but without any of cædmons poetic fire and originality cursor mundi c 1320 is a very long poem which makes a kind of metrical romance out of bible history and shows the whole dealing of god with man from creation to domesday it is interesting as showing a parallel to the cycles of miracle plays which attempt to cover the same vast ground they were forming in this age but we will study them later when we try to understand the rise of the drama in england  besides these greater works an enormous number of fables and satires appeared in this age copied or translated from the french like the metrical romances the most famous of these are the owl and the nightingalea long debate between the two birds one representing the gay side of life the other the sterner side of law and moralsand land of cockaygne ie luxury land a keen satire on monks and monastic religion57  while most of the literature of the time was a copy of the french and was intended only for the upper classes here and there were singers who made ballads for the common people and these next to the metrical romances are the most interesting and significant of all the works of the norman period on account of its obscure origin and its oral transmission the ballad is always the most difficult of literary subjects58 we make here only three suggestions which may well be borne in mind that ballads were produced continually in england from anglosaxon times until the seventeenth century that for centuries they were the only really popular literature and that in the ballads alone one is able to understand the common people read for instance the ballads of the merrie greenwood men which gradually collected into the geste of robin hood and you will understand better perhaps than from reading many histories what the common people of england felt and thought while their lords and masters were busy with impossible metrical romances  in these songs speaks the heart of the english folk there is lawlessness indeed but this seems justified by the oppression of the times and by the barbarous severity of the game laws an intense hatred of shams and injustice lurks in every song but the hatred is saved from bitterness by the humor with which captives especially rich churchmen are solemnly lectured by the bandits while they squirm at sight of devilish tortures prepared before their eyes in order to make them give up their golden purses and the scene generally ends in a bit of wild horseplay there is fighting enough and ambush and sudden death lurk at every turn of the lonely roads but there is also a rough honest chivalry for women and a generous sharing of plunder with the poor and needy all literature is but a dream expressed and robin hood is the dream of an ignorant and oppressed but essentially noble people struggling and determined to be free  far more poetical than the ballads and more interesting even than the romances are the little lyrics of the periodthose tears and smiles of long ago that crystallized into poems to tell us that the hearts of men are alike in all ages of these the best known are the luve ron love rune or letter of thomas de hales c 1250 springtime c 1300 beginning lenten spring ys come with luve to toune and the melodious love song alysoun written at the end of the thirteenth century by some unknown poet who heralds the coming of chaucer      bytuene mersh and averil     when spray biginneth to springe     the lutel foul59 hath hire wyl     on hyre lud60 to synge     ich libbe61 in love longinge

northern france which is still called normandy and rapidly adopted french civilization and the french language their conquest of anglosaxon england under william duke of normandy began with the battle of hastings in 1066 the literature which they brought to england is remarkable for its bright romantic tales of love and adventure in marked contrast with the strength and somberness of anglosaxon poetry during the three centuries following hastings normans and saxons gradually united the anglosaxon speech simplified itself by dropping most of its teutonic inflections absorbed eventually a large part of the french vocabulary and became our english language english literature is also a combination of french and saxon elements the three chief effects of the conquest were 1 the bringing of roman civilization to england 2 the growth of nationality ie a strong centralized government instead of the loose union of saxon tribes 3 the new language and literature which were proclaimed in chaucer  at first the new literature was remarkably varied but of small intrinsic worth and very little of it is now read in our study we have noted 1 geoffreys history which is valuable as a source book of literature since it contains the native celtic legends of arthur 2 the work of the french writers who made the arthurian legends popular 3 riming chronicles ie history in doggerel verse like layamons brut 4 metrical romances or tales in verse these were numerous and of four classes a the matter of france tales centering about charlemagne and his peers chief of which is the chanson de roland b matter of greece and rome an endless series of fabulous tales about alexander and about the fall of troy c matter of england stories of bevis of hampton guy of warwick robin hood etc d matter of britain tales having for their heroes arthur and his knights of the round table the best of these romances is sir gawain and the green knight 5 miscellaneous literaturethe ancren riwle our best

in the complex life of england during the fourteenth century the first is political and culminates in the reign of edward iii it shows the growth of the english national spirit following the victories of edward and the black prince on french soil during the hundred years war in the rush of this great national movement separating england from the political ties of france and to a less degree from ecclesiastical bondage to rome the mutual distrust and jealousy which had divided nobles and commons were momentarily swept aside by a wave of patriotic enthusiasm the french language lost its official prestige and english became the speech not only of the common people but of courts and parliament as well  the second movement is social it falls largely within the reign of edwards successor richard ii and marks the growing discontent with the contrast between luxury and poverty between the idle wealthy classes and the overtaxed peasants sometimes this movement is quiet and strong as when wyclif arouses the conscience of england again it has the portentous rumble of an approaching tempest as when john ball harangues a multitude of discontented peasants on black heath commons using the famous text      when adam delved and eve span     who was then the gentleman  and again it breaks out into the violent rebellion of wat tyler all these things show the same saxon spirit that had won its freedom in a thousand years struggle against foreign enemies and that now felt itself oppressed by a social and industrial tyranny in its own midst  aside from these two movements the age was one of unusual stir and progress chivalry that mediæval institution of mixed good and evil was in its indian summera sentiment rather than a practical system trade and its resultant wealth and luxury were increasing enormously following trade as the vikings had followed glory the english began to be a conquering and colonizing people like the anglosaxons the native shed something of his insularity and became a traveler going first to view the places where trade had opened the way and returning with wider interests and a larger horizon above all the first dawn of the renaissance is heralded in england as in spain and italy by the appearance of a national literature  five writers of the age the literary movement of the age clearly reflects the stirring life of the times there is langland voicing the social discontent preaching the equality of men and the dignity of labor wyclif greatest of english religious reformers giving the gospel to the people in their own tongue and the freedom of the gospel in unnumbered tracts and addresses gower the scholar and literary man criticising this vigorous life and plainly afraid of its consequences and mandeville the traveler romancing about the wonders to be seen abroad above all there is chaucerscholar traveler business man courtier sharing in all the stirring life of his times and reflecting it in literature as no other but shakespeare has ever done outside of england the greatest literary influence of the age was that of dante petrarch and boccaccio whose works then at the summit of their influence in italy profoundly affected the literature of all europe  chaucer 13401400                       what man artow quod he     thou lokest as thou woldest finde an hare     for ever upon the ground i see thee stare     approchë neer

reading chaucer are more apparent than real being due largely to obsolete spelling and there is small necessity for using any modern versions of the poets work which seem to miss the quiet charm and dry humor of the original if the reader will observe the following general rules which of necessity ignore many differences in pronunciation of fourteenthcentury english he may in an hour or two learn to read chaucer almost as easily as shakespeare 1 get the lilt of the lines and let the meter itself decide how final syllables are to be pronounced remember that chaucer is among the most musical of poets and that there is melody in nearly every line if the verse seems rough it is because we do not read it correctly 2 vowels in chaucer have much the same value as in modern german consonants are practically the same as in modern english 3 pronounce aloud any strangelooking words where the eye fails the ear will often recognize the meaning if eye and ear both fail then consult the glossary found in every good edition of the poets works 4 final e is usually sounded like a in virginia except where the following word begins with a vowel or with h in the latter case the final syllable of one word and the first of the word following are run together as in reading virgil at the end of a line the e if lightly pronounced adds melody to the verse70  in dealing with chaucers masterpiece the reader is urged to read widely at first for the simple pleasure of the stories and to remember that poetry and romance are more interesting and important than middle english when we like and appreciate chaucerhis poetry his humor his good stories his kind heartit will be time enough to study his language  life of chaucer for our convenience the life of chaucer is divided into three periods the first of thirty years includes his youth and early manhood in which time he was influenced almost exclusively by french literary models the second period of fifteen years covers chaucers active life as diplomat and man of affairs and in this the italian influence seems stronger than the french the third of fifteen years generally known as the english period is the time of chaucers richest development he lives at home observes life closely but kindly and while the french influence is still strong as shown in the canterbury tales he seems to grow more independent of foreign models and is dominated chiefly by the vigorous life of his own english people  chaucers boyhood was spent in london on thames street near the river where the worlds commerce was continually coming and going there he saw daily the shipman of the canterbury tales just home in his good ship maudelayne with the fascination of unknown lands in his clothes and conversation of his education we know nothing except that he was a great reader his father was a wine merchant purveyor to the royal household and from this accidental relation between trade and royalty may have arisen the fact that at seventeen years chaucer was made page to the princess elizabeth this was the beginning of his connection with the brilliant court which in the next forty years under three kings he was to know so intimately  at nineteen he went with the king on one of the many expeditions of the hundred years war and here he saw chivalry and all the pageantry of mediæval war at the height of their outward splendor taken prisoner at the unsuccessful siege of rheims he is said to have been ransomed by money out of the royal purse returning to england he became after a few years squire of the royal household the personal attendant and confidant of the king it was during this first period that he married a maid of honor to the queen this was probably philippa roet sister to the wife of john of gaunt the famous duke of lancaster from numerous whimsical references in his early poems it has been thought that this marriage into a noble family was not a happy one but this is purely a matter of supposition or of doubtful inference  in 1370 chaucer was sent abroad on the first of those diplomatic missions that were to occupy the greater part of the next fifteen years two years later he made his first official visit to italy to arrange a commercial treaty with genoa and from this time is noticeable a rapid development in his literary powers and the prominence of italian literary influences during the intervals between his different missions he filled various offices at home chief of which was comptroller of customs at the port of london an enormous amount of personal labor was involved but chaucer seems to have found time to follow his spirit into the new fields of italian literature      for whan thy labour doon al is     and hast ymaad thy rekeninges     in stede of reste and newe thinges     thou gost hoom to thy hous anoon     and also domb as any stoon     thou sittest at another boke     til fully daswed is thy loke     and livest thus as an hermyte71  in 1386 chaucer was elected member of parliament from kent and the distinctly english period of his life and work begins though exceedingly busy in public affairs and as receiver of customs his heart was still with his books from which only nature could win him      and as for me though that my wit be lyte     on bokes for to rede i me delyte     and to hem yeve i feyth and ful credence     and in myn

uncertain business chaucer naturally adhered to the party of john of gaunt and his fortunes rose or fell with those of his leader from this time until his death he is up and down on the political ladder today with money and good prospects tomorrow in poverty and neglect writing his complaint to his empty purs which he humorously calls his saveour doun in this werlde here this poem called the kings attention to the poets need and increased his pension but he had but few months to enjoy the effect of this unusual complaint for he died the next year 1400 and was buried with honor in westminster abbey the last period of his life though outwardly most troubled was the most fruitful of all his truth or good counsel reveals the quiet beautiful spirit of his life unspoiled either by the greed of trade or the trickery of politics      flee fro the prees and dwelle with sothfastnesse     suffyce unto thy good though hit be smal     for hord73 hath hate and climbing tikelnesse

that it is impossible to fix exact dates for most of his works some of his canterbury tales were written earlier than the english period and were only grouped with the others in his final arrangement  the best known though not the best poem of the first period is the romaunt of the rose83 a translation from the french roman de la rose the most popular poem of the middle agesa graceful but exceedingly tiresome allegory of the whole course of love the rose growing in its mystic garden is typical of the lady beauty gathering the rose represents the lovers attempt to win his ladys favor and the different feelings arousedlove hate envy jealousy idleness sweet looksare the allegorical persons of the poets drama chaucer translated this universal favorite putting in some original english touches but of the present romaunt only the first seventeen hundred lines are believed to be chaucers own work  perhaps the best poem of this period is the dethe of blanche the duchesse better known as the boke of the duchesse a poem of considerable dramatic and emotional power written after the death of blanche wife of chaucers patron john of gaunt additional poems are the compleynte to pite a graceful love poem the a b c a prayer to the virgin translated from the french of a cistercian monk its verses beginning with the successive letters of the alphabet and a number of what chaucer calls ballads roundels and virelays with which says his friend gower the land was filled the latter were imitations of the prevailing french love ditties  second period the chief work of the second or italian period is troilus and criseyde a poem of eight thousand lines the original story was a favorite of many authors during the middle ages and shakespeare makes use of it in his troilus and cressida the immediate source of chaucers poem is boccaccios il filostrato the lovesmitten one but he uses his material very freely to reflect the ideals of his own age and society and so gives to the whole story a dramatic force and beauty which it had never known before  the hous of fame is one of chaucers unfinished poems having the rare combination of lofty thought and simple homely language showing the influence of the great italian master in the poem the author is carried away in a dream by a great eagle from the brittle temple of venus in a sandy wilderness up to the hall of fame to this house come all rumors of earth as the sparks fly upward the house stands on a rock of ice                  writen ful of names     of folk that hadden grete fames  many of these have disappeared as the ice melted but the older names are clear as when first written for many of his ideas chaucer is indebted to dante ovid and virgil but the unusual conception and the splendid workmanship are all his own  the third great poem of the period is the legende of goode wimmen as he is resting in the fields among the daisies he falls asleep and a gay procession draws near first comes the love god leading by the hand alcestis model of all wifely virtues whose emblem is the daisy and behind them follow a troup of glorious women all of whom have been faithful in love they gather about the poet the god upbraids him for having translated the romance of the rose and for his early poems reflecting on the vanity and fickleness of women alcestis intercedes for him and offers pardon if he will atone for his errors by writing a glorious legend of good women chaucer promises and as soon as he awakes sets himself to the task nine legends were written of which thisbe is perhaps the best it is probable that chaucer intended to make this his masterpiece devoting many years to stories of famous women who were true to love but either because he wearied of his theme or because the plan of the canterbury tales was growing in his mind he abandoned the task in the middle of his ninth legendfortunately perhaps for the reader will find the prologue more interesting than any of the legends  third period chaucers masterpiece the canterbury tales one of the most famous works in all literature fills the third or english period of his life the plan of the work is magnificent to represent the wide sweep of english life by gathering a motley company together and letting each class of society tell its own favorite stories though the great work was never finished chaucer succeeded in his purpose so well that in the canterbury tales he has given us a picture of contemporary english life its work and play its deeds and dreams its fun and sympathy and hearty joy of living such as no other single work of literature has ever equaled  plan of the canterbury tales opposite old london at the southern end of london bridge once stood the tabard inn of southwark a quarter made famous not only by the canterbury tales but also by the first playhouses where shakespeare had his training this southwark was the point of departure of all travel to the south of england especially of those mediæval pilgrimages to the shrine of thomas a becket in canterbury on a spring evening at the inspiring time of the year when longen folk to goon on pilgrimages chaucer alights at the tabard inn and finds it occupied by a various company of people bent on a pilgrimage chance alone had brought them together for it was the custom of pilgrims to wait at some friendly inn until a sufficient company were gathered to make the journey pleasant and safe from robbers that might be encountered on the way chaucer joins this company which includes all classes of english society from the oxford scholar to the drunken miller and accepts gladly their invitation to go with them on the morrow  at supper the jovial host of the tabard inn suggests that to enliven the journey each of the company shall tell four tales two going and two coming on whatever subject shall suit him best the host will travel with them as master of ceremonies and whoever tells the best story shall be given a fine supper at the general expense when they all come back againa shrewd bit of business and a fine idea as the pilgrims all agree  when they draw lots for the first story the chance falls to the knight who tells one of the best of the canterbury tales the chivalric story of palamon and arcite then the tales follow rapidly each with its prologue and epilogue telling how the story came about and its effects on the merry company interruptions are numerous the narrative is full of life and movement as when the miller gets drunk and insists on telling his tale out of season or when they stop at a friendly inn for the night or when the poet with sly humor starts his story of sir thopas in dreary imitation of the metrical romances of the day and is roared at by the host for his drasty ryming with chaucer we laugh at his own expense and are ready for the next tale  from the number of persons in the company thirtytwo in all it is evident that chaucer meditated an immense work of one hundred and twentyeight tales which should cover the whole life of england only twentyfour were written some of these are incomplete and others are taken from his earlier work to fill out the general plan of the canterbury tales incomplete as they are they cover a wide range including stories of love and chivalry of saints and legends travels adventures animal fables allegory satires and the coarse humor of the common people though all but two are written in verse and abound in exquisite poetical touches they are stories as well as poems and chaucer is to be regarded as our first shortstory teller as well as our first modern poet the work ends with a kindly farewell from the poet to his reader and so here taketh the makere of this book his leve  prologue to the canterbury tales in the famous prologue the poet makes us acquainted with the various characters of his drama until chaucers day popular literature had been busy chiefly with the gods and heroes of a golden age it had been essentially romantic and so had never attempted to study men and women as they are or to describe them so that the reader recognizes them not as ideal heroes but as his own neighbors chaucer not only attempted this new realistic task but accomplished it so well that his characters were instantly recognized as true to life and they have since become the permanent possession of our literature beowulf and roland are ideal heroes essentially creatures of the imagination but the merry host of the tabard inn madame eglantyne the fat monk the parish priest the kindly plowman the poor scholar with his bookës black and redall seem more like personal acquaintances than characters in a book says dryden i see all the pilgrims their humours their features and their very dress as distinctly as if i had supped with them at the tabard in southwark chaucer is the first english writer to bring the atmosphere of romantic interest about the men and women and the daily work of ones own worldwhich is the aim of nearly all modern literature  the historian of our literature is tempted to linger over this prologue and to quote from it passage after passage to show how keenly and yet kindly our first modern poet observed his fellowmen the characters too attract one like a good play the verray parfit gentil knight and his manly son the modest prioress model of sweet piety and society manners the sporting monk and the fat friar the discreet man of law the wellfed country squire the sailor just home from sea the canny doctor the lovable parish priest who taught true religion to his flock but first he folwed it himselve the coarse but goodhearted wyf of bath the thieving miller leading the pilgrims to the music of his bagpipeall these and many others from every walk of english life and all described with a quiet kindly humor which seeks instinctively the best in human nature and which has an ample garment of charity to cover even its faults and failings here indeed as dryden says is gods plenty probably no keener or kinder critic ever described his fellows and in this immortal prologue chaucer is a model for all those who would put our human life into writing the student should read it entire as an introduction not only to the poet but to all our modern literature  the knights tale as a story palamon and arcite is in many respects the best of the canterbury tales reflecting as it does the ideals of the time in regard to romantic love and knightly duty though its dialogues and descriptions are somewhat too long and interrupt the story yet it shows chaucer at his best in his dramatic power his exquisite appreciation of nature and his tender yet profound philosophy of living which could overlook much of human frailty in the thought that      infinite been the sorwes and the teres     of oldë folk and folk of tendre yeres  the idea of the story was borrowed from boccaccio but parts of the original tale were much older and belonged to the common literary stock of the middle ages like shakespeare chaucer took the material for his poems wherever he found it and his originality consists in giving to an old story some present human interest making it express the life and ideals of his own age in this respect the knights tale is remarkable its names are those of an ancient civilization but its characters are men and women of the english nobility as chaucer knew them in consequence the story has many anachronisms such as the mediæval tournament before the temple of mars but the reader scarcely notices these things being absorbed in the dramatic interest of the narrative  briefly the knights tale is the story of two young men fast friends who are found wounded on the battlefield and taken prisoners to athens there from their dungeon window they behold the fair maid emily both fall desperately in love with her and their friendship turns to strenuous rivalry one is pardoned the other escapes and then knights empires naturethe whole universe follows their desperate efforts to win one small maiden who prays meanwhile to be delivered from both her bothersome suitors as the best of the canterbury tales are now easily accessible we omit here all quotations the story must be read entire with the prioress tale of hugh of lincoln the clerks tale of patient griselda and the nuns priests merry tale of chanticleer and the fox if the reader would appreciate the variety and charm of our first modern poet and storyteller  form of chaucers poetry there are three principal meters to be found in chaucers verse in the canterbury tales he uses lines of ten syllables and five accents each and the lines run in couplets      his eyen twinkled in his heed aright     as doon the sterres in the frosty night  the same musical measure arranged in sevenline stanzas but with a different rime called the rime royal is found in its most perfect form in troilus      o blisful light of whiche the bemes clere     adorneth al the thridde hevene faire     o sonnes leef o joves doughter dere     plesaunce of love o goodly debonaire     in gentil hertes ay redy to repaire     o verray cause of hele and of gladnesse     yheried be thy might and thy goodnesse     in hevene and helle in erthe and salte see     is felt thy might if that i wel descerne     as man brid best fish herbe and grene tree     thee fele in tymes with vapour eterne     god loveth and to love wol nought werne     and in this world no lyves creature     withouten love is worth or may endure84  the third meter is the eightsyllable line with four accents the lines riming in couplets as in the boke of the duchesse      thereto she coude so wel pleye     whan that hir liste that i dar seye     that she was lyk to torche bright     that every man may takeof light     ynough and hit hath never the lesse  besides these principal meters chaucer in his short poems used many other poetical forms modeled after the french who in the fourteenth century were cunning workers in every form of verse chief among these are the difficult but exquisite rondel now welcom somer with thy sonne softe which closes the parliament of fowls and the ballad flee fro the prees which has been already quoted in the monks tale there is a melodious measure which may have furnished the model for spensers famous stanza85 chaucers poetry is extremely musical and must be judged by the ear rather than by the eye to the modern reader the lines appear broken and uneven but if one reads them over a few times he soon catches the perfect swing of the measure and finds that he is in the hands of a master whose ear is delicately sensitive to the smallest accent there is a lilt in all his lines which is marvelous when we consider that he is the first to show us the poetic possibilities of the language his claim upon our gratitude is twofold86 first for discovering the music that is in our english speech and second for his influence in fixing the midland dialect as the literary language of england   chaucers contemporaries  william langland 1332   life very little is known of langland he was born probably near malvern in worcestershire the son of a poor freeman and in his early life lived in the fields as a shepherd later he went to london with his wife and children getting a hungry living as clerk in the church his real life meanwhile was that of a seer a prophet after isaiahs own heart if we may judge by the prophecy which soon found a voice in piers plowman in 1399 after the success of his great work he was possibly writing another poem called richard the redeless a protest against richard ii but we are not certain of the authorship of this poem which was left unfinished by the assassination of the king after 1399 langland disappears utterly and the date of his death is unknown  piers plowman the voice of him that crieth in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord might well be written at the beginning of this remarkable poem truth sincerity a direct and practical appeal to conscience and a vision of right triumphant over wrongthese are the elements of all prophecy and it was undoubtedly these elements in piers plowman that produced such an impression on the people of england for centuries literature had been busy in pleasing the upper classes chiefly but here at last was a great poem which appealed directly to the common people and its success was enormous the whole poem is traditionally attributed to langland but it is now known to be the work of several different writers it first appeared in 1362 as a poem of eighteen hundred lines and this may have been langlands work in the next thirty years during the desperate social conditions which led to tylers rebellion it was repeatedly revised and enlarged by different hands till it reached its final form of about fifteen thousand lines  the poem as we read it now is in two distinct parts the first containing the vision of piers the second a series of visions called the search for dowel dobet dobest do well better best the entire poem is in strongly accented alliterative lines something like beowulf and its immense popularity shows that the common people still cherished this easily memorized form of saxon poetry its tremendous appeal to justice and common honesty its clarion call to every man whether king priest noble or laborer to do his christian duty takes from it any trace of prejudice or bigotry with which such works usually abound its loyalty to the church while denouncing abuses that had crept into it in that period was one of the great influences which led to the reformation in england its two great principles the equality of men before god and the dignity of honest labor roused a whole nation of freemen altogether it is one of the worlds great works partly because of its national influence partly because it is the very best picture we possess of the social life of the fourteenth century  briefly piers plowman is an allegory of life in the first vision that of the field full of folk the poet lies down on the malvern hills on a may morning and a vision comes to him in sleep on the plain beneath him gather a multitude of folk a vast crowd expressing the varied life of the world all classes and conditions are there workingmen are toiling that others may seize all the first fruits of their labor and live high on the proceeds and the genius of the throng is lady bribery a powerfully drawn figure expressing the corrupt social life of the times  the next visions are those of the seven deadly sins allegorical figures but powerful as those of pilgrims progress making the allegories of the romaunt of the rose seem like shadows in comparison these all came to piers asking the way to truth but piers is plowing his half acre and refuses to leave his work and lead them he sets them all to honest toil as the best possible remedy for their vices and preaches the gospel of work as a preparation for salvation throughout the poem piers bears strong resemblance to john baptist preaching to the crowds in the wilderness the later visions are proclamations of the moral and spiritual life of man the poem grows dramatic in its intensity rising to its highest power in pierss triumph over death and then the poet wakes from his vision with the sound of easter bells ringing in his ears  here are a few lines to illustrate the style and language but the whole poem must be read if one is to understand its crude strength and prophetic spirit      in a somer sesun whon softe was the sonne     i schop87 me into a shroud as i a scheep were     in habite as an heremite unholy of werkes     went wyde in this world wondres to here     bote in a mayes mornynge on malverne hulles     me byfel a ferly88 of fairie me thoughte     i was wery forwandred and

by far the most powerful english figure of the fourteenth century the immense influence of his preaching in the native tongue and the power of his lollards to stir the souls of the common folk are too well known historically to need repetition though a university man and a profound scholar he sides with langland and his interests are with the people rather than with the privileged classes for whom chaucer writes his great work which earned him his title of father of english prose is the translation of the bible wyclif himself translated the gospels and much more of the new testament the rest was finished by his followers especially by nicholas of hereford these translations were made from the latin vulgate not from the original greek and hebrew and the whole work was revised in 1388 by john purvey a disciple of wyclif it is impossible to overestimate the influence of this work both on our english prose and on the lives of the english people  though wyclifs works are now unread except by occasional scholars he still occupies a very high place in our literature his translation of the bible was slowly copied all over england and so fixed a national standard of english prose to replace the various dialects portions of this translation in the form of favorite passages from scripture were copied by thousands and for the first time in our history a standard of pure english was established in the homes of the common people  as a suggestion of the language of that day we quote a few familiar sentences from the sermon on the mount as given in the later version of wyclifs

called the voyage and travail of sir john maundeville written in excellent style in the midland dialect which was then becoming the literary language of england for years this interesting work and its unknown author were subjects of endless dispute but it is now fairly certain that this collection of travelers tales is simply a compilation from odoric marco polo and various other sources the original work was probably in french which was speedily translated into latin then into english and other languages and wherever it appeared it became extremely popular its marvelous stories of foreign lands being exactly suited to the credulous spirit of the age103 at the present time there are said to be three hundred copied manuscripts of mandeville in various languagesmore probably than of any other work save the gospels in the prologue of the english version the author calls himself john maundeville and gives an outline of his wide travels during thirty years but the name is probably a blind the prologue more or less spurious and the real compiler is still to be discovered  the modern reader may spend an hour or two very pleasantly in this old wonderland on its literary side the book is remarkable though a translation as being the first prose work in modern english having a distinctly literary style and flavor otherwise it is a most interesting commentary on the general culture and credulity of the fourteenth century   summary of the age of chaucer the fourteenth century is remarkable historically for the decline of feudalism organized by the normans for the growth of the english national spirit during the wars with france for the prominence of the house of commons and for the growing power of the laboring classes who had heretofore been in a condition hardly above that of slavery  the age produced five writers of note one of whom geoffrey chaucer is one of the greatest of english writers his poetry is remarkable for its variety its story interest and its wonderful melody chaucers work and wyclifs translation of the bible developed the midland dialect into the national language of england  in our study we have noted 1 chaucer his life and work his early or french period in which he translated the romance of the rose and wrote many minor poems his middle or italian period of which the chief poems are troilus and cressida and the legend of good women his late or english period in which he worked at his masterpiece the famous canterbury tales 2 langland the poet and prophet of social reforms his chief work is piers plowman 3 wyclif the religious reformer who first translated the gospels into english and by his translation fixed a common standard of english speech 4 mandeville the alleged traveler who represents the new english interest in distant lands following the development of foreign trade he is famous for mandevilles travels a book which romances about the wonders to be seen abroad the fifth writer of the age is gower who wrote in three languages french latin and english his chief english work is the confessio amantis a long poem containing one hundred and twelve tales of these only the knight florent and two or three others are interesting to a modern reader  selections for reading chaucers prologue the knights tale nuns priests tale prioress tale clerks tale these are found more or less complete in standard

      chapter v  the revival of learning 14001550  i history of the period  political changes the century and a half following the death of chaucer 14001550 is the most volcanic period of english history the land is swept by vast changes inseparable from the rapid accumulation of national power but since power is the most dangerous of gifts until men have learned to control it these changes seem at first to have no specific aim or direction henry vwhose erratic yet vigorous life as depicted by shakespeare was typical of the life of his timesfirst let europe feel the might of the new national spirit to divert that growing and unruly spirit from rebellion at home henry led his army abroad in the apparently impossible attempt to gain for himself three things a french wife a french revenue and the french crown itself the battle of agincourt was fought in 1415 and five years later by the treaty of troyes france acknowledged his right to all his outrageous demands  the uselessness of the terrific struggle on french soil is shown by the rapidity with which all its results were swept away when henry died in 1422 leaving his son heir to the crowns of france and england a magnificent recumbent statue with head of pure silver was placed in westminster abbey to commemorate his victories the silver head was presently stolen and the loss is typical of all that he had struggled for his son henry vi was but the shadow of a king a puppet in the hands of powerful nobles who seized the power of england and turned it to self destruction meanwhile all his foreign possessions were won back by the french under the magic leadership of joan of arc cades rebellion 1450 and the bloody wars of the roses 14551485 are names to show how the energy of england was violently destroying itself like a great engine that has lost its balance wheel the frightful reign of richard iii followed which had however this redeeming quality that it marked the end of civil wars and the selfdestruction of feudalism and made possible a new growth of english national sentiment under the popular tudors  in the long reign of henry viii the changes are less violent but have more purpose and significance his age is marked by a steady increase in the national power at home and abroad by the entrance of the reformation by a side door and by the final separation of england from all ecclesiastical bondage in parliaments famous act of supremacy in previous reigns chivalry and the old feudal system had practically been banished now monasticism the third mediæval institution with its mixed evil and good received its deathblow in the wholesale suppression of the monasteries and the removal of abbots from the house of lords notwithstanding the evil character of the king and the hypocrisy of proclaiming such a creature the head of any church or the defender of any faith we acquiesce silently in stubbs declaration105 that the world owes some of its greatest debts to men from whose memory the world recoils  while england during this period was in constant political strife yet rising slowly like the spiral flight of an eagle to heights of national greatness intellectually it moved forward with bewildering rapidity printing was brought to england by caxton c 1476 and for the first time in history it was possible for a book or an idea to reach the whole nation schools and universities were established in place of the old monasteries greek ideas and greek culture came to england in the renaissance and mans spiritual freedom was proclaimed in the reformation the great names of the period are numerous and significant but literature is strangely silent probably the very turmoil of the age prevented any literary development for literature is one of the arts of peace it requires quiet and meditation rather than activity and the stirring life of the renaissance had first to be lived before it could express itself in the new literature of the elizabethan period  the revival of learning the revival of learning denotes in its broadest sense that gradual enlightenment of the human mind after the darkness of the middle ages the names renaissance and humanism which are often applied to the same movement have properly a narrower significance the term renaissance though used by many writers to denote the whole transition from the middle ages to the modern world106 is more correctly applied to the revival of art resulting from the discovery and imitation of classic models in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries humanism applies to the revival of classic literature and was so called by its leaders following the example of petrarch because they held that the study of the classics literae humanioresie the more human writings rather than the old theologywas the best means of promoting the largest human interests we use the term revival of learning to cover the whole movement whose essence was according to lamartine that man discovered himself and the universe and according to taine that man so long blinded had suddenly opened his eyes and seen  we shall understand this better if we remember that in the middle ages mans whole world consisted of the narrow mediterranean and the nations that clustered about it and that this little world seemed bounded by impassable barriers as if god had said to their sailors hitherto shalt thou come but no farther mans mind also was bounded by the same narrow lines his culture as measured by the great deductive system of scholasticism consisted not in discovery but rather in accepting certain principles and traditions established by divine and ecclesiastical authority as the basis of all truth these were his pillars of hercules his mental and spiritual bounds that he must not pass and within these like a child playing with lettered blocks he proceeded to build his intellectual system only as we remember their limitations can we appreciate the heroism of these toilers of the middle ages giants in intellect yet playing with childrens toys ignorant of the laws and forces of the universe while debating the essence and locomotion of angels eager to learn yet forbidden to enter fresh fields in the right of free exploration and the joy of individual discovery  the revival stirred these men as the voyages of da gama and columbus stirred the mariners of the mediterranean first came the sciences and inventions of the arabs making their way slowly against the prejudice of the authorities and opening mens eyes to the unexplored realms of nature then came the flood of greek literature which the new art of printing carried swiftly to every school in europe revealing a new world of poetry and philosophy scholars flocked to the universities as adventurers to the new world of america and there the old authority received a deathblow truth only was authority to search for truth everywhere as men sought for new lands and gold and the fountain of youththat was the new spirit which awoke in europe with the revival of learning   ii literature of the revival  the hundred and fifty years of the revival period are singularly destitute of good literature mens minds were too much occupied with religious and political changes and with the rapid enlargement of the mental horizon to find time for that peace and leisure which are essential for literary results perhaps also the floods of newly discovered classics which occupied scholars and the new printing presses alike were by their very power and abundance a discouragement of native talent roger ascham 15151568 a famous classical scholar who published a book called toxophilus school of shooting in 1545 expresses in his preface or apology a very widespread dissatisfaction over the neglect of native literature when he says and as for ye latin or greke tongue every thing is so excellently done in them that none can do better in the englysh tonge contrary every thinge in a maner so meanly both for the matter and handelynge that no man can do worse  on the continent also this new interest in the classics served to check the growth of native literatures in italy especially for a full century after the brilliant age of dante and petrarch no great literature was produced and the italian language itself seemed to go backward107 the truth is that these great writers were like chaucer far in advance of their age and that the mediæval mind was too narrow too scantily furnished with ideas to produce a varied literature the fifteenth century was an age of preparation of learning the beginnings of science and of getting acquainted with the great idealsthe stern law the profound philosophy the suggestive mythology and the noble poetry of the greeks and romans so the mind was furnished with ideas for a new literature  with the exception of malorys morte darthur which is still mediæval in spirit the student will find little of interest in the literature of this period we give here a brief summary of the men and the books most worthy of remembrance but for the real literature of the renaissance one must go forward a century and a half to the age of elizabeth  the two greatest books which appeared in england during this period are undoubtedly erasmuss108 praise of folly encomium moriae and mores utopia the famous kingdom of nowhere both were written in latin but were speedily translated into all european languages the praise of folly is like a song of victory for the new learning which had driven away vice ignorance and superstition the three foes of humanity it was published in 1511 after the accession of henry viii folly is represented as donning cap and bells and mounting a pulpit where the vice and cruelty of kings the selfishness and ignorance of the clergy and the foolish standards of education are satirized without mercy  mores utopia published in 1516 is a powerful and original study of social conditions unlike anything which had ever appeared in any literature109 in our own day we have seen its influence in bellamys looking backward an enormously successful book which recently set people to thinking of the unnecessary cruelty of modern social conditions more learns from a sailor one of amerigo vespuccis companions of a wonderful kingdom of nowhere in which all questions of labor government society and religion have been easily settled by simple justice and common sense in this utopia we find for the first time as the foundations of civilized society the three great words liberty fraternity equality which retained their inspiration through all the violence of the french revolution and which are still the unrealized ideal of every free government as he hears of this wonderful country more wonders why after fifteen centuries of christianity his own land is so little civilized and as we read the book today we ask ourselves the same question the splendid dream is still far from being realized yet it seems as if any nation could become utopia in a single generation so simple and just are the requirements  greater than either of these books in its influence upon the common people is tyndales translation of the new testament 1525 which fixed a standard of good english and at the same time brought that standard not only to scholars but to the homes of the common people tyndale made his translation from the original greek and later translated parts of the old testament from the hebrew much of tyndales work was included in cranmers bible known also as the great bible in 1539 and was read in every parish church in england it was the foundation for the authorized version which appeared nearly a century later and became the standard for the whole englishspeaking race  wyatt and surrey in 1557 appeared probably the first printed collection of miscellaneous english poems known as tottels miscellany it contained the work of the socalled courtly makers or poets which had hitherto circulated in manuscript form for the benefit of the court about half of these poems were the work of sir thomas wyatt 15031542 and of henry howard earl of surrey 15171547 both together wrote amorous sonnets modeled after the italians introducing a new verse form which although very difficult has been a favorite ever since with our english poets110 surrey is noted not for any especial worth or originality of his own poems but rather for his translation of two books of virgil in strange meter the strange meter was the blank verse which had never before appeared in english the chief literary work of these two men therefore is to introduce the sonnet and the blank verseone the most dainty the other the most flexible and characteristic form of english poetrywhich in the hands of shakespeare and milton were used to make the worlds masterpieces  malorys morte darthur the greatest english work of this period measured by its effect on subsequent literature is undoubtedly the morte darthur a collection of the arthurian romances told in simple and vivid prose of sir thomas malory the author caxton111 in his introduction says that he was a knight and completed his work in 1470 fifteen years before caxton printed it the record adds that he was the servant of jesu both by day and night beyond that we know little112 except what may be inferred from the splendid work itself  malory groups the legends about the central idea of the search for the holy grail though many of the stories like tristram and isolde are purely pagan malory treats them all in such a way as to preserve the whole spirit of mediæval christianity as it has been preserved in no other work it was to malory rather than to layamon or to the early french writers that shakespeare and his contemporaries turned for their material and in our own age he has supplied tennyson and matthew arnold and swinburne and morris with the inspiration for the idylls of the king and the death of tristram and the other exquisite poems which center about arthur and the knights of his round table  in subjectmatter the book belongs to the mediæval age but malory himself with his desire to preserve the literary monuments of the past belongs to the renaissance and he deserves our lasting gratitude for attempting to preserve the legends and poetry of britain at a time when scholars were chiefly busy with the classics of greece and rome as the arthurian legends are one of the great recurring motives of english literature malorys work should be better known his stories may be and should be told to every child as part of his literary inheritance then malory may be read for his style and his english prose and his expression of the mediæval spirit and then the stories may be read again in tennysons idylls to show how those exquisite old fancies appeal to the minds of our modern poets   summary of the revival of learning period this transition period is at first one of decline from the age of chaucer and then of intellectual preparation for the age of elizabeth for a century and a half after chaucer not a single great english work appeared and the general standard of literature was very low there are three chief causes to account for this 1 the long war with france and the civil wars of the roses distracted attention from books and poetry and destroyed of ruined many noble english families who had been friends and patrons of literature 2 the reformation in the latter part of the period filled mens minds with religious questions 3 the revival of learning set scholars and literary men to an eager study of the classics rather than to the creation of native literature historically the age is noticeable for its intellectual progress for the introduction of printing for the discovery of america for the beginning of the reformation and for the growth of political power among the common people  in our study we have noted 1 the revival of learning what it was and the significance of the terms humanism and renaissance 2 three influential literary workserasmuss praise of folly mores utopia and tyndales translation of the new testament 3 wyatt and surrey and the socalled courtly makers or poets 4 malorys morte darthur a collection of the arthurian legends in english prose the miracle and mystery plays were the most popular form of entertainment in this age but we have reserved them for special study in connection with the rise of the drama in the following chapter  selections for reading malorys morte darthur selections in

of elizabeth 15501620  i history of the period  political summary in the age of elizabeth all doubt seems to vanish from english history after the reigns of edward and mary with defeat and humiliation abroad and persecutions and rebellion at home the accession of a popular sovereign was like the sunrise after a long night and in miltons words we suddenly see england a noble and puissant nation rousing herself like a strong man after sleep and shaking her invincible locks with the queens character a strange mingling of frivolity and strength which reminds one of that iron image with feet of clay we have nothing whatever to do it is the national life that concerns the literary student since even a beginner must notice that any great development of the national life is invariably associated with a development of the national literature it is enough for our purpose therefore to point out two facts that elizabeth with all her vanity and inconsistency steadily loved england and englands greatness and that she inspired all her people with the unbounded patriotism which exults in shakespeare and with the personal devotion which finds a voice in the faery queen under her administration the english national life progressed by gigantic leaps rather than by slow historical process and english literature reached the very highest point of its development it is possible to indicate only a few general characteristics of this great age which had a direct bearing upon its literature  characteristics of the elizabethan age the most characteristic feature of the age was the comparative religious tolerance which was due largely to the queens influence the frightful excesses of the religious war known as the thirty years war on the continent found no parallel in england upon her accession elizabeth found the whole kingdom divided against itself the north was largely catholic while the southern counties were as strongly protestant scotland had followed the reformation in its own intense way while ireland remained true to its old religious traditions and both countries were openly rebellious the court made up of both parties witnessed the rival intrigues of those who sought to gain the royal favor it was due partly to the intense absorption of mens minds in religious questions that the preceding century though an age of advancing learning produced scarcely any literature worthy of the name elizabeth favored both religious parties and presently the world saw with amazement catholics and protestants acting together as trusted counselors of a great sovereign the defeat of the spanish armada established the reformation as a fact in england and at the same time united all englishmen in a magnificent national enthusiasm for the first time since the reformation began the fundamental question of religious toleration seemed to be settled and the mind of man freed from religious fears and persecutions turned with a great creative impulse to other forms of activity it is partly from this new freedom of the mind that the age of elizabeth received its great literary stimulus  2 it was an age of comparative social contentment in strong contrast with the days of langland the rapid increase of manufacturing towns gave employment to thousands who had before been idle and discontented increasing trade brought enormous wealth to england and this wealth was shared to this extent at least that for the first time some systematic care for the needy was attempted parishes were made responsible for their own poor and the wealthy were taxed to support them or give them employment the increase of wealth the improvement in living the opportunities for labor the new social contentthese also are factors which help to account for the new literary activity  3 it is an age of dreams of adventure of unbounded enthusiasm springing from the new lands of fabulous riches revealed by english explorers drake sails around the world shaping the mighty course which english colonizers shall follow through the centuries and presently the young philosopher bacon is saying confidently i have taken all knowledge for my province the mind must search farther than the eye with new rich lands opened to the sight the imagination must create new forms to people the new worlds hakluyts famous collection of voyages and purchas his pilgrimage were even more stimulating to the english imagination than to the english acquisitiveness while her explorers search the new world for the fountain of youth her poets are creating literary works that are young forever marston writes114 why man all their dripping pans are pure gold the prisoners they take are fettered in gold and as for rubies and diamonds they goe forth on holydayes and gather hem by the seashore to hang on their childrens coates this comes nearer to being a description of shakespeares poetry than of the indians in virginia prospero in the tempest with his control over the mighty powers and harmonies of nature is only the literary dream of that science which had just begun to grapple with the forces of the universe cabot drake frobisher gilbert raleigh willoughby hawkinsa score of explorers reveal a new earth to mens eyes and instantly literature creates a new heaven to match it so dreams and deeds increase side by side and the dream is ever greater than the deed that is the meaning of literature  4 to sum up the age of elizabeth was a time of intellectual liberty of growing intelligence and comfort among all classes of unbounded patriotism and of peace at home and abroad for a parallel we must go back to the age of pericles in athens or of augustus in rome or go forward a little to the magnificent court of louis xiv when corneille racine and molière brought the drama in france to the point where marlowe shakespeare and jonson had left it in england half a century earlier such an age of great thought and great action appealing to the eyes as well as to the imagination and intellect finds but one adequate literary expression neither poetry nor the story can express the whole manhis thought feeling action and the resulting character hence in the age of elizabeth literature turned instinctively to the drama and brought it rapidly to the highest stage of its development   ii the nondramatic poets of the elizabethan age  edmund spenser 15521599

suggestion of deor spenser reveals his own heart unconsciously perhaps as no biographer could possibly do his life and work seem to center about three great influences summed up in three names cambridge where he grew acquainted with the classics and the italian poets london where he experienced the glamour and the disappointment of court life and ireland which steeped him in the beauty and imagery of old celtic poetry and first gave him leisure to write his masterpiece  life of spensers early life and parentage we know little except that he was born in east smithfield near the tower of london and was poor his education began at the merchant tailors school in london and was continued in cambridge where as a poor sizar and fag for wealthy students he earned a scant living here in the glorious world that only a poor scholar knows how to create for himself he read the classics made acquaintance with the great italian poets and wrote numberless little poems of his own though chaucer was his beloved master his ambition was not to rival the canterbury tales but rather to express the dream of english chivalry much as ariosto had done for italy in orlando furioso  after leaving cambridge 1576 spenser went to the north of england on some unknown work or quest here his chief occupation was to fall in love and to record his melancholy over the lost rosalind in the shepherds calendar upon his friend harveys advice he came to london bringing his poems and here he met leicester then at the height of royal favor and the latter took him to live at leicester house here he finished the shepherds calendar and here he met sidney and all the queens favorites the court was full of intrigues lying and flattery and spensers opinion of his own uncomfortable position is best expressed in a few lines from mother hubbards tale      full little knowest thou that has not tried     what hell it is in suing long to bide     to lose good days that might be better spent     to waste long nights in pensive discontent                                             to fret thy soul with crosses and with cares     to eat thy heart through comfortless despairs     to fawn to crouch to wait to ride to run     to spend to give to want to be undone  in 1580 through leicesters influence spenser who was utterly weary of his dependent position was made secretary to lord grey the queens deputy in ireland and the third period of his life began he accompanied his chief through one campaign of savage brutality in putting down an irish rebellion and was given an immense estate with the castle of kilcolman in munster which had been confiscated from earl desmond one of the irish leaders his life here where according to the terms of his grant he must reside as an english settler he regarded as lonely exile      my luckless lot     that banished had myself like wight forlore     into that waste where i was quite forgot  it is interesting to note here a gentle poets view of the unhappy island after nearly sixteen years residence he wrote his view of the state of ireland 1596116 his only prose work in which he submits a plan for pacifying the oppressed and rebellious people this was to bring a huge force of cavalry and infantry into the country give the irish a brief time to submit and after that to hunt them down like wild beasts he calculated that cold famine and sickness would help the work of the sword and that after the rebels had been well hounded for two winters the following summer would find the country peaceful this plan from the poet of harmony and beauty was somewhat milder than the usual treatment of a brave people whose offense was that they loved liberty and religion strange as it may seem the view was considered most statesmanlike and was excellently well received in england  in kilcolman surrounded by great natural beauty spenser finished the first three books of the faery queen in 1589 raleigh visited him heard the poem with enthusiasm hurried the poet off to london and presented him to elizabeth the first three books met with instant success when published and were acclaimed as the greatest work in the english language a yearly pension of fifty pounds was conferred by elizabeth but rarely paid and the poet turned back to exile that is to ireland again  soon after his return spenser fell in love with his beautiful elizabeth an irish girl wrote his amoretti or sonnets in her honor and afterwards represented her in the faery queen as the beautiful woman dancing among the graces in 1594 he married elizabeth celebrating his wedding with his epithalamion one of the most beautiful wedding hymns in any language  spensers next visit to london was in 1595 when he published astrophel an elegy on the death of his friend sidney and three more books of the faery queen on this visit he lived again at leicester house now occupied by the new favorite essex where he probably met shakespeare and the other literary lights of the elizabethan age soon after his return to ireland spenser was appointed sheriff of cork a queer office for a poet which probably brought about his undoing the same year tyrones rebellion broke out in munster kilcolman the ancient house of desmond was one of the first places attacked by the rebels and spenser barely escaped with his wife and two children it is supposed that some unfinished parts of the faery queen were burned in the castle  from the shock of this frightful experience spenser never recovered he returned to england heartbroken and in the following year 1599 he died in an inn at westminster according to ben jonson he died for want of bread but whether that is a poetic way of saying that he had lost his property or that he actually died of destitution will probably never be known he was buried beside his master chaucer in westminster abbey the poets of that age thronging to his funeral and according to camden casting their elegies and the pens that had written them into his tomb  spensers works the faery queen is the great work upon which the poets fame chiefly rests the original plan of the poem included twentyfour books each of which was to recount the adventure and triumph of a knight who represented a moral virtue spensers purpose as indicated in a letter to raleigh which introduces the poem is as follows  to pourtraict in arthure before he was king the image of a brave knight perfected in the twelve private morall vertues as aristotle hath devised which is the purpose of these first twelve bookes which if i finde to be well accepted i may be perhaps encoraged to frame the other part of polliticke vertues in his person after that hee came to be king  each of the virtues appears as a knight fighting his opposing vice and the poem tells the story of the conflicts it is therefore purely allegorical not only in its personified virtues but also in its representation of life as a struggle between good and evil in its strong moral element the poem differs radically from orlando furioso upon which it was modeled spenser completed only six books celebrating holiness temperance chastity friendship justice and courtesy we have also a fragment of the seventh treating of constancy but the rest of this book was not written or else was lost in the fire at kilcolman the first three books are by far the best and judging by the way the interest lags and the allegory grows incomprehensible it is perhaps as well for spensers reputation that the other eighteen books remained a dream  argument of the faery queen from the introductory letter we learn that the hero visits the queens court in fairy land while she is holding a twelvedays festival on each day some distressed person appears unexpectedly tells a woful story of dragons of enchantresses or of distressed beauty or virtue and asks for a champion to right the wrong and to let the oppressed go free sometimes a knight volunteers or begs for the dangerous mission again the duty is assigned by the queen and the journeys and adventures of these knights are the subjects of the several books the first recounts the adventures of the redcross knight representing holiness and the lady una representing religion their contests are symbolical of the worldwide struggle between virtue and faith on the one hand and sin and heresy on the other the second book tells the story of sir guyon or temperance the third of britomartis representing chastity the fourth fifth and sixth of cambel and triamond friendship artegall justice and sir calidore courtesy spensers plan was a very elastic one and he filled up the measure of his narrative with everything that caught his fancyhistorical events and personages under allegorical masks beautiful ladies chivalrous knights giants monsters dragons sirens enchanters and adventures enough to stock a library of fiction if you read homer or virgil you know his subject in the first strong line if you read cædmons paraphrase or miltons epic the introduction gives you the theme but spensers great poemwith the exception of a single line in the prologue fierce warres and faithfull loves shall moralize my songgives hardly a hint of what is coming  as to the meaning of the allegorical figures one is generally in doubt in the first three books the shadowy faery queen sometimes represents the glory of god and sometimes elizabeth who was naturally flattered by the parallel britomartis is also elizabeth the redcross knight is sidney the model englishman arthur who always appears to rescue the oppressed is leicester which is another outrageous flattery una is sometimes religion and sometimes the protestant church while duessa represents mary queen of scots or general catholicism in the last three books elizabeth appears again as mercilla henry iv of france as bourbon the war in the netherlands as the story of lady belge raleigh as timias the earls of northumberland and westmoreland lovers of mary or duessa as blandamour and paridell and so on through the wide range of contemporary characters and events till the allegory becomes as difficult to follow as the second part of goethes faust  poetical form for the faery queen spenser invented a new verse form which has been called since his day the spenserian stanza because of its rare beauty it has been much used by nearly all our poets in their best work the new stanza was an improved form of ariostos ottava rima ie eightline stanza and bears a close resemblance to one of chaucers most musical verse forms in the monks tale spensers stanza is in nine lines eight of five feet each and the last of six feet riming ababbcbcc a few selections from the first book which is best worth reading are reproduced here to show the style and melody of the verse        a gentle knight was pricking on the plaine       ycladd117 in mightie armes and silver shielde       wherein old dints of deepe woundes did remaine       the

subdue avenging wrong  minor poems next to his masterpiece the shepherds calendar 1579 is the best known of spensers poems though as his first work it is below many others in melody it consists of twelve pastoral poems or eclogues one for each month of the year the themes are generally rural life nature love in the fields and the speakers are shepherds and shepherdesses to increase the rustic effect spenser uses strange forms of speech and obsolete words to such an extent that jonson complained his works are not english or any other language some are melancholy poems on his lost rosalind some are satires on the clergy one the briar and the oak is an allegory one flatters elizabeth and others are pure fables touched with the puritan spirit they are written in various styles and meters and show plainly that spenser was practicing and preparing himself for greater work  other noteworthy poems are mother hubbards tale a satire on society astrophel an elegy on the death of sidney amoretti or sonnets to his elizabeth the marriage hymn epithalamion and four hymns on love beauty heavenly love and heavenly beauty there are numerous other poems and collections of poems but these show the scope of his work and are best worth reading  importance of the shepherds calendar the publication of this work in 1579 by an unknown writer who signed himself modestly immerito marks an important epoch in our literature we shall appreciate this better if we remember the long years during which england had been without a great poet chaucer and spenser are often studied together as poets of the renaissance period and the idea prevails that they were almost contemporary in fact nearly two centuries passed after chaucers deathyears of enormous political and intellectual developmentand not only did chaucer have no successor but our language had changed so rapidly that englishmen had lost the ability to read his lines correctly125  this first published work of spenser is noteworthy in at least four respects first it marks the appearance of the first national poet in two centuries second it shows again the variety and melody of english verse which had been largely a tradition since chaucer third it was our first pastoral the beginning of a long series of english pastoral compositions modeled on spenser and as such exerted a strong influence on subsequent literature and fourth it marks the real beginning of the outburst of great elizabethan poetry  characteristics of spensers poetry the five main qualities of spensers poetry are 1 a perfect melody 2 a rare sense of beauty 3 a splendid imagination which could gather into one poem heroes knights ladies dwarfs demons and dragons classic mythology stories of chivalry and the thronging ideals of the renaissanceall passing in gorgeous procession across an everchanging and everbeautiful landscape 4 a lofty moral purity and seriousness 5 a delicate idealism which could make all nature and every common thing beautiful in contrast with these excellent qualities the reader will probably note the strange appearance of his lines due to his fondness for obsolete words like eyne eyes and shend shame and his tendency to coin others like mercify to suit his own purposes  it is spensers idealism his love of beauty and his exquisite melody which have caused him to be known as the poets poet nearly all our subsequent singers acknowledge their delight in him and their indebtedness macaulay alone among critics voices a fault which all who are not poets quickly feel namely that with all spensers excellences he is difficult to read the modern man loses himself in the confused allegory of the faery queen skips all but the marked passages and softly closes the book in gentle weariness even the best of his longer poems while of exquisite workmanship and delightfully melodious generally fail to hold the readers attention the movement is languid there is little dramatic interest and only a suggestion of humor the very melody of his verses sometimes grows monotonous like a strauss waltz too long continued we shall best appreciate spenser by reading at first only a few wellchosen selections from the faery queen and the shepherds calendar and a few of the minor poems which exemplify his wonderful melody  comparison between chaucer and spenser at the outset it is well to remember that though spenser regarded chaucer as his master two centuries intervene between them and that their writings have almost nothing in common we shall appreciate this better by a brief comparison between our first two modern poets  chaucer was a combined poet and man of affairs with the latter predominating though dealing largely with ancient or mediæval material he has a curiously modern way of looking at life indeed he is our only author preceding shakespeare with whom we feel thoroughly at home he threw aside the outgrown metrical romance which was practically the only form of narrative in his day invented the art of storytelling in verse and brought it to a degree of perfection which has probably never since been equaled though a student of the classics he lived wholly in the present studied the men and women of his own time painted them as they were but added always a touch of kindly humor or romance to make them more interesting so his mission appears to be simply to amuse himself and his readers his mastery of various and melodious verse was marvelous and has never been surpassed in our language but the english of his day was changing rapidly and in a very few years men were unable to appreciate his art so that even to spenser and dryden for example he seemed deficient in metrical skill on this account his influence on our literature has been much less than we should expect from the quality of his work and from his position as one of the greatest of english poets  like chaucer spenser was a busy man of affairs but in him the poet and the scholar always predominates he writes as the idealist describing men not as they are but as he thinks they should be he has no humor and his mission is not to amuse but to reform like chaucer he studies the classics and contemporary french and italian writers but instead of adapting his material to presentday conditions he makes poetry as in his eclogues for instance more artificial even than his foreign models where chaucer looks about him and describes life as he sees it spenser always looks backward for his inspiration he lives dreamily in the past in a realm of purely imaginary emotions and adventures his first quality is imagination not observation and he is the first of our poets to create a world of dreams fancies and illusions his second quality is a wonderful sensitiveness to beauty which shows itself not only in his subjectmatter but also in the manner of his poetry like chaucer he is an almost perfect workman but in reading chaucer we think chiefly of his natural characters or his ideas while in reading spenser we think of the beauty of expression the exquisite spenserian stanza and the rich melody of spensers verse have made him the model of all our modern poets   minor poets  though spenser is the one great nondramatic poet of the elizabethan age a multitude of minor poets demand attention of the student who would understand the tremendous literary activity of the period one needs only to read the paradyse of daynty devises 1576 or a gorgeous gallery of gallant inventions 1578 or any other of the miscellaneous collections to find hundreds of songs many of them of exquisite workmanship by poets whose names now awaken no response a glance is enough to assure one that over all england the sweet spirit of song had arisen like the first chirping of birds after a storm nearly two hundred poets are recorded in the short period from 1558 to 1625 and many of them were prolific writers in a work like this we can hardly do more than mention a few of the best known writers and spend a moment at least with the works that suggest marlowes description of infinite riches in a little room the reader will note for himself the interesting union of action and thought in these men so characteristic of the elizabethan age for most of them were engaged chiefly in business or war or politics and literature was to them a pleasant recreation rather than an absorbing profession  thomas sackville 15361608 sir thomas sackville earl of dorset and lord high treasurer of england is generally classed with wyatt and surrey among the predecessors of the elizabethan age in imitation of dantes inferno sackville formed the design of a great poem called the mirror for magistrates under guidance of an allegorical personage called sorrow he meets the spirits of all the important actors in english history the idea was to follow lydgates fall of princes and let each character tell his own story so that the poem would be a mirror in which present rulers might see themselves and read this warning who reckless rules right soon may hope to rue sackville finished only the induction and the complaint of the duke of buckingham these are written in the rime royal and are marked by strong poetic feeling and expression unfortunately sackville turned from poetry to politics and the poem was carried on by two inferior poets william baldwin and george ferrers  sackville wrote also in connection with thomas norton the first english tragedy ferrex and porrex called also gorboduc which will be considered in the following section on the rise of the drama  philip sidney 15541586 sidney the ideal gentleman the sir calidore of spensers legend of courtesy is vastly more interesting as a man than as a writer and the student is recommended to read his biography rather than his books his life expresses better than any single literary work the two ideals of the agepersonal honor and national greatness  as a writer he is known by three principal works all published after his death showing how little importance he attached to his own writing even while he was encouraging spenser the arcadia is a pastoral romance interspersed with eclogues in which shepherds and shepherdesses sing of the delights of rural life though the work was taken up idly as a summers pastime it became immensely popular and was imitated by a hundred poets the apologie for poetrie 1595 generally called the defense of poesie appeared in answer to a pamphlet by stephen gosson called the school of abuse 1579 in which the poetry of the age and its unbridled pleasure were denounced with puritan thoroughness and conviction the apologie is one of the first critical essays in english and though its style now seems labored and unnaturalthe pernicious result of euphues and his schoolit is still one of the best expressions of the place and meaning of poetry in any language astrophel and stella is a collection of songs and sonnets addressed to lady penelope devereux to whom sidney had once been betrothed they abound in exquisite lines and passages containing more poetic feeling and expression than the songs of any other minor writer of the age  george chapman 15591634 chapman spent his long quiet life among the dramatists and wrote chiefly for the stage his plays which were for the most part merely poems in dialogue fell far below the high dramatic standard of his time and are now almost unread his most famous work is the metrical translation of the iliad 1611 and of the odyssey 1614 chapmans homer though lacking the simplicity and dignity of the original has a force and rapidity of movement which makes it superior in many respects to popes more familiar translation chapman is remembered also as the finisher of marlowes hero and leander in which apart from the drama the renaissance movement is seen at perhaps its highest point in english poetry out of scores of long poems of the period hero and leander and the faery queen are the only two which are even slightly known to modern readers  michael drayton 15631631 drayton is the most voluminous and to antiquarians at least the most interesting of the minor poets he is the layamon of the elizabethan age and vastly more scholarly than his predecessor his chief work is polyolbion an enormous poem of many thousand couplets describing the towns mountains and rivers of britain with the interesting legends connected with each it is an extremely valuable work and represents a lifetime of study and research two other long works are the barons wars and the heroic epistle of england and besides these were many minor poems one of the best of these is the battle of agincourt a ballad written in the lively meter which tennyson used with some variations in the charge of the light brigade and which shows the old english love of brave deeds and of the songs that stir a peoples heart in memory of noble ancestors   iii the first english dramatists  the origin of the drama first the deed then the story then the play that seems to be the natural development of the drama in its simplest form the great deeds of a people are treasured in its literature and later generations represent in play or pantomime certain parts of the story which appeal most powerfully to the imagination among primitive races the deeds of their gods and heroes are often represented at the yearly festivals and among children whose instincts are not yet blunted by artificial habits one sees the story that was heard at bedtime repeated next day in vigorous action when our boys turn scouts and our girls princesses precisely as our first dramatists turned to the old legends and heroes of britain for their first stage productions to act a part seems as natural to humanity as to tell a story and originally the drama is but an old story retold to the eye a story put into action by living performers who for the moment make believe or imagine themselves to be the old heroes  to illustrate the matter simply there was a great life lived by him who was called the christ inevitably the life found its way into literature and we have the gospels around the life and literature sprang up a great religion its worship was at first simplethe common prayer the evening meal together the remembered words of the master and the closing hymn gradually a ritual was established which grew more elaborate and impressive as the centuries went by scenes from the masters life began to be represented in the churches especially at christmas time when the story of christs birth was made more effective to the eyes of a people who could not read by a babe in a manger surrounded by magi and shepherds with a choir of angels chanting the gloria in excelsis126 other impressive scenes from the gospel followed then the old testament was called upon until a complete cycle of plays from the creation to the final judgment was established and we have the mysteries and miracle plays of the middle ages out of these came directly the drama of the elizabethan age   periods in the development of the drama  1 the religious period in europe as in greece the drama had a distinctly religious origin127 the first characters were drawn from the new testament and the object of the first plays was to make the church service more impressive or to emphasize moral lessons by showing the reward of the good and the punishment of the evil doer in the latter days of the roman empire the church found the stage possessed by frightful plays which debased the morals of a people already fallen too low reform seemed impossible the corrupt drama was driven from the stage and plays of every kind were forbidden but mankind loves a spectacle and soon the church itself provided a substitute for the forbidden plays in the famous mysteries and miracles  miracle and mystery plays in france the name miracle was given to any play representing the lives of the saints while the mystère represented scenes from the life of christ or stories from the old testament associated with the coming of messiah in england this distinction was almost unknown the name miracle was used indiscriminately for all plays having their origin in the bible or in the lives of the saints and the name mystery to distinguish a certain class of plays was not used until long after the religious drama had passed away  the earliest miracle of which we have any record in england is the ludus de sancta katharina which was performed in dunstable about the year 1110128 it is not known who wrote the original play of st catherine but our first version was prepared by geoffrey of st albans a french schoolteacher of dunstable whether or not the play was given in english is not known but it was customary in the earliest plays for the chief actors to speak in latin or french to show their importance while minor and comic parts of the same play were given in english  for four centuries after this first recorded play the miracles increased steadily in number and popularity in england they were given first very simply and impressively in the churches then as the actors increased in number and the plays in liveliness they overflowed to the churchyards but when fun and hilarity began to predominate even in the most sacred representations the scandalized priests forbade plays altogether on church grounds by the year 1300 the miracles were out of ecclesiastical hands and adopted eagerly by the town guilds and in the following two centuries we find the church preaching against the abuse of the religious drama which it had itself introduced and which at first had served a purely religious purpose129 but by this time the miracles had taken strong hold upon the english people and they continued to be immensely popular until in the sixteenth century they were replaced by the elizabethan drama  the early miracle plays of england were divided into two classes the first given at christmas included all plays connected with the birth of christ the second at easter included the plays relating to his death and triumph by the beginning of the fourteenth century all these plays were in various localities united in single cycles beginning with the creation and ending with the final judgment the complete cycle was presented every spring beginning on corpus christi day and as the presentation of so many plays meant a continuous outdoor festival of a week or more this day was looked forward to as the happiest of the whole year  probably every important town in england had its own cycle of plays for its own guilds to perform but nearly all have been lost at the present day only four cycles exist except in the most fragmentary condition and these though they furnish an interesting commentary on the times add very little to our literature the four cycles are the chester and york plays so called from the towns in which they were given the towneley or wakefield plays named for the towneley family which for a long time owned the manuscript and the coventry plays which on doubtful evidence have been associated with the grey friars franciscans of coventry the chester cycle has 25 plays the wakefield 30 the coventry 42 and the york 48 it is impossible to fix either the date or the authorship of any of these plays we only know certainly that they were in great favor from the twelfth to the sixteenth century the york plays are generally considered to be the best but those of wakefield show more humor and variety and better workmanship the former cycle especially shows a certain unity resulting from its aim to represent the whole of mans life from birth to death the same thing is noticeable in cursor mundi which with the york and wakefield cycles belongs to the fourteenth century  at first the actors as well as the authors of the miracles were the priests and their chosen assistants later when the town guilds took up the plays and each guild became responsible for one or more of the series the actors were carefully selected and trained by four oclock on the morning of corpus christi all the players had to be in their places in the movable theaters which were scattered throughout the town in the squares and open places each of these theaters consisted of a twostory platform set on wheels the lower story was a dressing room for the actors the upper story was the stage proper and was reached by a trapdoor from below when the play was over the platform was dragged away and the next play in the cycle took its place so in a single square several plays would be presented in rapid sequence to the same audience meanwhile the first play moved on to another square where another audience was waiting to hear it  though the plays were distinctly religious in character there is hardly one without its humorous element in the play of noah for instance noahs shrewish wife makes fun for the audience by wrangling with her husband in the crucifixion play herod is a prankish kind of tyrant who leaves the stage to rant among the audience so that to outherod herod became a common proverb in all the plays the devil is a favorite character and the butt of every joke he also leaves the stage to play pranks or frighten the wondering children on the side of the stage was often seen a huge dragons head with gaping red jaws belching forth fire and smoke out of which poured a tumultuous troop of devils with clubs and pitchforks and gridirons to punish the wicked characters and to drag them away at last howling and shrieking into hellmouth as the dragons head was called so the fear of hell was ingrained into an ignorant people for four centuries alternating with these horrors were bits of rough horseplay and domestic scenes of peace and kindliness representing the life of the english fields and homes with these were songs and carols like that of the nativity for instance      as i out rode this enderes last night     of three jolly shepherds i saw a sight     and all about their fold a star shone bright          they sang terli terlow     so merryly the shepherds their pipes can blow     down from heaven from heaven so high     of angels there came a great companye     with mirth and joy and great solemnitye          they sang terli terlow     so merryly the shepherds their pipes can blow  such songs were taken home by the audience and sung for a season as a popular tune is now caught from the stage and sung on the streets and at times the whole audience would very likely join in the chorus  after these plays were written according to the general outline of the bible stories no change was tolerated the audience insisting like children at punch and judy upon seeing the same things year after year no originality in plot or treatment was possible therefore the only variety was in new songs and jokes and in the pranks of the devil childish as such plays seem to us they are part of the religious development of all uneducated people even now the persian play of the martyrdom of ali is celebrated yearly and the famous passion play a true miracle is given every ten years at oberammergau  2 the moral period of the drama130 the second or moral period of the drama is shown by the increasing prevalence of the morality plays in these the characters were allegorical personageslife death repentance goodness love greed and other virtues and vices the moralities may be regarded therefore as the dramatic counterpart of the once popular allegorical poetry exemplified by the romance of the rose it did not occur to our first unknown dramatists to portray men and women as they are until they had first made characters of abstract human qualities nevertheless the morality marks a distinct advance over the miracle in that it gave free scope to the imagination for new plots and incidents in spain and portugal these plays under the name auto were wonderfully developed by the genius of calderon and gil vicente but in england the morality was a dreary kind of performance like the allegorical poetry which preceded it  to enliven the audience the devil of the miracle plays was introduced and another lively personage called the vice was the predecessor of our modern clown and jester his business was to torment the virtues by mischievous pranks and especially to make the devils life a burden by beating him with a bladder or a wooden sword at every opportunity the morality generally ended in the triumph of virtue the devil leaping into hellmouth with vice on his back  the best known of the moralities is everyman which has recently been revived in england and america the subject of the play is the summoning of every man by death and the moral is that nothing can take away the terror of the inevitable summons but an honest life and the comforts of religion in its dramatic unity it suggests the pure greek drama there is no change of time or scene and the stage is never empty from the beginning to the end of the performance other wellknown moralities are the pride of life hyckescorner and castell of perseverance in the latter man is represented as shut up in a castle garrisoned by the virtues and besieged by the vices  like the miracle plays most of the old moralities are of unknown date and origin of the known authors of moralities two of the best are john skelton who wrote magnificence and probably also the necromancer and sir david lindsay 14901555 the poet of the scotch reformation whose religious business it was to make rulers uncomfortable by telling them unpleasant truths in the form of poetry with these men a new element enters into the moralities they satirize or denounce abuses of church and state and introduce living personages thinly disguised as allegories so that the stage first becomes a power in shaping events and correcting abuses  the interludes it is impossible to draw any accurate line of distinction between the moralities and interludes in general we may think of the latter as dramatic scenes sometimes given by themselves usually with music and singing at banquets and entertainments where a little fun was wanted and again slipped into a miracle play to enliven the audience after a solemn scene thus on the margin of a page of one of the old chester plays we read the boye and pigge when the kinges are gone certainly this was no part of the original scene between herod and the three kings so also the quarrel between noah and his wife is probably a late addition to an old play the interludes originated undoubtedly in a sense of humor and to john heywood 14971580 a favorite retainer and jester at the court of mary is due the credit for raising the interlude to the distinct dramatic form known as comedy  heywoods interludes were written between 1520 and 1540 his most famous is the four ps a contest of wit between a pardoner a palmer a pedlar and a poticary the characters here strongly suggest those of chaucer131 another interesting interlude is called the play of the weather in this jupiter and the gods assemble to listen to complaints about the weather and to reform abuses naturally everybody wants his own kind of weather the climax is reached by a boy who announces that a boys pleasure consists in two things catching birds and throwing snowballs and begs for the weather to be such that he can always do both jupiter decides that he will do just as he pleases about the weather and everybody goes home satisfied  all these early plays were written for the most part in a mingling of prose and wretched doggerel and add nothing to our literature their great work was to train actors to keep alive the dramatic spirit and to prepare the way for the true drama  3 the artistic period of the drama the artistic is the final stage in the development of the english drama it differs radically from the other two in that its chief purpose is not to point a moral but to represent human life as it is the artistic drama may have purpose no less than the miracle play but the motive is always subordinate to the chief end of representing life itself  the first true play in english with a regular plot divided into acts and scenes is probably the comedy ralph royster doyster it was written by nicholas udall master of eton and later of westminster school and was first acted by his schoolboys some time before 1556 the story is that of a conceited fop in love with a widow who is already engaged to another man the play is an adaptation of the miles gloriosus a classic comedy by plautus and the english characters are more or less artificial but as furnishing a model of a clear plot and natural dialogue the influence of this first comedy with its mixture of classic and english elements can hardly be overestimated  the next play gammer gurtons needle cir 1562 is a domestic comedy a true bit of english realism representing the life of the peasant class  gammer gurton is patching the leather breeches of her man hodge when gib the cat gets into the milk pan while gammer chases the cat the family needle is lost a veritable calamity in those days the whole household is turned upside down and the neighbors are dragged into the affair various comical situations are brought about by diccon a thieving vagabond who tells gammer that her neighbor dame chatte has taken her needle and who then hurries to tell dame chatte that she is accused by gammer of stealing a favorite rooster naturally there is a terrible row when the two irate old women meet and misunderstand each other diccon also drags doctor rat the curate into the quarrel by telling him that if he will but creep into dame chattes cottage by a hidden way he will find her using the stolen needle then diccon secretly warns dame chatte that gammer gurtons man hodge is coming to steal her chickens and the old woman hides in the dark passage and cudgels the curate soundly with the door bar all the parties are finally brought before the justice when hodge suddenly and painfully finds the lost needlewhich is all the while stuck in his leather breechesand the scene ends uproariously for both audience and actors  this first wholly english comedy is full of fun and coarse humor and is wonderfully true to the life it represents it was long attributed to john still afterwards bishop of bath but the authorship is now definitely assigned to william stevenson132 our earliest edition of the play was printed in 1575 but a similar play called dyccon of bedlam was licensed in 1552 twelve years before shakespeares birth  to show the spirit and the metrical form of the play we give a fragment of the boys description of the dullard hodge trying to light a fire on the hearth from the cats eyes and another fragment of the old drinking song at the beginning of the second act      at last in a dark corner two sparkes he thought he sees     which were indede nought els but gyb our cats two eyes     puffe quod hodge thinking therby to have fyre without doubt     with that gyb shut her two eyes and so the fyre was out     and byandby them opened even as they were before     with that the sparkes appeared even as they had done of yore     and even as hodge blew the fire as he did thincke     gyb as she felt the blast strayghtway began to wyncke     tyll hodge fell of swering as came best to his turne     the fier was sure bewicht and therfore wold not burne     at last gyb up the stayers among the old postes and pinnes     and hodge he hied him after till broke were both his shinnes     cursynge and swering othes were never of his makyng     that gyb wold

  i am nothinge acolde     i stuffe my skyn so full within       of ioly good ale and olde     backe and syde go bare etc  our first tragedy gorboduc was written by thomas sackville and thomas norton and was acted in 1562 only two years before the birth of shakespeare it is remarkable not only as our first tragedy but as the first play to be written in blank verse the latter being most significant since it started the drama into the style of verse best suited to the genius of english playwrights  the story of gorboduc is taken from the early annals of britain and recalls the story used by shakespeare in king lear gorboduc king of britain divides his kingdom between his sons ferrex and porrex the sons quarrel and porrex the younger slays his brother who is the queens favorite videna the queen slays porrex in revenge the people rebel and slay videna and gorboduc then the nobles kill the rebels and in turn fall to fighting each other the line of brutus being extinct with the death of gorboduc the country falls into anarchy with rebels nobles and a scottish invader all fighting for the right of succession the curtain falls upon a scene of bloodshed and utter confusion  the artistic finish of this first tragedy is marred by the authors evident purpose to persuade elizabeth to marry it aims to show the danger to which england is exposed by the uncertainty of succession otherwise the plan of the play follows the classical rule of seneca there is very little action on the stage bloodshed and battle are announced by a messenger and the chorus of four old men of britain sums up the situation with a few moral observations at the end of each of the first four acts  classical influence upon the drama the revival of latin literature had a decided influence upon the english drama as it developed from the miracle plays in the fifteenth century english teachers in order to increase the interest in latin began to let their boys act the plays which they had read as literature precisely as our colleges now present greek or german plays at the yearly festivals seneca was the favorite latin author and all his tragedies were translated into english between 1559 and 1581 this was the exact period in which the first english playwrights were shaping their own ideas but the severe simplicity of the classical drama seemed at first only to hamper the exuberant english spirit to understand this one has only to compare a tragedy of seneca or of euripides with one of shakespeare and see how widely the two masters differ in methods  in the classic play the socalled dramatic unities of time place and action were strictly observed time and place must remain the same the play could represent a period of only a few hours and whatever action was introduced must take place at the spot where the play began the characters therefore must remain unchanged throughout there was no possibility of the child becoming a man or of the mans growth with changing circumstances as the play was within doors all vigorous action was deemed out of place on the stage and battles and important events were simply announced by a messenger the classic drama also drew a sharp line between tragedy and comedy all fun being rigorously excluded from serious representations  the english drama on the other hand strove to represent the whole sweep of life in a single play the scene changed rapidly the same actors appeared now at home now at court now on the battlefield and vigorous action filled the stage before the eyes of the spectators the child of one act appeared as the man of the next and the imagination of the spectator was called upon to bridge the gaps from place to place and from year to year so the dramatist had free scope to present all life in a single place and a single hour moreover since the world is always laughing and always crying at the same moment tragedy and comedy were presented side by side as they are in life itself as hamlet sings after the play that amused the court but struck the king with deadly fear      why let the stricken deer go weep     the hart ungalled play     for some must watch while some must sleep     so runs the world away  naturally with these two ideals struggling to master the english drama two schools of writers arose the university two schools wits as men of learning were called generally of drama upheld the classical ideal and ridiculed the crudeness of the new english plays sackville and norton were of this class and gorboduc was classic in its construction in the defense of poesie sidney upholds the classics and ridicules the too ambitious scope of the english drama against these were the popular playwrights lyly peele greene marlowe and many others who recognized the english love of action and disregarded the dramatic unities in their endeavor to present life as it is in the end the native drama prevailed aided by the popular taste which had been trained by four centuries of miracles our first plays especially of the romantic type were extremely crude and often led to ridiculously extravagant scenes and here is where the classic drama exercised an immense influence for good by insisting upon beauty of form and definiteness of structure at a time when the tendency was to satisfy a taste for stage spectacles without regard to either  in the year 1574 a royal permit to lord leicesters actors allowed them to give plays anywhere throughout our realm of england and this must be regarded as the beginning of the regular drama two years later the first playhouse known as the theater was built for these actors by james burbage in finsbury fields just north of london it was in this theater that shakespeare probably found employment when he first came to the city the success of this venture was immediate and the next thirty years saw a score of theatrical companies at least seven regular theaters and a dozen or more inn yards permanently fitted for the giving of playsall established in the city and its immediate suburbs the growth seems all the more remarkable when we remember that the london of those days would now be considered a small city having in 1600 only about a hundred thousand inhabitants  a dutch traveler johannes de witt who visited london in 1596 has given us the only contemporary drawing we possess of the interior of one of these theaters they were built of stone and wood round or octagonal in shape and without a roof being simply an inclosed courtyard at one side was the stage and before it on the bare ground or pit stood that large part of the audience who could afford to pay only an admission fee the players and these groundlings were exposed to the weather those that paid for seats were in galleries sheltered by a narrow porchroof projecting inwards from the encircling walls while the young nobles and gallants who came to be seen and who could afford the extra fee took seats on the stage itself and smoked and chaffed the actors and threw nuts at the groundlings133 the whole idea of these first theaters according to de witt was like that of the roman amphitheater and the resemblance was heightened by the fact that when no play was on the boards the stage might be taken away and the pit given over to bull and bear baiting  in all these theaters probably the stage consisted of a bare platform with a curtain or traverse across the middle separating the front from the rear stage on the latter unexpected scenes or characters were discovered by simply drawing the curtain aside at first little or no scenery was used a gilded sign being the only announcement of a change of scene and this very lack of scenery led to better acting since the actors must be realistic enough to make the audience forget its shabby surroundings134 by shakespeares day however painted scenery had appeared first at university plays and then in the regular theaters135 in all our first plays female parts were taken by boy actors who evidently were more distressing than the crude scenery for contemporary literature has many satirical references to their acting136 and even the tolerant shakespeare writes      some squeaking cleopatra boy my greatness  however that may be the stage was deemed unfit for women and actresses were unknown in england until after the restoration  shakespeares predecessors in the drama the english drama as it developed from the miracle plays has an interesting history it began with schoolmasters like udall who translated and adapted latin plays for their boys to act and who were naturally governed by classic ideals it was continued by the choir masters of st paul and the royal and the queens chapel whose companies of choirboy actors were famous in london and rivaled the players of the regular theaters137 these choir masters were our first stage managers they began with masques and interludes and the dramatic presentation of classic myths modeled after the italians but some of them like richard edwards choir master of the queens chapel in 1561 soon added farces from english country life and dramatized some of chaucers stories finally the regular playwrights kyd nash lyly peele greene and marlowe brought the english drama to the point where shakespeare began to experiment upon it  each of these playwrights added or emphasized some essential element in the drama which appeared later in the work of shakespeare thus john lyly 15541606 who is now known chiefly as having developed the pernicious literary style called euphuism138 is one of the most influential of the early dramatists his court comedies are remarkable for their witty dialogue and for being our first plays to aim definitely at unity and artistic finish thomas kyds spanish tragedy c 1585 first gives us the drama or rather the melodrama of passion copied by marlowe and shakespeare this was the most popular of the early elizabethan plays it was revised again and again and ben jonson is said to have written one version and to have acted the chief part of hieronimo139 and robert greene 15581592 plays the chief part in the early development of romantic comedy and gives us some excellent scenes of english country life in plays like friar bacon and friar bungay  even a brief glance at the life and work of these first playwrights shows three noteworthy things which have a bearing on shakespeares career 1 these men were usually actors as well as dramatists they knew the stage and the audience and in writing their plays they remembered not only the actors part but also the audiences love for stories and brave spectacles will it act well and will it please our audience were the questions of chief concern to our early dramatists 2 their training began as actors then they revised old plays and finally became independent writers in this their work shows an exact parallel with that of shakespeare 3 they often worked together probably as shakespeare worked with marlowe and fletcher either in revising old plays or in creating new ones they had a common store of material from which they derived their stories and characters hence their frequent repetition of names and they often produced two or more plays on the same subject much of shakespeares work depends as we shall see on previous plays and even his hamlet uses the material of an earlier play of the same name probably by kyd which was well known to the london stage in 1589 some twelve years before shakespeares great work was written  all these things are significant if we are to understand the elizabethan drama and the man who brought it to perfection shakespeare was not simply a great genius he was also a great worker and he developed in exactly the same way as did all his fellow craftsmen and contrary to the prevalent opinion the elizabethan drama is not a minervalike creation springing full grown from the head of one man it is rather an orderly though rapid development in which many men bore a part all our early dramatists are worthy of study for the part they played in the development of the drama but we can here consider only one the most typical of all whose best work is often ranked with that of shakespeare   christopher marlowe 15641593  marlowe is one of the most suggestive figures of the english renaissance and the greatest of shakespeares predecessors the glory of the elizabethan drama dates from his tamburlaine 1587 wherein the whole restless temper of the age finds expression      nature that framed us of four elements     warring within our breasts for regiment     doth teach us all to have aspiring minds     our soulswhose faculties can comprehend     the wondrous architecture of the world     and measure every wandering planets course     still climbing after knowledge infinite     and always moving as the restless spheres     will us to wear ourselves and never rest     tamburlaine pt i ii vii  life marlowe was born in canterbury only a few months before shakespeare he was the son of a poor shoemaker but through the kindness of a patron was educated at the town grammar school and then at cambridge when he came to london c 1584 his soul was surging with the ideals of the renaissance which later found expression in faustus the scholar longing for unlimited knowledge and for power to grasp the universe unfortunately marlowe had also the unbridled passions which mark the early or pagan renaissance as taine calls it and the conceit of a young man just entering the realms of knowledge he became an actor and lived in a lowtavern atmosphere of excess and wretchedness in 1587 when but twentythree years old he produced tamburlaine which brought him instant recognition thereafter notwithstanding his wretched life he holds steadily to a high literary purpose though all his plays abound in violence no doubt reflecting many of the violent scenes in which he lived he develops his mighty line and depicts great scenes in magnificent bursts of poetry such as the stage had never heard before in five years while shakespeare was serving his apprenticeship marlowe produced all his great work then he was stabbed in a drunken brawl and died wretchedly as he had lived the epilogue of faustus might be written across his tombstone      cut is the branch that might have grown full straight     and burned is apollos laurel bough     that sometime grew within this learnéd man  marlowes works in addition to the poem hero and leander to which we have referred140 marlowe is famous for four dramas now known as the marlowesque or oneman type of tragedy each revolving about one central personality who is consumed by the lust of power the first of these is tamburlaine the story of timur the tartar timur begins as a shepherd chief who first rebels and then triumphs over the persian king intoxicated by his success timur rushes like a tempest over the whole east seated on his chariot drawn by captive kings with a caged emperor before him he boasts of his power which overrides all things then afflicted with disease he raves against the gods and would overthrow them as he has overthrown earthly rulers tamburlaine is an epic rather than a drama but one can understand its instant success with a people only half civilized fond of military glory and the instant adoption of its mighty line as the instrument of all dramatic expression  faustus the second play is one of the best of marlowes works141 the story is that of a scholar who longs for infinite knowledge and who turns from theology philosophy medicine and law the four sciences of the time to the study of magic much as a child might turn from jewels to tinsel and colored paper in order to learn magic he sells himself to the devil on condition that he shall have twentyfour years of absolute power and knowledge the play is the story of those twentyfour years like tamburlaine it is lacking in dramatic construction142 but has an unusual number of passages of rare poetic beauty miltons satan suggests strongly that the author of paradise lost had access to faustus and used it as he may also have used tamburlaine for the magnificent panorama displayed by satan in paradise regained for instance more than fifty years before miltons hero says which way i turn is hell myself am hell marlowe had written      faust how comes it then that thou art out of hell     mephisto why this is hell nor am i out of it                                                 hell hath no limits nor is circumscribed         in one self place for where we are is hell         and where hell is there must we ever be  marlowes third play is the jew of malta a study of the lust for wealth which centers about barabas a terrible old money lender strongly suggestive of shylock in the merchant of venice the first part of the play is well constructed showing a decided advance but the last part is an accumulation of melodramatic horrors barabas is checked in his murderous career by falling into a boiling caldron which he had prepared for another and dies blaspheming his only regret being that he has not done more evil in his life  marlowes last play is edward ii a tragic study of a kings weakness and misery in point of style and dramatic construction it is by far the best of marlowes plays and is a worthy predecessor of shakespeares historical drama  marlowe is the only dramatist of the time who is ever compared with shakespeare143 when we remember that he died at twentynine probably before shakespeare had produced a single great play we must wonder what he might have done had he outlived his wretched youth and become a man here and there his work is remarkable for its splendid imagination for the stateliness of its verse and for its rare bits of poetic beauty but in dramatic instinct in wide knowledge of human life in humor in delineation of womans character in the delicate fancy which presents an ariel as perfectly as a macbethin a word in all that makes a dramatic genius shakespeare stands alone marlowe simply prepared the way for the master who was to follow  variety of the early drama the thirty years between our first regular english plays and shakespeares first comedy144 witnessed a development of the drama which astonishes us both by its rapidity and variety we shall better appreciate shakespeares work if we glance for a moment at the plays that preceded him and note how he covers the whole field and writes almost every form and variety of the drama known to his age  first in importance or at least in popular interest are the new chronicle plays founded upon historical events and characters they show the strong national spirit of the elizabethan age and their popularity was due largely to the fact that audiences came to the theaters partly to gratify their awakened national spirit and to get their first knowledge of national history some of the moralities like bayles king johan 1538 are crude chronicle plays and the early robin hood plays and the first tragedy gorboduc show the same awakened popular interest in english history during the reign of elizabeth the popular chronicle plays increased till we have the record of over two hundred and twenty half of which are still extant dealing with almost every important character real or legendary in english history of shakespeares thirtyseven dramas ten are true chronicle plays of english kings three are from the legendary annals of britain and three more are from the history of other nations  other types of the early drama are less clearly defined but we may sum them up under a few general heads 1 the domestic drama began with crude home scenes introduced into the miracles and developed in a score of different ways from the coarse humor of gammer gurtons needle to the comedy of manners of jonson and the later dramatists shakespeares taming of the shrew and merry wives of windsor belong to this class 2 the socalled court comedy is the opposite of the former in that it represented a different kind of life and was intended for a different audience it was marked by elaborate dialogue by jests retorts and endless plays on words rather than by action it was made popular by lylys success and was imitated in shakespeares first or lylian comedies such as loves labours lost and the complicated two gentlemen of verona 3 romantic comedy and romantic tragedy suggest the most artistic and finished types of the drama which were experimented upon by peele greene and marlowe and were brought to perfection in the merchant of venice romeo and juliet and the tempest 4 in addition to the above types were several othersthe classical plays modeled upon seneca and favored by cultivated audiences the melodrama favorite of the groundlings which depended not on plot or characters but upon a variety of striking scenes and incidents and the tragedy of blood always more or less melodramatic like kyds spanish tragedy which grew more bloodandthundery in marlowe and reached a climax of horrors in shakespeares titus andronicus it is noteworthy that hamlet lear and macbeth all belong to this class but the developed genius of the author raised them to a height such as the tragedy of blood had never known before  these varied types are quite enough to show with what doubtful and unguided experiments our first dramatists were engaged like men first setting out in rafts and dugouts on an unknown sea they are the more interesting when we remember that shakespeare tried them all that he is the only dramatist whose plays cover the whole range of the drama from its beginning to its decline from the stage spectacle he developed the drama of human life and instead of the doggerel and bombast of our first plays he gives us the poetry of romeo and juliet and midsummer nights dream in a word shakespeare brought order out of dramatic chaos in a few short years he raised the drama from a blundering experiment to a perfection of form and expression which has never since been rivaled   iv shakespeare  one who reads a few of shakespeares great plays and then the meager story of his life is generally filled with a vague wonder here is an unknown country boy poor and poorly educated according to the standards of his age who arrives at the great city of london and goes to work at odd jobs in a theater in a year or two he is associated with scholars and dramatists the masters of their age writing plays of kings and clowns of gentlemen and heroes and noble women all of whose lives he seems to know by intimate association in a few years more he leads all that brilliant group of poets and dramatists who have given undying glory to the age of elizabeth play after play runs from his pen mighty dramas of human life and character following one another so rapidly that good work seems impossible yet they stand the test of time and their poetry is still unrivaled in any language for all this great work the author apparently cares little since he makes no attempt to collect or preserve his writings a thousand scholars have ever since been busy collecting identifying classifying the works which this magnificent workman tossed aside so carelessly when he abandoned the drama and retired to his native village he has a marvelously imaginative and creative mind but he invents few if any new plots or stories he simply takes an old play or an old poem makes it over quickly and lo this old familiar material glows with the deepest thoughts and the tenderest feelings that ennoble our humanity and each new generation of men finds it more wonderful than the last how did he do it that is still an unanswered question and the source of our wonder  there are in general two theories to account for shakespeare the romantic school of writers have always held that in him all came from within that his genius was his sufficient guide and that to the overmastering power of his genius alone we owe all his great works practical unimaginative men on the other hand assert that in shakespeare all came from without and that we must study his environment rather than his genius if we are to understand him he lived in a playloving age he studied the crowds gave them what they wanted and simply reflected their own thoughts and feelings in reflecting the english crowd about him he unconsciously reflected all crowds which are alike in all ages hence his continued popularity and in being guided by public sentiment he was not singular but followed the plain path that every good dramatist has always followed to success  probably the truth of the matter is to be found somewhere between these two extremes of his great genius there can be no question but there are other things to consider as we have already noticed shakespeare was trained like his fellow workmen first as an actor second as a reviser of old plays and last as an independent dramatist he worked with other playwrights and learned their secret like them he studied and followed the public taste and his work indicates at least three stages from his first somewhat crude experiments to his finished masterpieces so it would seem that in shakespeare we have the result of hard work and of orderly human development quite as much as of transcendent genius  life 15641616 two outward influences were powerful in developing the genius of shakespearethe little village of stratford center of the most beautiful and romantic district in rural england and the great city of london the center of the worlds political activity in one he learned to know the natural man in his natural environment in the other the social the artificial man in the most unnatural of surroundings  from the register of the little parish church at stratfordonavon we learn that william shakespeare was baptized there on the twentysixth of april 1564 old style as it was customary to baptize children on the third day after birth the twentythird of april may 3 according to our present calendar is generally accepted as the poets birthday  his father john shakespeare was a farmers son from the neighboring village of snitterfield who came to stratford about 1551 and began to prosper as a trader in corn meat leather and other agricultural products his mother mary arden was the daughter of a prosperous farmer descended from an old warwickshire family of mixed anglosaxon and norman blood in 1559 this married couple sold a piece of land and the document is signed the marke  of john shacksper the marke  of mary shacksper and from this it has been generally inferred that like the vast majority of their countrymen neither of the poets parents could read or write this was probably true of his mother but the evidence from stratford documents now indicates that his father could write and that he also audited the town accounts though in attesting documents he sometimes made a mark leaving his name to be filled in by the one who drew up the document  of shakespeares education we know little except that for a few years he probably attended the endowed grammar school at stratford where he picked up the small latin and less greek to which his learned friend ben jonson refers his real teachers meanwhile were the men and women and the natural influences which surrounded him stratford is a charming little village in beautiful warwickshire and near at hand were the forest of arden the old castles of warwick and kenilworth and the old roman camps and military roads to appeal powerfully to the boys lively imagination every phase of the natural beauty of this exquisite region is reflected in shakespeares poetry just as his characters reflect the nobility and the littleness the gossip vices emotions prejudices and traditions of the people about him      i saw a smith stand with his hammer thus     the whilst his iron did on the anvil cool     with open mouth swallowing a tailors news     who with his shears and measure in his hand     standing on slippers which his nimble haste     had falsely thrust upon contrary feet     told of a many thousand warlike french     that were embattailed and ranked in kent145  such passages suggest not only genius but also a keen sympathetic observer whose eyes see every significant detail so with the nurse in romeo and juliet whose endless gossip and vulgarity cannot quite hide a kind heart she is simply the reflection of some forgotten nurse with whom shakespeare had talked by the wayside  not only the gossip but also the dreams the unconscious poetry that sleeps in the heart of the common people appeal tremendously to shakespeares imagination and are reflected in his greatest plays othello tries to tell a curt soldiers story of his love but the account is like a bit of mandevilles famous travels teeming with the fancies that filled mens heads when the great round world was first brought to their attention by daring explorers here is a bit of folklore touched by shakespeares exquisite fancy which shows what one boy listened to before the fire at halloween                                 she comes     in shape no bigger than an agatestone     on the forefinger of an alderman     drawn with a team of little atomies     athwart mens noses as they lie asleep     her waggonspokes made of long spinners legs     the cover of the wings of grasshoppers     the traces of the smallest spiders web     the collars of the moonshines watery beams     her whip of crickets bone the lash of film     her waggoner a small greycoated gnat                                             her chariot is an empty hazel nut     made by the joiner squirrel or old grub     time out o mind the fairies coachmakers     and in this state she gallops night by night     through lovers brains and then they dream of love                                             oer lawyers fingers who straight dream on fees     oer ladies lips who straight on kisses dream146  so with shakespeares education at the hands of nature which came from keeping his heart as well as his eyes wide open to the beauty of the world he speaks of a horse and we know the fine points of a thoroughbred he mentions the dukes hounds and we hear them clamoring on a fox trail their voices matched like bells in the frosty air he stops for an instant in the sweep of a tragedy to note a flower a star a moonlit bank a hilltop touched by the sunrise and instantly we know what our own hearts felt but could not quite express when we saw the same thing because he notes and remembers every significant thing in the changing panorama of earth and sky no other writer has ever approached him in the perfect natural setting of his characters  when shakespeare was about fourteen years old his father lost his little property and fell into debt and the boy probably left school to help support the family of younger children what occupation he followed for the next eight years is a matter of conjecture from evidence found in his plays it is alleged with some show of authority that he was a country schoolmaster and a lawyers clerk the character of holofernes in loves labours lost being the warrant for one and shakespeares knowledge of law terms for the other but if we take such evidence then shakespeare must have been a botanist because of his knowledge of wild flowers a sailor because he knows the ropes a courtier because of his extraordinary facility in quips and compliments and courtly language a clown because none other is so dull and foolish a king because richard and henry are true to life a woman because he has sounded the depths of a womans feelings and surely a roman because in coriolanus and julius cæsar he has shown us the roman spirit better than have the roman writers themselves he was everything in his imagination and it is impossible from a study of his scenes and characters to form a definite opinion as to his early occupation  in 1582 shakespeare was married to anne hathaway the daughter of a peasant family of shottery who was eight years older than her boy husband from numerous sarcastic references to marriage made by the characters in his plays and from the fact that he soon left his wife and family and went to london it is generally alleged that the marriage was a hasty and unhappy one but here again the evidence is entirely untrustworthy in many miracles as well as in later plays it was customary to depict the seamy side of domestic life for the amusement of the crowd and shakespeare may have followed the public taste in this as he did in other things the references to love and home and quiet joys in shakespeares plays are enough if we take such evidence to establish firmly the opposite supposition that his love was a very happy one and the fact that after his enormous success in london he retired to stratford to live quietly with his wife and daughters tends to the same conclusion  about the year 1587 shakespeare left his family and went to london and joined himself to burbages company of players a persistent tradition says that he had incurred the anger of sir thomas lucy first by poaching deer in that noblemans park and then when haled before a magistrate by writing a scurrilous ballad about sir thomas which so aroused the old gentlemans ire that shakespeare was obliged to flee the country an old record147 says that the poet was much given to all unluckiness in stealing venison and rabbits the unluckiness probably consisting in getting caught himself and not in any lack of luck in catching the rabbits the ridicule heaped upon the lucy family in henry iv and the merry wives of windsor gives some weight to this tradition nicholas rowe who published the first life of shakespeare148 is the authority for this story but there is some reason to doubt whether at the time when shakespeare is said to have poached in the deer park of sir thomas lucy at charlescote there were any deer or park at the place referred to the subject is worthy of some scant attention if only to show how worthless is the attempt to construct out of rumor the story of a great life which fortunately perhaps had no contemporary biographer  of his life in london from 1587 to 1611 the period of his greatest literary activity we know nothing definitely we can judge only from his plays and from these it is evident that he entered into the stirring life of englands capital with the same perfect sympathy and understanding that marked him among the plain people of his native warwickshire the first authentic reference to him is in 1592 when greenes149 bitter attack appeared showing plainly that shakespeare had in five years assumed an important position among playwrights then appeared the apology of the publishers of greenes pamphlet with their tribute to the poets sterling character and occasional literary references which show that he was known among his fellows as the gentle shakespeare ben jonson says of him i loved the man and do honor his memory on this side idolatry as much as any he was indeed honest and of an open and free nature to judge from only three of his earliest plays150 it would seem reasonably evident that in the first five years of his london life he had gained entrance to the society of gentlemen and scholars had caught their characteristic mannerisms and expressions and so was ready by knowledge and observation as well as by genius to weave into his dramas the whole stirring life of the english people the plays themselves with the testimony of contemporaries and his business success are strong evidence against the tradition that his life in london was wild and dissolute like that of the typical actor and playwright of his time  shakespeares first work may well have been that of a general helper an oddjob man about the theater but he soon became an actor and the records of the old london theaters show that in the next ten years he gained a prominent place though there is little reason to believe that he was counted among the stars within two years he was at work on plays and his course here was exactly like that of other playwrights of his time he worked with other men and he revised old plays before writing his own and so gained a practical knowledge of his art henry vi c 15901591 is an example of this tinkering work in which however his native power is unmistakably manifest the three parts of henry vi and richard iii which belongs with them are a succession of scenes from english chronicle history strung together very loosely and only in the last is there any definite attempt at unity that he soon fell under marlowes influence is evident from the atrocities and bombast of titus andronicus and richard iii the former may have been written by both playwrights in collaboration or may be one of marlowes horrors left unfinished by his early death and brought to an end by shakespeare he soon broke away from this apprentice work and then appeared in rapid succession loves labours lost comedy of errors two gentlemen of verona the first english chronicle plays151 a midsummer nights dream and romeo and juliet this order is more or less conjectural but the wide variety of these plays as well as their unevenness and frequent crudities marks the first or experimental stage of shakespeares work it is as if the author were trying his power or more likely trying the temper of his audience for it must be remembered that to please his audience was probably the ruling motive of shakespeare as of the other early dramatists during the most vigorous and prolific period of his career  shakespeares poems rather than his dramatic work mark the beginning of his success venus and adonis became immensely popular in london and its dedication to the earl of southampton brought according to tradition a substantial money gift which may have laid the foundation for shakespeares business success he appears to have shrewdly invested his money and soon became part owner of the globe and blackfriars theaters in which his plays were presented by his own companies his success and popularity grew amazingly within a decade of his unnoticed arrival in london he was one of the most famous actors and literary men in england  following his experimental work there came a succession of wonderful playsmerchant of venice as you like it twelfth night julius cæsar hamlet macbeth othello king lear antony and cleopatra the great tragedies of this period are associated with a period of gloom and sorrow in the poets life but of its cause we have no knowledge it may have been this unknown sorrow which turned his thoughts back to stratford and caused apparently a dissatisfaction with his work and profession but the latter is generally attributed to other causes actors and playwrights were in his day generally looked upon with suspicion or contempt and shakespeare even in the midst of success seems to have looked forward to the time when he could retire to stratford to live the life of a farmer and country gentleman his own and his fathers families were first released from debt then in 1597 he bought new place the finest house in stratford and soon added a tract of farming land to complete his estate his profession may have prevented his acquiring the title of gentleman or he may have only followed a custom of the time152 when he applied for and obtained a coat of arms for his father and so indirectly secured the title by inheritance his home visits grew more and more frequent till about the year 1611 he left london and retired permanently to stratford  though still in the prime of life shakespeare soon abandoned his dramatic work for the comfortable life of a country gentleman of his later plays coriolanus cymbeline winters tale and pericles show a decided falling off from his previous work and indicate another period of experimentation this time not to test his own powers but to catch the fickle humor of the public as is usually the case with a theatergoing people they soon turned from serious drama to sentimental or more questionable spectacles and with fletcher who worked with shakespeare and succeeded him as the first playwright of london the decline of the drama had already begun in 1609 however occurred an event which gave shakespeare his chance for a farewell to the public an english ship disappeared and all on board were given up for lost a year later the sailors returned home and their arrival created intense excitement they had been wrecked on the unknown bermudas and had lived there for ten months terrified by mysterious noises which they thought came from spirits and devils five different accounts of this fascinating shipwreck were published and the bermudas became known as the ile of divels shakespeare took this storywhich caused as much popular interest as that later shipwreck which gave us robinson crusoeand wove it into the tempest in the same year 1611 he probably sold his interest in the globe and blackfriars theaters and his dramatic work was ended a few plays were probably left unfinished153 and were turned over to fletcher and other dramatists  that shakespeare thought little of his success and had no idea that his dramas were the greatest that the world ever produced seems evident from the fact that he made no attempt to collect or publish his works or even to save his manuscripts which were carelessly left to stage managers of the theaters and so found their way ultimately to the ragman after a few years of quiet life of which we have less record than of hundreds of simple country gentlemen of the time shakespeare died on the probable anniversary of his birth april 23 1616 he was given a tomb in the chancel of the parish church not because of his preëminence in literature but because of his interest in the affairs of a country village and in the sad irony of fate the broad stone that covered his tombnow an object of veneration to the thousands that yearly visit the little churchwas inscribed as follows      good friend for jesus sake forbeare     to dig the dust enclosed heare     bleste be the man that spares these stones     and curst be he that moves my bones  this wretched doggerel over the worlds greatest poet was intended no doubt as a warning to some stupid sexton lest he should empty the grave and give the honored place to some amiable gentleman who had given more tithes to the parish  works of shakespeare at the time of shakespeares death twentyone plays existed in manuscripts in the various theaters a few others had already been printed in quarto form and the latter are the only publications that could possibly have met with the poets own approval more probably they were taken down in shorthand by some listener at the play and then pirated by some publisher for his own profit the first printed collection of his plays now called the first folio 1623 was made by two actors heming and condell who asserted that they had access to the papers of the poet and had made a perfect edition in order to keep the memory of so worthy a friend and fellow alive this contains thirtysix of the thirtyseven plays generally attributed to shakespeare pericles being omitted this celebrated first folio was printed from playhouse manuscripts and from printed quartos containing many notes and changes by individual actors and stage managers moreover it was full of typographical errors though the editors alleged great care and accuracy and so though it is the only authoritative edition we have it is of little value in determining the dates or the classification of the plays as they existed in shakespeares mind  notwithstanding this uncertainty a careful reading of the plays and poems leaves us with an impression of four different periods of work probably corresponding with the growth and experience of the poets life these are 1 a period of early experimentation it is marked by youthfulness and exuberance of imagination by extravagance of language and by the frequent use of rimed couplets with his blank verse the period dates from his arrival in london to 1595 typical works of this first period are his early poems loves labours lost two gentlemen of verona and richard iii 2 a period of rapid growth and development from 1595 to 1600 such plays as the merchant of venice midsummer nights dream as you like it and henry iv all written in this period show more careful and artistic work better plots and a marked increase in knowledge of human nature 3 a period of gloom and depression from 1600 to 1607 which marks the full maturity of his powers what caused this evident sadness is unknown but it is generally attributed to some personal experience coupled with the political misfortunes of his friends essex and southampton the sonnets with their note of personal disappointment twelfth night which is shakespeares farewell to mirth and his great tragedies hamlet lear macbeth othello and julius cæsar belong to this period 4 a period of restored serenity of calm after storm which marked the last years of the poets literary work the winters tale and the tempest are the best of his later plays but they all show a falling off from his previous work and indicate a second period of experimentation with the taste of a fickle public  to read in succession four plays taking a typical work from each of the above periods is one of the very best ways of getting quickly at the real life and mind of shakespeare following is a complete list with the approximate dates of his works classified according to the above four periods  first period early experiment venus and adonis rape of lucrece 1594 titus andronicus henry vi three parts 15901591 loves labours lost 1590 comedy of errors two gentlemen of verona 15911592 richardiii 1593 richard ii king john 15941595  second period development romeo and juliet midsummer nights dream 1595 merchant of venice henry iv first part 1596 henry iv second part merry wives of windsor 1597 much ado about nothing 1598 as you like it henry v 1599  third period maturity and gloom sonnets 1600 twelfth night 1600 taming of the shrew julius cæsar hamlet troilus and cressida 16011602 alls well that ends well measure for measure 1603 othello 1604 king lear 1605 macbeth 1606 antony and cleopatra timon of athens 1607  fourth period late experiment coriolanus pericles 1608 cymbeline 1609 winters tale 16101611 the tempest 1611 henry viii unfinished  classification according to source in history legend and story shakespeare found the material for nearly all his dramas and so they are often divided into three classes called historical plays like richard iii and henry v legendary or partly historical plays like macbeth king lear and julius cæsar and fictional plays like romeo and juliet and the merchant of venice shakespeare invented few if any of the plots or stories upon which his dramas are founded but borrowed them freely after the custom of his age wherever he found them for his legendary and historical material he depended largely on holinsheds chronicles of england scotland and ireland and on norths translation of plutarchs famous lives  a full half of his plays are fictional and in these he used the most popular romances of the day seeming to depend most on the italian storytellers only two or three of his plots as in loves labours lost and merry wives of windsor are said to be original and even these are doubtful occasionally shakespeare made over an older play as in henry vi comedy of errors and hamlet and in one instance at least he seized upon an incident of shipwreck in which london was greatly interested and made out of it the original and fascinating play of the tempest in much the same spirit which leads our modern playwrights when they dramatize a popular novel or a war story to catch the public fancy  classification according to dramatic type shakespeares dramas are usually divided into three classes called tragedies comedies and historical plays strictly speaking the drama has but two divisions tragedy and comedy in which are included the many subordinate forms of tragicomedy melodrama lyric drama opera farce etc a tragedy is a drama in which the principal characters are involved in desperate circumstances or led by overwhelming passions it is invariably serious and dignified the movement is always stately but grows more and more rapid as it approaches the climax and the end is always calamitous resulting in death or dire misfortune to the principals as chaucers monk says before he begins to biwayle in maner of tragedie      tragedie is to seyn a certeyn storie     of him that stood in great prosperitee     and is yfallen out of heigh degree     into miserie and endeth wrecchedly  a comedy on the other hand is a drama in which the characters are placed in more or less humorous situations the movement is light and often mirthful and the play ends in general good will and happiness the historical drama aims to present some historical age or character and may be either a comedy or a tragedy the following list includes the best of shakespeares plays in each of the three classes but the order indicates merely the authors personal opinion of the relative merits of the plays in each class thus merchant of venice would be the first of the comedies for the beginner to read and julius cæsar is an excellent introduction to the historical plays and the tragedies  comedies merchant of venice midsummer nights dream as you like it winters tale the tempest twelfth night  tragedies romeo and juliet macbeth hamlet king lear othello  historical plays julius cæsar richard iii henry iv henry v coriolanus antony and cleopatra  doubtful plays it is reasonably certain that some of the plays generally attributed to shakespeare are partly the work of other dramatists the first of these doubtful plays often called the preshakespearian group are titus andronicus and the first part of henry vi shakespeare probably worked with marlowe in the two last parts of henry vi and in richard iii the three plays taming of the shrew timon and pericles are only partly shakespeares work but the other authors are unknown henry viii is the work of fletcher and shakespeare opinion being divided as to whether shakespeare helped fletcher or whether it was an unfinished work of shakespeare which was put into fletchers hands for completion two noble kinsmen is a play not ordinarily found in editions of shakespeare but it is often placed among his doubtful works the greater part of the play is undoubtedly by fletcher edward iii is one of several crude plays published at first anonymously and later attributed to shakespeare by publishers who desired to sell their wares it contains a few passages that strongly suggest shakespeare but the external evidence is all against his authorship  shakespeares poems it is generally asserted that if shakespeare had written no plays his poems alone would have given him a commanding place in the elizabethan age nevertheless in the various histories of our literature there is apparent a desire to praise and pass over all but the sonnets as rapidly as possible and the reason may be stated frankly his two long poems venus and adonis and the rape of lucrece contain much poetic fancy but it must be said of both that the subjects are unpleasant and that they are dragged out to unnecessary length in order to show the play of youthful imagination they were extremely popular in shakespeares day but in comparison with his great dramatic works these poems are now of minor importance  shakespeares sonnets one hundred and fiftyfour in number are the only direct expression of the poets own feelings that we possess for his plays are the most impersonal in all literature they were published together in 1609 but if they had any unity in shakespeares mind their plan and purpose are hard to discover by some critics they are regarded as mere literary exercises by others as the expression of some personal grief during the third period of the poets literary career still others taking a hint from the sonnet beginning two loves i have of comfort and despair divide them all into two classes addressed to a man who was shakespeares friend and to a woman who disdained his love the reader may well avoid such classifications and read a few sonnets like the twenty ninth for instance and let them speak their own message a few are trivial and artificial enough suggesting the elaborate exercises of a piano player but the majority are remarkable for their subtle thought and exquisite expression here and there is one like that beginning      when to the sessions of sweet silent thought     i summon up remembrance of things past  which will haunt the reader long afterwards like the remembrance of an old german melody  shakespeares place and influence shakespeare holds by general acclamation the foremost place in the worlds literature and his overwhelming greatness renders it difficult to criticise or even to praise him two poets only homer and dante have been named with him but each of these wrote within narrow limits while shakespeares genius included all the world of nature and of men in a word he is the universal poet to study nature in his works is like exploring a new and beautiful country to study man in his works is like going into a great city viewing the motley crowd as one views a great masquerade in which past and present mingle freely and familiarly as if the dead were all living again and the marvelous thing in this masquerade of all sorts and conditions of men is that shakespeare lifts the mask from every face lets us see the man as he is in his own soul and shows us in each one some germ of good some soul of goodness even in things evil for shakespeare strikes no uncertain note and raises no doubts to add to the burden of your own good always overcomes evil in the long run and love faith work and duty are the four elements that in all ages make the world right to criticise or praise the genius that creates these men and women is to criticise or praise humanity itself  of his influence in literature it is equally difficult to speak goethe expresses the common literary judgment when he says i do not remember that any book or person or event in my life ever made so great an impression upon me as the plays of shakespeare his influence upon our own language and thought is beyond calculation shakespeare and the king james bible are the two great conservators of the english speech and one who habitually reads them finds himself possessed of a style and vocabulary that are beyond criticism even those who read no shakespeare are still unconsciously guided by him for his thought and expression have so pervaded our life and literature that it is impossible so long as one speaks the english language to escape his influence      his life was gentle and the elements     so mixed in him that nature might stand up     and say to all the world this was a man   v shakespeares contemporaries and successors in the drama  decline of the drama it was inevitable that the drama should decline after shakespeare for the simple reason that there was no other great enough to fill his place aside from this other causes were at work and the chief of these was at the very source of the elizabethan dramas it must be remembered that our first playwrights wrote to please their audiences that the drama rose in england because of the desire of a patriotic people to see something of the stirring life of the times reflected on the stage for there were no papers or magazines in those days and people came to the theaters not only to be amused but to be informed like children they wanted to see a story acted and like men they wanted to know what it meant shakespeare fulfilled their desire he gave them their story and his genius was great enough to show in every play not only their own life and passions but something of the meaning of all life and of that eternal justice which uses the war of human passions for its own great ends thus good and evil mingle freely in his dramas but the evil is never attractive and the good triumphs as inevitably as fate though his language is sometimes coarse we are to remember that it was the custom of his age to speak somewhat coarsely and that in language as in thought and feeling shakespeare is far above most of his contemporaries  with his successors all this was changed the audience itself had gradually changed and in place of plain people eager for a story and for information we see a larger and larger proportion of those who went to the play because they had nothing else to do they wanted amusement only and since they had blunted by idleness the desire for simple and wholesome amusement they called for something more sensational shakespeares successors catered to the depraved tastes of this new audience they lacked not only shakespeares genius but his broad charity his moral insight into life with the exception of ben jonson they neglected the simple fact that man in his deepest nature is a moral being and that only a play which satisfies the whole nature of man by showing the triumph of the moral law can ever wholly satisfy an audience or a people beaumont and fletcher forgetting the deep meaning of life strove for effect by increasing the sensationalism of their plays webster reveled in tragedies of blood and thunder massinger and ford made another step downward producing evil and licentious scenes for their own sake making characters and situations more immoral till notwithstanding these dramatists ability the stage had become insincere frivolous and bad ben jonsons ode come leave the loathed stage is the judgment of a large and honest nature grown weary of the plays and the players of the time we read with a sense of relief that in 1642 only twentysix years after shakespeares death both houses of parliament voted to close the theaters as breeders of lies and immorality   ben jonson 15731637  personally jonson is the most commanding literary figure among the elizabethans for twentyfive years he was the literary dictator of london the chief of all the wits that gathered nightly at the old devil tavern with his great learning his ability and his commanding position as poet laureate he set himself squarely against his contemporaries and the romantic tendency of the age for two things he fought bravelyto restore the classic form of the drama and to keep the stage from its downward course apparently he failed the romantic school fixed its hold more strongly than ever the stage went swiftly to an end as sad as that of the early dramatists nevertheless his influence lived and grew more powerful till aided largely by french influence it resulted in the socalled classicism of the eighteenth century  life jonson was born at westminster about the year 1573 his father an educated gentleman had his property confiscated and was himself thrown into prison by queen mary so we infer the family was of some prominence from his mother he received certain strong characteristics and by a single short reference in jonsons works we are led to see the kind of woman she was it is while jonson is telling drummond of the occasion when he was thrown into prison because some passages in the comedy of eastward ho gave offense to king james and he was in danger of a horrible death after having his ears and nose cut off he tells us how after his pardon he was banqueting with his friends when his old mother came in and showed a paper full of lusty strong poison which she intended to mix with his drink just before the execution and to show that she was no churl she intended first to drink of the poison herself the incident is all the more suggestive from the fact that chapman and marston one his friend and the other his enemy were first cast into prison as the authors of eastward ho and rough ben jonson at once declared that he too had had a small hand in the writing and went to join them in prison  jonsons father came out of prison having given up his estate and became a minister he died just before the sons birth and two years later the mother married a bricklayer of london the boy was sent to a private school and later made his own way to westminster school where the submaster camden struck by the boys ability taught and largely supported him for a short time he may have studied at the university in cambridge but his stepfather soon set him to learning the bricklayers trade he ran away from this and went with the english army to fight spaniards in the low countries his best known exploit there was to fight a duel between the lines with one of the enemys soldiers while both armies looked on jonson killed his man and took his arms and made his way back to his own lines in a way to delight the old norman troubadours he soon returned to england and married precipitately when only nineteen or twenty years old five years later we find him employed like shakespeare as actor and reviser of old plays in the theater thereafter his life is a varied and stormy one he killed an actor in a duel and only escaped hanging by pleading benefit of clergy154 but he lost all his poor goods and was branded for life on his left thumb in his first great play every man in his humour 1598 shakespeare acted one of the parts and that may have been the beginning of their long friendship other plays followed rapidly upon the accession of james jonsons masques won him royal favor and he was made poet laureate he now became undoubted leader of the literary men of his time though his rough honesty and his hatred of the literary tendencies of the age made him quarrel with nearly all of them in 1616 soon after shakespeares retirement he stopped writing for the stage and gave himself up to study and serious work in 1618 he traveled on foot to scotland where he visited drummond from whom we have the scant records of his varied life his impressions of this journey called foot pilgrimage were lost in a fire before publication thereafter he produced less and his work declined in vigor but spite of growing poverty and infirmity we notice in his later work especially in the unfinished sad shepherd a certain mellowness and tender human sympathy which were lacking in his earlier productions he died poverty stricken in 1637 unlike shakespeares his death was mourned as a national calamity and he was buried with all honor in westminster abbey on his grave was laid a marble slab on which the words o rare ben jonson were his sufficient epitaph  works of ben jonson jonsons work is in strong contrast with that of shakespeare and of the later elizabethan dramatists alone he fought against the romantic tendency of the age and to restore the classic standards thus the whole action of his drama usually covers only a few hours or a single day he never takes liberties with historical facts as shakespeare does but is accurate to the smallest detail his dramas abound in classical learning are carefully and logically constructed and comedy and tragedy are kept apart instead of crowding each other as they do in shakespeare and in life in one respect his comedies are worthy of careful readingthey are intensely realistic presenting men and women of the time exactly as they were from a few of jonsons scenes we can understandbetter than from all the plays of shakespearehow men talked and acted during the age of elizabeth  jonsons first comedy every man in his humour is a key to all his dramas the word humour in his age stood for some characteristic whim or quality of society jonson gives to his leading character some prominent humor exaggerates it as the cartoonist enlarges the most characteristic feature of a face and so holds it before our attention that all other qualities are lost sight of which is the method that dickens used later in many of his novels every man in his humour was the first of three satires its special aim was to ridicule the humors of the city the second cynthias revels satirizes the humors of the court while the third the poetaster the result of a quarrel with his contemporaries was leveled at the false standards of the poets of the age  the three best known of jonsons comedies are volpone or the fox the alchemist and epicoene or the silent woman volpone is a keen and merciless analysis of a man governed by an overwhelming love of money for its own sake the first words in the first scene are a key to the whole comedy      volpone         good morning to the day and next my gold         open the shrine that i may see my saint             mosca withdraws a curtain and discovers piles of              gold plate jewels etc         hail the worlds soul and mine  volpones method of increasing his wealth is to play upon the avarice of men he pretends to be at the point of death and his suitors who know his love of gain and that he has no heirs endeavor hypocritically to sweeten his last moments by giving him rich presents so that he will leave them all his wealth the intrigues of these suitors furnish the story of the play and show to what infamous depths avarice will lead a man  the alchemist is a study of quackery on one side and of gullibility on the other founded on the mediæval idea of the philosophers stone155 and applies as well to the patent medicines and getrichquick schemes of our day as to the peculiar forms of quackery with which jonson was more familiar in plot and artistic construction the alchemist is an almost perfect specimen of the best english drama it has some remarkably good passages and is the most readable of jonsons plays  epicoene or the silent woman is a prose comedy exceedingly well constructed full of life abounding in fun and unexpected situations here is a brief outline from which the reader may see of what materials jonson made up his comedies  the chief character is morose a rich old codger whose humor is a horror of noise he lives in a street so narrow that it will admit no carriages he pads the doors plugs the keyhole puts mattresses on the stairs he dismisses a servant who wears squeaky boots makes all the rest go about in thick stockings and they must answer him by signs since he cannot bear to hear anybody but himself talk he disinherits his poor nephew eugenie and to make sure that the latter will not get any money out of him resolves to marry his confidant in this delicate matter is cutbeard the barber who unlike his kind never speaks unless spoken to and does not even knick his scissors as he works cutbeard who is secretly in league with the nephew tells him of epicoene a rare silent woman and morose is so delighted with her silence that he resolves to marry her on the spot cutbeard produces a parson with a bad cold who can speak only in a whisper to marry them and when the parson coughs after the ceremony morose demands back five shillings of the fee to save it the parson coughs more and is hurriedly bundled out of the house the silent woman finds her voice immediately after the marriage begins to talk loudly and to make reforms in the household driving morose to distraction a noisy dinner party from a neighboring house with drums and trumpets and a quarreling man and wife is skillfully guided in at this moment to celebrate the wedding morose flees for his life and is found perched like a monkey on a crossbeam in the attic with all his nightcaps tied over his ears he seeks a divorce but is driven frantic by the loud arguments of a lawyer and a divine who are no other than cutbeard and a sea captain disguised when morose is past all hope the nephew offers to release him from his wife and her noisy friends if he will allow him five hundred pounds a year morose offers him anything everything to escape his torment and signs a deed to that effect then comes the surprise of the play when eugenie whips the wig from epicoene and shows a boy in disguise  it will be seen that the silent woman with its rapid action and its unexpected situations offers an excellent opportunity for the actors but the reading of the play as of most of jonsons comedies is marred by low intrigues showing a sad state of morals among the upper classes  besides these and many other less known comedies jonson wrote two great tragedies sejanus 1603 and catiline 1611 upon severe classical lines after ceasing his work for the stage jonson wrote many masques in honor of james i and of queen anne to be played amid elaborate scenery by the gentlemen of the court the best of these are the satyr the penates masque of blackness masque of beauty hue and cry after cupid and the masque of queens in all his plays jonson showed a strong lyric gift and some of his little poems and songs like the triumph of charis drink to me only with thine eyes and to the memory of my beloved mother are now better known than his great dramatic works a single volume of prose called timber or discoveries made upon men and matter is an interesting collection of short essays which are more like bacons than any other work of the age  beaumont and fletcher the work of these two men is so closely interwoven that though fletcher outlived beaumont by nine years and the latter had no hand in some forty of the plays that bear their joint names we still class them together and only scholars attempt to separate their works so as to give each writer his due share unlike most of the elizabethan dramatists they both came from noble and cultured families and were university trained their work in strong contrast with jonsons is intensely romantic and in it all however coarse or brutal the scene there is still as emerson pointed out the subtle recognition of gentility  beaumont 15841616 was the brother of sir john beaumont of leicestershire from oxford he came to london to study law but soon gave it up to write for the stage fletcher 15791625 was the son of the bishop of london and shows in all his work the influence of his high social position and of his cambridge education the two dramatists met at the mermaid tavern under ben jonsons leadership and soon became inseparable friends living and working together tradition has it that beaumont supplied the judgment and the solid work of the play while fletcher furnished the highcolored sentiment and the lyric poetry without which an elizabethan play would have been incomplete of their joint plays the two best known are philaster whose old theme like that of cymbeline and griselda is the jealousy of a lover and the faithfulness of a girl and the maids tragedy concerning fletchers work the most interesting literary question is how much did he write of shakespeares henry viii and how much did shakespeare help him in the two noble kinsmen  john webster of websters personal history we know nothing except that he was well known as a dramatist under james i his extraordinary powers of expression rank him with shakespeare but his talent seems to have been largely devoted to the bloodandthunder play begun by marlowe his two best known plays are the white devil pub 1612 and the duchess of malfi pub 1623 the latter spite of its horrors ranks him as one of the greatest masters of english tragedy it must be remembered that he sought in this play to reproduce the italian life of the sixteenth century and for this no imaginary horrors are needed the history of any italian court or city in this period furnishes more vice and violence and dishonor than even the gloomy imagination of webster could conceive all the socalled blood tragedies of the elizabethan period from thomas kyds spanish tragedy down however much they may condemn the brutal taste of the english audiences are still only so many search lights thrown upon a history of horrible darkness  thomas middleton 15701627 middleton is best known by two great plays the changeling156 and women beware women in poetry and diction they are almost worthy at times to rank with shakespeares plays otherwise in their sensationalism and unnaturalness they do violence to the moral sense and are repulsive to the modern reader two earlier plays a trick to catch the old one his best comedy and a fair quarrel his earliest tragedy are less mature in thought and expression but more readable because they seem to express middletons own idea of the drama rather than that of the corrupt court and playwrights of his later age  thomas heywood 15801650 heywoods life of which we know little in detail covers the whole period of the elizabethan drama to the glory of that drama he contributed according to his own statement the greater part at least of nearly two hundred and twenty plays it was an enormous amount of work but he seems to have been animated by the modern literary spirit of following the best market and striking while the financial iron is hot naturally good work was impossible even to genius under such circumstances and few of his plays are now known the two best if the reader would obtain his own idea of heywoods undoubted ability are a woman killed with kindness a pathetic story of domestic life and the fair maid of the west a melodrama with plenty of fighting of the popular kind  thomas dekker 1570 dekker is in pleasing contrast with most of the dramatists of the time all we know of him must be inferred from his works which show a happy and sunny nature pleasant and good to meet the reader will find the best expression of dekkers personality and erratic genius in the shoemakers holiday a humorous study of plain working people and old fortunatus a fairy drama of the wishing hat and no end of money whether intended for children or not it had the effect of charming the elders far more than the young people and the play became immensely popular  massinger ford shirley these three men mark the end of the elizabethan drama their work done largely while the struggle was on between the actors and the corrupt court on one side and the puritans on the other shows a deliberate turning away not only from puritan standards but from the high ideals of their own art to pander to the corrupt taste of the upper classes  philip massinger 15841640 was a dramatic poet of great natural ability but his plots and situations are usually so strained and artificial that the modern reader finds no interest in them in his best comedy a new way to pay old debts he achieved great popularity and gave us one figure sir giles overreach which is one of the typical characters of the english stage his best plays are the great duke of florence the virgin martyr and the maid of honour  john ford 15861642 and james shirley 15961666 have left us little of permanent literary value and their works are read only by those who wish to understand the whole rise and fall of the drama an occasional scene in fords plays is as strong as anything that the elizabethan age produced but as a whole the plays are unnatural and tiresome probably his best play is the broken heart 1633 shirley was given to imitation of his predecessors and his very imitation is characteristic of an age which had lost its inspiration a single play hyde park with its frivolous realistic dialogue is sometimes read for its reflection of the fashionable gossipy talk of the day long before shirleys death the actors said farewell othellos occupations gone parliament voted to close the theaters thereby saving the drama from a more inglorious death by dissipation157   vi the prose writers  francis bacon 15611626  in bacon we see one of those complex and contradictory natures which are the despair of the biographer if the writer be an admirer of bacon he finds too much that he must excuse or pass over in silence and if he takes his stand on the law to condemn the avarice and dishonesty of his subject he finds enough moral courage and nobility to make him question the justice of his own judgment on the one hand is rugged ben jonsons tribute to his power and ability and on the other hallams summary that he was a man who being intrusted with the highest gifts of heaven habitually abused them for the poorest purposes of earthhired them out for guineas places and titles in the service of injustice covetousness and oppression  laying aside the opinions of others and relying only upon the facts of bacons life we find on the one side the politician cold calculating selfish and on the other the literary and scientific man with an impressive devotion to truth for its own great sake here a man using questionable means to advance his own interests and there a man seeking with zeal and endless labor to penetrate the secret ways of nature with no other object than to advance the interests of his fellowmen so in our ignorance of the secret motives and springs of the mans life judgment is necessarily suspended bacon was apparently one of those double natures that only god is competent to judge because of the strange mixture of intellectual strength and moral weakness that is in them  life bacon was the son of sir nicholas bacon lord keeper of the seal and of the learned ann cook sisterinlaw to lord burleigh greatest of the queens statesmen from these connections as well as from native gifts he was attracted to the court and as a child was called by elizabeth her little lord keeper at twelve he went to cambridge but left the university after two years declaring the whole plan of education to be radically wrong and the system of aristotle which was the basis of all philosophy in those days to be a childish delusion since in the course of centuries it had produced no fruit but only a jungle of dry and useless branches strange even for a sophomore of fourteen thus to condemn the whole system of the universities but such was the boy and the system next year in order to continue his education he accompanied the english ambassador to france where he is said to have busied himself chiefly with the practical studies of statistics and diplomacy  two years later he was recalled to london by the death of his father without money and naturally with expensive tastes he applied to his uncle burleigh for a lucrative position it was in this application that he used the expression so characteristic of the elizabethan age that he had taken all knowledge for his province burleigh who misjudged him as a dreamer and selfseeker not only refused to help him at the court but successfully opposed his advancement by elizabeth bacon then took up the study of law and was admitted to the bar in 1582 that he had not lost his philosophy in the mazes of the law is shown by his tract written about this time on the greatest birth of time which was a plea for his inductive system of philosophy reasoning from many facts to one law rather than from an assumed law to particular facts which was the deductive method that had been in use for centuries in his famous plea for progress bacon demanded three things the free investigation of nature the discovery of facts instead of theories and the verification of results by experiment rather than by argument in our day these are the a b c of science but in bacons time they seemed revolutionary  as a lawyer he became immediately successful his knowledge and power of pleading became widely known and it was almost at the beginning of his career that jonson wrote the fear of every one that heard him speak was that he should make an end the publication of his essays added greatly to his fame but bacon was not content his head was buzzing with huge schemesthe pacification of unhappy ireland the simplification of english law the reform of the church the study of nature the establishment of a new philosophy meanwhile sad to say he played the game of politics for his personal advantage he devoted himself to essex the young and dangerous favorite of the queen won his friendship and then used him skillfully to better his own position when the earl was tried for treason it was partly at least through bacons efforts that he was convicted and beheaded and though bacon claims to have been actuated by a high sense of justice we are not convinced that he understood either justice or friendship in appearing as queens counsel against the man who had befriended him his coldbloodedness and lack of moral sensitiveness appear even in his essays on love and friendship indeed we can understand his life only upon the theory that his intellectuality left him cold and dead to the higher sentiments of our humanity  during elizabeths reign bacon had sought repeatedly for high office but had been blocked by burleigh and perhaps also by the queens own shrewdness in judging men with the advent of james i 1603 bacon devoted himself to the new ruler and rose rapidly in favor he was knighted and soon afterwards attained another object of his ambition in marrying a rich wife the appearance of his great work the advancement of learning in 1605 was largely the result of the mental stimulus produced by his change in fortune in 1613 he was made attorneygeneral and speedily made enemies by using the office to increase his personal ends he justified himself in his course by his devotion to the kings cause and by the belief that the higher his position and the more ample his means the more he could do for science it was in this year that bacon wrote his series of state papers which show a marvelous grasp of the political tendencies of his age had his advice been followed it would have certainly averted the struggle between king and parliament that followed speedily in 1617 he was appointed to his fathers office lord keeper of the seal and the next year to the high office of lord chancellor with this office he received the title of baron verulam and later of viscount st alban which he affixed with some vanity to his literary work two years later appeared his greatest work the novum organum called after aristotles famous organon  bacon did not long enjoy his political honors the storm which had been long gathering against jamess government broke suddenly upon bacons head when parliament assembled in 1621 it vented its distrust of james and his favorite villiers by striking unexpectedly at their chief adviser bacon was sternly accused of accepting bribes and the evidence was so great that he confessed that there was much political corruption abroad in the land that he was personally guilty of some of it and he threw himself upon the mercy of his judges parliament at that time was in no mood for mercy bacon was deprived of his office and was sentenced to pay the enormous fine of 40000 pounds to be imprisoned during the kings pleasure and thereafter to be banished forever from parliament and court though the imprisonment lasted only a few days and the fine was largely remitted bacons hopes and schemes for political honors were ended and it is at this point of appalling adversity that the nobility in the mans nature asserts itself strongly if the reader be interested to apply a great mans philosophy to his own life he will find the essay of great place most interesting in this connection  bacon now withdrew permanently from public life and devoted his splendid ability to literary and scientific work he completed the essays experimented largely wrote history scientific articles and one scientific novel and made additions to his instauratio magna the great philosophical work which was never finished in the spring of 1626 while driving in a snowstorm it occurred to him that snow might be used as a preservative instead of salt true to his own method of arriving at truth he stopped at the first house bought a fowl and proceeded to test his theory the experiment chilled him and he died soon after from the effects of his exposure as macaulay wrote the great apostle of experimental philosophy was destined to be its martyr  works of bacon bacons philosophic works the advancement of learning and the novum organum will be best understood in connection with the instauratio magna or the great institution of true philosophy of which they were parts the instauratio was never completed but the very idea of the work was magnificentto sweep away the involved philosophy of the schoolmen and the educational systems of the universities and to substitute a single great work which should be a complete education a rich storehouse for the glory of the creator and for the relief of mans estate the object of this education was to bring practical results to all the people instead of a little selfish culture and much useless speculation which he conceived were the only products of the universities  the instauratio magna this was the most ambitious though it is not the best known of bacons works for the insight it gives us into the authors mind we note here a brief outline of his subject it was divided into six parts as follows  1 partitiones scientiarum this was to be a classification and summary of all human knowledge philosophy and all speculation must be cast out and the natural sciences established as the basis of all education the only part completed was the advancement of learning which served as an introduction  2 novum organum or the new instrument that is the use of reason and experiment instead of the old aristotelian logic to find truth one must do two things a get rid of all prejudices or idols as bacon called them these idols are four idols of the tribe that is prejudices due to common methods of thought among all races idols of the cave or den that is personal peculiarities and prejudices idols of the market place due to errors of language and idols of the theater which are the unreliable traditions of men b after discarding the above idols we must interrogate nature must collect facts by means of numerous experiments arrange them in order and then determine the law that underlies them  it will be seen at a glance that the above is the most important of bacons works the organum was to be in several books only two of which he completed and these he wrote and rewrote twelve times until they satisfied him  3 historic naturalis et experimentalis the study of all the phenomena of nature of four parts of this work which he completed one of them at least the sylva sylvarum is decidedly at variance with his own idea of fact and experiment it abounds in fanciful explanations more worthy of the poetic than of the scientific mind nature is seen to be full of desires and instincts the air thirsts for light and fragrance bodies rise or sink because they have an appetite for height or depth the qualities of bodies are the result of an essence so that when we discover the essences of gold and silver and diamonds it will be a simple matter to create as much of them as we may need  4 scala intellectus or ladder of the mind is the rational application of the organum to all problems by it the mind should ascend step by step from particular facts and instances to general laws and abstract principles  5 prodromi prophecies or anticipations is a list of discoveries that men shall make when they have applied bacons methods of study and experimentation  6 philosophia secunda which was to be a record of practical results of the new philosophy when the succeeding ages should have applied it faithfully  it is impossible to regard even the outline of such a vast work without an involuntary thrill of admiration for the bold and original mind which conceived it we may said bacon make no despicable beginnings the destinies of the human race must complete the work  for upon this will depend not only a speculative good but all the fortunes of mankind and all their power there is the unconscious expression of one of the great minds of the world bacon was like one of the architects of the middle ages who drew his plans for a mighty cathedral perfect in every detail from the deep foundation stone to the cross on the highest spire and who gave over his plans to the builders knowing that in his own lifetime only one tiny chapel would be completed but knowing also that the very beauty of his plans would appeal to others and that succeeding ages would finish the work which he dared to begin  the essays bacons famous essays is the one work which will interest all students of our literature his instauratio was in latin written mostly by paid helpers from short english abstracts he regarded latin as the only language worthy of a great work but the world neglected his latin to seize upon his englishmarvelous english terse pithy packed with thought in an age that used endless circumlocutions the first ten essays published in 1597 were brief notebook jottings of bacons observations their success astonished the author but not till fifteen years later were they republished and enlarged their charm grew upon bacon himself and during his retirement he gave more thought to the wonderful language which he had at first despised as much as aristotles philosophy in 1612 appeared a second edition containing thirtyeight essays and in 1625 the year before his death he republished the essays in their present form polishing and enlarging the original ten to fiftyeight covering a wide variety of subjects suggested by the life of men around him  concerning the best of these essays there are as many opinions as there are readers and what one gets out of them depends largely upon his own thought and intelligence in this respect they are like that nature to which bacon directed mens thoughts the whole volume may be read through in an evening but after one has read them a dozen times he still finds as many places to pause and reflect as at the first reading if one must choose out of such a storehouse we would suggest studies goodness riches atheism unity in religion adversity friendship and great place as an introduction to bacons worldlywise philosophy  miscellaneous works other works of bacon are interesting as a revelation of the elizabethan mind rather than because of any literary value the new atlantis is a kind of scientific novel describing another utopia as seen by bacon the inhabitants of atlantis have banished philosophy and applied bacons method of investigating nature using the results to better their own condition they have a wonderful civilization in which many of our later discoveriesacademies of the sciences observatories balloons submarines the modification of species and several otherswere foreshadowed with a strange mixture of cold reason and poetic intuition de sapientia veterum is a fanciful attempt to show the deep meaning underlying ancient mythsa meaning which would have astonished the myth makers themselves the history of henry vii is a calm dispassionate and remarkably accurate history which makes us regret that bacon did not do more historical work besides these are metrical versions of certain psalmswhich are valuable in view of the controversy anent shakespeares plays for showing bacons utter inability to write poetryand a large number of letters and state papers showing the range and power of his intellect  bacons place and work although bacon was for the greater part of his life a busy man of affairs one cannot read his work without becoming conscious of two thingsa perennial freshness which the world insists upon in all literature that is to endure and an intellectual power which marks him as one of the great minds of the world  of late the general tendency is to give less and less prominence to his work in science and philosophy but criticism of his instauratio in view of his lofty aim is of small consequence it is true that his science today seems woefully inadequate true also that though he sought to discover truth he thought perhaps to monopolize it and so looked with the same suspicion upon copernicus as upon the philosophers the practical man who despises philosophy has simply misunderstood the thing he despises in being practical and experimental in a romantic age he was not unique as is often alleged but only expressed the tendency of the english mind in all ages three centuries earlier the monk roger bacon did more practical experimenting than the elizabethan sage and the latters famous idols are strongly suggestive of the formers four sources of human ignorance although bacon did not make any of the scientific discoveries at which he aimed yet the whole spirit of his work especially of the organum has strongly influenced science in the direction of accurate observation and of carefully testing every theory by practical experiment he that regardeth the clouds shall not sow said a wise writer of old and bacon turned mens thoughts from the heavens above with which they had been too busy to the earth beneath which they had too much neglected in an age when men were busy with romance and philosophy he insisted that the first object of education is to make a man familiar with his natural environment from books he turned to men from theory to fact from philosophy to nature and that is perhaps his greatest contribution to life and literature like moses upon pisgah he stood high enough above his fellows to look out over a promised land which his people would inherit but into which he himself might never enter  richard hooker 15541600 in strong contrast with bacon is richard hooker one of the greatest prose writers of the elizabethan age one must read the story of his life an obscure and lowly life animated by a great spirit as told by izaak walton to appreciate the full force of this contrast bacon took all knowledge for his province but mastered no single part of it hooker taking a single theme the law and practice of the english church so handled it that no scholar even of the present day would dream of superseding it or of building upon any other foundation than that which hooker laid down his one great work is the laws of ecclesiastical polity158 a theological and argumentative book but entirely apart from its subject it will be read wherever men desire to hear the power and stateliness of the english language here is a single sentence remarkable not only for its perfect form but also for its expression of the reverence for law which lies at the heart of anglosaxon civilization  of law there can be no less acknowledged than that her seat is the bosom of god her voice the harmony of the world all things in heaven and earth do her homage the very least as feeling her care and the greatest as not exempted from her power both angels and men and creatures of what condition soever though each in different sort and manner yet all with uniform consent admiring her as the mother of their peace and joy  sidney and raleigh among the prose writers of this wonderful literary age there are many others that deserve passing notice though they fall far below the standard of bacon and hooker sir philip sidney 15541586 who has already been considered as a poet is quite as well known by his prose works arcadia a pastoral romance and the defense of poesie one of our earliest literary essays sidney whom the poet shelley has eulogized represents the whole romantic tendency of his age while sir walter raleigh 15521618 represents its adventurous spirit and activity the life of raleigh is an almost incomprehensible mixture of the poet scholar and adventurer now helping the huguenots or the struggling dutch in europe and now leading an expedition into the unmapped wilds of the new world busy here with court intrigues and there with piratical attempts to capture the goldladen spanish galleons one moment sailing the high seas in utter freedom and the next writing history and poetry to solace his imprisonment such a life in itself is a volume far more interesting than anything that he wrote he is the restless spirit of the elizabethan age personified  raleighs chief prose works are the discoverie of guiana a work which would certainly have been interesting enough had he told simply what he saw but which was filled with colonization schemes and visions of an el dorado to fill the eyes and ears of the credulous and the history of the world written to occupy his prison hours the history is a wholly untrustworthy account of events from creation to the downfall of the macedonian empire it is interesting chiefly for its style which is simple and dignified and for the flashes of wit and poetry that break into the fantastic combination of miracles traditions hearsay and state records which he called history in the conclusion is the famous apostrophe to death which suggests what raleigh might have done had he lived less strenuously and written more carefully  o eloquent just and mighty death whom none could advise thou hast persuaded what none hath dared thou hast done and whom all the world hath flattered thou only hast cast out of the world and despised thou hast drawn together all the starstretched greatness all the pride cruelty and ambition of man and covered it all over with these two narrow words hic jacet  john foxe 15161587 foxe will be remembered always for his famous book of martyrs a book that our elders gave to us on sundays when we were young thinking it good discipline for us to afflict our souls when we wanted to be roaming the sunlit fields or when in our enforced idleness we would if our own taste in the matter had been consulted have made good shift to be quiet and happy with robinson crusoe so we have a gloomy memory of foxe and something of a grievance which prevent a just appreciation of his worth  foxe had been driven out of england by the marian persecutions and in a wandering but diligent life on the continent he conceived the idea of writing a history of the persecutions of the church from the earliest days to his own the part relating to england and scotland was published in latin in 1559 under a title as sonorous and impressive as the roman office for the deadrerum in ecclesia gestarum maximarumque per europam persecutionum commentarii on his return to england foxe translated this work calling it the acts and monuments but it soon became known as the book of martyrs and so it will always be called foxes own bitter experience causes him to write with more heat and indignation than his saintly theme would warrant and the holy tone sometimes spoils a narrative that would be impressive in its bare simplicity nevertheless the book has made for itself a secure place in our literature it is strongest in its record of humble men like rowland taylor and thomas hawkes whose sublime heroism but for this narrative would have been lost amid the great names and the great events that fill the elizabethan age  camden and knox two historians william camden and john knox stand out prominently among the numerous historical writers of the age camdens britannia 1586 is a monumental work which marks the beginning of true antiquarian research in the field of history and his annals of queen elizabeth is worthy of a far higher place than has thus far been given it john knox the reformer in his history of the reformation in scotland has some very vivid portraits of his helpers and enemies the personal and aggressive elements enter too strongly for a work of history but the autobiographical parts show rare literary power his account of his famous interview with mary queen of scots is clearcut as a cameo and shows the mans extraordinary power better than a whole volume of biography such scenes make one wish that more of his time had been given to literary work rather than to the disputes and troubles of his own scotch kirk  hakluyt and purchas two editors of this age have made for themselves an enviable place in our literature they are richard hakluyt 15521616 and samuel purchas 15751626 hakluyt was a clergyman who in the midst of his little parish set himself to achieve two great patriotic endsto promote the wealth and commerce of his country and to preserve the memory of all his countrymen who added to the glory of the realm by their travels and explorations to further the first object he concerned himself deeply with the commercial interests of the east india company with raleighs colonizing plans in virginia and with a translation of de sotos travels in america to further the second he made himself familiar with books of voyages in all foreign languages and with the brief reports of explorations of his own countrymen his principal navigations voyages and discoveries of the english nation in three volumes appeared first in 1589 and a second edition followed in 15981600 the first volume tells of voyages to the north the second to india and the east the third which is as large as the other two to the new world with the exception of the very first voyage that of king arthur to iceland in 517 which is founded on a myth all the voyages are authentic accounts of the explorers themselves and are immensely interesting reading even at the present day no other book of travels has so well expressed the spirit and energy of the english race or better deserves a place in our literature  samuel purchas who was also a clergyman continued the work of hakluyt using many of the latters unpublished manuscripts and condensing the records of numerous other voyages his first famous book purchas his pilgrimage appeared in 1613 and was followed by hakluytus posthumus or purchas his pilgrimes in 1625 the very name inclines one to open the book with pleasure and when one follows his inclinationwhich is after all one of the best guides in literaturehe is rarely disappointed though it falls far below the standard of hakluyt both in accuracy and literary finish there is still plenty to make one glad that the book was written and that he can now comfortably follow purchas on his pilgrimage  thomas north among the translators of the elizabethan age sir thomas north 15351601 is most deserving of notice because of his version of plutarchs lives 1579 from which shakespeare took the characters and many of the incidents for three great roman plays thus in north we read  cæsar also had cassius in great jealousy and suspected him much whereupon he said on a time to his friends what will cassius do think ye i like not his pale looks another time when cæsars friends warned him of antonius and dolabella he answered them again i never reckon of them but these palevisaged and carrion lean people i fear them most meaning brutus and cassius  shakespeare merely touches such a scene with the magic of his genius and his cæsar speaks      let me have men about me that are fat     sleekheaded men and such as sleep o nights     yond cassius has a lean and hungry look     he thinks too much such men are dangerous  a careful reading of norths plutarch and then of the famous roman plays shows to how great an extent shakespeare was dependent upon his obscure contemporary  norths translation to which we owe so many heroic models in our literature was probably made not from plutarch but from amyots excellent french translation nevertheless he reproduces the spirit of the original and notwithstanding our modern and more accurate translations he remains the most inspiring interpreter of the great biographer whom emerson calls the historian of heroism  summary of the age of elizabeth this period is generally regarded as the greatest in the history of our literature historically we note in this age the tremendous impetus received from the renaissance from the reformation and from the exploration of the new world it was marked by a strong national spirit by patriotism by religious tolerance by social content by intellectual progress and by unbounded enthusiasm  such an age of thought feeling and vigorous action finds its best expression in the drama and the wonderful development of the drama culminating in shakespeare is the most significant characteristic of the elizabethan period though the age produced some excellent prose works it is essentially an age of poetry and the poetry is remarkable for its variety its freshness its youthful and romantic feeling both the poetry and the drama were permeated by italian influence which was dominant in english literature from chaucer to the restoration the literature of this age is often called the literature of the renaissance though as we have seen the renaissance itself began much earlier and for a century and a half added very little to our literary possessions  in our study of this great age we have noted 1 the nondramatic poets that is poets who did not write for the stage the center of this group is edmund spenser whose shepherds calendar 1579 marked the appearance of the first national poet since chaucers death in 1400 his most famous work is the faery queen associated with spenser are the minor poets thomas sackville michael drayton george chapman and philip sidney chapman is noted for his completion of marlowes poem hero and leander and for his translation of homers iliad and odyssey sidney besides his poetry wrote his prose romance arcadia and the defense of poesie one of our earliest critical essays  2 the rise of the drama in england the miracle plays moralities and interludes our first play ralph royster doyster the first true english comedy gammer gurtons needle and the first tragedy gorboduc the conflict between classic and native ideals in the english drama  3 shakespeares predecessors lyly kyd nash peele greene marlowe the types of drama with which they experimentedthe marlowesque oneman type or tragedy of passion the popular chronicle plays the domestic drama the court or lylian comedy romantic comedy and tragedy classical plays and the melodrama marlowe is the greatest of shakespeares predecessors his four plays are tamburlaine faustus the jew of malta and edward ii  4 shakespeare his life work and influence  5 shakespeares successors ben jonson beaumont and fletcher webster middleton heywood dekker and the rapid decline of the drama ben jonson is the greatest of this group his chief comedies are every man in his humour the silent woman and the alchemist his two extant tragedies are sejanus and catiline  6 the prose writers of whom bacon is the most notable his chief philosophical work is the instauratio magna incomplete which includes the advancement of learning and the novum organum but he is known to literary readers by his famous essays minor prose writers are richard hooker john foxe the historians camden and knox the editors hakluyt and purchas who gave us the stirring records of exploration and thomas north the

16201660  i historical summary  the puritan movement in its broadest sense the puritan movement may be regarded as a second and greater renaissance a rebirth of the moral nature of man following the intellectual awakening of europe in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries in italy whose influence had been uppermost in elizabethan literature the renaissance had been essentially pagan and sensuous it had hardly touched the moral nature of man and it brought little relief from the despotism of rulers one can hardly read the horrible records of the medici or the borgias or the political observations of machiavelli without marveling at the moral and political degradation of a cultured nation in the north especially among the german and english peoples the renaissance was accompanied by a moral awakening and it is precisely that awakening in england that greatest moral and political reform which ever swept over a nation in the short space of half a century which is meant by the puritan movement we shall understand it better if we remember that it had two chief objects the first was personal righteousness the second was civil and religious liberty in other words it aimed to make men honest and to make them free  such a movement should be cleared of all the misconceptions which have clung to it since the restoration when the very name of puritan was made ridiculous by the jeers of the gay courtiers of charles ii though the spirit of the movement was profoundly religious the puritans were not a religious sect neither was the puritan a narrowminded and gloomy dogmatist as he is still pictured even in the histories pym and hampden and eliot and milton were puritans and in the long struggle for human liberty there are few names more honored by freemen everywhere cromwell and thomas hooker were puritans yet cromwell stood like a rock for religious tolerance and thomas hooker in connecticut gave to the world the first written constitution in which freemen before electing their officers laid down the strict limits of the offices to which they were elected that is a puritan document and it marks one of the greatest achievements in the history of government  from a religious view point puritanism included all shades of belief the name was first given to those who advocated certain changes in the form of worship of the reformed english church under elizabeth but as the ideal of liberty rose in mens minds and opposed to it were the king and his evil counselors and the band of intolerant churchmen of whom laud is the great example then puritanism became a great national movement it included english churchmen as well as extreme separatists calvinists covenanters catholic noblemenall bound together in resistance to despotism in church and state and with a passion for liberty and righteousness such as the world has never since seen naturally such a movement had its extremes and excesses and it is from a few zealots and fanatics that most of our misconceptions about the puritans arise life was stern in those days too stern perhaps and the intensity of the struggle against despotism made men narrow and hard in the triumph of puritanism under cromwell severe laws were passed many simple pleasures were forbidden and an austere standard of living was forced upon an unwilling people so the criticism is made that the wild outbreak of immorality which followed the restoration of charles was partly due to the unnatural restrictions of the puritan era the criticism is just but we must not forget the whole spirit of the movement that the puritan prohibited maypole dancing and horse racing is of small consequence beside the fact that he fought for liberty and justice that he overthrew despotism and made a mans life and property safe from the tyranny of rulers a great river is not judged by the foam on its surface and certain austere laws and doctrines which we have ridiculed are but froth on the surface of the mighty puritan current that has flowed steadily like a river of life through english and american history since the age of elizabeth  changing ideals the political upheaval of the period is summed up in the terrible struggle between the king and parliament which resulted in the death of charles at the block and the establishment of the commonwealth under cromwell for centuries the english people had been wonderfully loyal to their sovereigns but deeper than their loyalty to kings was the old saxon love for personal liberty at times as in the days of alfred and elizabeth the two ideals went hand in hand but more often they were in open strife and a final struggle for supremacy was inevitable the crisis came when james i who had received the right of royalty from an act of parliament began by the assumption of divine right to ignore the parliament which had created him of the civil war which followed in the reign of charles i and of the triumph of english freedom it is unnecessary to write here the blasphemy of a mans divine right to rule his fellowmen was ended modern england began with the charge of cromwells brigade of puritans at naseby  religiously the age was one of even greater ferment than that which marked the beginning of the reformation a great ideal the ideal of a national church was pounding to pieces like a ship in the breakers and in the confusion of such an hour the action of the various sects was like that of frantic passengers each striving to save his possessions from the wreck the catholic church as its name implies has always held true to the ideal of a united church a church which like the great roman government of the early centuries can bring the splendor and authority of rome to bear upon the humblest village church to the farthest ends of the earth for a time that mighty ideal dazzled the german and english reformers but the possibility of a united protestant church perished with elizabeth then instead of the worldwide church which was the ideal of catholicism came the ideal of a purely national protestantism this was the ideal of laud and the reactionary bishops no less than of the scholarly richard hooker of the rugged scotch covenanters and of the puritans of massachusetts bay it is intensely interesting to note that charles called irish rebels and scotch highlanders to his aid by promising to restore their national religions and that the english puritans turning to scotland for help entered into the solemn covenant of 1643 establishing a national presbyterianism whose object was  to bring the churches of god in the three kingdoms to uniformity in religion and government to preserve the rights of parliament and the liberties of the kingdom  that we and our posterity may as brethren live in faith and love and the lord may delight to live in the midst of us  in this famous covenant we see the national the ecclesiastical and the personal dream of puritanism side by side in all their grandeur and simplicity  years passed years of bitter struggle and heartache before the impossibility of uniting the various protestant sects was generally recognized the ideal of a national church died hard and to its death is due all the religious unrest of the period only as we remember the national ideal and the struggle which it caused can we understand the amazing life and work of bunyan or appreciate the heroic spirit of the american colonists who left home for a wilderness in order to give the new ideal of a free church in a free state its practical demonstration  literary characteristics in literature also the puritan age was one of confusion due to the breaking up of old ideals mediaeval standards of chivalry the impossible loves and romances of which spenser furnished the types perished no less surely than the ideal of a national church and in the absence of any fixed standard of literary criticism there was nothing to prevent the exaggeration of the metaphysical poets who are the literary parallels to religious sects like the anabaptists poetry took new and startling forms in donne and herbert and prose became as somber as burtons anatomy of melancholy the spiritual gloom which sooner or later fastens upon all the writers of this age and which is unjustly attributed to puritan influence is due to the breaking up of accepted standards in government and religion no people from the greeks to those of our own day have suffered the loss of old ideals without causing its writers to cry ichabod the glory has departed that is the unconscious tendency of literary men in all times who look backward for their golden age and it need not concern the student of literature who even in the breakup of cherished institutions looks for some foregleams of a better light which is to break upon the world this socalled gloomy age produced some minor poems of exquisite workmanship and one great master of verse whose work would glorify any age or peoplejohn milton in whom the indomitable puritan spirit finds its noblest expression  there are three main characteristics in which puritan literature differs from that of the preceding age 1 elizabethan literature with all its diversity had a marked unity in spirit resulting from the patriotism of all classes and their devotion to a queen who with all her faults sought first the nations welfare under the stuarts all this was changed the kings were the open enemies of the people the country was divided by the struggle for political and religious liberty and the literature was as divided in spirit as were the struggling parties 2 elizabethan literature is generally inspiring it throbs with youth and hope and vitality that which follows speaks of age and sadness even its brightest hours are followed by gloom and by the pessimism inseparable from the passing of old standards 3 elizabethan literature is intensely romantic the romance springs from the heart of youth and believes all things even the impossible the great schoolmans credo i believe because it is impossible is a better expression of elizabethan literature than of mediæval theology in the literature of the puritan period one looks in vain for romantic ardor even in the lyrics and love poems a critical intellectual spirit takes its place and whatever romance asserts itself is in form rather than in feeling a fantastic and artificial adornment of speech rather than the natural utterance of a heart in which sentiment is so strong and true that poetry is its only expression   ii literature of the puritan period  the transition poets when one attempts to classify the literature of the first half of the seventeenth century from the death of elizabeth 1603 to the restoration 1660 he realizes the impossibility of grouping poets by any accurate standard the classifications attempted here have small dependence upon dates or sovereigns and are suggestive rather than accurate thus shakespeare and bacon wrote largely in the reign of james i but their work is elizabethan in spirit and bunyan is no less a puritan because he happened to write after the restoration the name metaphysical poets given by dr johnson is somewhat suggestive but not descriptive of the followers of donne the name caroline or cavalier poets brings to mind the careless temper of the royalists who followed king charles with a devotion of which he was unworthy and the name spenserian poets recalls the little band of dreamers who clung to spensers ideal even while his romantic mediæval castle was battered down by science at the one gate and puritanism at the other at the beginning of this bewildering confusion of ideals expressed in literature we note a few writers who are generally known as jacobean poets but whom we have called the transition poets because with the later dramatists they show clearly the changing standards of the age  samuel daniel 15621619 daniel who is often classed with the first metaphysical poets is interesting to us for two reasonsfor his use of the artificial sonnet and for his literary desertion of spenser as a model for poets his delia a cycle of sonnets modeled perhaps after sidneys astrophel and stella helped to fix the custom of celebrating love or friendship by a series of sonnets to which some pastoral pseudonym was affixed in his sonnets many of which rank with shakespeares and in his later poetry especially the beautiful complaint of rosamond and his civil wars he aimed solely at grace of expression and became influential in giving to english poetry a greater individuality and independence than it had ever known in matter he set himself squarely against the mediæval tendency      let others sing of kings and paladines     in aged accents and untimely words     paint shadows in imaginary lines  this fling at spenser and his followers marks the beginning of the modern and realistic school which sees in life as it is enough poetic material without the invention of allegories and impossible heroines daniels poetry which was forgotten soon after his death has received probably more homage than it deserves in the praises of wordsworth southey lamb and coleridge the latter says read daniel the admirable daniel the style and language are just such as any pure and manly writer of the present day would use it seems quite modern in comparison with the style of shakespeare  the song writers in strong contrast with the above are two distinct groups the song writers and the spenserian poets the close of the reign of elizabeth was marked by an outburst of english songs as remarkable in its sudden development as the rise of the drama two causes contributed to this resultthe increasing influence of french instead of italian verse and the rapid development of music as an art at the close of the sixteenth century the two song writers best worth studying are thomas campion 15671619 and nicholas breton 15451626 like all the lyric poets of the age they are a curious mixture of the elizabethan and the puritan standards they sing of sacred and profane love with the same zest and a careless love song is often found on the same page with a plea for divine grace  the spenserian poets of the spenserian poets giles fletcher and wither are best worth studying giles fletcher 15881623 has at times a strong suggestion of milton who was also a follower of spenser in his early years in the noble simplicity and majesty of his lines his best known work christs victory and triumph 1610 was the greatest religious poem that had appeared in england since piers plowman and is not an unworthy predecessor of paradise lost  the life of george wither 15881667 covers the whole period of english history from elizabeth to the restoration and the enormous volume of his work covers every phase of the literature of two great ages his life was a varied one now as a royalist leader against the covenanters and again announcing his puritan convictions and suffering in prison for his faith at his best wither is a lyric poet of great originality rising at times to positive genius but the bulk of his poetry is intolerably dull students of this period find him interesting as an epitome of the whole age in which he lived but the average reader is more inclined to note with interest that he published in 1623 hymns and songs of the church the first hymn book that ever appeared in the english language  the metaphysical poets this namewhich was given by dr johnson in derision because of the fantastic form of donnes poetryis often applied to all minor poets of the puritan age we use the term here in a narrower sense excluding the followers of daniel and that later group known as the cavalier poets it includes donne herbert waller denham cowley vaughan davenant marvell and crashaw the advanced student finds them all worthy of study not only for their occasional excellent poetry but because of their influence on later literature thus richard crashaw 16131649 the catholic mystic is interesting because his troubled life is singularly like donnes and his poetry is at times like herberts set on fire160 abraham cowley 16181667 who blossomed young and who at twentyfive was proclaimed the greatest poet in england is now scarcely known even by name but his pindaric odes161 set an example which influenced english poetry throughout the eighteenth century henry vaughan 16221695 is worthy of study because he is in some respects the forerunner of wordsworth162 and andrew marvell 16211678 because of his loyal friendship with milton and because his poetry shows the conflict between the two schools of spenser and donne edmund waller 16061687 stands between the puritan age and the restoration he was the first to use consistently the closed couplet which dominated our poetry for the next century by this and especially by his influence over dryden the greatest figure of the restoration he occupies a larger place in our literature than a reading of his rather tiresome poetry would seem to warrant  of all these poets each of whom has his special claim we can consider here only donne and herbert who in different ways are the types of revolt against earlier forms and standards of poetry in feeling and imagery both are poets of a high order but in style and expression they are the leaders of the fantastic school whose influence largely dominated poetry during the half century of the puritan period   john donne 15731631  life the briefest outline of donnes life shows its intense human interest he was born in london the son of a rich iron merchant at the time when the merchants of england were creating a new and higher kind of princes on his fathers side he came from an old welsh family and on his mothers side from the heywoods and sir thomas mores family both families were catholic and in his early life persecution was brought near for his brother died in prison for harboring a proscribed priest and his own education could not be continued in oxford and cambridge because of his religion such an experience generally sets a mans religious standards for life but presently donne as he studied law at lincolns inn was investigating the philosophic grounds of all faith gradually he left the church in which he was born renounced all denominations and called himself simply christian meanwhile he wrote poetry and shared his wealth with needy catholic relatives he joined the expedition of essex for cadiz in 1596 and for the azores in 1597 and on sea and in camp found time to write poetry two of his best poems the storm and the calm belong to this period next he traveled in europe for three years but occupied himself with study and poetry returning home he became secretary to lord egerton fell in love with the latters young niece anne more and married her for which cause donne was cast into prison strangely enough his poetical work at this time is not a song of youthful romance but the progress of the soul a study of transmigration years of wandering and poverty followed until sir george more forgave the young lovers and made an allowance to his daughter instead of enjoying his new comforts donne grew more ascetic and intellectual in his tastes he refused also the nattering offer of entering the church of england and of receiving a comfortable living by his pseudo martyr he attracted the favor of james i who persuaded him to be ordained yet left him without any place or employment when his wife died her allowance ceased and donne was left with seven children in extreme poverty then he became a preacher rose rapidly by sheer intellectual force and genius and in four years was the greatest of english preachers and dean of st pauls cathedral in london there he carried some to heaven in holy raptures and led others to amend their lives and as he leans over the pulpit with intense earnestness is likened by izaak walton to an angel leaning from a cloud  here is variety enough to epitomize his age and yet in all his life stronger than any impression of outward weal or woe is the sense of mystery that surrounds donne in all his work one finds a mystery a hiding of some deep thing which the world would gladly know and share and which is suggested in his haunting little poem the undertaking      i have done one braver thing     than all the worthies did     and yet a braver thence doth spring     which is to keep that hid  donnes poetry donnes poetry is so uneven at times so startling and fantastic that few critics would care to recommend it to others only a few will read his works and they must be left to their own browsing to find what pleases them like deer which in the midst of plenty take a bite here and there and wander on tasting twenty varieties of food in an hours feeding one who reads much will probably bewail donnes lack of any consistent style or literary standard for instance chaucer and milton are as different as two poets could well be yet the work of each is marked by a distinct and consistent style and it is the style as much as the matter which makes the tales or the paradise lost a work for all time donne threw style and all literary standards to the winds and precisely for this reason he is forgotten though his great intellect and his genius had marked him as one of those who should do things worthy to be remembered while the tendency of literature is to exalt style at the expense of thought the world has many men and women who exalt feeling and thought above expression and to these donne is good reading browning is of the same school and compels attention while donne played havoc with elizabethan style he nevertheless influenced our literature in the way of boldness and originality and the present tendency is to give him a larger place nearer to the few great poets than he has occupied since ben jonson declared that he was the first poet of the world in some things but likely to perish for not being understood for to much of his poetry we must apply his own satiric verses on anothers crudities      infinite work which doth so far extend     that none can study it to any end   george herbert 15931633  o day most calm most bright sang george herbert and we may safely take that single line as expressive of the whole spirit of his writings professor palmer whose scholarly edition of this poets works is a model for critics and editors calls herbert the first in english poetry who spoke face to face with god that may be true but it is interesting to note that not a poet of the first half of the seventeenth century not even the gayest of the cavaliers but has written some noble verse of prayer or aspiration which expresses the underlying puritan spirit of his age herbert is the greatest the most consistent of them all in all the others the puritan struggles against the cavalier or the cavalier breaks loose from the restraining puritan but in herbert the struggle is past and peace has come that his life was not all calm that the puritan in him had struggled desperately before it subdued the pride and idleness of the cavalier is evident to one who reads between his lines      i struck the board and cryd no more          i will abroad     what shall i ever sigh and pine     my lines and life are free free as the road     loose as the wind  there speaks the cavalier of the university and the court and as one reads to the end of the little poem which he calls by the suggestive name of the collar he may know that he is reading condensed biography  those who seek for faults for strained imagery and fantastic verse forms in herberts poetry will find them in abundance but it will better repay the reader to look for the deep thought and fine feeling that are hidden in these wonderful religious lyrics even in those that appear most artificial the fact that herberts reputation was greater at times than miltons and that his poems when published after his death had a large sale and influence shows certainly that he appealed to the men of his age and his poems will probably be read and appreciated if only by the few just so long as men are strong enough to understand the puritans spiritual convictions  life herberts life is so quiet and uneventful that to relate a few biographical facts can be of little advantage only as one reads the whole story by izaak walton can he share the gentle spirit of herberts poetry he was born at montgomery castle163 wales 1593 of a noble welsh family his university course was brilliant and after graduation he waited long years in the vain hope of preferment at court all his life he had to battle against disease and this is undoubtedly the cause of the long delay before each new step in his course not till he was thirtyseven was he ordained and placed over the little church of bemerton how he lived here among plain people in this happy corner of the lords field hoping all things and blessing all people asking his own way to sion and showing others the way should be read in walton it is a brief life less than three years of work before being cut off by consumption but remarkable for the single great purpose and the glorious spiritual strength that shine through physical weakness just before his death he gave some manuscripts to a friend and his message is worthy of john bunyan  deliver this little book to my dear brother ferrar and tell him he shall find in it a picture of the many spiritual conflicts that have passed betwixt god and my soul before i could subject mine to the will of jesus my master in whose service i have now found perfect freedom desire him to read it and then if he can think it may turn to the advantage of any dejected poor soul let it be made public if not let him burn it for i and it are less than the least of gods mercies  herberts poems herberts chief work the temple consists of over one hundred and fifty short poems suggested by the church her holidays and ceremonials and the experiences of the christian life the first poem the church porch is the longest and though polished with a care that foreshadows the classic school the least poetical it is a wonderful collection of condensed sermons wise precepts and moral lessons suggesting chaucers good counsel popes essay on man and poloniuss advice to laertes in hamlet only it is more packed with thought than any of these of truthspeaking he says      dare to be true nothing can need a lie     a fault which needs it most grows two thereby  and of calmness in argument      calmness is great advantage he that lets     another chafe may warm him at his fire  among the remaining poems of the temple one of the most suggestive is the pilgrimage here in six short stanzas every line closepacked with thought we have the whole of bunyans pilgrims progress the poem was written probably before bunyan was born but remembering the wide influence of herberts poetry it is an interesting question whether bunyan received the idea of his immortal work from this pilgrimage probably the best known of all his poems is the one called the pulley which generally appears however under the name rest or the gifts of god       when god at first made man     having a glass of blessings standing by     let us said he pour on him all we can     let the worlds riches which dispersed lie       contract into a span      so strength first made a way     then beauty flowed then wisdom honor pleasure     when almost all was out god made a stay     perceiving that alone of all his treasure       rest in the bottom lay      for if i should said he     bestow this jewel also on my creature     he would adore my gifts instead of me     and rest in nature not the god of nature       so both should losers be      yet let him keep the rest     but keep them with repining restlessness     let him be rich and weary that at least     if goodness lead him not yet weariness       may toss him to my breast  among the poems which may be read as curiosities of versification and which arouse the wrath of the critics against the whole metaphysical school are those like easter wings and the altar which suggest in the printed form of the poem the thing of which the poet sings more ingenious is the poem in which rime is made by cutting off the first letter of a preceding word as in the five stanzas of paradise       i bless thee lord because i grow     among thy trees which in a row     to thee both fruit and order ow  and more ingenious still are odd conceits like the poem heaven in which echo by repeating the last syllable of each line gives an answer to the poets questions  the cavalier poets in the literature of any age there are generally found two distinct tendencies the first expresses the dominant spirit of the times the second a secret or an open rebellion so in this age side by side with the serious and rational puritan lives the gallant and trivial cavalier the puritan finds expression in the best poetry of the period from donne to milton and in the prose of baxter and bunyan the cavalier in a small group of poetsherrick lovelace suckling and carewwho write songs generally in lighter vein gay trivial often licentious but who cannot altogether escape the tremendous seriousness of puritanism  thomas carew 15981639 carew may be called the inventor of cavalier love poetry and to him more than to any other is due the peculiar combination of the sensual and the religious which marked most of the minor poets of the seventeenth century his poetry is the spenserian pastoral stripped of its refinement of feeling and made direct coarse vigorous his poems published in 1640 are generally like his life trivial or sensual but here and there is found one like the following which indicates that with the metaphysical and cavalier poets a new and stimulating force had entered english literature      ask me no more where jove bestows     when june is past the fading rose     for in your beautys orient deep     these flowers as in their causes sleep     ask me no more where those stars light     that downwards fall in dead of night     for in your eyes they sit and there     fixèd become as in their sphere     ask me no more if east or west     the phoenix builds her spicy nest     for unto you at last she flies     and in your fragrant bosom dies  robert herrick 15911674 herrick is the true cavalier gay devilmay care in disposition but by some freak of fate a clergyman of dean prior in south devon a county made famous by him and blackmore here in a country parish he lived discontentedly longing for the joys of london and the mermaid tavern his bachelor establishment consisting of an old housekeeper a cat a dog a goose a tame lamb one henfor which he thanked god in poetry because she laid an egg every dayand a pet pig that drank beer with herrick out of a tankard with admirable good nature herrick made the best of these uncongenial surroundings he watched with sympathy the country life about him and caught its spirit in many lyrics a few of which like corinnas maying gather ye rosebuds while ye may and to daffodils are among the best known in our language his poems cover a wide range from trivial love songs pagan in spirit to hymns of deep religious feeling only the best of his poems should be read and these are remarkable for their exquisite sentiment and their graceful melodious expression the rest since they reflect something of the coarseness of his audience may be passed over in silence  late in life herrick published his one book hesperides and noble numbers 1648 the latter half contains his religious poems and one has only to read there the remarkable litany to see how the religious terror that finds expression in bunyans grace abounding could master even the most careless of cavalier singers  suckling and lovelace sir john suckling 16091642 was one of the most brilliant wits of the court of charles i who wrote poetry as he exercised a horse or fought a duel because it was considered a gentlemans accomplishment in those days his poems struck from his wild life like sparks from his rapier are utterly trivial and even in his best known ballad upon a wedding rarely rise above mere doggerel it is only the romance of his lifehis rich brilliant careless youth and his poverty and suicide in paris whither he fled because of his devotion to the stuartsthat keeps his name alive in our literature  in his life and poetry sir richard lovelace 16181658 offers a remarkable parallel to suckling and the two are often classed together as perfect representatives of the followers of king charles lovelaces lucasta a volume of love lyrics is generally on a higher plane than sucklings work and a few of the poems like to lucasta and to althea from prison deserve the secure place they have won in the latter occur the oftquoted lines      stone walls do not a prison make       nor iron bars a cage     minds innocent and quiet take       that for an hermitage     if i have freedom in my love       and in my soul am free     angels alone that soar above       enjoy such liberty  john milton 16081674      thy soul was like a star and dwelt apart     thou hadst a voice whose sound was like the sea     pure as the naked heavens majestic free     so didst thou travel on lifes common way     in cheerful godliness and yet thy heart     the lowliest duties on herself did lay         from wordsworths sonnet on milton  shakespeare and milton are the two figures that tower conspicuously above the goodly fellowship of men who have made our literature famous each is representative of the age that produced him and together they form a suggestive commentary upon the two forces that rule our humanitythe force of impulse and the force of a fixed purpose shakespeare is the poet of impulse of the loves hates fears jealousies and ambitions that swayed the men of his age milton is the poet of steadfast will and purpose who moves like a god amid the fears and hopes and changing impulses of the world regarding them as trivial and momentary things that can never swerve a great soul from its course  it is well to have some such comparison in mind while studying the literature of the elizabethan and the puritan age while shakespeare and ben jonson and their unequaled company of wits make merry at the mermaid tavern there is already growing up on the same london street a poet who shall bring a new force into literature who shall add to the renaissance culture and love of beauty the tremendous moral earnestness of the puritan such a poet must begin as the puritan always began with his own soul to discipline and enlighten it before expressing its beauty in literature he that would hope to write well hereafter in laudable things says milton ought himself to be a true poem that is a composition and pattern of the best and most honorable things here is a new proposition in art which suggests the lofty ideal of fra angelico that before one can write literature which is the expression of the ideal he must first develop in himself the ideal man because milton is human he must know the best in humanity therefore he studies giving his days to music art and literature his nights to profound research and meditation but because he knows that man is more than mortal he also prays depending as he tells us on devout prayer to that eternal spirit who can enrich with all utterance and knowledge such a poet is already in spirit far beyond the renaissance though he lives in the autumn of its glory and associates with its literary masters there is a spirit in man says the old hebrew poet and the inspiration of the almighty giveth him understanding here in a word is the secret of miltons life and writing hence his long silences years passing without a word and when he speaks it is like the voice of a prophet who begins with the sublime announcement the spirit of the lord is upon me hence his style producing an impression of sublimity which has been marked for wonder by every historian of our literature his style was unconsciously sublime because he lived and thought consciously in a sublime atmosphere  life of milton milton is like an ideal in the soul like a lofty mountain on the horizon we never attain the ideal we never climb the mountain but life would be inexpressibly poorer were either to be taken away  from childhood miltons parents set him apart for the attainment of noble ends and so left nothing to chance in the matter of training his father john milton is said to have turned puritan while a student at oxford and to have been disinherited by his family whereupon he settled in london and prospered greatly as a scrivener that is a kind of notary in character the elder milton was a rare combination of scholar and business man a radical puritan in politics and religion yet a musician whose hymn tunes are still sung and a lover of art and literature the poets mother was a woman of refinement and social grace with a deep interest in religion and in local charities so the boy grew up in a home which combined the culture of the renaissance with the piety and moral strength of early puritanism he begins therefore as the heir of one great age and the prophet of another  apparently the elder milton shared bacons dislike for the educational methods of the time and so took charge of his sons training encouraging his natural tastes teaching him music and seeking out a tutor who helped the boy to what he sought most eagerly not the grammar and mechanism of greek and latin but rather the stories the ideals the poetry that hide in their incomparable literatures at twelve years we find the boy already a scholar in spirit unable to rest till after midnight because of the joy with which his study was rewarded from boyhood two great principles seem to govern miltons career one the love of beauty of music art literature and indeed of every form of human culture the other a steadfast devotion to duty as the highest object in human life  a brief course at the famous st pauls school in london was the prelude to miltons entrance to christs college cambridge here again he followed his natural bent and like bacon found himself often in opposition to the authorities aside from some latin poems the most noteworthy song of this period of miltons life is his splendid ode on the morning of christs nativity which was begun on christmas day 1629 milton while deep in the classics had yet a greater love for his native literature spenser was for years his master in his verse we find every evidence of his loving study of shakespeare and his last great poems show clearly how he had been influenced by fletchers christs victory and triumph but it is significant that this first ode rises higher than anything of the kind produced in the famous age of elizabeth  while at cambridge it was the desire of his parents that milton should take orders in the church of england but the intense love of mental liberty which stamped the puritan was too strong within him and he refused to consider the oath of servitude as he called it which would mark his ordination throughout his life milton though profoundly religious held aloof from the strife of sects in belief he belonged to the extreme puritans called separatists independents congregationalists of which our pilgrim fathers are the great examples but he refused to be bound by any creed or church discipline      as ever in my great taskmasters eye  in this last line of one of his sonnets164 is found miltons rejection of every form of outward religious authority in face of the supreme puritan principle the liberty of the individual soul before god  a long period of retirement followed miltons withdrawal from the university in 1632 at his fathers country home in horton he gave himself up for six years to solitary reading and study roaming over the wide fields of greek latin hebrew spanish french italian and english literatures and studying hard at mathematics science theology and musica curious combination to his love of music we owe the melody of all his poetry and we note it in the rhythm and balance which make even his mighty prose arguments harmonious in lycidas lallegro il penseroso arcades comus and a few sonnets we have the poetic results of this retirement at hortonfew indeed but the most perfect of their kind that our literature has recorded  out of solitude where his talent was perfected milton entered the busy world where his character was to be proved to the utmost from horton he traveled abroad through france switzerland and italy everywhere received with admiration for his learning and courtesy winning the friendship of the exiled dutch scholar grotius in paris and of galileo in his sad imprisonment in florence165 he was on his way to greece when news reached him of the break between king and parliament with the practical insight which never deserted him milton saw clearly the meaning of the news his cordial reception in italy so chary of praise to anything not italian had reawakened in milton the old desire to write an epic which england would not willingly let die but at thought of the conflict for human freedom all his dreams were flung to the winds he gave up his travels and literary ambitions and hurried to england for i thought it base he says to be traveling at my ease for intellectual culture while my fellowcountrymen at home were fighting for liberty  then for nearly twenty years the poet of great achievement and still greater promise disappears we hear no more songs but only the prose denunciations and arguments which are as remarkable as his poetry in all our literature there is nothing more worthy of the puritan spirit than this laying aside of personal ambitions in order to join in the struggle for human liberty in his best known sonnet on his blindness which reflects his grief not at darkness but at his abandoned dreams we catch the sublime spirit of this renunciation  miltons opportunity to serve came in the crisis of 1649 the king had been sent to the scaffold paying the penalty of his own treachery and england sat shivering at its own deed like a child or a russian peasant who in sudden passion resists unbearable brutality and then is afraid of the consequences two weeks of anxiety of terror and silence followed then appeared miltons tenure of kings and magistrates to england it was like the coming of a strong man not only to protect the child but to justify his blow for liberty kings no less than people are subject to the eternal principle of law the divine right of a people to defend and protect themselvesthat was the mighty argument which calmed a peoples dread and proclaimed that a new man and a new principle had arisen in england milton was called to be secretary for foreign tongues in the new government and for the next few years until the end of the commonwealth there were two leaders in england cromwell the man of action milton the man of thought it is doubtful to which of the two humanity owes most for its emancipation from the tyranny of kings and prelates  two things of personal interest deserve mention in this period of miltons life his marriage and his blindness in 1643 he married mary powell a shallow pleasureloving girl the daughter of a royalist and that was the beginning of sorrows after a month tiring of the austere life of a puritan household she abandoned her husband who with the same radical reasoning with which he dealt with affairs of state promptly repudiated the marriage his doctrine and discipline of divorce and his tetrachordon are the arguments to justify his position but they aroused a storm of protest in england and they suggest to a modern reader that milton was perhaps as much to blame as his wife and that he had scant understanding of a womans nature when his wife fearing for her position appeared before him in tears all his ponderous arguments were swept aside by a generous impulse and though the marriage was never a happy one milton never again mentioned his wifes desertion the scene in paradise lost where eve comes weeping to adam seeking peace and pardon is probably a reflection of a scene in miltons own household his wife died in 1653 and a few years later he married another whom we remember for the sonnet methought i saw my late espoused saint in which she is celebrated she died after fifteen months and in 1663 he married a third wife who helped the blind old man to manage his poor household  from boyhood the strain on the poets eyes had grown more and more severe but even when his sight was threatened he held steadily to his purpose of using his pen in the service of his country during the kings imprisonment a book appeared called eikon basilike royal image giving a rosy picture of the kings piety and condemning the puritans the book speedily became famous and was the source of all royalist arguments against the commonwealth in 1649 appeared miltons eikonoklastes image breaker which demolished the flimsy arguments of the eikon basilike as a charge of cromwells ironsides had overwhelmed the kings followers after the execution of the king appeared another famous attack upon the puritans defensio regia pro carlo i instigated by charles ii who was then living in exile it was written in latin by salmasius a dutch professor at leyden and was hailed by the royalists as an invincible argument by order of the council of state milton prepared a reply his eyesight had sadly failed and he was warned that any further strain would be disastrous his reply was characteristic of the man and the puritan as he had once sacrificed his poetry so he was now ready he said to sacrifice his eyes also on the altar of english liberty his magnificent defensio pro populo anglicano is one of the most masterly controversial works in literature the power of the press was already strongly felt in england and the new commonwealth owed its standing partly to miltons prose and partly to cromwells policy the defensio was the last work that milton saw blindness fell upon him ere it was finished and from 1652 until his death he labored in total darkness  the last part of miltons life is a picture of solitary grandeur unequaled in literary history with the restoration all his labors and sacrifices for humanity were apparently wasted from his retirement he could hear the bells and the shouts that welcomed back a vicious monarch whose first act was to set his foot upon his peoples neck milton was immediately marked for persecution he remained for months in hiding he was reduced to poverty and his books were burned by the public hangman his daughters upon whom he depended in his blindness rebelled at the task of reading to him and recording his thoughts in the midst of all these sorrows we understand in samson the cry of the blind champion of israel      now blind disheartened shamed dishonored quelled     to what can i be useful wherein serve     my nation and the work from heaven imposed     but to sit idle on the household hearth     a burdenous drone to visitants a gaze     or pitied object  miltons answer is worthy of his own great life without envy or bitterness he goes back to the early dream of an immortal poem and begins with superb consciousness of power to dictate his great epic  paradise lost was finished in 1665 after seven years labor in darkness with great difficulty he found a publisher and for the great work now the most honored poem in our literature he received less than certain verse makers of our day receive for a little song in one of our popular magazines its success was immediate though like all his work it met with venomous criticism dryden summed up the impression made on thoughtful minds of his time when he said this man cuts us all out and the ancients too thereafter a bit of sunshine came into his darkened home for the work stamped him as one of the worlds great writers and from england and the continent pilgrims came in increasing numbers to speak their gratitude  the next year milton began his paradise regained in 1671 appeared his last important work samson agonistes the most powerful dramatic poem on the greek model which our language possesses the picture of israels mighty champion blind alone afflicted by thoughtless enemies but preserving a noble ideal to the end is a fitting close to the life work of the poet himself for years he was silent dreaming who shall say what dreams in his darkness and saying cheerfully to his friends still guides the heavenly vision he died peacefully in 1674 the most sublime and the most lonely figure in our literature  miltons early poetry166 in his early work milton appears as the inheritor of all that was best in elizabethan literature and his first work the ode on the morning of christs nativity approaches the highwater mark of lyric poetry in england in the next six years from 1631 to 1637 he wrote but little scarcely more than two thousand lines but these are among the most exquisite and the most perfectly finished in our language  lallegro and ii penseroso are twin poems containing many lines and short descriptive passages which linger in the mind like strains of music and which are known and loved wherever english is spoken lallegro the joyous or happy man is like an excursion into the english fields at sunrise the air is sweet birds are singing a multitude of sights sounds fragrances fill all the senses and to this appeal of nature the soul of man responds by being happy seeing in every flower and hearing in every harmony some exquisite symbol of human life il penseroso takes us over the same ground at twilight and at moonrise the air is still fresh and fragrant the symbolism is if possible more tenderly beautiful than before but the gay mood is gone though its memory lingers in the afterglow of the sunset a quiet thoughtfulness takes the place of the pure joyous sensation of the morning a thoughtfulness which is not sad though like all quiet moods it is akin to sadness and which sounds the deeps of human emotion in the presence of nature to quote scattered lines of either poem is to do injustice to both they should be read in their entirety the same day one at morning the other at eventide if one is to appreciate their beauty and suggestiveness  the masque of comus is in many respects the most perfect of miltons poems it was written in 1634 to be performed at ludlow castle before the earl of bridgewater and his friends there is a tradition that the earls three children had been lost in the woods and whether true or not milton takes the simple theme of a person lost calls in an attendant spirit to protect the wanderer and out of this with its natural action and melodious songs makes the most exquisite pastoral drama that we possess in form it is a masque like those gorgeous products of the elizabethan age of which ben jonson was the master england had borrowed the idea of the masque from italy and had used it as the chief entertainment at all festivals until it had become to the nobles of england what the miracle play had been to the common people of a previous generation milton with his strong puritan spirit could not be content with the mere entertainment of an idle hour comus has the gorgeous scenic effects the music and dancing of other masques but its moral purpose and its ideal teachings are unmistakable the triumph of virtue would be a better name for this perfect little masque for its theme is that virtue and innocence can walk through any peril of this world without permanent harm this eternal triumph of good over evil is proclaimed by the attendant spirit who has protected the innocent in this life and who now disappears from mortal sight to resume its life of joy      mortals that would follow me     love virtue she alone is free     she can teach ye how to climb     higher than the sphery chime     or if virtue feeble were     heaven itself would stoop to her  while there are undoubted traces of jonson and john fletcher in miltons comus the poem far surpasses its predecessors in the airy beauty and melody of its verses  in the next poem lycidas a pastoral elegy written in 1637 and the last of his horton poems milton is no longer the inheritor of the old age but the prophet of a new a college friend edward king had been drowned in the irish sea and milton follows the poetic custom of his age by representing both his friend and himself in the guise of shepherds leading the pastoral life milton also uses all the symbolism of his predecessors introducing fauns satyrs and sea nymphs but again the puritan is not content with heathen symbolism and so introduces a new symbol of the christian shepherd responsible for the souls of men whom he likens to hungry sheep that look up and are not fed the puritans and royalists at this time were drifting rapidly apart and milton uses his new symbolism to denounce the abuses that had crept into the church in any other poet this moral teaching would hinder the free use of the imagination but milton seems equal to the task of combining high moral purpose with the noblest poetry in its exquisite finish and exhaustless imagery lycidas surpasses most of the poetry of what is often called the pagan renaissance  besides these wellknown poems milton wrote in this early period a fragmentary masque called arcades several latin poems which like his english are exquisitely finished and his famous sonnets which brought this italian form of verse nearly to the point of perfection in them he seldom wrote of love the usual subject with his predecessors but of patriotism duty music and subjects of political interest suggested by the struggle into which england was drifting among these sonnets each reader must find his own favorites those best known and most frequently quoted are on his deceased wife to the nightingale on reaching the age of twentythree the massacre in piedmont and the two on his blindness  miltons prose of miltons prose works there are many divergent opinions ranging from macaulays unbounded praise to the condemnation of some of our modern critics from a literary view point miltons prose would be stronger if less violent and a modern writer would hardly be excused for using his language or his methods but we must remember the times and the methods of his opponents in his fiery zeal against injustice the poet is suddenly dominated by the soldiers spirit he first musters his facts in battalions and charges upon the enemy to crush and overpower without mercy for milton hates injustice and because it is an enemy of his people he cannot and will not spare it when the victory is won he exults in a paean of victory as soulstirring as the song of deborah he is the poet again spite of himself and his mind fills with magnificent images even with a subject so dull so barren of the bare possibilities of poetry as his animadversions upon the remonstrants defense he breaks out into an invocation oh thou that sittest in light and glory unapproachable parent of angels and men which is like a chapter from the apocalypse in such passages miltons prose is as taine suggests an outpouring of splendors which suggests the noblest poetry  on account of their controversial character these prose works are seldom read and it is probable that milton never thought of them as worthy of a place in literature of them all areopagitica has perhaps the most permanent interest and is best worth reading in miltons time there was a law forbidding the publication of books until they were indorsed by the official censor needless to say the censor holding his office and salary by favor was naturally more concerned with the divine right of kings and bishops than with the delights of literature and many books were suppressed for no better reason than that they were displeasing to the authorities milton protested against this as against every other form of tyranny and his areopagiticaso called from the areopagus or forum of athens the place of public appeal and the mars hill of st pauls addressis the most famous plea in english for the freedom of the press  miltons later poetry undoubtedly the noblest of miltons works written when he was blind and suffering are paradise lost paradise regained and samson agonistes the first is the greatest indeed the only generally acknowledged epic in our literature since beowulf the last is the most perfect specimen of a drama after the greek method in our language  of the history of the great epic we have some interesting glimpses in cambridge there is preserved a notebook of miltons containing a list of nearly one hundred subjects167 for a great poem selected while he was a boy at the university king arthur attracted him at first but his choice finally settled upon the fall of man and we have four separate outlines showing miltons proposed treatment of the subject these outlines indicate that he contemplated a mighty drama or miracle play but whether because of puritan antipathy to plays and players or because of the wretched dramatic treatment of religious subjects which milton had witnessed in italy he abandoned the idea of a play and settled on the form of an epic poem most fortunately it must be conceded for milton had not the knowledge of men necessary for a drama as a study of character paradise lost would be a grievous failure adam the central character is something of a prig while satan looms up a magnificent figure entirely different from the devil of the miracle plays and completely overshadowing the hero both in interest and in manliness the other characters the almighty the son raphael michael the angels and fallen spirits are merely mouthpieces for miltons declamations without any personal or human interest regarded as a drama therefore paradise lost could never have been a success but as poetry with its sublime imagery its harmonious verse its titanic background of heaven hell and the illimitable void that lies between it is unsurpassed in any literature  in 1658 milton in his darkness sat down to dictate the work which he had planned thirty years before in order to understand the mighty sweep of the poem it is necessary to sum up the argument of the twelve books as follows  book i opens with a statement of the subject the fall of man and a noble invocation for light and divine guidance then begins the account of satan and the rebel angels their banishment from heaven and their plot to oppose the design of the almighty by dragging down his children our first parents from their state of innocence the book closes with a description of the land of fire and endless pain where the fallen spirits abide and the erection of pandemonium the palace of satan book ii is a description of the council of evil spirits of satans consent to undertake the temptation of adam and eve and his journey to the gates of hell which are guarded by sin and death book iii transports us to heaven again god foreseeing the fall sends raphael to warn adam and eve so that their disobedience shall be upon their own heads then the son offers himself a sacrifice to take away the sin of the coming disobedience of man at the end of this book satan appears in a different scene meets uriel the angel of the sun inquires from him the way to earth and takes his journey thither disguised as an angel of light book iv shows us paradise and the innocent state of man an angel guard is set over eden and satan is arrested while tempting eve in a dream but is curiously allowed to go free again book v shows us eve relating her dream to adam and then the morning prayer and the daily employment of our first parents raphael visits them is entertained by a banquet which eve proposes in order to show him that all gods gifts are not kept in heaven and tells them of the revolt of the fallen spirits his story is continued in book vi in book vii we read the story of the creation of the world as raphael tells it to adam and eve in book viii adam tells raphael the story of his own life and of his meeting with eve book ix is the story of the temptation by satan following the account in genesis book x records the divine judgment upon adam and eve shows the construction by sin and death of a highway through chaos to the earth and satans return to pandemonium adam and eve repent of their disobedience and satan and his angels are turned into serpents in book xi the almighty accepts adams repentance but condemns him to be banished from paradise and the archangel michael is sent to execute the sentence at the end of the book after eves feminine grief at the loss of paradise michael begins a prophetic vision of the destiny of man book xii continues michaels vision adam and eve are comforted by hearing of the future redemption of their race the poem ends as they wander forth out of paradise and the door closes behind them  it will be seen that this is a colossal epic not of a man or a hero but of the whole race of men and that miltons characters are such as no human hand could adequately portray but the scenes the splendors of heaven the horrors of hell the serene beauty of paradise the sun and planets suspended between celestial light and gross darkness are pictured with an imagination that is almost superhuman the abiding interest of the poem is in these colossal pictures and in the lofty thought and the marvelous melody with which they are impressed on our minds the poem is in blank verse and not until milton used it did we learn the infinite variety and harmony of which it is capable he played with it changing its melody and movement on every page as an organist out of a single theme develops an unending variety of harmony  lamartine has described paradise lost as the dream of a puritan fallen asleep over his bible and this suggestive description leads us to the curious fact that it is the dream not the theology or the descriptions of bible scenes that chiefly interests us thus milton describes the separation of earth and water and there is little or nothing added to the simplicity and strength of genesis but the sunset which follows is miltons own dream and instantly we are transported to a land of beauty and poetry      now came still evening on and twilight gray     had in her sober livery all things clad     silence accompanied for beast and bird     they to their grassy couch these to their nests     were slunk all but the wakeful nightingale     she all night long her amorous descant sung     silence was pleased now glowed the firmament     with living sapphires hesperus that led     the starry host rode brightest till the moon     rising in clouded majesty at length     apparent queen unveiled her peerless light     and oer the dark her silver mantle threw  so also miltons almighty considered purely as a literary character is unfortunately tinged with the narrow and literal theology of the time he is a being enormously egotistic the despot rather than the servant of the universe seated upon a throne with a chorus of angels about him eternally singing his praises and ministering to a kind of divine vanity it is not necessary to search heaven for such a character the type is too common upon earth but in satan milton breaks away from crude mediæval conceptions he follows the dream again and gives us a character to admire and understand      is this the region this the soil the clime     said then the lost archangel this the seat     that we must change for heaventhis mournful gloom     for that celestial light be it so since he     who now is sovran can dispose and bid     what shall be right farthest from him is best     whom reason hath equalled force hath made supreme     above his equals farewell happy fields     where joy forever dwells hail horrors hail     infernal world and thou profoundest hell     receive thy new possessorone who brings     a mind not to be changed by place or time     the mind is its own place and in itself     can make a heaven of hell a hell of heaven     what matter where if i be still the same     and what i should be all but less than he     whom thunder hath made greater here at least     we shall be free the almighty hath not built     here for his envy will not drive us hence     here we may reign secure and in my choice     to reign is worth ambition though in hell     better to reign in hell than serve in heaven  in this magnificent heroism milton has unconsciously immortalized the puritan spirit the same unconquerable spirit that set men to writing poems and allegories when in prison for the faith and that sent them over the stormy sea in a cockleshell to found a free commonwealth in the wilds of america  for a modern reader the understanding of paradise lost presupposes two thingsa knowledge of the first chapters of the scriptures and of the general principles of calvinistic theology but it is a pity to use the poem as has so often been done to teach a literal acceptance of one or the other of the theology of paradise lost the least said the better but to the splendor of the puritan dream and the glorious melody of its expression no words can do justice even a slight acquaintance will make the reader understand why it ranks with the divina commedia of dante and why it is generally accepted by critics as the greatest single poem in our literature  soon after the completion of paradise lost thomas ellwood a friend of milton asked one day after reading the paradise manuscript but what hast thou to say of paradise found it was in response to this suggestion that milton wrote the second part of the great epic known to us as paradise regained the first tells how mankind in the person of adam fell at the first temptation by satan and became an outcast from paradise and from divine grace the second shows how mankind in the person of christ withstands the tempter and is established once more in the divine favor christs temptation in the wilderness is the theme and milton follows the account in the fourth chapter of matthews gospel though paradise regained was miltons favorite and though it has many passages of noble thought and splendid imagery equal to the best of paradise lost the poem as a whole falls below the level of the first and is less interesting to read  in samson agonistes milton turns to a more vital and personal theme and his genius transfigures the story of samson the mighty champion of israel now blind and scorned working as a slave among the philistines the poets aim was to present in english a pure tragedy with all the passion and restraint which marked the old greek dramas that he succeeded where others failed is due to two causes first milton himself suggests the hero of one of the greek tragedieshis sorrow and affliction give to his noble nature that touch of melancholy and calm dignity which is in perfect keeping with his subject second milton is telling his own story like samson he had struggled mightily against the enemies of his race he had taken a wife from the philistines and had paid the penalty he was blind alone scorned by his vain and thoughtless masters to the essential action of the tragedy milton could add therefore that touch of intense yet restrained personal feeling which carries more conviction than any argument samson is in many respects the most convincing of his works entirely apart from the interest of its subject and treatment one may obtain from it a better idea of what great tragedy was among the greeks than from any other work in our language      nothing is here for tears nothing to wail     or knock the breast no weakness no contempt     dispraise or blamenothing but well and fair     and what may quiet us in a death so noble   iii prose writers of the puritan period  john bunyan 16281688  as there is but one poet great enough to express the puritan spirit so there is but one commanding prose writer john bunyan milton was the child of the renaissance inheritor of all its culture and the most profoundly educated man of his age bunyan was a poor uneducated tinker from the renaissance he inherited nothing but from the reformation he received an excess of that spiritual independence which had caused the puritan struggle for liberty these two men representing the extremes of english life in the seventeenth century wrote the two works that stand today for the mighty puritan spirit one gave us the only epic since beowulf the other gave us our only great allegory which has been read more than any other book in our language save the bible  life of bunyan bunyan is an extraordinary figure we must study him as well as his books fortunately we have his life story in his own words written with the same lovable modesty and sincerity that marked all his work reading that story now in grace abounding we see two great influences at work in his life one from within was his own vivid imagination which saw visions allegories parables revelations in every common event the other from without was the spiritual ferment of the age the multiplication of strange sectsquakers freewillers ranters anabaptists millenariansand the untempered zeal of all classes like an engine without a balance wheel when men were breaking away from authority and setting up their own religious standards bunyans life is an epitome of that astonishing religious individualism which marked the close of the english reformation  he was born in the little village of elstow near bedford in 1628 the son of a poor tinker for a little while the boy was sent to school where he learned to read and write after a fashion but he was soon busy in his fathers shop where amid the glowing pots and the fire and smoke of his little forge he saw vivid pictures of hell and the devils which haunted him all his life when he was sixteen years old his father married the second time whereupon bunyan ran away and became a soldier in the parliamentary army  the religious ferment of the age made a tremendous impression on bunyans sensitive imagination he went to church occasionally only to find himself wrapped in terrors and torments by some fiery itinerant preacher and he would rush violently away from church to forget his fears by joining in sunday sports on the village green as night came on the sports were forgotten but the terrors returned multiplied like the evil spirits of the parable visions of hell and the demons swarmed in his brain he would groan aloud in his remorse and even years afterwards he bemoans the sins of his early life when we look for them fearfully expecting some shocking crimes and misdemeanors we find that they consisted of playing ball on sunday and swearing the latter sin sad to say was begun by listening to his father cursing some obstinate kettle which refused to be tinkered and it was perfected in the parliamentary army one day his terrible swearing scared a woman a very loose and ungodly wretch as he tells us who reprimanded him for his profanity the reproach of the poor woman went straight home like the voice of a prophet all his profanity left him he hung down his head with shame i wished with all my heart he says that i might be a little child again that my father might learn me to speak without this wicked way of swearing with characteristic vehemence bunyan hurls himself upon a promise of scripture and instantly the reformation begins to work in his soul he casts out the habit root and branch and finds to his astonishment that he can speak more freely and vigorously than before nothing is more characteristic of the man than this sudden seizing upon a text which he had doubtless heard many times before and being suddenly raised up or cast down by its influence  with bunyans marriage to a good woman the real reformation in his life began while still in his teens he married a girl as poor as himself we came together he says as poor as might be having not so much household stuff as a dish or spoon between us both the only dowry which the girl brought to her new home was two old threadbare books the plain mans pathway to heaven and the practice of piety168 bunyan read these books which instantly gave fire to his imagination he saw new visions and dreamed terrible new dreams of lost souls his attendance at church grew exemplary he began slowly and painfully to read the bible for himself but because of his own ignorance and the contradictory interpretations of scripture which he heard on every side he was tossed about like a feather by all the winds of doctrine  the record of the next few years is like a nightmare so terrible is bunyans spiritual struggle one day he feels himself an outcast the next the companion of angels the third he tries experiments with the almighty in order to put his salvation to the proof as he goes along the road to bedford he thinks he will work a miracle like gideon with his fleece he will say to the little puddles of water in the horses tracks be ye dry and to all the dry tracks he will say be ye puddles as he is about to perform the miracle a thought occurs to him but go first under yonder hedge and pray that the lord will make you able to perform a miracle he goes promptly and prays then he is afraid of the test and goes on his way more troubled than before  after years of such struggle chased about between heaven and hell bunyan at last emerges into a saner atmosphere even as pilgrim came out of the horrible valley of the shadow soon led by his intense feelings he becomes an openair preacher and crowds of laborers gather about him on the village green they listen in silence to his words they end in groans and tears scores of them amend their sinful lives for the anglosaxon people are remarkable for this that however deeply they are engaged in business or pleasure they are still sensitive as barometers to any true spiritual influence whether of priest or peasant they recognize what emerson calls the accent of the holy ghost and in this recognition of spiritual leadership lies the secret of their democracy so this village tinker with his strength and sincerity is presently the acknowledged leader of an immense congregation and his influence is felt throughout england it is a tribute to his power that after the return of charles ii bunyan was the first to be prohibited from holding public meetings  concerning bunyans imprisonment in bedford jail which followed his refusal to obey the law prohibiting religious meetings without the authority of the established church there is a difference of opinion that the law was unjust goes without saying but there was no religious persecution as we understand the term bunyan was allowed to worship when and how he pleased he was simply forbidden to hold public meetings which frequently became fierce denunciations of the established church and government his judges pleaded with bunyan to conform with the law he refused saying that when the spirit was upon him he must go up and down the land calling on men everywhere to repent in his refusal we see much heroism a little obstinacy and perhaps something of that desire for martyrdom which tempts every spiritual leader that his final sentence to indefinite imprisonment was a hard blow to bunyan is beyond question he groaned aloud at the thought of his poor family and especially at the thought of leaving his little blind daughter  i found myself a man encompassed with infirmities the parting was like pulling the flesh from my bones oh the thoughts of the hardship i thought my poor blind one might go under would break my heart to pieces poor child thought i what sorrow thou art like to have for thy portion in this world thou must be beaten must beg suffer hunger cold nakedness and a thousand calamities though i cannot now endure that the wind should blow upon thee169  and then because he thinks always in parables and seeks out most curious texts of scripture he speaks of the two milch kine that were to carry the ark of god into another country and leave their calves behind them poor cows poor bunyan such is the mind of this extraordinary man  with characteristic diligence bunyan set to work in prison making shoe laces and so earned a living for his family his imprisonment lasted for nearly twelve years but he saw his family frequently and was for some time a regular preacher in the baptist church in bedford occasionally he even went about late at night holding the proscribed meetings and increasing his hold upon the common people the best result of this imprisonment was that it gave bunyan long hours for the working of his peculiar mind and for study of his two only books the king james bible and foxes book of martyrs the result of his study and meditation was the pilgrims progress which was probably written in prison but which for some reason he did not publish till long after his release  the years which followed are the most interesting part of bunyans strange career the publication of pilgrims progress in 1678 made him the most popular writer as he was already the most popular preacher in england books tracts sermons nearly sixty works in all came from his pen and when one remembers his ignorance his painfully slow writing and his activity as an itinerant preacher one can only marvel his evangelistic journeys carried him often as far as london and wherever he went crowds thronged to hear him scholars bishops statesmen went in secret to listen among the laborers and came away wondering and silent at southwark the largest building could not contain the multitude of his hearers and when he preached in london thousands would gather in the cold dusk of the winter morning before work began and listen until he had made an end of speaking bishop bunyan he was soon called on account of his missionary journeys and his enormous influence  what we most admire in the midst of all this activity is his perfect mental balance his charity and humor in the strife of many sects he was badgered for years by petty enemies and he arouses our enthusiasm by his tolerance his selfcontrol and especially by his sincerity to the very end he retained that simple modesty which no success could spoil once when he had preached with unusual power some of his friends waited after the service to congratulate him telling him what a sweet sermon he had delivered aye said bunyan you need not remind me the devil told me that before i was out of the pulpit  for sixteen years this wonderful activity continued without interruption then one day when riding through a cold storm on a labor of love to reconcile a stubborn man with his own stubborn son he caught a severe cold and appeared ill and suffering but rejoicing in his success at the house of a friend in reading he died there a few days later and was laid away in bunhill fields burial ground london which has been ever since a campo santo to the faithful  works of bunyan the worlds literature has three great allegoriesspensers faery queen dantes divina commedia and bunyans pilgrims progress the first appeals to poets the second to scholars the third to people of every age and condition here is a brief outline of the famous work  as i walked through the wilderness of this world i lighted on a certain place where was a den bedford jail and laid me down in that place to sleep and as i slept i dreamed a dream so the story begins he sees a man called christian setting out with a book in his hand and a great load on his back from the city of destruction christian has two objectsto get rid of his burden which holds the sins and fears of his life and to make his way to the holy city at the outset evangelist finds him weeping because he knows not where to go and points him to a wicket gate on a hill far away as christian goes forward his neighbors friends wife and children call to him to come back but he puts his fingers in his ears crying out life life eternal life and so rushes across the plain  then begins a journey in ten stages which is a vivid picture of the difficulties and triumphs of the christian life every trial every difficulty every experience of joy or sorrow of peace or temptation is put into the form and discourse of a living character other allegorists write in poetry and their characters are shadowy and unreal but bunyan speaks in terse idiomatic prose and his characters are living men and women there are mr worldly wiseman a selfsatisfied and dogmatic kind of man youthful ignorance sweet piety courteous demas garrulous talkative honest faithful and a score of others who are not at all the bloodless creatures of the romance of the rose but men real enough to stop you on the road and to hold your attention scene after scene follows in which are pictured many of our own spiritual experiences there is the slough of despond into which we all have fallen out of which pliable scrambles on the hither side and goes back grumbling but through which christian struggles mightily till helpful stretches him a hand and drags him out on solid ground and bids him go on his way then come interpreters house the palace beautiful the lions in the way the valley of humiliation the hard fight with the demon apollyon the more terrible valley of the shadow vanity fair and the trial of faithful the latter is condemned to death by a jury made up of mr blindman mr nogood mr heady mr liveloose mr hatelight and others of their kind to whom questions of justice are committed by the jury system most famous is doubting castle where christian and hopeful are thrown into a dungeon by giant despair and then at last the delectable mountains of youth the deep river that christian must cross and the city of all delight and the glorious company of angels that come singing down the streets at the very end when in sight of the city and while he can hear the welcome with which christian is greeted ignorance is snatched away to go to his own place and bunyan quaintly observes then i saw that there was a way to hell even from the gates of heaven as well as from the city of destruction so i awoke and behold it was a dream  such in brief is the story the great epic of a puritans individual experience in a rough world just as paradise lost was the epic of mankind as dreamed by the great puritan who had fallen asleep over his bible  the chief fact which confronts the student of literature as he pauses before this great allegory is that it has been translated into seventyfive languages and dialects and has been read more than any other book save one in the english language  as for the secret of its popularity taine says next to the bible the book most widely read in england is the pilgrims progress protestantism is the doctrine of salvation by grace and no writer has equaled bunyan in making this doctrine understood and this opinion is echoed by the majority of our literary historians it is perhaps sufficient answer to quote the simple fact that pilgrims progress is not exclusively a protestant study it appeals to christians of every name and to mohammedans and buddhists in precisely the same way that it appeals to christians when it was translated into the languages of catholic countries like france and portugal only one or two incidents were omitted and the story was almost as popular there as with english readers the secret of its success is probably simple it is first of all not a procession of shadows repeating the authors declamations but a real story the first extended story in our language our puritan fathers may have read the story for religious instruction but all classes of men have read it because they found in it a true personal experience told with strength interest humorin a word with all the qualities that such a story should possess young people have read it first for its intrinsic worth because the dramatic interest of the story lured them on to the very end and second because it was their introduction to true allegory the child with his imaginative mindthe man also who has preserved his simplicitynaturally personifies objects and takes pleasure in giving them powers of thinking and speaking like himself bunyan was the first writer to appeal to this pleasant and natural inclination in a way that all could understand add to this the fact that pilgrims progress was the only book having any story interest in the great majority of english and american homes for a full century and we have found the real reason for its wide reading  the holy war published in 1665 is the first important work of bunyan it is a prose paradise lost and would undoubtedly be known as a remarkable allegory were it not overshadowed by its great rival grace abounding to the chief of sinners published in 1666 twelve years before pilgrims progress is the work from which we obtain the clearest insight into bunyans remarkable life and to a man with historical or antiquarian tastes it is still excellent reading in 1682 appeared the life and death of mr badman a realistic character study which is a precursor of the modern novel and in 1684 the second part of pilgrims progress showing the journey of christiana and her children to the city of all delight besides these bunyan published a multitude of treatises and sermons all in the same styledirect simple convincing expressing every thought and emotion perfectly in words that even a child can understand many of these are masterpieces admired by workingmen and scholars alike for their thought and expression take for instance the heavenly footman put it side by side with the best work of latimer and the resemblance in style is startling it is difficult to realize that one work came from an ignorant tinker and the other from a great scholar both engaged in the same general work as bunyans one book was the bible we have here a suggestion of its influence in all our prose literature   minor prose writers  the puritan period is generally regarded as one destitute of literary interest but that was certainly not the result of any lack of books or writers says burton in his anatomy of melancholy  i have  new books every day pamphlets currantoes stories whole catalogues of volumes of all sorts new paradoxes opinions schisms heresies controversies in philosophy and religion now come tidings of weddings maskings entertainments jubilees embassies sports plays then again as in a newshipped scene treasons cheatings tricks robberies enormous villainies in all kinds funerals deaths new discoveries expeditions now comical then tragical matters  so the record continues till one rubs his eyes and thinks he must have picked up by mistake the last literary magazine and for all these kaleidoscopic events there were waiting a multitude of writers ready to seize the abundant material and turn it to literary account for a tract an article a volume or an encyclopedia  if one were to recommend certain of these books as expressive of this age of outward storm and inward calm there are three that deserve more than a passing notice namely the religio medici holy living and the compleat angler the first was written by a busy physician a supposedly scientific man at that time the second by the most learned of english churchmen and the third by a simple merchant and fisherman strangely enough these three great booksthe reflections of nature science and revelationall interpret human life alike and tell the same story of gentleness charity and noble living if the age had produced only these three books we could still be profoundly grateful to it for its inspiring message  robert burton 15771640 burton is famous chiefly as the author of the anatomy of melancholy one of the most astonishing books in all literature which appeared in 1621 burton was a clergyman of the established church an incomprehensible genius given to broodings and melancholy and to reading of every conceivable kind of literature thanks to his wonderful memory everything he read was stored up for use or ornament till his mind resembled a huge curiosity shop all his life he suffered from hypochondria but curiously traced his malady to the stars rather than to his own liver it is related of him that he used to suffer so from despondency that no help was to be found in medicine or theology his only relief was to go down to the river and hear the bargemen swear at one another  burtons anatomy was begun as a medical treatise on morbidness arranged and divided with all the exactness of the schoolmens demonstration of doctrines but it turned out to be an enormous hodgepodge of quotations and references to authors known and unknown living and dead which seemed to prove chiefly that much study is a weariness to the flesh by some freak of taste it became instantly popular and was proclaimed one of the greatest books in literature a few scholars still explore it with delight as a mine of classic wealth but the style is hopelessly involved and to the ordinary reader most of his numerous references are now as unmeaning as a hyperjacobian surface  sir thomas browne 16051682 browne was a physician who after much study and travel settled down to his profession in norwich but even then he gave far more time to the investigation of natural phenomena than to the barbarous practices which largely constituted the art of medicine in his day he was known far and wide as a learned doctor and an honest man whose scientific studies had placed him in advance of his age and whose religious views were liberal to the point of heresy with this in mind it is interesting to note as a sign of the times that this most scientific doctor was once called to give expert testimony in the case of two old women who were being tried for the capital crime of witchcraft he testified under oath that the fits were natural but heightened by the devils coöperating with the witches at whose instance he the alleged devil did the villainies  brownes great work is the religio medici ie the religion of a physician 1642 which met with most unusual success hardly ever was a book published in britain says oldys a chronicler who wrote nearly a century later that made more noise than the religio medici its success may be due largely to the fact that among thousands of religious works it was one of the few which saw in nature a profound revelation and which treated purely religious subjects in a reverent kindly tolerant way without ecclesiastical bias it is still therefore excellent reading but it is not so much the matter as the mannerthe charm the gentleness the remarkable prose stylewhich has established the book as one of the classics of our literature  two other works of browne are vulgar errors 1646 a curious combination of scientific and credulous research in the matter of popular superstition and urn burial a treatise suggested by the discovery of roman burial urns at walsingham it began as an inquiry into the various methods of burial but ended in a dissertation on the vanity of earthly hope and ambitions from a literary point of view it is brownes best work but is less read than the religio medici  thomas fuller 16081661 fuller was a clergyman and royalist whose lively style and witty observations would naturally place him with the gay caroline poets his best known works are the holy war the holy state and the profane state church history of britain and the history of the worthies of england the holy and profane state is chiefly a biographical record the first part consisting of numerous historical examples to be imitated the second of examples to be avoided the church history is not a scholarly work notwithstanding its authors undoubted learning but is a lively and gossipy account which has at least one virtue that it entertains the reader the worthies the most widely read of his works is a racy account of the important men of england fuller traveled constantly for years collecting information from outoftheway sources and gaining a minute knowledge of his own country this with his overflowing humor and numerous anecdotes and illustrations makes lively and interesting reading indeed we hardly find a dull page in any of his numerous books  jeremy taylor 16131667 taylor was the greatest of the clergymen who made this period famous a man who like milton upheld a noble ideal in storm and calm and himself lived it nobly he has been called the shakespeare of divines and a kind of spenser in a cassock and both descriptions apply to him very well his writings with their exuberant fancy and their noble diction belong rather to the elizabethan than to the puritan age  from the large number of his works two stand out as representative of the man himself the liberty of prophesying 1646 which hallam calls the first plea for tolerance in religion on a comprehensive basis and on deepseated foundations and the rules and exercises of holy living 1650 to the latter might be added its companion volume holy dying published in the following year the holy living and dying as a single volume was for many years read in almost every english cottage with baxters saints rest pilgrims progress and the king james bible it often constituted the entire library of multitudes of puritan homes and as we read its noble words and breathe its gentle spirit we cannot help wishing that our modern libraries were gathered together on the same thoughtful foundations  richard baxter 16151691 this busiest man of his age strongly suggests bunyan in his life and writings like bunyan he was poor and uneducated a nonconformist minister exposed continually to insult and persecution and like bunyan he threw himself heart and soul into the conflicts of his age and became by his public speech a mighty power among the common people unlike jeremy taylor who wrote for the learned and whose involved sentences and classical allusions are sometimes hard to follow baxter went straight to his mark appealing directly to the judgment and feeling of his readers  the number of his works is almost incredible when one thinks of his busy life as a preacher and the slowness of manual writing in all he left nearly one hundred and seventy different works which if collected would make fifty or sixty volumes as he wrote chiefly to influence men on the immediate questions of the day most of this work has fallen into oblivion his two most famous books are the saints everlasting rest and a call to the unconverted both of which were exceedingly popular running through scores of successive editions and have been widely read in our own generation  izaak walton 15931683 walton was a small tradesman of london who preferred trout brooks and good reading to the profits of business and the doubtful joys of a city life so at fifty years when he had saved a little money he left the city and followed his heart out into the country he began his literary work or rather his recreation by writing his famous liveskindly and readable appreciations of donne wotton hooker herbert and sanderson which stand at the beginning of modern biographical writing  in 1653 appeared the compleat angler which has grown steadily in appreciation and which is probably more widely read than any other book on the subject of fishing it begins with a conversation between a falconer a hunter and an angler but the angler soon does most of the talking as fishermen sometimes do the hunter becomes a disciple and learns by the easy method of hearing the fisherman discourse about his art the conversations it must be confessed are often diffuse and pedantic but they only make us feel most comfortably sleepy as one invariably feels after a good days fishing so kindly is the spirit of the angler so exquisite his appreciation of the beauty of the earth and sky that one returns to the book as to a favorite trout stream with the undying expectation of catching something among a thousand books on angling it stands almost alone in possessing a charming style and so it will probably be read as long as men go fishing best of all it leads to a better appreciation of nature and it drops little moral lessons into the readers mind as gently as one casts a fly to a wary trout so that one never suspects his better nature is being angled for though we have sometimes seen anglers catch more than they need or sneak ahead of brother fishermen to the best pools we are glad for waltons sake to overlook such unaccountable exceptions and agree with the milkmaid that we love all anglers they be such honest civil quiet men  summary of the puritan period the half century between 1625 and 1675 is called the puritan period for two reasons first because puritan standards prevailed for a time in england and second because the greatest literary figure during all these years was the puritan john milton historically the age was one of tremendous conflict the puritan struggled for righteousness and liberty and because he prevailed the age is one of moral and political revolution in his struggle for liberty the puritan overthrew the corrupt monarchy beheaded charles i and established the commonwealth under cromwell the commonwealth lasted but a few years and the restoration of charles ii in 1660 is often put as the end of the puritan period the age has no distinct limits but overlaps the elizabethan period on one side and the restoration period on the other  the age produced many writers a few immortal books and one of the worlds great literary leaders the literature of the age is extremely diverse in character and the diversity is due to the breaking up of the ideals of political and religious unity this literature differs from that of the preceding age in three marked ways 1 it has no unity of spirit as in the days of elizabeth resulting from the patriotic enthusiasm of all classes 2 in contrast with the hopefulness and vigor of elizabethan writings much of the literature of this period is somber in character it saddens rather than inspires us 3 it has lost the romantic impulse of youth and become critical and intellectual it makes us think rather than feel deeply  in our study we have noted 1 the transition poets of whom daniel is chief 2 the song writers campion and breton 3 the spenserian poets wither and giles fletcher 4 the metaphysical poets donne and herbert 5 the cavalier poets herrick carew lovelace and suckling 6 john milton his life his early or

period of the restoration 16601700  the age of french influence  history of the period it seems a curious contradiction at first glance to place the return of charles ii at the beginning of modern england as our historians are wont to do for there was never a time when the progress of liberty which history records was more plainly turned backwards the puritan régime had been too severe it had repressed too many natural pleasures now released from restraint society abandoned the decencies of life and the reverence for law itself and plunged into excesses more unnatural than had been the restraints of puritanism the inevitable effect of excess is disease and for almost an entire generation following the restoration in 1660 england lay sick of a fever socially politically morally london suggests an italian city in the days of the medici and its literature especially its drama often seems more like the delirium of illness than the expression of a healthy mind but even a fever has its advantages whatever impurity is in the blood is burnt and purged away and a man rises from fever with a new strength and a new idea of the value of life like king hezekiah who after his sickness and fear of death resolved to go softly all his days the restoration was the great crisis in english history and that england lived through it was due solely to the strength and excellence of that puritanism which she thought she had flung to the winds when she welcomed back a vicious monarch at dover the chief lesson of the restoration was thisthat it showed by awful contrast the necessity of truth and honesty and of a strong government of free men for which the puritan had stood like a rock in every hour of his rugged history through fever england came slowly back to health through gross corruption in society and in the state england learned that her people were at heart sober sincere religious folk and that their character was naturally too strong to follow after pleasure and be satisfied so puritanism suddenly gained all that it had struggled for and gained it even in the hour when all seemed lost when milton in his sorrow unconsciously portrayed the government of charles and his cabal in that tremendous scene of the council of the infernal peers in pandemonium plotting the ruin of the world  of the king and his followers it is difficult to write temperately most of the dramatic literature of the time is atrocious and we can understand it only as we remember the character of the court and society for which it was written unspeakably vile in his private life the king had no redeeming patriotism no sense of responsibility to his country for even his public acts he gave high offices to blackguards stole from the exchequer like a common thief played off catholics and protestants against each other disregarding his pledges to both alike broke his solemn treaty with the dutch and with his own ministers and betrayed his country for french money to spend on his own pleasures it is useless to paint the dishonor of a court which followed gayly after such a leader the first parliament while it contained some noble and patriotic members was dominated by young men who remembered the excess of puritan zeal but forgot the despotism and injustice which had compelled puritanism to stand up and assert the manhood of england these young politicians vied with the king in passing laws for the subjugation of church and state and in their thirst for revenge upon all who had been connected with cromwells iron government once more a wretched formalismthat perpetual danger to the english churchcame to the front and exercised authority over the free churches the house of lords was largely increased by the creation of hereditary titles and estates for ignoble men and shameless women who had flattered the kings vanity even the bench that last strong refuge of english justice was corrupted by the appointment of judges like the brutal jeffreys whose aim like that of their royal master was to get money and to exercise power without personal responsibility amid all this dishonor the foreign influence and authority of cromwells strong government vanished like smoke the valiant little dutch navy swept the english fleet from the sea and only the thunder of dutch guns in the thames under the very windows of london awoke the nation to the realization of how low it had fallen  two considerations must modify our judgment of this disheartening spectacle first the king and his court are not england though our histories are largely filled with the records of kings and soldiers of intrigues and fighting these no more express the real life of a people than fever and delirium express a normal manhood though king and court and high society arouse our disgust or pity records are not wanting to show that private life in england remained honest and pure even in the worst days of the restoration while london society might be entertained by the degenerate poetry of rochester and the dramas of dryden and wycherley english scholars hailed milton with delight and the common people followed bunyan and baxter with their tremendous appeal to righteousness and liberty second the king with all his pretensions to divine right remained only a figurehead and the anglosaxon people when they tire of one figurehead have always the will and the power to throw it overboard and choose a better one the country was divided into two political parties the whigs who sought to limit the royal power in the interests of parliament and the people and the tories who strove to check the growing power of the people in the interests of their hereditary rulers both parties however were largely devoted to the anglican church and when james ii after four years of misrule attempted to establish a national catholicism by intrigues which aroused the protest of the pope171 as well as of parliament then whigs and tories catholics and protestants united in englands last great revolution  the complete and bloodless revolution of 1688 which called william of orange to the throne was simply the indication of englands restored health and sanity it proclaimed that she had not long forgotten and could never again forget the lesson taught her by puritanism in its hundred years of struggle and sacrifice modern england was firmly established by the revolution which was brought about by the excesses of the restoration  literary characteristics in the literature of the restoration we note a sudden breaking away from old standards just as society broke away from the restraints of puritanism many of the literary men had been driven out of england with charles and his court or else had followed their patrons into exile in the days of the commonwealth on their return they renounced old ideals and demanded that english poetry and drama should follow the style to which they had become accustomed in the gayety of paris we read with astonishment in pepyss diary 16601669 that he has been to see a play called midsummer nights dream but that he will never go again to hear shakespeare for it is the most insipid ridiculous play that ever i saw in my life and again we read in the diary of evelynanother writer who reflects with wonderful accuracy the life and spirit of the restorationi saw hamlet played but now the old plays begin to disgust this refined age since his majestys being so long abroad since shakespeare and the elizabethans were no longer interesting literary men began to imitate the french writers with whose works they had just grown familiar and here begins the socalled period of french influence which shows itself in english literature for the next century instead of the italian influence which had been dominant since spenser and the elizabethans  one has only to consider for a moment the french writers of this period pascal bossuet fénelon malherbe corneille racine molièreall that brilliant company which makes the reign of louis xiv the elizabethan age of french literatureto see how far astray the early writers of the restoration went in their wretched imitation when a man takes another for his model he should copy virtues not vices but unfortunately many english writers reversed the rule copying the vices of french comedy without any of its wit or delicacy or abundant ideas the poems of rochester the plays of dryden wycherley congreve vanbrugh and farquhar all popular in their day are mostly unreadable miltons sons of belial flown with insolence and wine is a good expression of the vile character of the court writers and of the london theaters for thirty years following the restoration such work can never satisfy a people and when jeremy collier172 in 1698 published a vigorous attack upon the evil plays and the playwrights of the day all london tired of the coarseness and excesses of the restoration joined the literary revolution and the corrupt drama was driven from the stage  with the final rejection of the restoration drama we reach a crisis in the history of our literature the old elizabethan spirit with its patriotism its creative vigor its love of romance and the puritan spirit with its moral earnestness and individualism were both things of the past and at first there was nothing to take their places dryden the greatest writer of the age voiced a general complaint when he said that in his prose and poetry he was drawing the outlines of a new art but had no teacher to instruct him but literature is a progressive art and soon the writers of the age developed two marked tendencies of their ownthe tendency to realism and the tendency to that preciseness and elegance of expression which marks our literature for the next hundred years  in realismthat is the representation of men exactly as they are the expression of the plain unvarnished truth without regard to ideals or romancethe tendency was at first thoroughly bad the early restoration writers sought to paint realistic pictures of a corrupt court and society and as we have suggested they emphasized vices rather than virtues and gave us coarse low plays without interest or moral significance like hobbes they saw only the externals of man his body and appetites not his soul and its ideals and so like most realists they resemble a man lost in the woods who wanders aimlessly around in circles seeing the confusing trees but never the whole forest and who seldom thinks of climbing the nearest high hill to get his bearings later however this tendency to realism became more wholesome while it neglected romantic poetry in which youth is eternally interested it led to a keener study of the practical motives which govern human action  the second tendency of the age was toward directness and simplicity of expression and to this excellent tendency our literature is greatly indebted in both the elizabethan and the puritan ages the general tendency of writers was towards extravagance of thought and language sentences were often involved and loaded with latin quotations and classical allusions the restoration writers opposed this vigorously from france they brought back the tendency to regard established rules for writing to emphasize close reasoning rather than romantic fancy and to use short cleancut sentences without an unnecessary word we see this french influence in the royal society173 which had for one of its objects the reform of english prose by getting rid of its swellings of style and which bound all its members to use a close naked natural way of speaking  as near to mathematical plainness as they can dryden accepted this excellent rule for his prose and adopted the heroic couplet as the next best thing for the greater part of his poetry as he tells us himself      and this unpolished rugged verse i chose     as fittest for discourse and nearest prose  it is largely due to him that writers developed that formalism of style that precise almost mathematical elegance miscalled classicism which ruled english literature for the next century174  another thing which the reader will note with interest in restoration literature is the adoption of the heroic couplet that is two iambic pentameter lines which rime together as the most suitable form of poetry waller175 who began to use it in 1623 is generally regarded as the father of the couplet for he is the first poet to use it consistently in the bulk of his poetry chaucer had used the rimed couplet wonderfully well in his canterbury tales but in chaucer it is the poetical thought more than the expression which delights us with the restoration writers form counts for everything waller and dryden made the couplet the prevailing literary fashion and in their hands the couplet becomes closed that is each pair of lines must contain a complete thought stated as precisely as possible thus waller writes      the souls dark cottage battered and decayed     lets in new light through chinks that time has made176  that is a kind of aphorism such as pope made in large quantities in the following age it contains a thought is catchy quotable easy to remember and the restoration writers delighted in it soon this mechanical closed couplet in which the second line was often made first177 almost excluded all other forms of poetry it was dominant in england for a full century and we have grown familiar with it and somewhat weary of its monotony in such famous poems as popes essay on man and goldsmiths deserted village these however are essays rather than poems that even the couplet is capable of melody and variety is shown in chaucers tales and in keatss exquisite endymion  these four things the tendency to vulgar realism in the drama a general formalism which came from following set rules the development of a simpler and more direct prose style and the prevalence of the heroic couplet in poetry are the main characteristics of restoration literature they are all exemplified in the work of one man john dryden   john dryden 16311700  dryden is the greatest literary figure of the restoration and in his work we have an excellent reflection of both the good and the evil tendencies of the age in which he lived if we can think for a moment of literature as a canal of water we may appreciate the figure that dryden is the lock by which the waters of english poetry were let down from the mountains of shakespeare and milton to the plain of pope that is he stands between two very different ages and serves as a transition from one to the other  life drydens life contains so many conflicting elements of greatness and littleness that the biographer is continually taken away from the facts which are his chief concern to judge motives which are manifestly outside his knowledge and business judged by his own opinion of himself as expressed in the numerous prefaces to his works dryden was the soul of candor writing with no other master than literature and with no other object than to advance the welfare of his age and nation judged by his acts he was apparently a timeserver catering to a depraved audience in his dramas and dedicating his work with much flattery to those who were easily cajoled by their vanity into sharing their purse and patronage in this however he only followed the general custom of the time and is above many of his contemporaries  dryden was born in the village of aldwinkle northamptonshire in 1631 his family were prosperous people who brought him up in the strict puritan faith and sent him first to the famous westminster school and then to cambridge he made excellent use of his opportunities and studied eagerly becoming one of the best educated men of his age especially in the classics though of remarkable literary taste he showed little evidence of literary ability up to the age of thirty by his training and family connections he was allied to the puritan party and his only wellknown work of this period the heroic stanzas was written on the death of cromwell      his grandeur he derived from heaven alone       for he was great ere fortune made him so     and wars like mists that rise against the sun       made him but greater seem not greater grow  in these four lines taken almost at random from the heroic stanzas we have an epitome of the thought the preciseness and the polish that mark all his literary work  this poem made dryden well known and he was in a fair way to become the new poet of puritanism when the restoration made a complete change in his methods he had come to london for a literary life and when the royalists were again in power he placed himself promptly on the winning side his astraea redux a poem of welcome to charles ii and his panegyric to his sacred majesty breathe more devotion to the old goat as the king was known to his courtiers than had his earlier poems to puritanism  in 1667 he became more widely known and popular by his annus mirabilis a narrative poem describing the terrors of the great fire in london and some events of the disgraceful war with holland but with the theaters reopened and nightly filled the drama offered the most attractive field to one who made his living by literature so dryden turned to the stage and agreed to furnish three plays yearly for the actors of the kings theater for nearly twenty years the best of his life dryden gave himself up to this unfortunate work both by nature and habit he seems to have been clean in his personal life but the stage demanded unclean plays and dryden followed his audience that he deplored this is evident from some of his later work and we have his statement that he wrote only one play his best to please himself this was all for love which was written in blank verse most of the others being in rimed couplets  during this time dryden had become the best known literary man of london and was almost as much a dictator to the literary set which gathered in the taverns and coffeehouses as ben jonson had been before him his work meanwhile was rewarded by large financial returns and by his being appointed poet laureate and collector of the port of london the latter office it may be remembered had once been held by chaucer  at fifty years of age and before jeremy collier had driven his dramas from the stage dryden turned from dramatic work to throw himself into the strife of religion and politics writing at this period his numerous prose and poetical treatises in 1682 appeared his religio laici religion of a layman defending the anglican church against all other sects especially the catholics and presbyterians but three years later when james ii came to the throne with schemes to establish the roman faith dryden turned catholic and wrote his most famous religious poem the hind and the panther beginning      a milkwhite hind immortal and unchanged     fed on the lawns and in the forest ranged     without unspotted innocent within     she feared no danger for she knew no sin  this hind is a symbol for the roman church and the anglicans as a panther are represented as persecuting the faithful numerous other sectscalvinists anabaptists quakerswere represented by the wolf boar hare and other animals which gave the poet an excellent chance for exercising his satire drydens enemies made the accusation often since repeated of hypocrisy in thus changing his church but that he was sincere in the matter can now hardly be questioned for he knew how to suffer for the faith and to be true to his religion even when it meant misjudgment and loss of fortune at the revolution of 1688 he refused allegiance to william of orange he was deprived of all his offices and pensions and as an old man was again thrown back on literature as his only means of livelihood he went to work with extraordinary courage and energy writing plays poems prefaces for other men eulogies for funeral occasions every kind of literary work that men would pay for his most successful work at this time was his translations which resulted in the complete aeneid and many selections from homer ovid and juvenal appearing in english rimed couplets his most enduring poem the splendid ode called alexanders feast was written in 1697 three years later he published his last work fables containing poetical paraphrases of the tales of boccaccio and chaucer and the miscellaneous poems of his last years long prefaces were the fashion in drydens day and his best critical work is found in his introductions the preface to the fables is generally admired as an example of the new prose style developed by dryden and his followers  from the literary view point these last troubled years were the best of drydens life though they were made bitter by obscurity and by the criticism of his numerous enemies he died in 1700 and was buried near chaucer in westminster abbey  works of dryden the numerous dramatic works of dryden are best left in that obscurity into which they have fallen now and then they contain a bit of excellent lyric poetry and in all for love another version of antony and cleopatra where he leaves his cherished heroic couplet for the blank verse of marlowe and shakespeare he shows what he might have done had he not sold his talents to a depraved audience on the whole reading his plays is like nibbling at a rotting apple even the good spots are affected by the decay and one ends by throwing the whole thing into the garbage can where most of the dramatic works of this period belong  the controversial and satirical poems are on a higher plane though it must be confessed drydens satire often strikes us as cutting and revengeful rather than witty the best known of these and a masterpiece of its kind is absalom and achitophel which is undoubtedly the most powerful political satire in our language taking the bible story of david and absalom he uses it to ridicule the whig party and also to revenge himself upon his enemies charles ii appeared as king david his natural son the duke of monmouth who was mixed up in the rye house plot paraded as absalom shaftesbury was achitophel the evil counselor and the duke of buckingham was satirized as zimri the poem had enormous political influence and raised dryden in the opinion of his contemporaries to the front rank of english poets two extracts from the powerful characterizations of achitophel and zimri are given here to show the style and spirit of the whole work              shaftesbury     of these the false achitophel was first     a name to all succeeding ages cursed     for close designs and crooked counsels fit     sagacious bold and turbulent of wit     restless unfixed in principles and place     in power unpleased impatient of disgrace     a fiery soul which working out its way     fretted the pygmy body to decay     a daring pilot in extremity     pleased with the danger when the waves went high     he sought the storms but for a calm unfit     would steer too nigh the sands to boast his wit     great wits are sure to madness near allied     and thin partitions do their bounds divide     else why should he with wealth and honor blest     refuse his age the needful hours of rest     punish a body which he could not please     bankrupt of life yet prodigal of ease     and all to leave what with his toil he won     to that unfeathered twolegged thing a son     in friendship false implacable in hate     resolved to ruin or to rule the state     then seized with fear yet still affecting fame     usurped a patriots allatoning name     so easy still it proves in factious times     with public zeal to cancel private crimes          the duke of buckingham     some of their chiefs were princes of the land     in the first rank of these did zimri stand     a man so various that he seemed to be     not one but all mankinds epitome     stiff in opinions always in the wrong     was everything by starts and nothing long     but in the course of one revolving moon     was chymist fiddler statesman and buffoon     then all for women painting rhyming drinking     besides ten thousand freaks that died in thinking     blest madman who could every hour employ     with something new to wish or to enjoy     railing and praising were his usual themes     and both to show his judgment in extremes     so overviolent or overcivil     that every man with him was god or devil  of the many miscellaneous poems of dryden the curious reader will get an idea of his sustained narrative power from the annus mirabilis the best expression of drydens literary genius however is found in alexanders feast which is his most enduring ode and one of the best in our language  as a prose writer dryden had a very marked influence on our literature in shortening his sentences and especially in writing naturally without depending on literary ornamentation to give effect to what he is saying if we compare his prose with that of milton or browne or jeremy taylor we note that dryden cares less for style than any of the others but takes more pains to state his thought clearly and concisely as men speak when they wish to be understood the classical school which followed the restoration looked to dryden as a leader and to him we owe largely that tendency to exactness of expression which marks our subsequent prose writing with his prose dryden rapidly developed his critical ability and became the foremost critic178 of his age his criticisms instead of being published as independent works were generally used as prefaces or introductions to his poetry the best known of these criticisms are the preface to the fables of heroic plays discourse on satire and especially the essay of dramatic poesy 1668 which attempts to lay a foundation for all literary criticism  drydens influence on literature drydens place among authors is due partly to his great influence on the succeeding age of classicism briefly this influence may be summed up by noting the three new elements which he brought into our literature these are 1 the establishment of the heroic couplet as the fashion for satiric didactic and descriptive poetry 2 his development of a direct serviceable prose style such as we still cultivate and 3 his development of the art of literary criticism in his essays and in the numerous prefaces to his poems this is certainly a large work for one man to accomplish and dryden is worthy of honor though comparatively little of what he wrote is now found on our bookshelves  samuel butler 16121680 in marked contrast with dryden who devoted his life to literature and won his success by hard work is samuel butler who jumped into fame by a single careless work which represents not any serious intent or effort but the pastime of an idle hour we are to remember that though the royalists had triumphed in the restoration the puritan spirit was not dead nor even sleeping and that the puritan held steadfastly to his own principles against these principles of justice truth and liberty there was no argument since they expressed the manhood of england but many of the puritan practices were open to ridicule and the royalists in revenge for their defeat began to use ridicule without mercy during the early years of the restoration doggerel verses ridiculing puritanism and burlesquethat is a ridiculous representation of serious subjects or a serious representation of ridiculous subjectswere the most popular form of literature with london society of all this burlesque and doggerel the most famous is butlers hudibras a work to which we can trace many of the prejudices that still prevail against puritanism  of butler himself we know little he is one of the most obscure figures in our literature during the days of cromwells protectorate he was in the employ of sir samuel luke a crabbed and extreme type of puritan nobleman and here he collected his material and probably wrote the first part of his burlesque which of course he did not dare to publish until after the restoration  hudibras is plainly modeled upon the don quixote of cervantes it describes the adventures of a fanatical justice of the peace sir hudibras and of his squire ralpho in their endeavor to put down all innocent pleasures in hudibras and ralpho the two extreme types of the puritan party presbyterians and independents are mercilessly ridiculed when the poem first appeared in public in 1663 after circulating secretly for years in manuscript it became at once enormously popular the king carried a copy in his pocket and courtiers vied with each other in quoting its most scurrilous passages a second and a third part continuing the adventures of hudibras were published in 1664 and 1668 at best the work is a wretched doggerel but it was clever enough and strikingly original and since it expressed the royalist spirit towards the puritans it speedily found its place in a literature which reflects every phase of human life a few odd lines are given here to show the character of the work and to introduce the reader to the best known burlesque in our language        he was in logic a great critic     profoundly skilled in analytic     he could distinguish and divide     a hair twixt south and southwest side     on either which he would dispute     confute change hands and still confute     hed undertake to prove by force     of argument a mans no horse     hed run in debt by disputation     and pay with ratiocination     for he was of that stubborn crew     of errant saints whom all men grant     to be the true church militant     such as do build their faith upon     the holy text of pike and gun     decide all controversies by     infallible artillery     and prove their doctrine orthodox     by apostolic blows and knocks     compound for sins they are inclined to     by damning those they have no mind to  hobbes and locke thomas hobbes 15881679 is one of the writers that puzzle the historian with a doubt as to whether or not he should be included in the story of literature the one book for which he is famous is called leviathan or the matter form and power of a commonwealth 1651 it is partly political partly a philosophical book combining two central ideas which challenge and startle the attention namely that selfinterest is the only guiding power of humanity and that blind submission to rulers is the only true basis of government179 in a word hobbes reduced human nature to its purely animal aspects and then asserted confidently that there was nothing more to study certainly therefore as a reflection of the underlying spirit of charles and his followers it has no equal in any purely literary work of the time  john locke 16321704 is famous as the author of a single great philosophical work the essay concerning human understanding 1690 this is a study of the nature of the human mind and of the origin of ideas which far more than the work of bacon and hobbes is the basis upon which english philosophy has since been built aside from their subjects both works are models of the new prose direct simple convincing for which dryden and the royal society labored they are known to every student of philosophy but are seldom included in a work of literature180  evelyn and pepys these two men john evelyn 16201706 and samuel pepys 16331703 are famous as the writers of diaries in which they jotted down the daily occurrences of their own lives without any thought that the world would ever see or be interested in what they had written  evelyn was the author of sylva the first book on trees and forestry in english and terra which is the first attempt at a scientific study of agriculture but the world has lost sight of these two good books while it cherishes his diary which extends over the greater part of his life and gives us vivid pictures of society in his time and especially of the frightful corruption of the royal court  pepys began life in a small way as a clerk in a government office but soon rose by his diligence and industry to be secretary of the admiralty here he was brought into contact with every grade of society from the kings ministers to the poor sailors of the fleet being inquisitive as a blue jay he investigated the rumors and gossip of the court as well as the small affairs of his neighbors and wrote them all down in his diary with evident interest but because he chattered most freely and told his little book a great many secrets which it were not well for the world to know he concealed everything in shorthandand here again he was like the blue jay which carries off and hides every bright trinket it discovers the diary covers the years from 1660 to 1669 and gossips about everything from his own position and duties at the office his dress and kitchen and cook and children to the great political intrigues of office and the scandals of high society no other such minutepicture of the daily life of an age has been written yet for a century and a half it remained entirely unknown and not until 1825 was pepyss shorthand deciphered and published since then it has been widely read and is still one of the most interesting examples of diary writing that we possess following are a few extracts181 covering only a few days in april 1663 from which one may infer the minute and interesting character of the work that this clerk politician president of the royal society and general busybody wrote to please himself  april 1st i went to the temple to my cozen roger pepys to see and talk with him a little who tells me that with much ado the parliament do agree to throw down popery but he says it is with so much spite and passion and an endeavor of bringing all nonconformists into the same condition that he is afeard matters will not go so well as he could wish to my office all the afternoon lord how sir j minnes like a mad coxcomb did swear and stamp swearing that commissioner pett hath still the old heart against the king that ever he had  and all the damnable reproaches in the world at which i was ashamed but said little but upon the whole i find him still a foole led by the nose with stories told by sir w batten whether with or without reason so vexed in my mind to see things ordered so unlike gentlemen or men of reason i went home and to bed  3d to white hall and to chappell which being most monstrous full i could not go into my pew but sat among the quire dr creeton the scotchman preached a most admirable good learned honest and most severe sermon yet comicall he railed bitterly ever and anon against john calvin and his brood the presbyterians and against the present terme now in use of tender consciences he ripped up hugh peters calling him the execrable skellum his preaching and stirring up the mayds of the city to bring in their bodkins and thimbles thence going out of white hall i met captain grove who did give me a letter directed to myself from himself i discerned money to be in it and took it knowing as i found it to be the proceed of the place i have got him the taking up of vessels for tangier but i did not open it till i came home to my office and there i broke it open not looking into it till all the money was out that i might say i saw no money in the paper if ever i should be questioned about it there was a piece of gold and 4£ in silver  4th to my office home to dinner whither by and by comes roger pepys etc very merry at before and after dinner and the more for that my dinner was great and most neatly dressed by our owne only mayde we had a fricasee of rabbits and chickens a leg of mutton boiled three carps in a dish a great dish of a side of lambe a dish of roasted pigeons a dish of four lobsters three tarts a lamprey pie a most rare pie a dish of anchovies good wine of several sorts and all things mighty noble and to my great content  5th lords day up and spent the morning till the barber came in reading in my chamber part of osbornes advice to his son which i shall not never enough admire for sense and language and being by and by trimmed to church myself wife ashwell etc home and while dinner was prepared to my office to read over my vows with great affection and to very good purpose then to church again where a simple bawling young scot preached  19th easter day up and this day put on my closekneed coloured suit which with new stockings of the colour with belt and new gilthandled sword is very handsome to church alone and after dinner to church again where the young scotchman preaching i slept all the while after supper fell in discourse of dancing and i find that ashwell hath a very fine carriage which makes my wife almost ashamed of herself to see herself so outdone but tomorrow she begins to learn to dance for a month or two so to prayers and to bed will being gone with my leave to his fathers this day for a day or two to take physique these holydays  23d st georges day and coronacion the king and court being at windsor at the installing of the king of denmarke by proxy and the duke of monmouth spent the evening with my father at cards till late and being at supper my boy being sent for some mustard to a neats tongue the rogue staid half an houre in the streets it seems at a bonfire at which i was very angry and resolve to beat him tomorrow  24th up betimes and with my salt eele went down into the parler and there got my boy and did beat him till i was fain to take breath two or three times yet for all i am afeard it will make the boy never the better he is grown so hardened in his tricks which i am sorry for he being capable of making a brave man and is a boy that i and my wife love very well   summary of the restoration period the chief thing to note in england during the restoration is the tremendous social reaction from the restraints of puritanism which suggests the wide swing of a pendulum from one extreme to the other for a generation many natural pleasures had been suppressed now the theaters were reopened bull and bear baiting revived and sports music dancinga wild delight in the pleasures and vanities of this world replaced that absorption in otherworldliness which characterized the extreme of puritanism  in literature the change is no less marked from the elizabethan drama playwrights turned to coarse evil scenes which presently disgusted the people and were driven from the stage from romance writers turned to realism from italian influence with its exuberance of imagination they turned to france and learned to repress the emotions to follow the head rather than the heart and to write in a clear concise formal style according to set rules poets turned from the noble blank verse of shakespeare and milton from the variety and melody which had characterized english poetry since chaucers day to the monotonous heroic couplet with its mechanical perfection  the greatest writer of the age is john dryden who established the heroic couplet as the prevailing verse form in english poetry and who developed a new and serviceable prose style suited to the practical needs of the age the popular ridicule of puritanism in burlesque and doggerel is best exemplified in butlers hudibras the realistic tendency the study of facts and of men as they are is shown in the work of the royal society in the philosophy of hobbes and locke and in the diaries of evelyn and pepys with their minute pictures of social life the age was one of transition from the exuberance and vigor of renaissance literature to the formality and polish of the augustan age in strong contrast with the preceding ages comparatively little of restoration literature is familiar to modern readers   selections for

17001800  i augustan or classic age  history of the period the revolution of 1688 which banished the last of the stuart kings and called william of orange to the throne marks the end of the long struggle for political freedom in england thereafter the englishman spent his tremendous energy which his forbears had largely spent in fighting for freedom in endless political discussions and in efforts to improve his government in order to bring about reforms votes were now necessary and to get votes the people of england must be approached with ideas facts arguments information so the newspaper was born182 and literature in its widest sense including the book the newspaper and the magazine became the chief instrument of a nations progress  the first half of the eighteenth century is remarkable for the rapid social development in england hitherto men had been more or less governed by the narrow isolated standards of the middle ages and when they differed they fell speedily to blows now for the first time they set themselves to the task of learning the art of living together while still holding different opinions in a single generation nearly two thousand public coffeehouses each a center of sociability sprang up in london alone and the number of private clubs is quite as astonishing183 this new social life had a marked effect in polishing mens words and manners the typical londoner of queen annes day was still rude and a little vulgar in his tastes the city was still very filthy the streets unlighted and infested at night by bands of rowdies and mohawks but outwardly men sought to refine their manners according to prevailing standards and to be elegant to have good form was a mans first duty whether he entered society or wrote literature one can hardly read a book or poem of the age without feeling this superficial elegance government still had its opposing tory and whig parties and the church was divided into catholics anglicans and dissenters but the growing social life offset many antagonisms producing at least the outward impression of peace and unity nearly every writer of the age busied himself with religion as well as with party politics the scientist newton as sincerely as the churchman barrow the philosophical locke no less earnestly than the evangelical wesley but nearly all tempered their zeal with moderation and argued from reason and scripture or used delicate satire upon their opponents instead of denouncing them as followers of satan there were exceptions of course but the general tendency of the age was toward toleration man had found himself in the long struggle for personal liberty now he turned to the task of discovering his neighbor of finding in whig and tory in catholic and protestant in anglican and dissenter the same general human characteristics that he found in himself this good work was helped moreover by the spread of education and by the growth of the national spfrit following the victories of marlborough on the continent in the midst of heated argument it needed only a wordgibraltar blenheim ramillies malplaquetor a poem of victory written in a garret184 to tell a patriotic people that under their many differences they were all alike englishmen  in the latter half of the century the political and social progress is almost bewildering the modern form of cabinet government responsible to parliament and the people had been established under george i and in 1757 the cynical and corrupt practices of walpole premier of the first tory cabinet were replaced by the more enlightened policies of pitt schools were established clubs and coffeehouses increased books and magazines multiplied until the press was the greatest visible power in england the modern great dailies the chronicle post and times began their career of public education religiously all the churches of england felt the quickening power of that tremendous spiritual revival known as methodism

banner of st george over the untold wealth of new lands and spreading the worldwide empire of the anglosaxons  literary characteristics in every preceding age we have noted especially the poetical works which constitute according to matthew arnold the glory of english literature now for the first time we must chronicle the triumph of english prose a multitude of practical interests arising from the new social and political conditions demanded expression not simply in books but more especially in pamphlets magazines and newspapers poetry was inadequate for such a task hence the development of prose of the unfettered word as dante calls ita development which astonishes us by its rapidity and excellence the graceful elegance of addisons essays the terse vigor of swifts satires the artistic finish of fieldings novels the sonorous eloquence of gibbons history and of burkes orationsthese have no parallel in the poetry of the age indeed poetry itself became prosaic in this respect that it was used not for creative works of imagination but for essays for satire for criticismfor exactly the same practical ends as was prose the poetry of the first half of the century as typified in the work of pope is polished and witty enough but artificial it lacks fire fine feeling enthusiasm the glow of the elizabethan age and the moral earnestness of puritanism in a word it interests us as a study of life rather than delights or inspires us by its appeal to the imagination the variety and excellence of prose works and the development of a serviceable prose style which had been begun by dryden until it served to express clearly every human interest and emotionthese are the chief literary glories of the eighteenth century  in the literature of the preceding age we noted two marked tendenciesthe tendency to realism in subjectmatter and the tendency to polish and refinement of expression both these tendencies were continued in the augustan age and are seen clearly in the poetry of pope who brought the couplet to perfection and in the prose of addison a third tendency is shown in the prevalence of satire resulting from the unfortunate union of politics with literature we have already noted the power of the press in this age and the perpetual strife of political parties nearly every writer of the first half of the century was used and rewarded by whigs or tories for satirizing their enemies and for advancing their special political interests pope was a marked exception but he nevertheless followed the prose writers in using satire too largely in his poetry now satirethat is a literary work which searches out the faults of men or institutions in order to hold them up to ridiculeis at best a destructive kind of criticism a satirist is like a laborer who clears away the ruins and rubbish of an old house before the architect and builders begin on a new and beautiful structure the work may sometimes be necessary but it rarely arouses our enthusiasm while the satires of pope swift and addison are doubtless the best in our language we hardly place them with our great literature which is always constructive in spirit and we have the feeling that all these men were capable of better things than they ever wrote  the classic age the period we are studying is known to us by various names it is often called the age of queen anne but unlike elizabeth this meekly stupid queen had practically no influence upon our literature the name classic age is more often heard but in using it we should remember clearly these three different ways in which the word classic is applied to literature 1 the term classic refers in general to writers of the highest rank in any nation as used in our literature it was first applied to the works of the great greek and roman writers like homer and virgil and any english book which followed the simple and noble method of these writers was said to have a classic style later the term was enlarged to cover the great literary works of other ancient nations so that the bible and the avestas as well as the iliad and the aeneid are called classics 2 every national literature has at least one period in which an unusual number of great writers are producing books and this is called the classic period of a nations literature thus the reign of augustus is the classic or golden age of rome the generation of dante is the classic age of italian literature the age of louis xiv is the french classic age and the age of queen anne is often called the classic age of england 3 the word classic acquired an entirely different meaning in the period we are studying and we shall better understand this by reference to the preceding ages the elizabethan writers were led by patriotism by enthusiasm and in general by romantic emotions they wrote in a natural style without regard to rules and though they exaggerated and used too many words their works are delightful because of their vigor and freshness and fine feeling in the following age patriotism had largely disappeared from politics and enthusiasm from literature poets no longer wrote naturally but artificially with strange and fantastic verse forms to give effect since fine feeling was wanting and this is the general character of the poetry of the puritan age185 gradually our writers rebelled against the exaggerations of both the natural and the fantastic style they demanded that poetry should follow exact rules and in this they were influenced by french writers especially by boileau and rapin who insisted on precise methods of writing poetry and who professed to have discovered their rules in the classics of horace and aristotle in our study of the elizabethan drama we noted the good influence of the classic movement in insisting upon that beauty of form and definiteness of expression which characterize the dramas of greece and rome and in the work of dryden and his followers we see a revival of classicism in the effort to make english literature conform to rules established by the great writers of other nations at first the results were excellent especially in prose but as the creative vigor of the elizabethans was lacking in this age writing by rule soon developed a kind of elegant formalism which suggests the elaborate social code of the time just as a gentleman might not act naturally but must follow exact rules in doffing his hat or addressing a lady or entering a room or wearing a wig or offering his snuffbox to a friend so our writers lost individuality and became formal and artificial the general tendency of literature was to look at life critically to emphasize intellect rather than imagination the form rather than the content of a sentence writers strove to repress all emotion and enthusiasm and to use only precise and elegant methods of expression this is what is often meant by the classicism of the ages of pope and johnson it refers to the critical intellectual spirit of many writers to the fine polish of their heroic couplets or the elegance of their prose and not to any resemblance which their work bears to true classic literature in a word the classic movement had become pseudoclassic ie a false or sham classicism and the latter term is now often used to designate a considerable part of eighteenthcentury literature186 to avoid this critical difficulty we have adopted the term augustan age a name chosen by the writers themselves who saw in pope addison swift johnson and burke the modern parallels to horace virgil cicero and all that brilliant company who made roman literature famous in the days of augustus   alexander pope 16881744  pope is in many respects a unique figure in the first place he was for a generation the poet of a great nation to be sure poetry was limited in the early eighteenth century there were few lyrics little or no love poetry no epics no dramas or songs of nature worth considering but in the narrow field of satiric and didactic verse pope was the undisputed master his influence completely dominated the poetry of his age and many foreign writers as well as the majority of english poets looked to him as their model second he was a remarkably clear and adequate reflection of the spirit of the age in which he lived there is hardly an ideal a belief a doubt a fashion a whim of queen annes time that is not neatly expressed in his poetry third he was the only important writer of that age who gave his whole life to letters swift was a clergyman and politician addison was secretary of state other writers depended on patrons or politics or pensions for fame and a livelihood but pope was independent and had no profession but literature and fourth by the sheer force of his ambition he won his place and held it in spite of religious prejudice and in the face of physical and temperamental obstacles that would have discouraged a stronger man for pope was deformed and sickly dwarfish in soul and body he knew little of the world of nature or of the world of the human heart he was lacking apparently in noble feeling and instinctively chose a lie when the truth had manifestly more advantages yet this jealous peevish waspish little man became the most famous poet of his age and the acknowledged leader of english literature we record the fact with wonder and admiration but we do not attempt to explain it  life pope was born in london in 1688 the year of the revolution his parents were both catholics who presently removed from london and settled in binfield near windsor where the poets childhood was passed partly because of an unfortunate prejudice against catholics in the public schools partly because of his own weakness and deformity pope received very little school education but browsed for himself among english books and picked up a smattering of the classics very early he began to write poetry and records the fact with his usual vanity      as yet a child nor yet a fool to fame     i lisped in numbers for the numbers came  being debarred by his religion from many desirable employments he resolved to make literature his life work and in this he resembled dryden who he tells us was his only master though much of his work seems to depend on boileau the french poet and critic187 when only sixteen years old he had written his pastorals a few years later appeared his essay on criticism which made him famous with the publication of the rape of the lock in 1712 popes name was known and honored all over england and this dwarf of twentyfour years by the sheer force of his own ambition had jumped to the foremost place in english letters it was soon after this that voltaire called him the best poet of england and at present of all the worldwhich is about as near the truth as voltaire generally gets in his numerous universal judgments for the next twelve years pope was busy with poetry especially with his translations of homer and his work was so successful financially that he bought a villa at twickenham on the thames and remained happily independent of wealthy patrons for a livelihood  led by his success pope returned to london and for a time endeavored to live the gay and dissolute life which was supposed to be suitable for a literary genius but he was utterly unfitted for it mentally and physically and soon retired to twickenham there he gave himself up to poetry manufactured a little garden more artificial than his verses and cultivated his friendship with martha blount with whom for many years he spent a good part of each day and who remained faithful to him to the end of his life at twickenham he wrote his moral epistles poetical satires modeled after horace and revenged himself upon all his critics in the bitter abuse of the dunciad he died in 1744 and was buried at twickenham his religion preventing him from the honor which was certainly his due of a resting place in westminster abbey  works of pope for convenience we may separate popes work into three groups corresponding to the early middle and later period of his life in the first he wrote his pastorals windsor forest messiah essay on criticism eloise to abelard and the rape of the lock in the second his translations of homer in the third the dunciad and the epistles the latter containing the famous essay on man and the epistle to dr arbuthnot which is in truth his apologia and in which alone we see popes life from his own view point  the essay on criticism sums up the art of poetry as taught first by horace then by boileau and the eighteenthcentury classicists though written in heroic couplets we hardly consider this as a poem but rather as a storehouse of critical maxims for fools rush in where angels fear to tread to err is human to forgive divine a little learning is a dangerous thingthese lines and many more like them from the same source have found their way into our common speech and are used without thinking of the author whenever we need an apt quotation  the rape of the lock is a masterpiece of its kind and comes nearer to being a creation than anything else that pope has written the occasion of the famous poem was trivial enough a fop at the court of queen anne one lord petre snipped a lock of hair from the abundant curls of a pretty maid of honor named arabella fermor the young lady resented it and the two families were plunged into a quarrel which was the talk of london pope being appealed to seized the occasion to construct not a ballad as the cavaliers would have done nor an epigram as french poets love to do but a long poem in which all the mannerisms of society are pictured in minutest detail and satirized with the most delicate wit the first edition consisting of two cantos was published in 1712 and it is amazing now to read of the trivial character of london court life at the time when english soldiers were battling for a great continent in the french and indian wars its instant success caused pope to lengthen the poem by three more cantos and in order to make a more perfect burlesque of an epic poem he introduces gnomes sprites sylphs and salamanders188 instead of the gods of the great epics with which his readers were familiar the poem is modeled after two foreign satires boileaus le lutrin reading desk a satire on the french clergy who raised a huge quarrel over the location of a lectern and la secchia rapita stolen bucket a famous italian satire on the petty causes of the endless italian wars pope however went far ahead of his masters in style and in delicacy of handling a mockheroic theme and during his lifetime the rape of the lock was considered as the greatest poem of its kind in all literature the poem is still well worth reading for as an expression of the artificial life of the ageof its cards parties toilettes lapdogs teadrinking snufftaking and idle vanitiesit is as perfect in its way as tamburlaine which reflects the boundless ambition of the elizabethans  the fame of popes iliad which was financially the most successful of his books was due to the fact that he interpreted homer in the elegant artificial language of his own age not only do his words follow literary fashions but even the homeric characters lose their strength and become fashionable men of the court so the criticism of the scholar bentley was most appropriate when he said it is a pretty poem mr pope but you must not call it homer pope translated the entire iliad and half of the odyssey and the latter work was finished by two cambridge scholars elijah fenton and william broome who imitated the mechanical couplets so perfectly that it is difficult to distinguish their work from that of the greatest poet of the age a single selection is given to show how in the nobler passages even pope may faintly suggest the elemental grandeur of homer      the troops exulting sat in order round     and beaming fires illumined all the ground     as when the moon refulgent lamp of night     oer heavens clear azure spreads her sacred light     when not a breath disturbs the deep serene     and not a cloud oercasts the solemn scene     around her throne the vivid planets roll     and stars unnumbered gild the glowing pole     oer the dark trees a yellower verdure shed     and tip with silver every mountains head  the essay is the best known and the most quoted of all popes works except in form it is not poetry and when one considers it as an essay and reduces it to plain prose it is found to consist of numerous literary ornaments without any very solid structure of thought to rest upon the purpose of the essay is in popes words to vindicate the ways of god to man and as there are no unanswered problems in popes philosophy the vindication is perfectly accomplished in four poetical epistles concerning mans relations to the universe to himself to society and to happiness the final result is summed up in a few wellknown lines      all nature is but art unknown to thee     all chance direction which thou canst not see     all discord harmony not understood     all partial evil universal good     and spite of pride in erring reasons spite     one truth is clear whatever is is right  like the essay on criticism the poem abounds in quotable lines such as the following which make the entire work well worth reading      hope springs eternal in the human breast     man never is but always to be blest     know then thyself presume not god to scan     the proper study of mankind is man     the same ambition can destroy or save     and makes a patriot as it makes a knave     honor and shame from no condition rise     act well your part there all the honor lies       vice is a monster of so frightful mien     as to be hated needs but to be seen     yet seen too oft familiar with her face     we first endure then pity then embrace       behold the child by natures kindly law     pleased with a rattle tickled with a straw     some livelier plaything gives his youth delight     a little louder but as empty quite     scarfs garters gold amuse his riper stage     and beads and prayer books are the toys of age     pleased with this bauble still as that before     till tired he sleeps and lifes poor play is oer189  the dunciad ie the iliad of the dunces began originally as a controversy concerning shakespeare but turned out to be a coarse and revengeful satire upon all the literary men of the age who had aroused popes anger by their criticism or lack of appreciation of his genius though brilliantly written and immensely popular at one time its present effect on the reader is to arouse a sense of pity that a man of such acknowledged power and position should abuse both by devoting his talents to personal spite and petty quarrels among the rest of his numerous works the reader will find popes estimate of himself best set forth in his epistle to dr arbuthnot and it will be well to close our study of this strange mixture of vanity and greatness with the universal prayer which shows at least that pope had considered and judged himself and that all further judgment is consequently superfluous   jonathan swift 16671745  in each of marlowes tragedies we have the picture of a man dominated by a single passion the lust of power for its own sake in each we see that a powerful man without selfcontrol is like a dangerous instrument in the hands of a child and the tragedy ends in the destruction of the man by the ungoverned power which he possesses the life of swift is just such a living tragedy he had the power of gaining wealth like the hero of the jew of malta yet he used it scornfully and in sad irony left what remained to him of a large property to found a hospital for lunatics by hard work he won enormous literary power and used it to satirize our common humanity he wrested political power from the hands of the tories and used it to insult the very men who had helped him and who held his fate in their hands by his dominant personality he exercised a curious power over women and used it brutally to make them feel their inferiority being loved supremely by two good women he brought sorrow and death to both and endless misery to himself so his power brought always tragedy in its wake it is only when we remember his life of struggle and disappointment and bitterness that we can appreciate the personal quality in his satire and perhaps find some sympathy for this greatest genius of all the augustan writers  life swift was born in dublin of english parents in 1667 his father died before he was born his mother was poor and swift though proud as lucifer was compelled to accept aid from relatives who gave it grudgingly at the kilkenny school and especially at dublin university he detested the curriculum reading only what appealed to his own nature but since a degree was necessary to his success he was compelled to accept it as a favor from the examiners whom he despised in his heart after graduation the only position open to him was with a distant relative sir william temple who gave him the position of private secretary largely on account of the unwelcome relationship  temple was a statesman and an excellent diplomatist but he thought himself to be a great writer as well and he entered into a literary controversy concerning the relative merits of the classics and modern literature swifts first notable work the battle of the books written at this time but not published is a keen satire upon both parties in the controversy the first touch of bitterness shows itself here for swift was in a galling position for a man of his pride knowing his intellectual superiority to the man who employed him and yet being looked upon as a servant and eating at the servants table thus he spent ten of the best years of his life in the pretty moor park surrey growing more bitter each year and steadily cursing his fate nevertheless he read and studied widely and after his position with temple grew unbearable quarreled with his patron took orders and entered the church of england some years later we find him settled in the little church of laracor irelanda country which he disliked intensely but whither he went because no other living was open to him  in ireland faithful to his church duties swift labored to better the condition of the unhappy people around him never before had the poor of his parishes been so well cared for but swift chafed under his yoke growing more and more irritated as he saw small men advanced to large positions while he remained unnoticed in a little country churchlargely because he was too proud and too blunt with those who might have advanced him while at laracor he finished his tale of a tub a satire on the various churches of the day which was published in london with the battle of the books in 1704 the work brought him into notice as the most powerful satirist of the age and he soon gave up his church to enter the strife of party politics the cheap pamphlet was then the most powerful political weapon known and as swift had no equal at pamphlet writing he soon became a veritable dictator for several years especially from 1710 to 1713 swift was one of the most important figures in london the whigs feared the lash of his satire the tories feared to lose his support he was courted flattered cajoled on every side but the use he made of his new power is sad to contemplate an unbearable arrogance took possession of him lords statesmen even ladies were compelled to sue for his favor and to apologize for every fancied slight to his egoism it is at this time that he writes in his journal to stella  mr secretary told me the duke of buckingham had been talking much about me and desired my acquaintance i answered it could not be for he had not yet made sufficient advances then shrewsbury said he thought the duke was not used to make advances i said i could not help that for i always expected advances in proportion to mens quality and more from a duke than any other man  writing to the duchess of queensberry he says  i am glad you know your duty for it has been a known and established rule above twenty years in england that the first advances have been constantly made me by all ladies who aspire to my acquaintance and the greater their quality the greater were their advances  when the tories went out of power swifts position became uncertain he expected and had probably been promised a bishopric in england with a seat among the peers of the realm but the tories offered him instead the place of dean of st patricks cathedral in dublin it was galling to a man of his proud spirit but after his merciless satire on religion in the tale of a tub any ecclesiastical position in england was rendered impossible dublin was the best he could get and he accepted it bitterly once more cursing the fate which he had brought upon himself  with his return to ireland begins the last act in the tragedy of his life his best known literary work gullivers travels was done here but the bitterness of life grew slowly to insanity and a frightful personal sorrow of which he never spoke reached its climax in the death of esther johnson a beautiful young woman who had loved swift ever since the two had met in temples household and to whom he had written his journal to stella during the last years of his life a brain disease of which he had shown frequent symptoms fastened its terrible hold upon swift and he became by turns an idiot and a madman he died in 1745 and when his will was opened it was found that he had left all his property to found st patricks asylum for lunatics and incurables it stands today as the most suggestive monument of his peculiar genius  the works of swift from swifts life one can readily foresee the kind of literature he will produce taken together his works are a monstrous satire on humanity and the spirit of that satire is shown clearly in a little incident of his first days in london there was in the city at that time a certain astrologer named partridge who duped the public by calculating nativities from the stars and by selling a yearly almanac predicting future events swift who hated all shams wrote with a great show of learning his famous bickerstaff almanac containing predictions for the year 1708 as determined by the unerring stars as swift rarely signed his name to any literary work letting it stand or fall on its own merits his burlesque appeared over the pseudonym of isaac bickerstaff a name afterwards made famous by steele in the tatler among the predictions was the following  my first prediction is but a trifle yet i will mention it to show how ignorant those sottish pretenders to astrology are in their own concerns it relates to partridge the almanack maker i have consulted the star of his nativity by my own rules and find he will infallibly die upon the 29th of march next about eleven at night of a raging fever therefore i advise him to consider of it and settle his affairs in time  on march 30 the day after the prediction was to be fulfilled there appeared in the newspapers a letter from a revenue officer giving the details of partridges death with the doings of the bailiff and the coffin maker and on the following morning appeared an elaborate elegy of mr partridge when poor partridge who suddenly found himself without customers published a denial of the burial swift answered with an elaborate vindication of isaac bickerstaff in which he proved by astrological rules that partridge was dead and that the man now in his place was an impostor trying to cheat the heirs out of their inheritance  this ferocious joke is suggestive of all swifts satires against any case of hypocrisy or injustice he sets up a remedy of precisely the same kind only more atrocious and defends his plan with such seriousness that the satire overwhelms the reader with a sense of monstrous falsity thus his solemn argument to prove that the abolishing of christianity may be attended with some inconveniences is such a frightful satire upon the abuses of christianity by its professed followers that it is impossible for us to say whether swift intended to point out needed reforms or to satisfy his conscience190 or to perpetrate a joke on the church as he had done on poor partridge so also with his modest proposal concerning the children of ireland which sets up the proposition that poor irish farmers ought to raise children as dainties to be eaten like roast pigs on the tables of prosperous englishmen in this most characteristic work it is impossible to find swift or his motive the injustice under which ireland suffered her perversity in raising large families to certain poverty and the indifference of english politicians to her suffering and protests are all mercilessly portrayed but why that is still the unanswered problem of swifts life and writings  swifts two greatest satires are his tale of a tub and gullivers travels the tale began as a grim exposure of the alleged weaknesses of three principal forms of religious belief catholic lutheran and calvinist as opposed to the anglican but it ended in a satire upon all science and philosophy  swift explains his whimsical title by the custom of mariners in throwing out a tub to a whale in order to occupy the monsters attention and divert it from an attack upon the shipwhich only proves how little swift knew of whales or sailors but let that pass his book is a tub thrown out to the enemies of church and state to keep them occupied from further attacks or criticism and the substance of the argument is that all churches and indeed all religion and science and statesmanship are arrant hypocrisy the best known part of the book is the allegory of the old man who died and left a coat which is christian truth to each of his three sons peter martin and jack with minute directions for its care and use these three names stand for catholics lutherans and calvinists and the way in which the sons evade their fathers will and change the fashion of their garment is part of the bitter satire upon all religious sects though it professes to defend the anglican church that institution fares perhaps worse than the others for nothing is left to her but a thin cloak of custom under which to hide her alleged hypocrisy  in gullivers travels the satire grows more unbearable strangely enough this book upon which swifts literary fame generally rests was not written from any literary motive but rather as an outlet for the authors own bitterness against fate and human society it is still read with pleasure as robinson crusoe is read for the interesting adventures of the hero and fortunately those who read it generally overlook its degrading influence and motive  gullivers travels records the pretended four voyages of one lemuel gulliver and his adventures in four astounding countries the first book tells of his voyage and shipwreck in lilliput where the inhabitants are about as tall as ones thumb and all their acts and motives are on the same dwarfish scale in the petty quarrels of these dwarfs we are supposed to see the littleness of humanity the statesmen who obtain place and favor by cutting monkey capers on the tight rope before their sovereign and the two great parties the littleendians and bigendians who plunge the country into civil war over the momentous question of whether an egg should be broken on its big or on its little end are satires on the politics of swifts own day and generation the style is simple and convincing the surprising situations and adventures are as absorbing as those of defoes masterpiece and altogether it is the most interesting of swifts satires  on the second voyage gulliver is abandoned in brobdingnag where the inhabitants are giants and everything is done upon an enormous scale the meanness of humanity seems all the more detestable in view of the greatness of these superior beings when gulliver tells about his own people their ambitions and wars and conquests the giants can only wonder that such great venom could exist in such little insects  in the third voyage gulliver continues his adventures in laputa and this is a satire upon all the scientists and philosophers laputa is a flying island held up in the air by a loadstone and all the professors of the famous academy at lagado are of the same airy constitution the philosopher who worked eight years to extract sunshine from cucumbers is typical of swifts satiric treatment of all scientific problems it is in this voyage that we hear of the struldbrugs a ghastly race of men who are doomed to live upon earth after losing hope and the desire for life the picture is all the more terrible in view of the last years of swifts own life in which he was compelled to live on a burden to himself and his friends  in these three voyages the evident purpose is to strip off the veil of habit and custom with which men deceive themselves and show the crude vices of humanity as swift fancies he sees them in the fourth voyage the merciless satire is carried out to its logical conclusion this brings us to the land of the houyhnhnms in which horses superior and intelligent creatures are the ruling animals all our interest however is centered on the yahoos a frightful race having the form and appearance of men but living in unspeakable degradation  the journal to stella written chiefly in the years 17101713 for the benefit of esther johnson is interesting to us for two reasons it is first an excellent commentary on contemporary characters and political events by one of the most powerful and original minds of the age and second in its love passages and purely personal descriptions it gives us the best picture we possess of swift himself at the summit of his power and influence as we read now its words of tenderness for the woman who loved him and who brought almost the only ray of sunlight into his life we can only wonder and be silent entirely different are his drapiers letters a model of political harangue and of popular argument which roused an unthinking english public and did much benefit to ireland by preventing the politicians plan of debasing the irish coinage swifts poems though vigorous and original like defoes of the same period are generally satirical often coarse and seldom rise above doggerel unlike his friend addison swift saw in the growing polish and decency of society only a mask for hypocrisy and he often used his verse to shock the newborn modesty by pointing out some native ugliness which his diseased mind discovered under every beautiful exterior  that swift is the most original writer of his time and one of the greatest masters of english prose is undeniable directness vigor simplicity mark every page among writers of that age he stands almost alone in his disdain of literary effects keeping his object steadily before him he drives straight on to the end with a convincing power that has never been surpassed in our language even in his most grotesque creations the reader never loses the sense of reality of being present as an eyewitness of the most impossible events so powerful and convincing is swifts prose defoe had the same power but in writing robinson crusoe for instance his task was comparatively easy since his hero and his adventures were both natural while swift gives reality to pygmies giants and the most impossible situations as easily as if he were writing of facts notwithstanding these excellent qualities the ordinary reader will do well to confine himself to gullivers travels and a book of wellchosen selections for it must be confessed the bulk of swifts work is not wholesome reading it is too terribly satiric and destructive it emphasizes the faults and failings of humanity and so runs counter to the general course of our literature which from cynewulf to tennyson follows the ideal as merlin followed the gleam191 and is not satisfied till the hidden beauty of mans soul and the divine purpose of his struggle are manifest   joseph addison 16721719  in the pleasant art of living with ones fellows addison is easily a master it is due to his perfect expression of that art of that new social life which as we have noted was characteristic of the age of anne that addison occupies such a large place in the history of literature of less power and originality than swift he nevertheless wields and deserves to wield a more lasting influence swift is the storm roaring against the ice and frost of the late spring of english life addison is the sunshine which melts the ice and dries the mud and makes the earth thrill with light and hope like swift he despised shams but unlike him he never lost faith in humanity and in all his satires there is a gentle kindliness which makes one think better of his fellowmen even while he laughs at their little vanities  two things addison did for our literature which are of inestimable value first he overcame a certain corrupt tendency bequeathed by restoration literature it was the apparent aim of the low drama and even of much of the poetry of that age to make virtue ridiculous and vice attractive addison set himself squarely against this unworthy tendency to strip off the mask of vice to show its ugliness and deformity but to reveal virtue in its own native lovelinessthat was addisons purpose and he succeeded so well that never since his day has our english literature seriously followed after false gods as macaulay says so effectually did he retort on vice the mockery which had recently been directed against virtue that since his time the open violation of decency has always been considered amongst us a sure mark of a fool and second prompted and aided by the more original genius of his friend steele addison seized upon the new social life of the clubs and made it the subject of endless pleasant essays upon types of men and manners the tatler and the spectator are the beginning of the modern essay and their studies of human character as exemplified in sir roger de coverley are a preparation for the modern novel  life addisons life like his writings is in marked contrast to that of swift he was born in milston wiltshire in 1672 his father was a scholarly english clergyman and all his life addison followed naturally the quiet and cultured ways to which he was early accustomed at the famous charterhouse school in london and in his university life at oxford he excelled in character and scholarship and became known as a writer of graceful verses he had some intention at one time of entering the church but was easily persuaded by his friends to take up the government service instead unlike swift who abused his political superiors addison took the more tactful way of winning the friendship of men in large places his lines to dryden won that literary leaders instant favor and one of his latin poems the peace of ryswick 1697 with its kindly appreciation of king williams statesmen brought him into favorable political notice it brought him also a pension of three hundred pounds a year with a suggestion that he travel abroad and cultivate the art of diplomacy which he promptly did to his own great advantage  from a literary view point the most interesting work of addisons early life is his account of the greatest english poets 1693 written while he was a fellow of oxford university one rubs his eyes to find dryden lavishly praised spenser excused or patronized while shakespeare is not even mentioned but addison was writing under boileaus classic rules and the poet like the age was perhaps too artificial to appreciate natural genius  while he was traveling abroad the death of william and the loss of power by the whigs suddenly stopped addisons pension necessity brought him home and for a time he lived in poverty and obscurity then occurred the battle of blenheim and in the effort to find a poet to celebrate the event addison was brought to the tories attention his poem the campaign celebrating the victory took the country by storm instead of making the hero slay his thousands and ten thousands like the old epic heroes addison had some sense of what is required in a modern general and so made marlborough direct the battle from the outside comparing him to an angel riding on the whirlwind      t was then great marlbros mighty soul was proved     that in the shock of charging hosts unmoved     amidst confusion horror and despair     examined all the dreadful scenes of war     in peaceful thought the field of death surveyed     to fainting squadrons sent the timely aid     inspired repulsed battalions to engage     and taught the doubtful battle where to rage     so when an angel by divine command     with rising tempests shakes a guilty land     such as of late oer pale britannia past     calm and serene he drives the furious blast     and pleased th almightys orders to perform     rides in the whirlwind and directs the storm  that one doubtful simile made addisons fortune never before or since was a poets mechanical work so well rewarded it was called the finest thing ever written and from that day addison rose steadily in political favor and office he became in turn undersecretary member of parliament secretary for ireland and finally secretary of state probably no other literary man aided by his pen alone ever rose so rapidly and so high in office  the rest of addisons life was divided between political duties and literature his essays for the tatler and spectator which we still cherish were written between 1709 and 1714 but he won more literary fame by his classic tragedy cato which we have almost forgotten in 1716 he married a widow the countess of warwick and went to live at her home the famous holland house his married life lasted only three years and was probably not a happy one certainly he never wrote of women except with gentle satire and he became more and more a clubman spending most of his time in the clubs and coffeehouses of london up to this time his life had been singularly peaceful but his last years were shadowed by quarrels first with pope then with swift and finally with his lifelong friend steele the first quarrel was on literary grounds and was largely the result of popes jealousy the latters venomous caricature of addison as atticus shows how he took his petty revenge on a great and good man who had been his friend the other quarrels with swift and especially with his old friend steele were the unfortunate result of political differences and show how impossible it is to mingle literary ideals with party politics he died serenely in 1719 a brief description from thackerays english humorists is his best epitaph  a life prosperous and beautiful a calm death an immense fame and affection afterwards for his happy and spotless name  works of addison the most enduring of addisons works are his famous essays collected from the tatler and spectator we have spoken of him as a master of the art of gentle living and these essays are a perpetual inducement to others to know and to practice the same fine art to an age of fundamental coarseness and artificiality he came with a wholesome message of refinement and simplicity much as ruskin and arnold spoke to a later age of materialism only addisons success was greater than theirs because of his greater knowledge of life and his greater faith in men he attacks all the little vanities and all the big vices of his time not in swifts terrible way which makes us feel hopeless of humanity but with a kindly ridicule and gentle humor which takes speedy improvement for granted to read swifts brutal letters to a young lady and then to read addisons dissection of a beaus head and his dissection of a coquettes heart is to know at once the secret of the latters more enduring influence  three other results of these delightful essays are worthy of attention first they are the best picture we possess of the new social life of england with its many new interests second they advanced the art of literary criticism to a much higher stage than it had ever before reached and however much we differ from their judgment and their interpretation of such a man as milton they certainly led englishmen to a better knowledge and appreciation of their own literature and finally in ned softly the literary dabbler will wimble the poor relation sir andrew freeport the merchant will honeycomb the fop and sir roger the country gentleman they give us characters that live forever as part of that goodly company which extends from chaucers country parson to kiplings mulvaney addison and steele not only introduced the modern essay but in such characters as these they herald the dawn of the modern novel of all his essays the best known and loved are those which introduce us to sir roger de coverley the genial dictator of life and manners in the quiet english country  in style these essays are remarkable as showing the growing perfection of the english language johnson says whoever wishes to attain an english style familiar but not coarse and elegant but not ostentatious must give his days and nights to the volumes of addison and again he says give nights and days sir to the study of addison if you mean to be a good writer or what is more worth an honest man that was good criticism for its day and even at the present time critics are agreed that addisons essays are well worth reading once for their own sake and many times for their influence in shaping a clear and graceful style of writing  addisons poems which were enormously popular in his day are now seldom read his cato with its classic unities and lack of dramatic power must be regarded as a failure if we study it as tragedy but it offers an excellent example of the rhetoric and fine sentiment which were then considered the essentials of good writing the best scene from this tragedy is in the fifth act where cato soliloquizes with platos immortality of the soul open in his hand and a drawn sword on the table before him      it must be soplato thou reasonst well     else whence this pleasing hope this fond desire     this longing after immortality     or whence this secret dread and inward horror     of falling into nought why shrinks the soul     back on herself and startles at destruction     tis the divinity that stirs within us     tis heaven itself that points out an hereafter     and intimates eternity to man  many readers make frequent use of one portion of addisons poetry without knowing to whom they are indebted his devout nature found expression in many hymns a few of which are still used and loved in our churches many a congregation thrills as thackeray did to the splendid sweep of his god in nature beginning the spacious firmament on high almost as well known and loved are his travelers hymn and his continued help beginning when all thy mercies o my god the latter hymnwritten in a storm at sea off the italian coast when the captain and crew were demoralized by terrorshows that poetry especially a good hymn that one can sing in the same spirit as one would say his prayers is sometimes the most practical and helpful thing in the world  richard steele 16721729 steele was in almost every respect the antithesis of his friend and fellowworkera rollicking goodhearted emotional lovable irishman at the charterhouse school and at oxford he shared everything with addison asking nothing but love in return unlike addison he studied but little and left the university to enter the horse guards he was in turn soldier captain poet playwright essayist member of parliament manager of a theater publisher of a newspaper and twenty other thingsall of which he began joyously and then abandoned sometimes against his will as when he was expelled from parliament and again because some other interest of the moment had more attraction his poems and plays are now little known but the reader who searches them out will find one or two suggestive things about steele himself for instance he loves children and he is one of the few writers of his time who show a sincere and unswerving respect for womanhood even more than addison he ridicules vice and makes virtue lovely he is the originator of the tatler and joins with addison in creating the spectatorthe two periodicals which in the short space of less than four years did more to influence subsequent literature than all other magazines of the century combined moreover he is the original genius of sir roger and of many other characters and essays for which addison usually receives the whole credit it is often impossible in the tatler essays to separate the work of the two men but the majority of critics hold that the more original parts the characters the thought the overflowing kindliness are largely steeles creation while to addison fell the work of polishing and perfecting the essays and of adding that touch of humor which made them the most welcome literary visitors that england had ever received  the tatler and the spectator on account of his talent in writing political pamphlets steele was awarded the position of official gazetteer while in this position and writing for several small newspapers the idea occurred to steele to publish a paper which should contain not only the political news but also the gossip of the clubs and coffeehouses with some light essays on the life and manners of the age the immediate resultfor steele never let an idea remain idlewas the famous tatler the first number of which appeared april 12 1709 it was a small folio sheet appearing on post days three times a week and it sold for a penny a copy that it had a serious purpose is evident from this dedication to the first volume of collected tatler essays  the general purpose of this paper is to expose the false arts of life to pull off the disguises of cunning vanity and affectation and to recommend a general simplicity in our dress our discourse and our behavior  the success of this unheardof combination of news gossip and essay was instantaneous not a club or a coffeehouse in london could afford to be without it and over its pages began the first general interest in contemporary english life as expressed in literature steele at first wrote the entire paper and signed his essays with the name of isaac bickerstaff which had been made famous by swift a few years before addison is said to have soon recognized one of his own remarks to steele and the secret of the authorship was out from that time addison was a regular contributor and occasionally other writers added essays on the new social life of england192  steele lost his position as gazetteer and the tatler was discontinued after less than two years life but not till it won an astonishing popularity and made ready the way for its successor two months later on march 1 1711 appeared the first number of the spectator in the new magazine politics and news as such were ignored it was a literary magazine pure and simple and its entire contents consisted of a single light essay it was considered a crazy venture at the time but its instant success proved that men were eager for some literary expression of the new social ideals the following whimsical letter to the editor may serve to indicate the part played by the spectator in the daily life of london  mr spectatoryour paper is a part of my tea equipage and my servant knows my humor so well that in calling for my breakfast this morning it being past my usual hour she answered the spectator was not yet come in but the teakettle boiled and she expected it every moment  it is in the incomparable spectator papers that addison shows himself most worthy to be remembered he contributed the majority of its essays and in its first number appears this description of the spectator by which name addison is now generally known  there is no place of general resort wherein i do not often make my appearance sometimes i am seen thrusting my head into a round of politicians at wills coffeehouse and listening with great attention to the narratives that are made in those little circular audiences sometimes i smoke a pipe at childs and whilst i seem attentive to nothing but the postman overhear the conversation of every table in the room i appear on sunday nights at st jamess and sometimes join the little committee of politics in the inner room as one who comes to hear and improve my face is likewise very well known at the grecian the cocoa tree and in the theaters both of drury lane and the haymarket i have been taken for a merchant upon the exchange for above these ten years and sometimes pass for a jew in the assembly of stock jobbers at jonathans thus i live in the world rather as a spectator of mankind than as one of the species which is the character i intend to preserve in this paper  the large place which these two little magazines hold in our literature seems most disproportionate to their short span of days in the short space of four years in which addison and steele worked together the light essay was established as one of the most important forms of modern literature and the literary magazine won its place as the expression of the social life of a nation   samuel johnson 17091784  the reader of boswells johnson after listening to endless grumblings and watching the clumsy actions of the hero often finds himself wondering why he should end his reading with a profound respect for this old bear who is the object of boswells groveling attention here is a man who was certainly not the greatest writer of his age perhaps not even a great writer at all but who was nevertheless the dictator of english letters and who still looms across the centuries of a magnificent literature as its most striking and original figure here moreover is a huge fat awkward man of vulgar manners and appearance who monopolizes conversation argues violently abuses everybody clubs down oppositionmadam speaking to his cultivated hostess at table talk no more nonsense sir turning to a distinguished guest i perceive you are a vile whig while talking he makes curious animal sounds sometimes giving a half whistle sometimes clucking like a hen and when he has concluded a violent dispute and laid his opponents low by dogmatism or ridicule he leans back to blow out his breath like a whale and gulp down numberless cups of hot tea yet this curious dictator of an elegant age was a veritable lion much sought after by society and around him in his own poor house gathered the foremost artists scholars actors and literary men of londonall honoring the man loving him and listening to his dogmatism as the greeks listened to the voice of their oracle  what is the secret of this astounding spectacle if the reader turns naturally to johnsons works for an explanation he will be disappointed reading his verses we find nothing to delight or inspire us but rather gloom and pessimism with a few moral observations in rimed couplets      but scarce observed the knowing and the bold     fall in the general massacre of gold     widewasting pest that rages unconfined     and crowds with crimes the records of mankind     for gold his sword the hireling ruffian draws     for gold the hireling judge distorts the laws     wealth heaped on wealth nor truth nor safety buys     the dangers gather as the treasures rise193  that is excellent common sense but it is not poetry and it is not necessary to hunt through johnsons bulky volumes for the information since any moralist can give us offhand the same doctrine as for his rambler essays once so successful though we marvel at the big words the carefully balanced sentences the classical allusions one might as well try to get interested in an oldfashioned threehour sermon we read a few pages listlessly yawn and go to bed  since the mans work fails to account for his leadership and influence we examine his personality and here everything is interesting because of a few oftquoted passages from boswells biography johnson appears to us as an eccentric bear who amuses us by his growlings and clumsy antics but there is another johnson a brave patient kindly religious soul who as goldsmith said had nothing of the bear but his skin a man who battled like a hero against poverty and pain and melancholy and the awful fear of death and who overcame them manfully that trouble passed away so will this sang the sorrowing deor in the first old anglosaxon lyric and that expresses the great and suffering spirit of johnson who in the face of enormous obstacles never lost faith in god or in himself though he was a reactionary in politics upholding the arbitrary power of kings and opposing the growing liberty of the people yet his political theories like his manners were no deeper than his skin for in all london there was none more kind to the wretched and none more ready to extend an open hand to every struggling man and woman who crossed his path when he passed poor homeless arabs sleeping in the streets he would slip a coin into their hands in order that they might have a happy awakening for he himself knew well what it meant to be hungry such was johnsona mass of genuine manhood as carlyle called him and as such men loved and honored him194  life of johnson johnson was born in lichfield staffordshire in 1709 he was the son of a small bookseller a poor man but intelligent and fond of literature as booksellers invariably were in the good days when every town had its bookshop from his childhood johnson had to struggle against physical deformity and disease and the consequent disinclination to hard work he prepared for the university partly in the schools but largely by omnivorous reading in his fathers shop and when he entered oxford he had read more classical authors than had most of the graduates before finishing his course he had to leave the university on account of his poverty and at once he began his long struggle as a hack writer to earn his living  at twentyfive years he married a woman old enough to be his mothera genuine love match he called itand with her dowry of £800 they started a private school together which was a dismal failure then without money or influential friends he left his home and wife in lichfield and tramped to london accompanied only by david garrick afterwards the famous actor who had been one of his pupils here led by old associations johnson made himself known to the booksellers and now and then earned a penny by writing prefaces reviews and translations  it was a dogs life indeed that he led there with his literary brethren many of the writers of the day who are ridiculed in popes heartless dunciad having no wealthy patrons to support them lived largely in the streets and taverns sleeping on an ash heap or under a wharf like rats glad of a crust and happy over a single meal which enabled them to work for a while without the reminder of hunger a few favored ones lived in wretched lodgings in grub street which has since become a synonym for the fortunes of struggling writers195 often johnson tells us he walked the streets all night long in dreary weather when it was too cold to sleep without food or shelter but he wrote steadily for the booksellers and for the gentlemans magazine and presently he became known in london and received enough work to earn a bare living  the works which occasioned this small success were his poem london and his life of the poet savage a wretched life at best which were perhaps better left without a biographer but his success was genuine though small and presently the booksellers of london are coming to him to ask him to write a dictionary of the english language it was an enormous work taking nearly eight years of his time and long before he had finished it he had eaten up the money which he received for his labor in the leisure intervals of this work he wrote the vanity of human wishes and other poems and finished his classic tragedy of irene  led by the great success of the spectator johnson started two magazines the rambler 17501752 and the idler 17581760 later the rambler essays were published in book form and ran rapidly through ten editions but the financial returns were small and johnson spent a large part of his earnings in charity when his mother died in 1759 johnson although one of the best known men in london had no money and hurriedly finished rasselas his only romance in order it is said to pay for his mothers burial  it was not till 1762 when johnson was fiftythree years old that his literary labors were rewarded in the usual way by royalty and he received from george iii a yearly pension of three hundred pounds then began a little sunshine in his life with joshua reynolds the artist he founded the famous literary club of which burke pitt fox gibbon goldsmith and indeed all the great literary men and politicians of the time were members this is the period of johnsons famous conversations which were caught in minutest detail by boswell and given to the world his idea of conversation as shown in a hundred places in boswell is to overcome your adversary at any cost to knock him down by arguments or when these fail by personal ridicule to dogmatize on every possible question pronounce a few oracles and then desist with the air of victory concerning the philosopher humes view of death he says sir if he really thinks so his perceptions are disturbed he is mad if he does not think so he lies exit opposition there is nothing more to be said curiously enough it is often the palpable blunders of these monologues that now attract us as if we were enjoying a good joke at the dictators expense once a lady asked him dr johnson why did you define pastern as the knee of a horse ignorance madame pure ignorance thundered the great authority  when seventy years of age johnson was visited by several booksellers of the city who were about to bring out a new edition of the english poets and who wanted johnson as the leading literary man of london to write the prefaces to the several volumes the result was his lives of the poets as it is now known and this is his last literary work he died in his poor fleet street house in 1784 and was buried among englands honored poets in westminster abbey  johnsons works a book says dr johnson should help us either to enjoy life or to endure it judged by this standard one is puzzled what to recommend among johnsons numerous books the two things which belong among the things worthy to be remembered are his dictionary and his lives of the poets though both these are valuable not as literature but rather as a study of literature the dictionary as the first ambitious attempt at an english lexicon is extremely valuable notwithstanding the fact that his derivations are often faulty and that he frequently exercises his humor or prejudice in his curious definitions in defining oats for example as a grain given in england to horses and in scotland to the people he indulges his prejudice against the scotch whom he never understood just as in his definition of pension he takes occasion to rap the writers who had flattered their patrons since the days of elizabeth though he afterwards accepted a comfortable pension for himself with characteristic honesty he refused to alter his definition in subsequent editions of the dictionary  the lives of the poets are the simplest and most readable of his literary works for ten years before beginning these biographies he had given himself up to conversation and the ponderous style of his rambler essays here gives way to a lighter and more natural expression as criticisms they are often misleading giving praise to artificial poets like cowley and pope and doing scant justice or abundant injustice to nobler poets like gray and milton and they are not to be compared with those found in thomas wartons history of english poetry which was published in the same generation as biographies however they are excellent reading and we owe to them some of our best known pictures of the early english poets  of johnsons poems the reader will have enough if he glance over the vanity of human wishes his only story rasselas prince of abyssinia is a matter of rhetoric rather than of romance but is interesting still to the reader who wants to hear johnsons personal views of society philosophy and religion any one of his essays like that on reading or the pernicious effects of revery will be enough to acquaint the reader with the johnsonese style which was once much admired and copied by orators but which happily has been replaced by a more natural way of speaking most of his works it must be confessed are rather tiresome it is not to his books but rather to the picture of the man himself as given by boswell that johnson owes his great place in our literature   boswells life of johnson  in james boswell 17401795 we have another extraordinary figurea shallow little scotch barrister who trots about like a dog at the heels of his big master frantic at a caress and groveling at a cuff and abundantly contented if only he can be near him and record his oracles all his life long boswells one ambition seems to have been to shine in the reflected glory of great men and his chief task to record their sayings and doings when he came to london at twentytwo years of age johnson then at the beginning of his great fame was to this insatiable little gloryseeker like a silver doctor to a hungry trout he sought an introduction as a man seeks gold haunted every place where johnson declaimed until in daviess bookstore the supreme opportunity came this is his record of the great event  i was much agitated says boswell and recollecting his prejudice against the scotch of which i had heard much i said to davies dont tell him where i come from from scotland cried davies roguishly mr johnson said i i do indeed come from scotland but i cannot help it that sir cried johnson i find is what a very great many of your countrymen cannot help this stroke stunned me a good deal and when we had sat down i felt myself not a little embarrassed and apprehensive of what might come next  then for several years with a persistency that no rebuffs could abate and with a thick skin that no amount of ridicule could render sensitive he follows johnson forces his way into the literary club where he is not welcome in order to be near his idol carries him off on a visit to the hebrides talks with him on every possible occasion and when he is not invited to a feast waits outside the house or tavern in order to walk home with his master in the thick fog of the early morning and the moment the oracle is out of sight and in bed boswell patters home to record in detail all that he has seen and heard it is to his minute record that we owe our only perfect picture of a great man all his vanity as well as his greatness his prejudices superstitions and even the details of his personal appearance  there is the gigantic body the huge face seamed with the scars of disease the brown coat the black worsted stockings the gray wig with the scorched foretop the dirty hands the nails bitten and pared to the quick we see the eyes and mouth moving with convulsive twitches we see the heavy form rolling we hear it puffing and then comes the why sir and the what then sir and the no sir and the you dont see your way through the question sir196  to boswells record we are indebted also for our knowledge of those famous conversations those wordy knockdown battles which made johnson famous in his time and which still move us to wonder here is a specimen conversation taken almost at random from a hundred such in boswells incomparable biography after listening to johnsons prejudice against scotland and his dogmatic utterances on voltaire robertson and twenty others an unfortunate theorist brings up a recent essay on the possible future life of brutes quoting some possible authority from the sacred scriptures  johnson who did not like to hear anything concerning a future state which was not authorized by the regular canons of orthodoxy discouraged this talk and being offended at its continuation he watched an opportunity to give the gentleman a blow of reprehension so when the poor speculatist with a serious metaphysical pensive face addressed him but really sir when we see a very sensible dog we dont know what to think of him johnson rolling with joy at the thought which beamed in his eye turned quickly round and replied true sir and when we see a very foolish fellow we dont know what to think of him he then rose up strided to the fire and stood for some time laughing and exulting  then the oracle proceeds to talk of scorpions and natural history denying facts and demanding proofs which nobody could possibly furnish  he seemed pleased to talk of natural philosophy that woodcocks said he fly over the northern countries is proved because they have been observed at sea swallows certainly sleep all the winter a number of them conglobulate together by flying round and round and then all in a heap throw themselves under water and lie in the bed of a river he told us one of his first essays was a latin poem upon the glowworm i am sorry i did not ask where it was to be found  then follows an astonishing array of subjects and opinions he catalogues libraries settles affairs in china pronounces judgment on men who marry women superior to themselves flouts popular liberty hammers swift unmercifully and adds a few miscellaneous oracles most of which are about as reliable as his knowledge of the hibernation of swallows  when i called upon dr johnson next morning i found him highly satisfied with his colloquial prowess the preceding evening well said he we had good talk yes sir says i you tossed and gored several persons  far from resenting this curious mental dictatorship his auditors never seem to weary they hang upon his words praise him flatter him repeat his judgments all over london the next day and return in the evening hungry for more whenever the conversation begins to flag boswell is like a woman with a parrot or like a man with a dancing bear he must excite the creature make him talk or dance for the edification of the company he sidles obsequiously towards his hero and with utter irrelevancy propounds a question of theology a social theory a fashion of dress or marriage a philosophical conundrum do you think sir that natural affections are born with us or sir if you were shut up in a castle and a newborn babe with you what would you do then follow more johnsonian laws judgments oracles the insatiable audience clusters around him and applauds while boswell listens with shining face and presently goes home to write the wonder down it is an astonishing spectacle one does not know whether to laugh or grieve over it but we know the man and the audience almost as well as if we had been there and that unconsciously is the superb art of this matchless biographer  when johnson died the opportunity came for which boswell had been watching and waiting some twenty years he would shine in the world now not by reflection but by his own luminosity he gathered together his endless notes and records and began to write his biography but he did not hurry several biographies of johnson appeared in the four years after his death without disturbing boswells perfect complacency after seven years labor he gave the world his life of johnson it is an immortal work praise is superfluous it must be read to be appreciated like the greek sculptors the little slave produced a more enduring work than the great master the man who reads it will know johnson as he knows no other man who dwells across the border and he will lack sensitiveness indeed if he lay down the work without a greater love and appreciation of all good literature  later augustan writers with johnson who succeeded dryden and pope in the chief place of english letters the classic movement had largely spent its force and the latter half of the eighteenth century gives us an imposing array of writers who differ so widely that it is almost impossible to classify them in general three schools of writers are noticeable first the classicists who under johnsons lead insisted upon elegance and regularity of style second the romantic poets like collins gray thomson and burns who revolted from popes artificial couplets and wrote of nature and the human heart197 third the early novelists like defoe and fielding who introduced a new type of literature the romantic poets and the novelists are reserved for special chapters and of the other writersberkeley and hume in philosophy robertson hume and gibbon in history chesterfield and lady montagu in letter writing adam smith in economics pitt burke fox and a score of lesser writers in politicswe select only two burke and gibbon whose works are most typical of the augustan ie the elegant classic style of prose writing   edmund burke 17291797  to read all of burkes collected works and so to understand him thoroughly is something of a task few are equal to it on the other hand to read selections here and there as most of us do is to get a wrong idea of the man and to join either in fulsome praise of his brilliant oratory or in honest confession that his periods are ponderous and his ideas often buried under johnsonian verbiage such are the contrasts to be found on successive pages of burkes twelve volumes which cover the enormous range of the political and economic thought of the age and which mingle fact and fancy philosophy statistics and brilliant flights of the imagination to a degree never before seen in english literature for burke belongs in spirit to the new romantic school while in style he is a model for the formal classicists we can only glance at the life of this marvelous irishman and then consider his place in our literature  life burke was born in dublin the son of an irish barrister in 1729 after his university course in trinity college he came to london to study law but soon gave up the idea to follow literature which in turn led him to politics he had the soul the imagination of a poet and the law was only a clog to his progress his two first works a vindication of natural society and the origin of our ideas of the sublime and the beautiful brought him political as well as literary recognition and several small offices were in turn given to him when thirtysix years old he was elected to parliament as member from wendover and for the next thirty years he was the foremost figure in the house of commons and the most eloquent orator which that body has ever known pure and incorruptible in his politics as in his personal life no more learned or devoted servant of the commonwealth ever pleaded for justice and human liberty he was at the summit of his influence at the time when the colonies were struggling for independence and the fact that he championed their cause in one of his greatest speeches on conciliation with america gives him an added interest in the eyes of american readers his championship of america is all the more remarkable from the fact that in other matters burke was far from liberal he set himself squarely against the teachings of the romantic writers who were enthusiastic over the french revolution he denounced the principles of the revolutionists broke with the liberal whig party to join the tories and was largely instrumental in bringing on the terrible war with france which resulted in the downfall of napoleon  it is good to remember that in all the strife and bitterness of party politics burke held steadily to the noblest personal ideals of truth and honesty and that in all his work whether opposing the slave trade or pleading for justice for america or protecting the poor natives of india from the greed of corporations or setting himself against the popular sympathy for france in her desperate struggle he aimed solely at the welfare of humanity when he retired on a pension in 1794 he had won and he deserved the gratitude and affection of the whole nation  works there are three distinctly marked periods in burkes career and these correspond closely to the years in which he was busied with the affairs of america india and france successively the first period was one of prophecy he had studied the history and temper of the american colonies and he warned england of the disaster which must follow her persistence in ignoring the american demands and especially the american spirit his great speeches on american taxation and on conciliation with america were delivered in 1774 and 1775 preceding the declaration of independence in this period burkes labor seemed all in vain he lost his cause and england her greatest colony  the second period is one of denunciation rather than of prophecy england had won india but when burke studied the methods of her victory and understood the soulless way in which millions of poor natives were made to serve the interests of an english monopoly his soul rose in revolt and again he was the champion of an oppressed people his two greatest speeches of this period are the nabob of arcots debts and his tremendous impeachment of warren hastings again he apparently lost his cause though he was still fighting on the side of right hastings was acquitted and the spoliation of india went on but the seeds of reform were sown and grew and bore fruit long after burkes labors were ended  the third period is curiously enough one of reaction whether because the horrors of the french revolution had frightened him with the danger of popular liberty or because his own advance in office and power had made him side unconsciously with the upper classes is unknown that he was as sincere and noble now as in all his previous life is not questioned he broke with the liberal whigs and joined forces with the reactionary tories he opposed the romantic writers who were on fire with enthusiasm over the french revolution and thundered against the dangers which the revolutionary spirit must breed forgetting that it was a revolution which had made modern england possible here where we must judge him to have been mistaken in his cause he succeeded for the first time it was due largely to burkes influence that the growing sympathy for the french people was checked in england and war was declared which ended in the frightful victories of trafalgar and waterloo  burkes best known work of this period is his reflections on the french revolution which he polished and revised again essay on and again before it was finally printed this ambitious literary essay though it met with remarkable success is a disappointment to the reader though of celtic blood burke did not understand the french or the principles for which the common people were fighting in their own way198 and his denunciations and apostrophes to france suggest a preacher without humor hammering away at sinners who are not present in his congregation the essay has few illuminating ideas but a great deal of johnsonian rhetoric which make its periods tiresome notwithstanding our admiration for the brilliancy of its author more significant is one of burkes first essays a philosophical inquiry into the origin of our ideas of the sublime and beautiful which is sometimes read in order to show the contrast in style with addisons spectator essays on the pleasures of the imagination  burkes best known speeches on conciliation with america american taxation and the impeachment of warren hastings are still much studied in our schools as models of english prose and this fact tends to give them an exaggerated literary importance viewed purely as literature they have faults enough and the first of these so characteristic of the classic age is that they abound in fine rhetoric but lack simplicity199 in a strict sense these eloquent speeches are not literature to delight the reader and to suggest ideas but studies in rhetoric and in mental concentration all this however is on the surface a careful study of any of these three famous speeches reveals certain admirable qualities which account for the important place they are given in the study of english first as showing the stateliness and the rhetorical power of our language these speeches are almost unrivaled second though burke speaks in prose he is essentially a poet whose imagery like that of miltons prose works is more remarkable than that of many of our writers of verse he speaks in figures images symbols and the musical cadence of his sentences reflects the influence of his wide reading of poetry not only in figurative expression but much more in spirit he belongs with the poets of the revival at times his language is pseudoclassic reflecting the influence of johnson and his school but his thought is always romantic he is governed by ideal rather than by practical interests and a profound sympathy for humanity is perhaps his most marked characteristic  third the supreme object of these orations so different from the majority of political speeches is not to win approval or to gain votes but to establish the truth like our own lincoln burke had a superb faith in the compelling power of the truth a faith in men also who if the history of our race means anything will not willingly follow a lie the methods of these two great leaders are strikingly similar in this respect that each repeats his idea in many ways presenting the truth from different view points so that it will appeal to men of widely different experiences otherwise the two men are in marked contrast the uneducated lincoln speaks in simple homely words draws his illustrations from the farm and often adds a humorous story so apt and telling that his hearers can never forget the point of his argument the scholarly burke speaks in ornate majestic periods and searches all history and all literature for his illustrations his wealth of imagery and allusions together with his rare combination of poetic and logical reasoning make these orations remarkable entirely apart from their subject and purpose  fourth and perhaps most significant of the man and his work burke takes his stand squarely upon the principle of justice he has studied history and he finds that to establish justice between man and man and between nation and nation has been the supreme object of every reformer since the world began no small or merely temporary success attracts him only the truth will suffice for an argument and nothing less than justice will ever settle a question permanently such is his platform simple as the golden rule unshakable as the moral law hence though he apparently fails of his immediate desire in each of these three orations the principle for which he contends cannot fail as a modern writer says of lincoln the full rich flood of his life through the nations pulse is yet beating and his words are still potent in shaping the course of english politics in the way of justice   edward gibbon 17371794  to understand burke or johnson one must read a multitude of books and be wary in his judgment but with gibbon the task is comparatively easy for one has only to consider two books his memoirs and the first volume of his history to understand the author in his memoirs we have an interesting reflection of gibbons own personalitya man who looks with satisfaction on the material side of things who seeks always the easiest path for himself and avoids lifes difficulties and responsibilities i sighed as a lover but i obeyed as a son he says when to save his inheritance he gave up the woman he loved and came home to enjoy the paternal loaves and fishes that is suggestive of the mans whole life his history on the other hand is a remarkable work it was the first in our language to be written on scientific principles and with a solid basis of fact and the style is the very climax of that classicism which had ruled england for an entire century its combination of historical fact and literary style makes the decline and fall of the roman empire the one thing of gibbons life that is worthy to be remembered  gibbons history for many years gibbon had meditated like milton upon an immortal work and had tried several historical subjects only to give them up idly in his journal he tells us how his vague resolutions were brought to a focus  it was at rome on the fifteenth of october 1764 as i sat musing amidst the ruins of the capitol while the barefooted friars were singing vespers in the temple of jupiter that the idea of writing the decline and fall of the city first started to my mind  twelve years later in 1776 gibbon published the first volume of the decline and fall of the roman empire and the enormous success of the work encouraged him to go on with the other five volumes which were published at intervals during the next twelve years the history begins with the reign of trajan in ad 98 and builds a straight roman road through the confused histories of thirteen centuries ending with the fall of the byzantine empire in 1453 the scope of the history is enormous it includes not only the decline of the roman empire but such movements as the descent of the northern barbarians the spread of christianity the reorganization of the european nations the establishment of the great eastern empire the rise of mohammedanism and the splendor of the crusades on the one hand it lacks philosophical insight being satisfied with facts without comprehending the causes and as gibbon seems lacking in ability to understand spiritual and religious movements it is utterly inadequate in its treatment of the tremendous influence of christianity on the other hand gibbons scholarship leaves little to criticise he read enormously sifted his facts out of multitudes of books and records and then marshaled them in the imposing array with which we have grown familiar moreover he is singularly just and discriminating in the use of all documents and authorities at his command hence he has given us the first history in english that has borne successfully the test of modern research and scholarship  the style of the work is as imposing as his great subject indeed with almost any other subject the sonorous roll of his majestic sentences would be out of place while it deserves all the adjectives that have been applied to it by enthusiastic admirersfinished elegant splendid rounded massive sonorous copious elaborate ornate exhaustiveit must be confessed though one whispers the confession that the style sometimes obscures our interest in the narrative as he sifted his facts from a multitude of sources so he often hides them again in endless periods and one must often sift them out again in order to be quite sure of even the simple facts another drawback is that gibbon is hopelessly worldly in his point of view he loves pageants and crowds rather than individuals and he is lacking in enthusiasm and in spiritual insight the result is so frankly material at times that one wonders if he is not reading of forces or machines rather than of human beings a little reading of his history here and there is an excellent thing leaving one impressed with the elegant classical style and the scholarship but a continued reading is very apt to leave us longing for simplicity for naturalness and above all for the glow of enthusiasm which makes the dead heroes live once more in the written pages  this judgment however must not obscure the fact that the book had a remarkably large sale and that this of itself is an evidence that multitudes of readers found it not only erudite but readable and interesting  ii the revival of romantic poetry        the old order changeth yielding place to new       and god fulfills himself in many ways       lest one good custom should corrupt the world                      tennysons the passing of arthur  the meaning of romanticism while dryden pope and johnson were successively the dictators of english letters and while under their leadership the heroic couplet became the fashion of poetry and literature in general became satiric or critical in spirit and formal in expression a new romantic movement quietly made its appearance thomsons the seasons 1730 was the first noteworthy poem of the romantic revival and the poems and the poets increased steadily in number and importance till in the age of wordsworth and scott the spirit of romanticism dominated our literature more completely than classicism had ever done this romantic movementwhich victor hugo calls liberalism in literatureis simply the expression of life as seen by imagination rather than by prosaic common sense which was the central doctrine of english philosophy in the eighteenth century it has six prominent characteristics which distinguish it from the socalled classic literature which we have just studied  1 the romantic movement was marked and is always marked by a strong reaction and protest against the bondage of rule and custom which in science and theology as well as in literature generally tend to fetter the free human spirit  2 romanticism returned to nature and to plain humanity for its material and so is in marked contrast to classicism which had confined itself largely to the clubs and drawingrooms and to the social and political life of london thomsons seasons whatever its defects was a revelation of the natural wealth and beauty which for nearly a century had been hardly noticed by the great writers of england  3 it brought again the dream of a golden age200 in which the stern realities of life were forgotten and the ideals of youth were established as the only permanent realities for the dreamer lives forever but the toiler dies in a day expresses perhaps only the wild fancy of a modern poet but when we think of it seriously the dreams and ideals of a people are cherished possessions long after their stone monuments have crumbled away and their battles are forgotten the romantic movement emphasized these eternal ideals of youth and appealed to the human heart as the classic elegance of dryden and pope could never do  4 romanticism was marked by intense human sympathy and by a consequent understanding of the human heart not to intellect or to science does the heart unlock its treasures but rather to the touch of a sympathetic nature and things that are hidden from the wise and prudent are revealed unto children pope had no appreciable humanity swifts work is a frightful satire addison delighted polite society but had no message for plain people while even johnson with all his kindness had no feeling for men in the mass but supported sir robert walpole in his policy of letting evils alone until forced by a revolution to take notice of humanitys appeal with the romantic revival all this was changed while howard was working heroically for prison reform and wilberforce for the liberation of the slaves gray wrote his short and simple annals of the poor and goldsmith his deserted village and cowper sang                       my ear is pained     my soul is sick with every days report     of wrong and outrage with which earth is filled     there is no flesh in mans obdurate heart     it does not feel for man201  this sympathy for the poor and this cry against oppression grew stronger and stronger till it culminated in bobby burns who more than any other writer in any language is the poet of the unlettered human heart  5 the romantic movement was the expression of individual genius rather than of established rules in consequence the literature of the revival is as varied as the characters and moods of the different writers when we read pope for instance we have a general impression of sameness as if all his polished poems were made in the same machine but in the work of the best romanticists there is endless variety to read them is like passing through a new village meeting a score of different human types and finding in each one something to love or to remember nature and the heart of man are as new as if we had never studied them hence in reading the romanticists who went to these sources for their material we are seldom wearied but often surprised and the surprise is like that of the sunrise or the sea which always offers some new beauty and stirs us deeply as if we had never seen it before  6 the romantic movement while it followed its own genius was not altogether unguided strictly speaking there is no new movement either in history or in literature each grows out of some good thing which has preceded it and looks back with reverence to past masters spenser shakespeare and milton were the inspiration of the romantic revival and we can hardly read a poem of the early romanticists without finding a suggestion of the influence of one of these great leaders202  there are various other characteristics of romanticism but these sixthe protest against the bondage of rules the return to nature and the human heart the interest in old sagas and mediæval romances as suggestive of a heroic age the sympathy for the toilers of the world the emphasis upon individual genius and the return to milton and the elizabethans instead of to pope and dryden for literary modelsare the most noticeable and the most interesting remembering them we shall better appreciate the work of the following writers who in varying degree illustrate the revival of romantic poetry in the eighteenth century  thomas gray 17161771      the curfew tolls the knell of parting day     the lowing herd wind slowly oer the lea     the plowman homeward plods his weary way     and leaves the world to darkness and to me     now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight     and all the air a solemn stillness holds     save where the beetle wheels his droning flight     and drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds  so begins the best known poem in the english language a poem full of the gentle melancholy which marks all early romantic poetry it should be read entire as a perfect model of its kind not even miltons il penseroso which it strongly suggests excels it in beauty and suggestiveness  life of gray the author of the famous elegy is the most scholarly and wellbalanced of all the early romantic poets in his youth he was a weakling the only one of twelve children who survived infancy and his unhappy childhood the tyranny of his father and the separation from his loved mother gave to his whole life the stamp of melancholy which is noticeable in all his poems at the famous eton school and again at cambridge he seems to have followed his own scholarly tastes rather than the curriculum and was shocked like gibbon at the general idleness and aimlessness of university life one happy result of his school life was his friendship for horace walpole who took him abroad for a three years tour of the continent  no better index of the essential difference between the classical and the new romantic school can be imagined than that which is revealed in the letters of gray and addison as they record their impressions of foreign travel thus when addison crossed the alps some twentyfive years before in good weather he wrote a very troublesome journey you cannot imagine how i am pleased with the sight of a plain gray crossed the alps in the beginning of winter wrapped in muffs hoods and masks of beaver fur boots and bearskins but wrote ecstatically not a precipice not a torrent not a cliff but is pregnant with religion and poetry  on his return to england gray lived for a short time at stoke poges where he wrote his ode on eton and probably sketched his elegy which however was not finished till 1750 eight years later during the latter years of his shy and scholarly life he was professor of modern history and languages at cambridge without any troublesome work of lecturing to students here he gave himself up to study and to poetry varying his work by prowlings among the manuscripts of the new british museum and by his lilliputian travels in england and scotland he died in his rooms at pembroke college in 1771 and was buried in the little churchyard of stoke poges  works of gray grays letters published in 1775 are excellent reading and his journal is still a model of natural description but it is to a single small volume of poems that he owes his fame and his place in literature these poems divide themselves naturally into three periods in which we may trace the progress of grays emancipation from the classic rules which had so long governed english literature in the first period he wrote several minor poems of which the best are his hymn to adversity and the odes to spring and on a distant prospect of eton college these early poems reveal two suggestive things first the appearance of that melancholy which characterizes all the poetry of the period and second the study of nature not for its own beauty or truth but rather as a suitable background for the play of human emotions  the second period shows the same tendencies more strongly developed the elegy written in a country churchyard 1750 the most perfect poem of the age belongs to this period to read miltons il penseroso and grays elegy is to see the beginning and the perfection of that literature of melancholy which largely occupied english poets for more than a century two other wellknown poems of this second period are the pindaric odes the progress of poesy and the bard the first is strongly suggestive of drydens alexanders feast but shows miltons influence in a greater melody and variety of expression the bard is in every way more romantic and original an old minstrel the last of the welsh singers halts king edward and his army in a wild mountain pass and with fine poetic frenzy prophesies the terror and desolation which must ever follow the tyrant from its first line ruin seize thee ruthless king to the end when the old bard plunges from his lofty crag and disappears in the rivers flood the poem thrills with the fire of an ancient and noble race of men it breaks absolutely with the classical school and proclaims a literary declaration of independence  in the third period gray turns momentarily from his welsh material and reveals a new field of romantic interest in two norse poems the fatal sisters and the descent of odin 1761 gray translated his material from the latin and though these two poems lack much of the elemental strength and grandeur of the norse sagas they are remarkable for calling attention to the unused wealth of literary material that was hidden in northern mythologv to gray and to percy who published his northern antiquities in 1770 is due in large measure the profound interest in the old norse sagas which has continued to our own day  taken together grays works form a most interesting commentary on the varied life of the eighteenth century he was a scholar familiar with all the intellectual interests of his age and his work has much of the precision and polish of the classical school but he shares also the reawakened interest in nature in common man and in mediæval culture and his work is generally romantic both in style and in spirit the same conflict between the classic and romantic schools and the triumph of romanticism is shown clearly in the most versatile of grays contemporaries oliver goldsmith  oliver goldsmith 17281774  because the deserted village is one of the most familiar poems in our language goldsmith is generally given a high place among the poets of the romantic dawn but the village when we read it carefully turns out to be a rimed essay in the style of popes famous essay on man it owes its popularity to the sympathetic memories which it awakens rather than to its poetic excellence it is as a prose writer that goldsmith excels he is an essayist with addisons fine polish but with more sympathy for human life he is a dramatist one of the very few who have ever written a comedy that can keep its popularity unchanged while a century rolls over its head but greater perhaps than the poet and essayist and dramatist is goldsmith the novelist who set himself to the important work of purifying the early novel of its brutal and indecent tendencies and who has given us in the vicar of wakefield one of the most enduring characters in english fiction in his manner especially in his poetry goldsmith was too much influenced by his friend johnson and the classicists but in his matter in his sympathy for nature and human life he belongs unmistakably to the new romantic school altogether he is the most versatile the most charming the most inconsistent and the most lovable genius of all the literary men who made famous the age of johnson  life goldsmiths career is that of an irresponsible unbalanced genius which would make one despair if the man himself did not remain so lovable in all his inconsistencies he was born in the village of pallas ireland the son of a poor irish curate whose noble character is portrayed in dr primrose of the vicar of wakefield and in the country parson of the deserted village after an unsatisfactory course in various schools where he was regarded as hopelessly stupid goldsmith entered trinity college dublin as a sizar ie a student who pays with labor for his tuition by his escapades he was brought into disfavor with the authorities but that troubled him little he was also wretchedly poor which troubled him less for when he earned a few shillings by writing ballads for street singers his money went oftener to idle beggars than to the paying of his honest debts after three years of university life he ran away in dimenovel fashion and nearly starved to death before he was found and brought back in disgrace then he worked a little and obtained his degree in 1749  strange that such an idle and irresponsible youth should have been urged by his family to take holy orders but such was the fact for two years more goldsmith labored with theology only to be rejected when he presented himself as a candidate for the ministry he tried teaching and failed then his fancy turned to america and provided with money and a good horse he started off for cork where he was to embark for the new world he loafed along the pleasant irish ways missed his ship and presently turned up cheerfully amongst his relatives minus all his money and riding a sorry nag called fiddleback for which he had traded his own on the way203 he borrowed fifty pounds more and started for london to study law but speedily lost his money at cards and again appeared amiable and irresponsible as ever among his despairing relatives the next year they sent him to edinburgh to study medicine here for a couple of years he became popular as a singer of songs and a teller of tales to whom medicine was only a troublesome affliction suddenly the wanderlust seized him and he started abroad ostensibly to complete his medical education but in reality to wander like a cheerful beggar over europe singing and playing his flute for food and lodging he may have studied a little at leyden and at padua but that was only incidental after a year or more of vagabondage he returned to london with an alleged medical degree said to have been obtained at louvain or padua  the next few years are a pitiful struggle to make a living as tutor apothecarys assistant comedian usher in a country school and finally as a physician in southwark gradually he drifted into literature and lived from hand to mouth by doing hack work for the london booksellers some of his essays and his citizen of the world 17601761 brought him to the attention of johnson who looked him up was attracted first by his poverty and then by his genius and presently declared him to be one of the first men we now have as an author johnsons friendship proved invaluable and presently goldsmith found himself a member of the exclusive literary club he promptly justified johnsons confidence by publishing the traveller 1764 which was hailed as one of the finest poems of the century money now came to him liberally with orders from the booksellers he took new quarters in fleet street and furnished them gorgeously but he had an inordinate vanity for brightcolored clothes and faster than he earned money he spent it on velvet cloaks and in indiscriminate charity for a time he resumed his practice as a physician but his fine clothes did not bring patients as he expected and presently he turned to writing again to pay his debts to the booksellers he produced several superficial and grossly inaccurate schoolbookslike his animated nature and his histories of england greece and romewhich brought him bread and more fine clothes and his vicar of wakefield the deserted village and she stoops to conquer which brought him undying fame  after meeting with johnson goldsmith became the object of boswells magpie curiosity and to boswells life of johnson we are indebted for many of the details of goldsmiths lifehis homeliness his awkward ways his drolleries and absurdities which made him alternately the butt and the wit of the famous literary club boswell disliked goldsmith and so draws an unflattering portrait but even this does not disguise the contagious good humor which made men love him when in his fortyseventh year he fell sick of a fever and with childish confidence turned to a quack medicine to cure himself he died in 1774 and johnson placed a tablet with a sonorous latin epitaph in westminster abbey though goldsmith was buried elsewhere let not his frailties be remembered he was a very great man said johnson and the literary worldwhich like that old dictator is kind enough at heart though often rough in its methodsis glad to accept and record the verdict  works of goldsmith of goldsmiths early essays and his later school histories little need be said they have settled into their own place far out of sight of the ordinary reader perhaps the most interesting of these is a series of letters for the public ledger afterwards published as the citizen of the world written from the view point of an alleged chinese traveler and giving the latters comments on english civilization204 the following five works are those upon which goldsmiths fame chiefly rests  the traveller 1764 made goldsmiths reputation among his contemporaries but is now seldom read except by students who would understand how goldsmith was at one time dominated by johnson and his pseudoclassic ideals it is a long poem in rimed couplets giving a survey and criticism of the social life of various countries in europe and reflects many of goldsmiths own wanderings and impressions  the deserted village 1770 though written in the same mechanical style is so permeated with honest human sympathy and voices so perfectly the revolt of the individual man against institutions that a multitude of common people heard it gladly without consulting the critics as to whether they should call it good poetry notwithstanding its faults to which matthew arnold has called sufficient attention it has become one of our best known poems though we cannot help wishing that the monotony of its couplets had been broken by some of the irish folk songs and ballads that charmed street audiences in dublin and that brought goldsmith a welcome from the french peasants wherever he stopped to sing in the village parson and the schoolmaster goldsmith has increased chaucers list by two lovable characters that will endure as long as the english language the criticism that the picture of prosperous sweet auburn never applied to any village in ireland is just no doubt but it is outside the question goldsmith was a hopeless dreamer bound to see everything as he saw his debts and his gay clothes in a purely idealistic way  the goodnatured man and she stoops to conquer are goldsmiths two comedies the former a comedy of character though it has some laughable scenes and one laughable character croaker met with failure on the stage and has never been revived with any success the latter a comedy of intrigue is one of the few plays that has never lost its popularity its lively bustling scenes and its pleasantly absurd characters marlowe the hardcastles and tony lumpkin still hold the attention of modern theater goers and nearly every amateur dramatic club sooner or later places she stoops to conquer on its list of attractions  the vicar of wakefield is goldsmiths only novel and the first in any language that gives to home life an enduring romantic interest however much we admire the beginnings of the english novel to which we shall presently refer we are nevertheless shocked by its frequent brutalities and indecencies goldsmith like steele had the irish reverence for pure womanhood and this reverence made him shun as a pest the vulgarity and coarseness in which contemporary novelists like smollett and sterne seemed to delight so he did for the novel what addison and steele had done for the satire and the essay he refined and elevated it making it worthy of the old anglosaxon ideals which are our best literary heritage  briefly the vicar of wakefield is the story of a simple english clergyman dr primrose and his family who pass from happiness through great tribulation misfortunes which are said never to come singly appear in this case in flocks but through poverty sorrow imprisonment and the unspeakable loss of his daughters the vicars faith in god and man emerges triumphant to the very end he is like one of the old martyrs who sings alleluia while the lions roar about him and his children in the arena goldsmiths optimism it must be confessed is here stretched to the breaking point the reader is sometimes offered fine johnsonian phrases where he would naturally expect homely and vigorous language and he is continually haunted by the suspicion that even in this best of all possible worlds the vicars clouds of affliction were somewhat too easily converted into showers of blessing yet he is forced to read on and at the end he confesses gladly that goldsmith has succeeded in making a most interesting story out of material that in other hands would have developed either a burlesque or a brutal tragedy laying aside all romantic passion intrigue and adventure upon which other novelists depended goldsmith in this simple story of common life has accomplished three noteworthy results he has made human fatherhood almost a divine thing he has glorified the moral sentiments which cluster about the family life as the center of civilization and he has given us in dr primrose a striking and enduring figure which seems more like a personal acquaintance than a character in a book   william cowper 17311800  in cowper we have another interesting poet who like gray and goldsmith shows the struggle between romantic and classic ideals in his first volume of poems cowper is more hampered by literary fashions than was goldsmith in his traveller and his deserted village in his second period however cowper uses blank verse freely and his delight in nature and in homely characters like the teamster and the mail carrier of the task shows that his classicism is being rapidly thawed out by romantic feeling in his later work especially his immortal john gilpin cowper flings fashions aside gives pegasus the reins takes to the open road and so proves himself a worthy predecessor of burns who is the most spontaneous and the most interesting of all the early romanticists  life cowpers life is a pathetic story of a shy and timid genius who found the world of men too rough and who withdrew to nature like a wounded animal he was born at great berkhamstead hertfordshire in 1731 the son of an english clergyman he was a delicate sensitive child whose early life was saddened by the death of his mother and by his neglect at home at six years he was sent away to a boys school where he was terrified by young barbarians who made his life miserable there was one atrocious bully into whose face cowper could never look he recognized his enemy by his shoe buckles and shivered at his approach the fierce invectives of his tirocinium or a review of schools 1784 shows how these school experiences had affected his mind and health for twelve years he studied law but at the approach of a public examination for an office he was so terrified that he attempted suicide the experience unsettled his reason and the next twelve months were spent in an asylum at st albans the death of his father in 1756 had brought the poet a small patrimony which placed him above the necessity of struggling like goldsmith for his daily bread upon his recovery he boarded for years at the house of the unwins cultured people who recognized the genius hidden in this shy and melancholy yet quaintly humorous man mrs unwin in particular cared for him as a son and whatever happiness he experienced in his poor life was the result of the devotion of this good woman who is the mary of all his poems  a second attack of insanity was brought on by cowpers morbid interest in religion influenced perhaps by the untempered zeal of one john newton a curate with whom cowper worked in the small parish of olney and with whom he compiled the famous olney hymns the rest of his life between intervals of melancholia or insanity was spent in gardening in the care of his numerous pets and in writing his poems his translation of homer and his charming letters his two best known poems were suggested by a lively and cultivated widow lady austen who told him the story of john gilpin and called for a ballad on the subject she also urged him to write a long poem in blank verse and when he demanded a subject she whimsically suggested the sofa which was a new article of furniture at that time cowper immediately wrote the sofa and influenced by the poetic possibilities that lie in unexpected places he added to this poem from time to time and called his completed work the task this was published in 1785 and the author was instantly recognized as one of the chief poets of his age the last years of his life were a long battle with insanity until death mercifully ended the struggle in 1800 his last poem the castaway is a cry of despair in which under guise of a man washed overboard in a storm he describes himself perishing in the sight of friends who are powerless to help  cowpers works cowpers first volume of poems containing the progress of error truth table talk etc is interesting chiefly as showing how the poet was bound by the classical rules of his age these poems are dreary on the whole but a certain gentleness and especially a vein of pure humor occasionally rewards the reader for cowper was a humorist and only the constant shadow of insanity kept him from becoming famous in that line alone  the task written in blank verse and published in 1785 is cowpers longest poem used as we are to the natural poetry of wordsworth and tennyson it is hard for us to appreciate the striking originality of this work much of it is conventional and wooden to be sure like much of wordsworths poetry but when after reading the rimed essays and the artificial couplets of johnsons age we turn suddenly to cowpers description of homely scenes of woods and brooks of plowmen and teamsters and the letter carrier on his rounds we realize that we are at the dawn of a better day in poetry      he comes the herald of a noisy world     with spatterd boots strappd waist and frozen locks     news from all nations lumbering at his back     true to his charge the closepacked load behind     yet careless what he brings his one concern     is to conduct it to the destined inn     and having dropped the expected bag pass on     he whistles as he goes lighthearted wretch     cold and yet cheerful messenger of grief     perhaps to thousands and of joy to some     to him indifferent whether grief or joy     houses in ashes and the fall of stocks     births deaths and marriages epistles wet     with tears that trickled down the writers cheeks     fast as the periods from his fluent quill     or charged with amorous sighs of absent swains     or nymphs responsive equally affect     his horse and him unconscious of them all  cowpers most laborious work the translation of homer in blank verse was published in 1791 its stately miltonlike movement and its better rendering of the greek make this translation far superior to popes artificial couplets it is also better in many respects than chapmans more famous and more fanciful rendering but for some reason it was not successful and has never received the recognition which it deserves entirely different in spirit are the poets numerous hymns which were published in the olney collection in 1779 and which are still used in our churches it is only necessary to mention a few first linesgod moves in a mysterious way oh for a closer walk with god sometimes a light surprisesto show how his gentle and devout spirit has left its impress upon thousands who now hardly know his name with cowpers charming letters published in 1803 we reach the end of his important works and the student who enjoys reading letters will find that these rank among the best of their kind it is not however for his ambitious works that cowper is remembered but rather for his minor poems which have found their own way into so many homes among these the one that brings quickest response from hearts that understand is his little poem on the receipt of my mothers picture beginning with the striking line oh that those lips had language another called alexander selkirk beginning i am monarch of all i survey suggests how selkirks experiences as a castaway which gave defoe his inspiration for robinson crusoe affected the poets timid nature and imagination last and most famous of all is his immortal john gilpin cowper was in a terrible fit of melancholy when lady austen told him the story which proved to be better than medicine for all night long chuckles and suppressed laughter were heard in the poets bedroom next morning at breakfast he recited the ballad that had afforded its author so much delight in the making the student should read it even if he reads nothing else by cowper and he will be lacking in humor or appreciation if he is not ready to echo heartily the last stanza      now let us sing long live the king     and gilpin long live he     and when he next doth ride abroad     may i be there to see   robert burns 17591796  after a century and more of classicism we noted with interest the work of three men gray goldsmith and cowper whose poetry like the chorus of awakening birds suggests the dawn of another day two other poets of the same age suggest the sunrise the first is the plowman burns who speaks straight from the heart to the primitive emotions of the race the second is the mystic blake who only half understands his own thoughts and whose words stir a sensitive nature as music does or the moon in midheaven rousing in the soul those vague desires and aspirations which ordinarily sleep and which can never be expressed because they have no names blake lived his shy mystic spiritual life in the crowded city and his message is to the few who can understand burns lived his sad toilsome erring life in the open air with the sun and the rain and his songs touch all the world the latters poetry so far as it has a philosophy rests upon two principles which the classic school never understoodthat common people are at heart romantic and lovers of the ideal and that simple human emotions furnish the elements of true poetry largely because he follows these two principles burns is probably the greatest song writer of the world his poetic creed may be summed up in one of his own stanzas      give me ae spark o natures fire     thats a the learning i desire     then though i trudge thro dub an mire            at pleugh or cart     my muse though hamely in attire            may touch the heart  life205 burnss life is a life of fragments as carlyle called it and the different fragments are as unlike as the noble cotters saturday night and the rant and riot of the jolly beggars the details of this sad and disjointed life were better perhaps forgotten we call attention only to the facts which help us to understand the man and his poetry  burns was born in a clay cottage at alloway scotland in the bleak winter of 1759 his father was an excellent type of the scotch peasant of those daysa poor honest godfearing man who toiled from dawn till dark to wrest a living for his family from the stubborn soil his tall figure was bent with unceasing labor his hair was thin and gray and in his eyes was the careworn hunted look of a peasant driven by poverty and unpaid rents from one poor farm to another the family often fasted of necessity and lived in solitude to avoid the temptation of spending their hardearned money the children went barefoot and bareheaded in all weathers and shared the parents toil and their anxiety over the rents at thirteen bobby the eldest was doing a peasants full days labor at sixteen he was chief laborer on his fathers farm and he describes the life as the cheerless gloom of a hermit and the unceasing moil of a galley slave in 1784 the father after a lifetime of toil was saved from a debtors prison by consumption and death to rescue something from the wreck of the home and to win a poor chance of bread for the family the two older boys set up a claim for arrears of wages that had never been paid with the small sum allowed them they buried their father took another farm mossgiel in mauchline and began again the long struggle with poverty  such in outline is burnss own story of his early life taken mostly from his letters there is another and more pleasing side to the picture of which we have glimpses in his poems and in his commonplace book here we see the boy at school for like most scotch peasants the father gave his boys the best education he possibly could we see him following the plow not like a slave but like a free man crooning over an old scotch song and making a better one to match the melody we see him stop the plow to listen to what the wind is saying or turn aside lest he disturb the birds at their singing and nest making at supper we see the family about the table happy notwithstanding their scant fare each child with a spoon in one hand and a book in the other we hear betty davidson reciting from her great store some heroic ballad that fired the young hearts to enthusiasm and made them forget the days toil and in the cotters saturday night we have a glimpse of scotch peasant life that makes us almost reverence these heroic men and women who kept their faith and their selfrespect in the face of poverty and whose hearts under their rough exteriors were tender and true as steel  a most unfortunate change in burnss life began when he left the farm at seventeen and went to kirkoswald to study surveying the town was the haunt of smugglers roughliving harddrinking men and burns speedily found his way into those scenes of riot and roaring dissipation which were his bane ever afterwards for a little while he studied diligently but one day while taking the altitude of the sun he saw a pretty girl in the neighboring garden and love put trigonometry to flight soon he gave up his work and wandered back to the farm and poverty again  when twentyseven years of age burns first attracted literary attention and in the same moment sprang to the first place in scottish letters in despair over his poverty and personal habits he resolved to emigrate to jamaica and gathered together a few of his early poems hoping to sell them for enough to pay the expenses of his journey the result was the famous kilmarnock edition of burns published in 1786 for which he was offered twenty pounds it is said that he even bought his ticket and on the night before the ship sailed wrote his farewell to scotland beginning the gloomy night is gathering fast which he intended to be his last song on scottish soil  in the morning he changed his mind led partly by some dim foreshadowing of the result of his literary adventure for the little book took all scotland by storm not only scholars and literary men but even plowboys and maid servants says a contemporary eagerly spent their hardearned shillings for the new book instead of going to jamaica the young poet hurried to edinburgh to arrange for another edition of his work his journey was a constant ovation and in the capital he was welcomed and feasted by the best of scottish society this inexpected triumph lasted only one winter burnss fondness for taverns and riotous living shocked his cultured entertainers and when he returned to edinburgh next winter after a pleasure jaunt through the highlands he received scant attention he left the city in anger and disappointment and went back to the soil where he was more at home  the last few years of burnss life are a sad tragedy and we pass over them hurriedly he bought the farm ellisland dumfriesshire and married the faithful jean armour in 1788 that he could write of her      i see her in the dewy flowers     i see her sweet and fair     i hear her in the tunefu birds     i hear her charm the air     theres not a bonie flower that springs     by fountain shaw or green     theres not a bonie bird that sings     but minds me o my jean  is enough for us to remember the next year he was appointed exciseman ie collector of liquor revenues and the small salary with the return from his poems would have been sufficient to keep his family in modest comfort had he but kept away from taverns for a few years his life of alternate toil and dissipation was occasionally illumined by his splendid lyric genius and he produced many songsbonnie doon my loves like a red red rose auld lang syne highland mary and the soulstirring scots wha hae composed while galloping over the moor in a stormwhich have made the name of burns known wherever the english language is spoken and honored wherever scotchmen gather together he died miserably in 1796 when only thirtyseven years old his last letter was an appeal to a friend for money to stave off the bailiff and one of his last poems a tribute to jessie lewars a kind lassie who helped to care for him in his illness this last exquisite lyric o wert thou in the cauld blast set to mendelssohns music is one of our best known songs though its history is seldom suspected by those who sing it  the poetry of burns the publication of the kilmarnock burns with the title poems chiefly in the scottish dialect 1786 marks an epoch in the history of english literature like the publication of spensers shepherds calendar after a century of cold and formal poetry relieved only by the romanticism of gray and cowper these fresh inspired songs went straight to the heart like the music of returning birds in springtime it was a little volume but a great book and we think of marlowes line infinite riches in a little room in connection with it such poems as the cotters saturday night to a mouse to mountain daisy man was made to mourn the twa dogs address to the deil and halloween suggest that the whole spirit of the romantic revival is embodied in this obscure plowman love humor pathos the response to natureall the poetic qualities that touch the human heart are here and the heart was touched as it had not been since the days of elizabeth if the reader will note again the six characteristics of the romantic movement and then read six poems of burns he will see at once how perfectly this one man expresses the new idea or take a single suggestion      ae fond kiss and then we sever     ae farewell and then forever     deep in heartwrung tears ill pledge thee     warring sighs and groans ill wage thee     who shall say that fortune grieves him     while the star of hope she leaves him     me nae cheerfu twinkle lights me     dark despair around benights me     ill neer blame my partial fancy     naething could resist my nancy     but to see her was to love her     love but her and love forever     had we never lovd sae kindly     had we never lovd sae blindly     never metor never parted     we had neer been brokenhearted  the essence of a thousand love tales is in that one little song because he embodies the new spirit of romanticism critics give him a high place in the history of our literature and because his songs go straight to the heart he is the poet of common men  of burnss many songs for music little need be said they have found their way into the hearts of a whole people and there they speak for themselves they range from the exquisite o wert thou in the cauld blast to the tremendous appeal to scottish patriotism in scots wha hae wi wallace bled which carlyle said should be sung with the throat of the whirlwind many of these songs were composed in his best days when following the plow or resting after his work while the music of some old scotch song was ringing in his head it is largely because he thought of music while he composed that so many of his poems have the singing quality suggesting a melody as we read them  among his poems of nature to a mouse and to a mountain daisy are unquestionably the best suggesting the poetical possibilities that daily pass unnoticed under our feet these two poems are as near as burns ever comes to appreciating nature for its own sake the majority of his poems like winter and ye banks and braes o bonie doon regard nature in the same way that gray regarded it as a background for the play of human emotions  of his poems of emotion there is an immense number it is a curious fact that the world is always laughing and crying at the same moment and we can hardly read a page of burns without finding this natural juxtaposition of smiles and tears it is noteworthy also that all strong emotions when expressed naturally lend themselves to poetry and burns more than any other writer has an astonishing faculty of describing his own emotions with vividness and simplicity so that they appeal instantly to our own one cannot read i love my jean for instance without being in love with some idealized woman or to mary in heaven without sharing the personal grief of one who has loved and lost  besides the songs of nature and of human emotion burns has given us a large number of poems for which no general title can be given noteworthy among these are a mans a man for a that which voices the new romantic estimate of humanity the vision from which we get a strong impression of burnss early ideals the epistle to a young friend from which rather than from his satires we learn burnss personal views of religion and honor the address to the unco guid which is the poets plea for mercy in judgment and a bards epitaph which as a summary of his own life might well be written at the end of his poems halloween a picture of rustic merrymaking and the twa dogs a contrast between the rich and poor are generally classed among the poets best works but one unfamiliar with the scotch dialect will find them rather difficult  of burnss longer poems the two best worth reading are the cotters saturday night and tam o shanterthe one giving the most perfect picture we possess of a noble poverty the other being the most lively and the least objectionable of his humorous works it would be difficult to find elsewhere such a combination of the grewsome and the ridiculous as is packed up in tam o shanter with the exception of these two the longer poems add little to the authors fame or to our own enjoyment it is better for the beginner to read burnss exquisite songs and gladly to recognize his place in the hearts of a people and forget the rest since they only sadden us and obscure the poets better nature   william blake 17571827      piping down the valleys wild       piping songs of pleasant glee     on a cloud i saw a child       and he laughing said to me     pipe a song about a lamb       so i piped with merry cheer     piper pipe that song again       so i piped he wept to hear     piper sit thee down and write       in a book that all may read     so he vanished from my sight       and i plucked a hollow reed     and i made a rural pen       and i stained the water clear     and i wrote my happy songs       every child may joy to hear206  of all the romantic poets of the eighteenth century blake is the most independent and the most original in his earliest work written when he was scarcely more than a child he seems to go back to the elizabethan song writers for his models but for the greater part of his life he was the poet of inspiration alone following no mans lead and obeying no voice but that which he heard in his own mystic soul though the most extraordinary literary genius of his age he had practically no influence upon it indeed we hardly yet understand this poet of pure fancy this mystic this transcendental madman who remained to the end of his busy life an incomprehensible child  life blake the son of a london tradesman was a strange imaginative child whose soul was more at home with brooks and flowers and fairies than with the crowd of the city streets beyond learning to read and write he received education but he began at ten years to copy prints and to write verses he also began a long course of art study which resulted in his publishing his own books adorned with marginal engravings colored by handan unusual setting worthy of the strong artistic sense that shows itself in many of his early verses as a child he had visions of god and the angels looking in at his window and as a man he thought he received visits from the souls of the great dead moses virgil homer dante miltonmajestic shadows gray but luminous he calls them he seems never to have asked himself the question how far these visions were pure illusions but believed and trusted them implicitly to him all nature was a vast spiritual symbolism wherein he saw elves fairies devils angelsall looking at him in friendship or enmity through the eyes of flowers and stars      with the blue sky spread over with wings       and the mild sun that mounts and sings     with trees and fields full of fairy elves       and little devils who fight for themselves     with angels planted in hawthorne bowers       and god himself in the passing hours  and this curious pantheistic conception of nature was not a matter of creed but the very essence of blakes life strangely enough he made no attempt to found a new religious cult but followed his own way singing cheerfully working patiently in the face of discouragement and failure that writers of far less genius were exalted to favor while he remained poor and obscure does not seem to have troubled him in the least for over forty years he labored diligently at book engraving guided in his art by michael angelo but inventing his own curious designs at which we still wonder the illustrations for youngs night thoughts for blairs grave and the inventions to the book of job show the peculiarity of blakes mind quite as clearly as his poems while he worked at his trade he flung offfor he never seemed to composedisjointed visions and incomprehensible rhapsodies with an occasional little gem that still sets our hearts to singing      ah sunflower weary of time       who countest the steps of the sun     seeking after that sweet golden clime       where the travellers journey is done     where the youth pined away with desire       and the pale virgin shrouded in snow     rise from their graves and aspire       where my sunflower wishes to go  that is a curious flower to find growing in the london street but it suggests blakes own life which was outwardly busy and quiet but inwardly full of adventure and excitement his last huge prophetic works like jerusalem and milton 1804 were dictated to him he declares by supernatural means and even against his own will they are only half intelligible but here and there one sees flashes of the same poetic beauty that marks his little poems critics generally dismiss blake with the word madman but that is only an evasion at best he is the writer of exquisite lyrics at worst he is mad only northnorthwest like hamlet and the puzzle is to find the method in his madness the most amazing thing about him is the perfectly sane and cheerful way in which he moved through poverty and obscurity flinging out exquisite poems or senseless rhapsodies as a child might play with gems or straws or sunbeams indifferently he was a gentle kindly most unworldly little man with extraordinary eyes which seem even in the lifeless portraits to reflect some unusual hypnotic power he died obscurely smiling at a vision of paradise in 1827 that was nearly a century ago yet he still remains one of the most incomprehensible figures in our literature  works of blake the poetical sketches published in 1783 is a collection of blakes earliest poetry much of it written in boyhood it contains much crude and incoherent work but also a few lyrics of striking originality two later and better known volumes are songs of innocence and songs of experience reflecting two widely different views of the human soul as in all his works there is an abundance of apparently worthless stuff in these songs but in the language of miners it is all pay dirt it shows gleams of golden grains that await our sifting and now and then we find a nugget unexpectedly      my lord was like a flower upon the brows     of lusty may ah life as frail as flower     my lord was like a star in highest heaven     drawn down to earth by spells and wickedness     my lord was like the opening eye of day     but he is darkened like the summer moon     clouded falln like the stately tree cut down     the breath of heaven dwelt among his leaves  on account of the chaotic character of most of blakes work it is well to begin our reading with a short book of selections containing the best songs of these three little volumes swinburne calls blake the only poet of supreme and simple poetic genius of the eighteenth century the one man of that age fit on all accounts to rank with the old great masters207 the praise is doubtless extravagant and the criticism somewhat intemperate but when we have read the evening star memory night love to the muses spring summer the tiger the lamb the clod and the pebble we may possibly share swinburnes enthusiasm certainly in these three volumes we have some of the most perfect and the most original songs in our language  of blakes longer poems his titanic prophecies and apocalyptic splendors it is impossible to write justly in such a brief work as this outwardly they suggest a huge chaff pile and the scattered grains of wheat hardly warrant the labor of winnowing the curious reader will get an idea of blakes amazing mysticism by dipping into any of the works of his middle lifeurizen gates of paradise marriage of heaven and hell america the french revolution or the vision of the daughters of albion his latest works like jerusalem and milton are too obscure to have any literary value to read any of these works casually is to call the author a madman to study them remembering blakes songs and his genius is to quote softly his own answer to the child who asked about the land of dreams      o what land is the land of dreams     what are its mountains and what are its streams     o father i saw my mother there     among the lilies by waters fair     dear child i also by pleasant streams     have wandered all night in the land of dreams     but though calm and warm the waters wide     i could not get to the other side   minor poets of the revival  we have chosen the five preceding poets gray goldsmith cowper burns and blake as the most typical and the most interesting of the writers who proclaimed the dawn of romanticism in the eighteenth century with them we associate a group of minor writers whose works were immensely popular in their own day the ordinary reader will pass them by but to the student they are all significant as expressions of very different phases of the romantic revival  james thomson 17001748 thomson belongs among the pioneers of romanticism like gray and goldsmith he wavered between pseudoclassic and the new romantic ideals and for this reason if for no other his early work is interesting like the uncertainty of a child who hesitates whether to creep safely on all fours or risk a fall by walking he is worthy to be remembered for three poemsrule britannia which is still one of the national songs of england the castle of indolence and the seasons the dreamy and romantic castle 1748 occupied by enchanter indolence and his willing captives in the land of drowsyhed is purely spenserian in its imagery and is written in the spenserian stanza the seasons 1726 1730 written in blank verse describes the sights and sounds of the changing year and the poets own feelings in the presence of nature these two poems though rather dull to a modern reader were significant of the early romantic revival in three ways they abandoned the prevailing heroic couplet they went back to the elizabethans instead of to pope for their models and they called attention to the longneglected life of nature as a subject for poetry  william collins 17211759 collins the friend and disciple of thomson was of a delicate nervous temperament like cowper and over him also brooded the awful shadow of insanity his first work oriental eclogues 1742 is romantic in feeling but is written in the prevailing mechanical couplets all his later work is romantic in both thought and expression his ode on the popular superstitions of the highlands 1750 is an interesting event in the romantic revival for it introduced a new world of witches pygmies fairies and mediæval kings for the imagination to play in collinss best known poems are the odes to simplicity to fear to the passions the little unnamed lyric beginning how sleep the brave and the exquisite ode to evening in reading the latter one is scarcely aware that the lines are so delicately balanced that they have no need of rime to accentuate their melody  george crabbe 17541832 crabbe is an interesting combination of realism and romanticism his work of depicting common life being at times vaguely suggestive of fieldings novels the village 1783 a poem without a rival as a picture of the workingmen of his age is sometimes like fielding in its coarse vigor and again like dryden in its precise versification the poem was not successful at first and crabbe abandoned his literary dreams for over twenty years he settled down as a clergyman in a country parish observing keenly the common life about him then he published more poems exactly like the village which immediately brought him fame and money they brought him also the friendship of walter scott who like others regarded crabbe as one of the first poets of the age these later poems the parish register 1807 the borough 1810 tales in verse 1812 and tales of the hall 1819 are in the same strain they are written in couplets they are reflections of nature and of country life they contain much that is sordid and dull but are nevertheless real pictures of real men and women just as crabbe saw them and as such they are still interesting goldsmith and burns had idealized the poor and we admire them for their sympathy and insight it remained for crabbe to show that in wretched fishing villages in the lives of hardworking men and women children laborers smugglers paupersall sorts and conditions of common menthere is abundant romantic without exaggerating or idealizing their vices and virtues  james macpherson 17361796 in macpherson we have an unusual figure who catered to the new romantic interest in the old epic heroes and won immense though momentary fame by a series of literary forgeries macpherson was a scotch schoolmaster an educated man but evidently not overtender of conscience whose imagination had been stirred by certain old poems which he may have heard in gaelic among the highlanders in 1760 he published his fragments of ancient poetry collected in the highlands and alleged that his work was but a translation of gaelic manuscripts whether the work of itself would have attracted attention is doubtful but the fact that an abundance of literary material might be awaiting discovery led to an interest such as now attends the opening of an egyptian tomb and a subscription was promptly raised in edinburgh to send macpherson through the highlands to collect more manuscripts the result was the epic fingal 1762 that lank and lamentable counterfeit of poetry as swinburne calls it which the author professed to have translated from the gaelic of the poet ossian its success was astonishing and macpherson followed it up with temora 1763 another epic in the same strain in both these works macpherson succeeds in giving an air of primal grandeur to his heroes the characters are big and shadowy the imagery is at times magnificent the language is a kind of chanting bombastic prose  now fingal arose in his might and thrice he reared his voice cromla answered around and the sons of the desert stood still they bent their red faces to earth ashamed at the presence of fingal he came like a cloud of rain in the days of the sun when slow it rolls on the hill and fields expect the shower swaran beheld the terrible king of morven and stopped in the midst of his course dark he leaned on his spear rolling his red eyes around silent and tall he seemed as an oak on the banks of lubar which had its branches blasted of old by the lightning of heaven his thousands pour around the hero and the darkness of battle gathers on the hill208  the publication of this gloomy imaginative work produced a literary storm a few critics led by dr johnson demanded to see the original manuscripts and when macpherson refused to produce them209 the ossianic poems were branded as a forgery nevertheless they had enormous success macpherson was honored as a literary explorer he was given an official position carrying a salary for life and at his death in 1796 he was buried in westminster abbey blake burns and indeed most of the poets of the age were influenced by this sham poetry even the scholarly gray was deceived and delighted with ossian and men as far apart as goethe and napoleon praised it immoderately  thomas chatterton 17521770 this marvelous boy to whom keats dedicated his endymion and who is celebrated in shelleys adonais is one of the saddest and most interesting figures of the romantic revival during his childhood he haunted the old church of st mary redcliffe in bristol where he was fascinated by the mediæval air of the place and especially by one old chest known as canynges coffer containing musty documents which had been preserved for three hundred years with strange uncanny intentness the child pored over these relics of the past copying them instead of his writing book until he could imitate not only the spelling and language but even the handwriting of the original soon after the ossian forgeries appeared chatterton began to produce documents apparently very old containing mediæval poems legends and family histories centering around two charactersthomas rowley priest and poet and william canynge merchant of bristol in the days of henry vi it seems incredible that the whole design of these mediæval romances should have been worked out by a child of eleven and that he could reproduce the style and the writing of caxtons day so well that the printers were deceived but such is the fact more and more rowley papers as they were called were produced by chattertonapparently from the archives of the old church in reality from his own imaginationdelighting a large circle of readers and deceiving all but gray and a few scholars who recognized the occasional misuse of fifteenthcentury english words all this work was carefully finished and bore the unmistakable stamp of literary genius reading now his Ælla or the ballad of charite or the long poem in ballad style called bristowe tragedie it is hard to realize that it is a boys work at seventeen years of age chatterton went for a literary career to london where he soon afterwards took poison and killed himself in a fit of childish despondency brought on by poverty and hunger  thomas percy 17291811 to percy bishop of the irish church in dromore we are indebted for the first attempt at a systematic collection of the folk songs and ballads which are counted among the treasures of a nations literature210 in 1765 he published in three volumes his famous reliques of ancient english poetry the most valuable part of this work is the remarkable collection of old english and scottish ballads such as chevy chase the nut brown mayde children of the wood battle of otterburn and many more which but for his labor might easily have perished we have now much better and more reliable editions of these same ballads for percy garbled his materials adding and subtracting freely and even inventing a few ballads of his own two motives probably influenced him in this first the different versions of the same ballad varied greatly and percy in changing them to suit himself took the same liberty as had many other writers in dealing with the same material second percy was under the influence of johnson and his school and thought it necessary to add a few elegant ballads to atone for the rudeness of the more obsolete poems that sounds queer now used as we are to exactness in dealing with historical and literary material but it expresses the general spirit of the age in which he lived  notwithstanding these drawbacks percys reliques marks an epoch in the history of romanticism and it is difficult to measure its influence on the whole romantic movement scott says of it the first time i could scrape a few shillings together i bought myself a copy of these beloved volumes nor do i believe i ever read a book half so frequently or with half the enthusiasm scotts own poetry is strongly modeled upon these early ballads and his minstrelsy of the scottish border is due chiefly to the influence of percys work  besides the reliques percy has given us another good work in his northern antiquities 1770 translated from the french of mallets history of denmark this also was of immense influence since it introduced to english readers a new and fascinating mythology more rugged and primitive than that of the greeks and we are still in music as in letters under the spell of thor and odin of frea and the valkyr maidens and of that stupendous drama of passion and tragedy which ended in the twilight of the gods the literary world owes a debt of gratitude to percy who wrote nothing of importance himself but who by collecting and translating the works of other men did much to hasten the triumph of romanticism in the nineteenth century   iii the first english novelists  the chief literary phenomena of the complex eighteenth century are the reign of socalled classicism the revival of romantic poetry and the discovery of the modern novel of these three the last is probably the most important aside from the fact that the novel is the most modern and at present the most widely read and influential type of literature we have a certain pride in regarding it as englands original contribution to the world of letters other great types of literature like the epic the romance and the drama were first produced by other nations but the idea of the modern novel seems to have been worked out largely on english soil211 and in the number and the fine quality of her novelists england has hardly been rivaled by any other nation before we study the writers who developed this new type of literature it is well to consider briefly its meaning and history  meaning of the novel probably the most significant remark made by the ordinary reader concerning a work of fiction takes the form of a question is it a good story for the reader of today is much like the child and the primitive man in this respect that he must be attracted and held by the story element of a narrative before he learns to appreciate its style or moral significance the story element is therefore essential to the novel but where the story originates is impossible to say as well might we seek for the origin of the race for wherever primitive men are found there we see them gathering eagerly about the storyteller in the halls of our saxon ancestors the scop and the talebringer were ever the most welcome guests and in the bark wigwams of the american indians the man who told the legends of hiawatha had an audience quite as attentive as that which gathered at the greek festivals to hear the story of ulyssess wanderings to mans instinct or innate love for a story we are indebted for all our literature and the novel must in some degree satisfy this instinct or fail of appreciation  the second question which we ask concerning a work of fiction is how far does the element of imagination enter into it for upon the element of imagination depends largely our classification of works of fiction into novels romances and mere adventure stories the divisions here are as indefinite as the border land between childhood and youth between instinct and reason but there are certain principles to guide us we note in the development of any normal child that there comes a time when for his stories he desires knights giants elves fairies witches magic and marvelous adventures which have no basis in experience he tells extraordinary tales about himself which may be only the vague remembrances of a dream or the creations of a dawning imaginationboth of which are as real to him as any other part of life when we say that such a child romances we give exactly the right name to it for this sudden interest in extraordinary beings and events marks the development of the human imaginationrunning riot at first because it is not guided by reason which is a later developmentand to satisfy this new interest the romance212 was invented the romance is originally a work of fiction in which the imagination is given full play without being limited by facts or probabilities it deals with extraordinary events with heroes whose powers are exaggerated and often adds the element of superhuman or supernatural characters it is impossible to draw the line where romance ends but this element of excessive imagination and of impossible heroes and incidents is its distinguishing mark in every literature  where the novel begins it is likewise impossible to say but again we have a suggestion in the experience of every reader there comes a time naturally and inevitably in the life of every youth when the romance no longer enthralls him he lives in a world of facts gets acquainted with men and women some good some bad but all human and he demands that literature shall express life as he knows it by experience this is the stage of the awakened intellect and in our stories the intellect as well as the imagination must now be satisfied at the beginning of this stage we delight in robinson crusoe we read eagerly a multitude of adventure narratives and a few socalled historical novels but in each case we must be lured by a story must find heroes and moving accidents by flood and field to appeal to our imagination and though the hero and the adventure may be exaggerated they must both be natural and within the bounds of probability gradually the element of adventure or surprising incident grows less and less important as we learn that true life is not adventurous but a plain heroic matter of work and duty and the daily choice between good and evil life is the most real thing in the world nownot the life of kings or heroes or superhuman creatures but the individual life with its struggles and temptations and triumphs or failures like our own and any work that faithfully represents life becomes interesting so we drop the adventure story and turn to the novel for the novel is a work of fiction in which the imagination and the intellect combine to express life in the form of a story and the imagination is always directed and controlled by the intellect it is interested chiefly not in romance or adventure but in men and women as they are it aims to show the motives and influences which govern human life and the effects of personal choice upon character and destiny such is the true novel213 and as such it opens a wider and more interesting field than any other type of literature  precursors of the novel before the novel could reach its modern stage of a more or less sincere attempt to express human life and character it had to pass through several centuries of almost imperceptible development among the early precursors of the novel we must place a collection of tales known as the greek romances dating from the second to the sixth centuries these are imaginative and delightful stories of ideal love and marvelous adventure214 which profoundly affected romance writing for the next thousand years a second group of predecessors is found in the italian and spanish pastoral romances which were inspired by the eclogues of virgil these were extremely popular in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries and their influence is seen later in sidneys arcadia which is the best of this type in english  the third and most influential group of predecessors of the novel is made up of the romances of chivalry such as are found in malorys morte darthur it is noticeable in reading these beautiful old romances in different languages that each nation changes them somewhat so as to make them more expressive of national traits and ideals in a word the old romance tends inevitably towards realism especially in england where the excessive imagination is curbed and the heroes become more human in malory in the unknown author of sir gawain and the green knight and especially in chaucer we see the effect of the practical english mind in giving these old romances a more natural setting and in making the heroes suggest though faintly the men and women of their own day the canterbury tales with their story interest and their characters delightfully true to nature have in them the suggestion at least of a connected story whose chief aim is to reflect life as it is  in the elizabethan age the idea of the novel grows more definite in sidneys arcadia 1580 a romance of chivalry the pastoral setting at least is generally true to nature our credulity is not taxed as in the old romances by the continual appearance of magic or miracles and the characters though idealized till they become tiresome occasionally give the impression of being real men and women in bacons the new atlantis 1627 we have the story of the discovery by mariners of an unknown country inhabited by a superior race of men more civilized than ourselvesan idea which had been used by more in his utopia in 1516 these two books are neither romances nor novels in the strict sense but studies of social institutions they use the connected story as a means of teaching moral lessons and of bringing about needed reforms and this valuable suggestion has been adopted by many of our modern writers in the socalled problem novels and novels of purpose  nearer to the true novel is lodges romantic story of rosalynde which was used by shakespeare in as you like it this was modeled upon the italian novella or short story which became very popular in england during the elizabethan age in the same age we have introduced into england the spanish picaresque novel from picaro a knave or rascal which at first was a kind of burlesque on the mediæval romance and which took for its hero some low scoundrel or outcast instead of a knight and followed him through a long career of scandals and villainies one of the earliest types of this picaresque novel in english is nashs the unfortunate traveller or the life of jack wilton 1594 which is also a forerunner of the historical novel since its action takes place during that gorgeous interview between henry viii and the king of france on the field of the cloth of gold in all these short stories and picaresque novels the emphasis was laid not so much on life and character as on the adventures of the hero and the interest consisted largely in wondering what would happen next and how the plot would end the same method is employed in all trashy novels and it is especially the bane of many modern storywriters this excessive interest in adventures or incidents for their own sake and not for their effect on character is what distinguishes the modern adventure story from the true novel  in the puritan age we approach still nearer to the modern novel especially in the work of bunyan and as the puritan always laid emphasis on character stories appeared having a definite moral purpose bunyans the pilgrims progress 1678 differs from the faery queen and from all other mediæval allegories in this important respectthat the characters far from being bloodless abstractions are but thinly disguised men and women indeed many a modern man reading the story of the christianhas found in it the reflection of his own life and experience in the life and death of mr badman 1682 we have another and even more realistic study of a man as he was in bunyans day these two striking figures christian and mr badman belong among the great characters of english fiction bunyans good workhis keen insight his delineation of character and his emphasis upon the moral effects of individual actionwas carried on by addison and steele some thirty years later the character of sir roger de coverley is a real reflection of english country life in the eighteenth century and with steeles domestic sketches in the tatler the spectator and the guardian 17091713 we definitely cross the border land that lies outside of romance and enter the region of character study where the novel has its beginning  the discovery of the modern novel notwithstanding this long history of fiction to which we have called attention it is safe to say that until the publication of richardsons pamela in 1740 no true novel had appeared in any literature by a true novel we mean simply a work of fiction which relates the story of a plain human life under stress of emotion which depends for its interest not on incident or adventure but on its truth to nature a number of english novelistsgoldsmith richardson fielding smollett sterneall seem to have seized upon the idea of reflecting life as it is in the form of a story and to have developed it simultaneously the result was an extraordinary awakening of interest especially among people who had never before been greatly concerned with literature we are to remember that in previous periods the number of readers was comparatively small and that with the exception of a few writers like langland and bunyan authors wrote largely for the upper classes in the eighteenth century the spread of education and the appearance of newspapers and magazines led to an immense increase in the number of readers and at the same time the middleclass people assumed a foremost place in english life and history these new readers and this new powerful middle class had no classic tradition to hamper them they cared little for the opinions of dr johnson and the famous literary club and so far as they read fiction at all they apparently took little interest in the exaggerated romances of impossible heroes and the picaresque stories of intrigue and villainy which had interested the upper classes some new type of literature was demanded this new type must express the new ideal of the eighteenth century namely the value and the importance of the individual life so the novel was born expressing though in a different way exactly the same ideals of personality and of the dignity of common life which were later proclaimed in the american and in the french revolution and were welcomed with rejoicing by the poets of the romantic revival to tell men not about knights or kings or types of heroes but about themselves in the guise of plain men and women about their own thoughts and motives and struggles and the results of actions upon their own charactersthis was the purpose of our first novelists the eagerness with which their chapters were read in england and the rapidity with which their work was copied abroad show how powerfully the new discovery appealed to readers everywhere  before we consider the work of these writers who first developed the modern novel we must glance at the work of a pioneer daniel defoe whom we place among the early novelists for the simple reason that we do not know how else to classify him   daniel defoe 16611731  to defoe is often given the credit for the discovery of the modern novel but whether or not he deserves that honor is an open question even a casual reading of robinson crusoe 1719 which generally heads the list of modern fiction shows that this exciting tale is largely an adventure story rather than the study of human character which defoe probably intended it to be young people still read it as they might a dime novel skipping its moralizing passages and hurrying on to more adventures but they seldom appreciate the excellent mature reasons which banish the dime novel to a secret place in the haymow while crusoe hangs proudly on the christmas tree or holds an honored place on the family bookshelf defoes apparition of mrs veal memoirs of a cavalier and journal of the plague year are such mixtures of fact fiction and credulity that they defy classification while other socalled novels like captain singleton moll flanders and roxana are but little better than picaresque stories with a deal of unnatural moralizing and repentance added for puritanical effect in crusoe defoe brought the realistic adventure story to a very high stage of its development but his works hardly deserve to be classed as true novels which must subordinate incident to the faithful portrayal of human life and character  life defoe was the son of a london butcher named foe and kept his family name until he was forty years of age when he added the aristocratic prefix with which we have grown familiar the events of his busy seventy years of life in which he passed through all extremes from poverty to wealth from prosperous brickmaker to starveling journalist from newgate prison to immense popularity and royal favor are obscure enough in details but four facts stand out clearly which help the reader to understand the character of his work first defoe was a jackatalltrades as well as a writer his interest was largely with the working classes and notwithstanding many questionable practices he seems to have had some continued purpose of educating and uplifting the common people this partially accounts for the enormous popularity of his works and for the fact that they were criticised by literary men as being fit only for the kitchen second he was a radical nonconformist in religion and was intended by his father for the independent ministry the puritan zeal for reform possessed him and he tried to do by his pen what wesley was doing by his preaching without however having any great measure of the latters sincerity or singleness of purpose this zeal for reform marks all his numerous works and accounts for the moralizing to be found everywhere third defoe was a journalist and pamphleteer with a reporters eye for the picturesque and a newspaper mans instinct for making a good story he wrote an immense number of pamphlets poems and magazine articles conducted several papersone of the most popular the review being issued from prisonand the fact that they often blew hot and cold upon the same question was hardly noticed indeed so extraordinarily interesting and plausible were defoes articles that he generally managed to keep employed by the party in power whether whig or tory this long journalistic career lasting half a century accounts for his direct simple narrative style which holds us even now by its intense reality to defoes genius we are also indebted for two discoveries the interview and the leading editorial both of which are still in daily use in our best newspapers  the fourth fact to remember is that defoe knew prison life and thereby hangs a tale in 1702 defoe published a remarkable pamphlet called the shortest way with the dissenters supporting the claims of the free churches against the high fliers ie tories and anglicans in a vein of grim humor which recalls swifts modest proposal defoe advocated hanging all dissenting ministers and sending all members of the free churches into exile and so ferociously realistic was the satire that both dissenters and tories took the author literally defoe was tried found guilty of seditious libel and sentenced to be fined to stand three days in the pillory and to be imprisoned hardly had the sentence been pronounced when defoe wrote his hymn to the pillory      hail hieroglyphic state machine     contrived to punish fancy in  a set of doggerel verses ridiculing his prosecutors which defoe with a keen eye for advertising scattered all over london crowds flocked to cheer him in the pillory and seeing that defoe was making popularity out of persecution his enemies bundled him off to newgate prison he turned this experience also to account by publishing a popular newspaper and by getting acquainted with rogues pirates smugglers and miscellaneous outcasts each one with a good story to be used later after his release from prison in 1704 he turned his knowledge of criminals to further account and entered the government employ as a kind of spy or secret service agent his prison experience and the further knowledge of criminals gained in over twenty years as a spy accounts for his numerous stories of thieves and pirates jonathan wild and captain avery and also for his later novels which deal almost exclusively with villains and outcasts  when defoe was nearly sixty years of age he turned to fiction and wrote the great work by which he is remembered robinson crusoe was an instant success and the author became famous all over europe other stories followed rapidly and defoe earned money enough to retire to newington and live in comfort but not idly for his activity in producing fiction is rivaled only by that of walter scott thus in 1720 appeared captain singleton duncan campbell and memoirs of a cavalier in 1722 colonel jack moll flanders and the amazingly realistic journal of the plague year so the list grows with astonishing rapidity ending with the history of the devil in 1726  in the latter year defoes secret connection with the government became known and a great howl of indignation rose against him in the public print destroying in an hour the popularity which he had gained by a lifetime of intrigue and labor he fled from his home to london where he died obscurely in 1731 while hiding from real or imaginary enemies  works of defoe at the head of the list stands robinson crusoe 1719 1720 one of the few books in any literature which has held its popularity undiminished for nearly two centuries the story is based upon the experiences of alexander selkirk or selcraig who had been marooned in the island of juan fernandez off the coast of chile and who had lived there in solitude for five years on his return to england in 1709 selkirks experiences became known and steele published an account of them in the englishman without however attracting any wide attention that defoe used selkirks story is practically certain but with his usual duplicity he claimed to have written crusoe in 1708 a year before selkirks return however that may be the story itself is real enough to have come straight from a sailors logbook defoe as shown in his journal of the plague year and his memoirs of a cavalier had the art of describing things he had never seen with the accuracy of an eyewitness  the charm of the story is its intense reality in the succession of thoughts feelings incidents which every reader recognizes to be absolutely true to life at first glance it would seem that one man on a desert island could not possibly furnish the material for a long story but as we read we realize with amazement that every slightest thought and actionthe saving of the cargo of the shipwrecked vessel the preparation for defense against imaginary foes the intense agitation over the discovery of a footprint in the sandis a record of what the reader himself would do and feel if he were alone in such a place defoes long and varied experience now stood him in good stead in fact he was the only man of letters in his time who might have been thrown on a desert island without finding himself at a loss what to do215 and he puts himself so perfectly in his heros place that he repeats his blunders as well as his triumphs thus what reader ever followed defoes hero through weary feverish months of building a huge boat which was too big to be launched by one man without recalling some boy who spent many stormy days in shed or cellar building a boat or dog house and who when the thing was painted and finished found it a foot wider than the door and had to knock it to pieces this absolute naturalness characterizes the whole story it is a study of the human will alsoof patience fortitude and the indomitable saxon spirit overcoming all obstacles and it was this element which made rousseau recommend robinson crusoe as a better treatise on education than anything which aristotle or the moderns had ever written and this suggests the most significant thing about defoes masterpiece namely that the hero represents the whole of human society doing with his own hands all the things which by the division of labor and the demands of modern civilization are now done by many different workers he is therefore the type of the whole civilized race of men  in the remaining works of defoe more than two hundred in number there is an astonishing variety but all are marked by the same simple narrative style and the same intense realism the best known of these are the journal of the plague year in which the horrors of a frightful plague are minutely recorded the memoirs of a cavalier so realistic that chatham quoted it as history in parliament and several picaresque novels like captain singleton colonel jack moll flanders and roxana the last work is by some critics given a very high place in realistic fiction but like the other three and like defoes minor narratives of jack sheppard and cartouche it is a disagreeable study of vice ending with a forced and unnatural repentance   samuel richardson 16891761  to richardson belongs the credit of writing the first modern novel he was the son of a london joiner who for economys sake resided in some unknown town in derbyshire where samuel was born in 1689 the boy received very little education but he had a natural talent for writing letters and even as a boy we find him frequently employed by working girls to write their love letters for them this early experience together with his fondness for the society of his dearest ladies rather than of men gave him that intimate knowledge of the hearts of sentimental and uneducated women which is manifest in all his work moreover he was a keen observer of manners and his surprisingly accurate descriptions often compel us to listen even when he is most tedious at seventeen years of age he went to london and learned the printers trade which he followed to the end of his life when fifty years of age he had a small reputation as a writer of elegant epistles and this reputation led certain publishers to approach him with a proposal that he write a series of familiar letters which could be used as models by people unused to writing richardson gladly accepted the proposal and had the happy inspiration to make these letters tell the connected story of a girls life defoe had told an adventure story of human life on a desert island but richardson would tell the story of a girls inner life in the midst of english neighbors that sounds simple enough now but it marked an epoch in the history of literature like every other great and simple discovery it makes us wonder why some one had not thought of it before  richardsons novels the result of richardsons inspiration was pamela or virtue rewarded an endless series of letters216 telling of the trials tribulations and the final happy marriage of a too sweet young maiden published in four volumes extending over the years 1740 and 1741 its chief fame lies in the fact that it is our first novel in the modern sense aside from this important fact and viewed solely as a novel it is sentimental grandiloquent and wearisome its success at the time was enormous and richardson began another series of letters he could tell a story in no other way which occupied his leisure hours for the next six years the result was clarissa or the history of a young lady published in eight volumes in 17471748 this was another and somewhat better sentimental novel and it was received with immense enthusiasm of all richardsons heroines clarissa is the most human in her doubts and scruples of conscience and especially in her bitter grief and humiliation she is a real woman in marked contrast with the mechanical hero lovelace who simply illustrates the authors inability to portray a mans character the dramatic element in this novel is strong and is increased by means of the letters which enable the reader to keep close to the characters of the story and to see life from their different view points macaulay who was deeply impressed by clarissa is said to have made the remark that were the novel lost he could restore almost the whole of it from memory  richardson now turned from his middleclass heroines and in five or six years completed another series of letters in which he attempted to tell the story of a man and an aristocrat the result was sir charles grandison 1754 a novel in seven volumes whose hero was intended to be a model of aristocratic manners and virtues for the middleclass people who largely constituted the novelists readers for richardson who began in pamela with the purpose of teaching his hearers how to write ended with the deliberate purpose of teaching them how to live and in most of his work his chief object was in his own words to inculcate virtue and good deportment his novels therefore suffer as much from his purpose as from his own limitations notwithstanding his tedious moralizing and his other defects richardson in these three books gave something entirely new to the literary world and the world appreciated the gift this was the story of human life told from within and depending for its interest not on incident or adventure but on its truth to human nature reading his work is on the whole like examining the antiquated model of a sternwheel steamer it is interesting for its undeveloped possibilities rather than for its achievement   henry fielding 17071754  life judged by his ability alone fielding was the greatest of this new group of novel writers and one of the most artistic that our literature has produced he was born in east stour dorsetshire in 1707 in contrast with richardson he was well educated having spent several years at the famous eton school and taken a degree in letters at the university of leyden in 1728 moreover he had a deeper knowledge of life gained from his own varied and sometimes riotous experience for several years after returning from leyden he gained a precarious living by writing plays farces and buffoneries for the stage in 1735 he married an admirable woman of whom we have glimpses in two of his characters amelia and sophia western and lived extravagantly on her little fortune at east stour having used up all his money he returned to london and studied law gaining his living by occasional plays and by newspaper work for ten years or more little is definitely known of him save that he published his first novel joseph andrews in 1742 and that he was made justice of the peace for westminster in 1748 the remaining years of his life in which his best novels were written were not given to literature but rather to his duties as magistrate and especially to breaking up the gangs of thieves and cutthroats which infested the streets of london after nightfall he died in lisbon whither he had gone for his health in 1754 and lies buried there in the english cemetery the pathetic account of this last journey together with an inkling of the generosity and kindheartedness of the man notwithstanding the scandals and irregularities of his life are found in his last work the journal of a voyage to lisbon  fieldings work fieldings first novel joseph andrews 1742 was inspired by the success of pamela and began as a burlesque of the false sentimentality and the conventional virtues of richardsons heroine he took for his hero the alleged brother of pamela who was exposed to the same kind of temptations but who instead of being rewarded for his virtue was unceremoniously turned out of doors by his mistress there the burlesque ends the hero takes to the open road and fielding forgets all about pamela in telling the adventures of joseph and his companion parson adams unlike richardson who has no humor who minces words and moralizes and dotes on the sentimental woes of his heroines fielding is direct vigorous hilarious and coarse to the point of vulgarity he is full of animal spirits and he tells the story of a vagabond life not for the sake of moralizing like richardson or for emphasizing a forced repentance like defoe but simply because it interests him and his only concern is to laugh men out of their follies so his story though it abounds in unpleasant incidents generally leaves the reader with the strong impression of reality  fieldings later novels are jonathan wild the story of a rogue which suggests defoes narrative the history of tom jones a foundling 1749 his best work and amelia 1751 the story of a good wife in contrast with an unworthy husband his strength in all these works is in the vigorous but coarse figures like those of jan steens pictures which fill most of his pages his weakness is in lack of taste and in barrenness of imagination or invention which leads him to repeat his plots and incidents with slight variations in all his work sincerity is perhaps the most marked characteristic fielding likes virile men just as they are good and bad but detests shams of every sort his satire has none of swifts bitterness but is subtle as that of chaucer and goodnatured as that of steele he never moralizes though some of his powerfully drawn scenes suggest a deeper moral lesson than anything in defoe or richardson and he never judges even the worst of his characters without remembering his own frailty and tempering justice with mercy on the whole though much of his work is perhaps in bad taste and is too coarse for pleasant or profitable reading fielding must be regarded as an artist a very great artist in realistic fiction and the advanced student who reads him will probably concur in the judgment of a modern critic that by giving us genuine pictures of men and women of his own age without moralizing over their vices and virtues he became the real founder of the modern novel   smollett and sterne  tobias smollett 17211771 apparently tried to carry on fieldings work but he lacked fieldings genius as well as his humor and inherent kindness and so crowded his pages with the horrors and brutalities which are sometimes mistaken for realism smollett was a physician of eccentric manners and ferocious instincts who developed his unnatural peculiarities by going as a surgeon on a battleship where he seems to have picked up all the evils of the navy and of the medical profession to use later in his novels  his three best known works are roderick random 1748 a series of adventures related by the hero peregrine pickle 1751 in which he reflects with brutal directness the worst of his experiences at sea and humphrey clinker 1771 his last work recounting the mild adventures of a welsh family in a journey through england and scotland this last alone can be generally read without arousing the readers profound disgust without any particular ability he models his novels on don quixote and the result is simply a series of coarse adventures which are characteristic of the picaresque novel of his age were it not for the fact that he unconsciously imitates jonsons every man in his humour he would hardly be named among our writers of fiction but in seizing upon some grotesque habit or peculiarity and making a character out of itsuch as commodore trunnion in peregrine pickle matthew bramble in humphrey clinker and bowling in roderick randomhe laid the foundation for that exaggeration in portraying human eccentricities which finds a climax in dickenss caricatures  lawrence sterne 17131768 has been compared to a little bronze satyr of antiquity in whose hollow body exquisite odors were stored that is true so far as the satyr is concerned for a more weazened unlovely personality would be hard to find the only question in the comparison is in regard to the character of the odors and that is a matter of taste in his work he is the reverse of smollett the latter being given over to coarse vulgarities which are often mistaken for realism the former to whims and vagaries and sentimental tears which frequently only disguise a sneer at human grief and pity  the two books by which sterne is remembered are tristram shandy and a sentimental journey through france and italy these are termed novels for the simple reason that we know not what else to call them the former was begun in his own words with no real idea of how it was to turn out its nine volumes published at intervals from 1760 to 1767 proceeded in the most aimless way recording the experiences of the eccentric shandy family and the book was never finished its strength lies chiefly in its brilliant style the most remarkable of the age and in its odd characters like uncle toby and corporal trim which with all their eccentricities are so humanized by the authors genius that they belong among the great creations of our literature the sentimental journey is a curious combination of fiction sketches of travel miscellaneous essays on odd subjectsall marked by the same brilliancy of style and all stamped with sternes false attitude towards everything in life many of its best passages were either adapted or taken bodily from burton rabelais and a score of other writers so that in reading sterne one is never quite sure how much is his own work though the mark of his grotesque genius is on every page  the first novelists and their work with the publication of goldsmiths vicar of wakefield in 1766 the first series of english novels came to a suitable close of this work with its abundance of homely sentiment clustering about the family life as the most sacred of anglosaxon institutions we have already spoken217 if we except robinson crusoe as an adventure story the vicar of wakefield is the only novel of the period which can be freely recommended to all readers as giving an excellent idea of the new literary type which was perhaps more remarkable for its promise than for its achievement in the short space of twentyfive years there suddenly appeared and flourished a new form of literature which influenced all europe for nearly a century and which still furnishes the largest part of our literary enjoyment each successive novelist brought some new element to the work as when fielding supplied animal vigor and humor to richardsons analysis of a human heart and sterne added brilliancy and goldsmith emphasized purity and the honest domestic sentiments which are still the greatest ruling force among men so these early workers were like men engaged in carving a perfect cameo from the reverse side one works the profile another the eyes a third the mouth and the fine lines of character and not till the work is finished and the cameo turned do we see the complete human face and read its meaning such in a parable is the story of the english novel  summary of the eighteenth century the period we are studying is included between the english revolution of 1688 and the beginning of the french revolution of 1789 historically the period begins in a remarkable way by the adoption of the bill of rights in 1689 this famous bill was the third and final step in the establishment of constitutional government the first step being the great charter 1215 and the second the petition of right 1628 the modern form of cabinet government was established in the reign of george i 17141727 the foreign prestige of england was strengthened by the victories of marlborough on the continent in the war of the spanish succession and the bounds of empire were enormously increased by clive in india by cook in australia and the islands of the pacific and by english victories over the french in canada and the mississippi valley during the seven years or french and indian wars politically the country was divided into whigs and tories the former seeking greater liberty for the people the latter upholding the king against popular government the continued strife between these two political parties had a direct and generally a harmful influence on literature as many of the great writers were used by the whig or tory party to advance its own interests and to satirize its enemies notwithstanding this perpetual strife of parties the age is remarkable for the rapid social development which soon expressed itself in literature clubs and coffeehouses multiplied and the social life of these clubs resulted in better manners in a general feeling of toleration and especially in a kind of superficial elegance which shows itself in most of the prose and poetry of the period on the other hand the moral standard of the nation was very low bands of rowdies infested the city streets after nightfall bribery and corruption were the rule in politics and drunkenness was frightfully prevalent among all classes swifts degraded race of yahoos is a reflection of the degradation to be seen in multitudes of london saloons this low standard of morals emphasizes the importance of the great methodist revival under whitefield and wesley which began in the second quarter of the eighteenth century  the literature of the century is remarkably complex but we may classify it all under three general headsthe reign of socalled classicism the revival of romantic poetry and the beginning of the modern novel the first half of the century especially is an age of prose owing largely to the fact that the practical and social interests of the age demanded expression modern newspapers like the chronicle post and times and literary magazines like the tatler and spectator which began in this age greatly influenced the development of a serviceable prose style the poetry of the first half of the century as typified in pope was polished unimaginative formal and the closed couplet was in general use supplanting all other forms of verse both prose and poetry were too frequently satiric and satire does not tend to produce a high type of literature these tendencies in poetry were modified in the latter part of the century by the revival of romantic poetry  in our study we have noted 1 the augustan or classic age the meaning of classicism the life and work of alexander pope the greatest poet of the age of jonathan swift the satirist of joseph addison the essayist of richard steele who was the original genius of the tatler and the spectator of samuel johnson who for nearly half a century was the dictator of english letters of james boswell who gave us the immortal life of johnson of edmund burke the greatest of english orators and of edward gibbon the historian famous for his decline and fall of the roman empire  2 the revival of romantic poetry the meaning of romanticism the life and work of thomas gray of oliver goldsmith famous as poet dramatist and novelist of william cowper of robert burns the greatest of scottish poets of william blake the mystic and the minor poets of the early romantic movementjames thomson william collins george crabbe james macpherson author of the ossian poems thomas chatterton the boy who originated the rowley papers and thomas percy whose work for literature was to collect the old ballads which he called the reliques of ancient english poetry and to translate the stories of norse mythology in his northern antiquities  3 the first english novelists the meaning and history of the modern novel the life and work of daniel defoe author of robinson

literature  the first half of the nineteenth century records the triumph of romanticism in literature and of democracy in government and the two movements are so closely associated in so many nations and in so many periods of history that one must wonder if there be not some relation of cause and effect between them just as we understand the tremendous energizing influence of puritanism in the matter of english liberty by remembering that the common people had begun to read and that their book was the bible so we may understand this age of popular government by remembering that the chief subject of romantic literature was the essential nobleness of common men and the value of the individual as we read now that brief portion of history which lies between the declaration of independence 1776 and the english reform bill of 1832 we are in the presence of such mighty political upheavals that the age of revolution is the only name by which we can adequately characterize it its great historic movements become intelligible only when we read what was written in this period for the french revolution and the american commonwealth as well as the establishment of a true democracy in england by the reform bill were the inevitable results of ideas which literature had spread rapidly through the civilized world liberty is fundamentally an ideal and that idealbeautiful inspiring compelling as a loved banner in the windwas kept steadily before mens minds by a multitude of books and pamphlets as far apart as burnss poems and thomas paines rights of manall read eagerly by the common people all proclaiming the dignity of common life and all uttering the same passionate cry against every form of class or caste oppression  first the dream the ideal in some human soul then the written word which proclaims it and impresses other minds with its truth and beauty then the united and determined effort of men to make the dream a realitythat seems to be a fair estimate of the part that literature plays even in our political progress  historical summary the period we are considering begins in the latter half of the reign of george iii and ends with the accession of victoria in 1837 when on a foggy morning in november 1783 king george entered the house of lords and in a trembling voice recognized the independence of the united states of america he unconsciously proclaimed the triumph of that free government by free men which had been the ideal of english literature for more than a thousand years though it was not till 1832 when the reform bill became the law of the land that england herself learned the lesson taught her by america and became the democracy of which her writers had always dreamed  the half century between these two events is one of great turmoil yet of steady advance in every department of english life the storm center of the political unrest was the french revolution that frightful uprising which proclaimed the natural rights of man and the abolition of class distinctions its effect on the whole civilized world is beyond computation patriotic clubs and societies multiplied in england all asserting the doctrine of liberty equality fraternity the watchwords of the revolution young england led by pitt the younger hailed the new french republic and offered it friendship old england which pardons no revolutions but her own looked with horror on the turmoil in france and misled by burke and the nobles of the realm forced the two nations into war even pitt saw a blessing in this at first because the sudden zeal for fighting a foreign nationwhich by some horrible perversion is generally called patriotismmight turn mens thoughts from their own to their neighbors affairs and so prevent a threatened revolution at home  the causes of this threatened revolution were not political but economic by her invention in steel and machinery and by her monopoly of the carrying trade england had become the workshop of the world her wealth had increased beyond her wildest dreams but the unequal distribution of that wealth was a spectacle to make angels weep the invention of machinery at first threw thousands of skilled hand workers out of employment in order to protect a few agriculturists heavy duties were imposed on corn and wheat and bread rose to famine prices just when laboring men had the least money to pay for it there followed a curious spectacle while england increased in wealth and spent vast sums to support her army and subsidize her allies in europe and while nobles landowners manufacturers and merchants lived in increasing luxury a multitude of skilled laborers were clamoring for work fathers sent their wives and little children into the mines and factories where sixteen hours labor would hardly pay for the daily bread and in every large city were riotous mobs made up chiefly of hungry men and women it was this unbearable economic condition and not any political theory as burke supposed which occasioned the danger of another english revolution  it is only when we remember these conditions that we can understand two books adam smiths wealth of nations and thomas paines rights of man which can hardly be considered as literature but which exercised an enormous influence in england smith was a scottish thinker who wrote to uphold the doctrine that labor is the only source of a nations wealth and that any attempt to force labor into unnatural channels or to prevent it by protective duties from freely obtaining the raw materials for its industry is unjust and destructive paine was a curious combination of jekyll and hyde shallow and untrustworthy personally but with a passionate devotion to popular liberty his rights of man published in london in 1791 was like one of burnss lyric outcries against institutions which oppressed humanity coming so soon after the destruction of the bastille it added fuel to the flames kindled in england by the french revolution the author was driven out of the country on the curious ground that he endangered the english constitution but not until his book had gained a wide sale and influence  all these dangers real and imaginary passed away when england turned from the affairs of france to remedy her own economic conditions the long continental war came to an end with napoleons overthrow at waterloo in 1815 and england having gained enormously in prestige abroad now turned to the work of reform at home the destruction of the african slave trade the mitigation of horribly unjust laws which included poor debtors and petty criminals in the same class the prevention of child labor the freedom of the press the extension of manhood suffrage the abolition of restrictions against catholics in parliament the establishment of hundreds of popular schools under the leadership of andrew bell and joseph lancasterthese are but a few of the reforms which mark the progress of civilization in a single half century when england in 1833 proclaimed the emancipation of all slaves in all her colonies she unconsciously proclaimed her final emancipation from barbarism  literary characteristics of the age it is intensely interesting to note how literature at first reflected the political turmoil of the age and then when the turmoil was over and england began her mighty work of reform how literature suddenly developed a new creative spirit which shows itself in the poetry of wordsworth coleridge byron shelley keats and in the prose of scott jane austen lamb and de quinceya wonderful group of writers whose patriotic enthusiasm suggests the elizabethan days and whose genius has caused their age to be known as the second creative period of our literature thus in the early days when old institutions seemed crumbling with the bastille coleridge and southey formed their youthful scheme of a pantisocracy on the banks of the susquehannaan ideal commonwealth in which the principles of mores utopia should be put in practice even wordsworth fired with political enthusiasm could write      bliss was it in that dawn to be alive     but to be young was very heaven  the essence of romanticism was it must be remembered that literature must reflect all that is spontaneous and unaffected in nature and in man and be free to follow its own fancy in its own way we have already noted this characteristic in the work of the elizabethan dramatists who followed their own genius in opposition to all the laws of the critics in coleridge we see this independence expressed in kubla khan and the ancient mariner two dream pictures one of the populous orient the other of the lonely sea in wordsworth this literary independence led him inward to the heart of common things following his own instinct as shakespeare does he too      finds tongues in trees books in the running brooks     sermons in stones and good in everything  and so more than any other writer of the age he invests the common life of nature and the souls of common men and women with glorious significance these two poets coleridge and wordsworth best represent the romantic genius of the age in which they lived though scott had a greater literary reputation and byron and shelley had larger audiences  the second characteristic of this age is that it is emphatically an age of poetry the previous century with its practical outlook on life was largely one of prose but now as in the elizabethan age the young enthusiasts turned as naturally to poetry as a happy man to singing the glory of the age is in the poetry of scott wordsworth coleridge byron shelley keats moore and southey of its prose works those of scott alone have attained a very wide reading though the essays of charles lamb and the novels of jane austen have slowly won for their authors a secure place in the history of our literature coleridge and southey who with wordsworth form the trio of socalled lake poets wrote far more prose than poetry and southeys prose is much better than his verse it was characteristic of the spirit of this age so different from our own that southey could say that in order to earn money he wrote in verse what would otherwise have been better written in prose  it was during this period that woman assumed for the first time an important place in our literature probably the chief reason for this interesting phenomenon lies in the fact that woman was for the first time given some slight chance of education of entering into the intellectual life of the race and as is always the case when woman is given anything like a fair opportunity she responded magnificently a secondary reason may be found in the nature of the age itself which was intensely emotional the french revolution stirred all europe to its depths and during the following half century every great movement in literature as in politics and religion was characterized by strong emotion which is all the more noticeable by contrast with the cold formal satiric spirit of the early eighteenth century as woman is naturally more emotional than man it may well be that the spirit of this emotional age attracted her and gave her the opportunity to express herself in literature  as all strong emotions tend to extremes the age produced a new type of novel which seems rather hysterical now but which in its own day delighted multitudes of readers whose nerves were somewhat excited and who reveled in bogey stories of supernatural terror mrs anne radcliffe 17641823 was one of the most successful writers of this school of exaggerated romance her novels with their azureeyed heroines haunted castles trapdoors bandits abductions rescues in the nick of time and a general medley of overwrought joys and horrors219 were immensely popular not only with the crowd of novel readers but also with men of unquestioned literary genius like scott and byron  in marked contrast to these extravagant stories is the enduring work of jane austen with her charming descriptions of everyday life and of maria edgeworth whose wonderful pictures of irish life suggested to walter scott the idea of writing his scottish romances two other women who attained a more or less lasting fame were hannah more poet dramatist and novelist and jane porter whose scottish chiefs and thaddeus of warsaw are still in demand in our libraries beside these were fanny burney madame darblay and several other writers whose works in the early part of the nineteenth century raised woman to the high place in literature which she has ever since maintained  in this age literary criticism became firmly established by the appearance of such magazines as the edinburgh review 18o2 the quarterly review 1808 blackwoods magazine 1817 the westminster review 1824 the spectator 1828 the athenæum 1828 and frasers magazine 1830 these magazines edited by such men as francis jeffrey john wilson who is known to us as christopher north and john gibson lockhart who gave us the life of scott exercised an immense influence on all subsequent literature at first their criticisms were largely destructive as when jeffrey hammered scott wordsworth and byron most unmercifully and lockhart could find no good in either keats or tennyson but with added wisdom criticism assumed its true function of construction and when these magazines began to seek and to publish the works of unknown writers like hazlitt lamb and leigh hunt they discovered the chief mission of the modern magazine which is to give every writer of ability the opportunity to make his work known to the world   i the poets of romanticism  william wordsworth 17701850  it was in 1797 that the new romantic movement in our literature assumed definite form wordsworth and coleridge retired to the quantock hills somerset and there formed the deliberate purpose to make literature adapted to interest mankind permanently which they declared classic poetry could never do helping the two poets was wordsworths sister dorothy with a womans love for flowers and all beautiful things and a womans divine sympathy for human life even in its lowliest forms though a silent partner she furnished perhaps the largest share of the inspiration which resulted in the famous lyrical ballads of 1798 in their partnership coleridge was to take up the supernatural or at least romantic while wordsworth was to give the charm of novelty to things of everyday  by awakening the minds attention from the lethargy of custom and directing it to the loveliness and the wonders of the world before us the whole spirit of their work is reflected in two poems of this remarkable little volume the rime of the ancient mariner which is coleridges masterpiece and lines written a few miles above tintern abbey which expresses wordsworths poetical creed and which is one of the noblest and most significant of our poems that the lyrical ballads attracted no attention220 and was practically ignored by a public that would soon go into raptures over byrons childe harold and don juan is of small consequence many men will hurry a mile to see skyrockets who never notice orion and the pleiades from their own doorstep had wordsworth and coleridge written only this one little book they would still be among the representative writers of an age that proclaimed the final triumph of romanticism  life of wordsworth to understand the life of him who in tennysons words uttered nothing base it is well to read first the prelude which records the impressions made upon wordsworths mind from his earliest recollection until his full manhood in 1805 when the poem was completed221 outwardly his long and uneventful life divides itself naturally into four periods 1 his childhood and youth in the cumberland hills from 1770 to 1787 2 a period of uncertainty of storm and stress including his university life at cambridge his travels abroad and his revolutionary experience from 1787 to 1797 3 a short but significant period of finding himself and his work from 1797 to 1799 4 a long period of retirement in the northern lake region where he was born and where for a full half century he lived so close to nature that her influence is reflected in all his poetry when one has outlined these four periods he has told almost all that can be told of a life which is marked not by events but largely by spiritual experiences  wordsworth was born in 1770 at cockermouth cumberland where the derwent            fairest of all rivers loved     to blend his murmurs with my nurses song     and from his alder shades and rocky falls     and from his fords and shallows sent a voice     that flowed along my dreams  it is almost a shock to one who knows wordsworth only by his calm and noble poetry to read that he was of a moody and violent temper and that his mother despaired of him alone among her five children she died when he was but eight years old but not till she had exerted an influence which lasted all his life so that he could remember her as the heart of all our learnings and our loves the father died some six years later and the orphan was taken in charge by relatives who sent him to school at hawkshead in the beautiful lake region here apparently the unroofed school of nature attracted him more than the discipline of the classics and he learned more eagerly from the flowers and hills and stars than from his books but one must read wordsworths own record in the prelude to appreciate this three things in this poem must impress even the casual reader first wordsworth loves to be alone and is never lonely with nature second like every other child who spends much time alone in the woods and fields he feels the presence of some living spirit real though unseen and companionable though silent third his impressions are exactly like our own and delightfully familiar when he tells of the long summer day spent in swimming basking in the sun and questing over the hills or of the winter night when on his skates he chased the reflection of a star in the black ice or of his exploring the lake in a boat and getting suddenly frightened when the world grew big and strangein all this he is simply recalling a multitude of our own vague happy memories of childhood he goes out into the woods at night to tend his woodcock snares he runs across another boys snares follows them finds a woodcock caught takes it hurries away through the night and then      i heard among the solitary hills     low breathings coming after me and sounds     of undistinguishable motion  that is like a mental photograph any boy who has come home through the woods at night will recognize it instantly again he tells as of going birdsnesting on the cliffs              oh when i have hung     above the ravens nest by knots of grass     and halfinch fissures in the slippery rock     but illsustained and almost so it seemed     suspended by the blast that blew amain     shouldering the naked cragoh at that time     while on the perilous ridge i hung alone     with what strange utterance did the loud dry wind     blow through my ear the sky seemed not a sky     of earthand with what motion moved the clouds  no man can read such records without finding his own boyhood again and his own abounding joy of life in the poets early impressions  the second period of wordsworths life begins with his university course at cambridge in 1787 in the third book of the prelude we find a dispassionate account of student life with its trivial occupations its pleasures and general aimlessness wordsworth proved to be a very ordinary scholar following his own genius rather than the curriculum and looking forward more eagerly to his vacation among the hills than to his examinations perhaps the most interesting thing in his life at cambridge was his fellowship with the young political enthusiasts whose spirit is expressed in his remarkable poem on the french revolutiona poem which is better than a volume of history to show the hopes and ambitions that stirred all europe in the first days of that mighty upheaval wordsworth made two trips to france in 1790 and 1791 seeing things chiefly through the rosy spectacles of the young oxford republicans on his second visit he joined the girondists or the moderate republicans and only the decision of his relatives who cut off his allowance and hurried him back to england prevented his going headlong to the guillotine with the leaders of his party two things rapidly cooled wordsworths revolutionary enthusiasm and ended the only dramatic interest of his placid life one was the excesses of the revolution itself and especially the execution of louis xvi the other was the rise of napoleon and the slavish adulation accorded by france to this most vulgar and dangerous of tyrants his coolness soon grew to disgust and opposition as shown by his subsequent poems and this brought upon him the censure of shelley byron and other extremists though it gained the friendship of scott who from the first had no sympathy with the revolution or with the young english enthusiasts  of the decisive period of wordsworths life when he was living with his sister dorothy and with coleridge at alfoxden we have already spoken the importance of this decision to give himself to poetry is evident when we remember that at thirty years of age he was without money or any definite aim or occupation in life he considered the law but confessed he had no sympathy for its contradictory precepts and practices he considered the ministry but though strongly inclined to the church he felt himself not good enough for the sacred office once he had wanted to be a soldier and serve his country but had wavered at the prospect of dying of disease in a foreign land and throwing away his life without glory or profit to anybody an apparent accident which looks more to us like a special providence determined his course he had taken care of a young friend raisley calvert who died of consumption and left wordsworth heir to a few hundred pounds and to the request that he should give his life to poetry it was this unexpected gift which enabled wordsworth to retire from the world and follow his genius all his life he was poor and lived in an atmosphere of plain living and high thinking his poetry brought him almost nothing in the way of money rewards and it was only by a series of happy accidents that he was enabled to continue his work one of these accidents was that he became a tory and soon accepted the office of a distributor of stamps and was later appointed poet laureate by the governmentwhich occasioned brownings famous but illconsidered poem of the lost leader      just for a handful of silver he left us     just for a riband to stick in his coat  the last half century of wordsworths life in which he retired to his beloved lake district and lived successively at grasmere and rydal mount remind one strongly of brownings long struggle for literary recognition it was marked by the same steadfast purpose the same trusted ideal the same continuous work and the same tardy recognition by the public his poetry was mercilessly ridiculed by nearly all the magazine critics who seized upon the worst of his work as a standard of judgment and book after book of poems appeared without meeting any success save the approval of a few loyal friends without doubt or impatience he continued his work trusting to the future to recognize and approve it his attitude here reminds one strongly of the poor old soldier whom he met in the hills222 who refused to beg or to mention his long service or the neglect of his country saying with noble simplicity        my trust is in the god of heaven     and in the eye of him who passes me  such work and patience are certain of their reward and long before wordsworths death he felt the warm sunshine of general approval the wave of popular enthusiasm for scott and byron passed by as their limitations were recognized and wordsworth was hailed by critics as the first living poet and one of the greatest that england had ever produced on the death of southey 1843 he was made poet laureate against his own inclination the late excessive praise left him quite as unmoved as the first excessive neglect the steady decline in the quality of his work is due not as might be expected to selfsatisfaction at success but rather to his intense conservatism to his living too much alone and failing to test his work by the standards and judgment of other literary men he died tranquilly in 1850 at the age of eighty years and was buried in the churchyard at grasmere  such is the brief outward record of the worlds greatest interpreter of natures message and only one who is acquainted with both nature and the poet can realize how inadequate is any biography for the best thing about wordsworth must always remain unsaid it is a comfort to know that his life noble sincere heroically happy never contradicted his message poetry was his life his soul was in all his work and only by reading what he has written can we understand the man  the poetry of wordsworth there is often a sense of disappointment when one reads wordsworth for the first time and this leads us to speak first of two difficulties which may easily prevent a just appreciation of the poets worth the first difficulty is in the reader who is often puzzled by wordsworths absolute simplicity we are so used to stage effects in poetry that beauty unadorned is apt to escape our noticelike wordsworths lucy      a violet by a mossy stone       half hidden from the eye     fair as a star when only one       is shining in the sky  wordsworth set himself to the task of freeing poetry from all its conceits of speaking the language of simple truth and of portraying man and nature as they are and in this good work we are apt to miss the beauty the passion the intensity that hide themselves under his simplest lines the second difficulty is in the poet not in the reader it must be confessed that wordsworth is not always melodious that he is seldom graceful and only occasionally inspired when he is inspired few poets can be compared with him at other times the bulk of his verse is so wooden and prosy that we wonder how a poet could have written it moreover he is absolutely without humor and so he often fails to see the small step that separates the sublime from the ridiculous in no other way can we explain the idiot boy or pardon the serious absurdity of peter bell and his grieving jackass  on account of these difficulties it is well to avoid at first the longer works and begin with a good book of selections223 when we read these exquisite shorter poems with their noble lines that live forever in our memory we realize that wordsworth is the greatest poet of nature that our literature has produced if we go further and study the poems that impress us we shall find four remarkable characteristics 1 wordsworth is sensitive as a barometer to every subtle change in the world about him in the prelude he compares himself to an æolian harp which answers with harmony to every touch of the wind and the figure is strikingly accurate as well as interesting for there is hardly a sight or a sound from a violet to a mountain and from a bird note to the thunder of the cataract that is not reflected in some beautiful way in wordsworths poetry  2 of all the poets who have written of nature there is none that compares with him in the truthfulness of his representation burns like gray is apt to read his own emotions into natural objects so that there is more of the poet than of nature even in his mouse and mountain daisy but wordsworth gives you the bird and the flower the wind and the tree and the river just as they are and is content to let them speak their own message  3 no other poet ever found such abundant beauty in the common world he had not only sight but insight that is he not only sees clearly and describes accurately but penetrates to the heart of things and always finds some exquisite meaning that is not written on the surface it is idle to specify or to quote lines on flowers or stars on snow or vapor nothing is ugly or commonplace in his world on the contrary there is hardly one natural phenomenon which he has not glorified by pointing out some beauty that was hidden from our eyes  4 it is the life of nature which is everywhere recognized not mere growth and cell changes but sentient personal life and the recognition of this personality in nature characterizes all the worlds great poetry in his childhood wordsworth regarded natural objects the streams the hills the flowers even the winds as his companions and with his mature belief that all nature is the reflection of the living god it was inevitable that his poetry should thrill with the sense of a spirit that rolls through all things cowper burns keats tennysonall these poets give you the outward aspects of nature in varying degrees but wordsworth gives you her very life and the impression of some personal living spirit that meets and accompanies the man who goes alone through the woods and fields we shall hardly find even in the philosophy of leibnitz or in the nature myths of our indians any such impression of living nature as this poet awakens in us and that suggests another delightful characteristic of wordsworths poetry namely that he seems to awaken rather than create an impression he stirs our memory deeply so that in reading him we live once more in the vague beautiful wonderland of our own childhood  such is the philosophy of wordsworths nature poetry if we search now for his philosophy of human life we shall find four more doctrines which rest upon his basal conception that man is not apart from nature but is the very life of her life 1 in childhood man is sensitive as a wind harp to all natural influences he is an epitome of the gladness and beauty of the world wordsworth explains this gladness and this sensitiveness to nature by the doctrine that the child comes straight from the creator of nature      our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting     the soul that rises with us our lifes star       hath had elsewhere its setting         and cometh from afar       not in entire forgetfulness       and not in utter nakedness     but trailing clouds of glory do we come       from god who is our home  in this exquisite ode which he calls intimations of immortality from recollections of early childhood 1807 wordsworth sums up his philosophy of childhood and he may possibly be indebted here to the poet vaughan who more than a century before had proclaimed in the retreat the same doctrine this kinship with nature and with god which glorifies childhood ought to extend through a mans whole life and ennoble it this is the teaching of tintern abbey in which the best part of our life is shown to be the result of natural influences according to wordsworth society and the crowded unnatural life of cities tend to weaken and pervert humanity and a return to natural and simple living is the only remedy for human wretchedness  2 the natural instincts and pleasures of childhood are the true standards of a mans happiness in this life all artificial pleasures soon grow tiresome the natural pleasures which a man so easily neglects in his work are the chief means by which we may expect permanent and increasing joy in tintern abbey the rainbow ode to duty and intimations of immortality we see this plain teaching but we can hardly read one of wordsworths pages without finding it slipped in unobtrusively like the fragrance of a wild flower  3 the truth of humanity that is the common life which labors and loves and shares the general heritage of smiles and tears is the only subject of permanent literary interest burns and the early poets of the revival began the good work of showing the romantic interest of common life and wordsworth continued it in michael the solitary reaper to a highland girl stepping westward the excursion and a score of lesser poems joy and sorrow not of princes or heroes but in widest commonalty spread are his themes and the hidden purpose of many of his poems is to show that the keynote of all life is happinessnot an occasional thing the result of chance or circumstance but a heroic thing to be won as one would win any other success by work and patience  4 to this natural philosophy of man wordsworth adds a mystic element the result of his own belief that in every natural object there is a reflection of the living god nature is everywhere transfused and illumined by spirit man also is a reflection of the divine spirit and we shall never understand the emotions roused by a flower or a sunset until we learn that nature appeals through the eye of man to his inner spirit in a word nature must be spiritually discerned in tintern abbey the spiritual appeal of nature is expressed in almost every line but the mystic conception of man is seen more clearly in intimations of immortality which emerson calls the highwater mark of poetry in the nineteenth century in this last splendid ode wordsworth adds to his spiritual interpretation of nature and man the alluring doctrine of preëxistence which has appealed so powerfully to hindoo and greek in turn and which makes of human life a continuous immortal thing without end or beginning  wordsworths longer poems since they contain much that is prosy and uninteresting may well be left till after we have read the odes sonnets and short descriptive poems that have made him famous as showing a certain heroic cast of wordsworths mind it is interesting to learn that the greater part of his work including the prelude and the excursion was intended for a place in a single great poem to be called the recluse which should treat of nature man and society the prelude treating of the growth of a poets mind was to introduce the work the home at grasmere which is the first book of the recluse was not published till 1888 long after the poets death the excursion 1814 is the second book of the recluse and the third was never completed though wordsworth intended to include most of his shorter poems in this third part and so make an immense personal epic of a poets life and work it is perhaps just as well that the work remained unfinished the best of his work appeared in the lyrical ballads 1798 and in the sonnets odes and lyrics of the next ten years though the duddon sonnets 1820 to a skylark 1825 and yarrow revisited 1831 show that he retained till past sixty much of his youthful enthusiasm in his later years however he perhaps wrote too much his poetry like his prose becomes dull and unimaginative and we miss the flashes of insight the tender memories of childhood and the recurrence of noble lineseach one a poemthat constitutes the surprise and the delight of reading wordsworth      the outward shows of sky and earth       of hill and valley he has viewed     and impulses of deeper birth       have come to him in solitude     in common things that round us lie       some random truths he can impart     the harvest of a quiet eye       that broods and sleeps on his own heart   samuel taylor coleridge 17721834      a grief without a pang void dark and drear       a stifled drowsy unimpassioned grief     which finds no natural outlet no relief       in word or sigh or tear  in the wonderful ode to dejection from which the above fragment is taken we have a single strong impression of coleridges whole lifea sad broken tragic life in marked contrast with the peaceful existence of his friend wordsworth for himself during the greater part of his life the poet had only grief and remorse as his portion but for everybody else for the audiences that were charmed by the brilliancy of his literary lectures for the friends who gathered about him to be inspired by his ideals and conversation and for all his readers who found unending delight in the little volume which holds his poetry he had and still has a cheering message full of beauty and hope and inspiration such is coleridge a man of grief who makes the world glad  life in 1772 there lived in ottery st mary devonshire a queer little man the rev john coleridge vicar of the parish church and master of the local grammar school in the former capacity he preached profound sermons quoting to openmouthed rustics long passages from the hebrew which he told them was the very tongue of the holy ghost in the latter capacity he wrote for his boys a new latin grammar to mitigate some of the difficulties of traversing that terrible jungle by means of ingenious bypaths and short cuts for instance when his boys found the ablative a somewhat difficult case to understand he told them to think of it as the qualequarequidditive case which of course makes its meaning perfectly clear in both these capacities the elder coleridge was a sincere man gentle and kindly whose memory was like a religion to his sons and daughters in that same year was born samuel taylor coleridge the youngest of thirteen children he was an extraordinarily precocious child who could read at three years of age and who before he was five had read the bible and the arabian nights and could remember an astonishing amount from both books from three to six he attended a dame school and from six till nine when his father died and left the family destitute he was in his fathers school learning the classics reading an enormous quantity of english books avoiding novels and delighting in cumbrous theological and metaphysical treatises at ten he was sent to the charity school of christs hospital london where he met charles lamb who records his impression of the place and of coleridge in one of his famous essays224 coleridge seems to have remained in this school for seven or eight years without visiting his homea poor neglected boy whose comforts and entertainments were all within himself just as when a little child he used to wander over the fields with a stick in his hand slashing the tops from weeds and thistles and thinking himself to be the mighty champion of christendom against the infidels so now he would lie on the roof of the school forgetting the play of his fellows and the roar of the london streets watching the white clouds drifting over and following them in spirit into all sorts of romantic adventures  at nineteen this hopeless dreamer who had read more books than an old professor entered cambridge as a charity student he remained for nearly three years then ran away because of a trifling debt and enlisted in the dragoons where he served several months before he was discovered and brought back to the university he left in 1794 without taking his degree and presently we find him with the youthful southeya kindred spirit who had been fired to wild enthusiasm by the french revolutionfounding his famous pantisocracy for the regeneration of human society the fall of robespierre a poem composed by the two enthusiasts is full of the new revolutionary spirit the pantisocracy on the banks of the susquehanna was to be an ideal community in which the citizens combined farming and literature and work was to be limited to two hours each day moreover each member of the community was to marry a good woman and take her with him the two poets obeyed the latter injunction first marrying two sisters and then found that they had no money to pay even their traveling expenses to the new utopia  during all the rest of his career a tragic weakness of will takes possession of coleridge making it impossible for him with all his genius and learning to hold himself steadily to any one work or purpose he studied in germany worked as a private secretary till the drudgery wore upon his free spirit then he went to rome and remained for two years lost in study later he started the friend a paper devoted to truth and liberty lectured on poetry and the fine arts to enraptured audiences in london until his frequent failures to meet his engagements scattered his hearers was offered an excellent position and a half interest amounting to some £2000 in the morning post and the courier but declined it saying that i would not give up the country and the lazy reading of old folios for two thousand times two thousand poundsin short that beyond £350 a year i considered money a real evil his family meanwhile was almost entirely neglected he lived apart following his own way and the wife and children were left in charge of his friend southey needing money he was on the point of becoming a unitarian minister when a small pension from two friends enabled him to live for a few years without regular employment  a terrible shadow in coleridges life was the apparent cause of most of his dejection in early life he suffered from neuralgia and to ease the pain began to use opiates the result on such a temperament was almost inevitable he became a slave to the drug habit his naturally weak will lost all its directing and sustaining force until after fifteen years of pain and struggle and despair he gave up and put himself in charge of a physician one mr gillman of highgate carlyle who visited him at this time calls him a king of men but records that he gave you the idea of a life that had been full of sufferings a life heavyladen halfvanquished still swimming painfully in seas of manifold physical and other bewilderment  the shadow is dark indeed but there are gleams of sunshine that occasionally break through the clouds one of these is his association with wordsworth and his sister dorothy in the quantock hills out of which came the famous lyrical ballads of 1798 another was his loyal devotion to poetry for its own sake with the exception of his tragedy remorse which through byrons influence was accepted at drury lane theater and for which he was paid £400 he received almost nothing for his poetry indeed he seems not to have desired it for he says poetry has been to me its own exceeding great reward it has soothed my afflictions it has multiplied and refined my enjoyments it has endeared solitude and it has given me the habit of wishing to discover the good and the beautiful in all that meets and surrounds me one can better understand his exquisite verse after such a declaration a third ray of sunlight came from the admiration of his contemporaries for though he wrote comparatively little he was by his talents and learning a leader among literary men and his conversations were as eagerly listened to as were those of dr johnson wordsworth says of him that though other men of the age had done some wonderful things coleridge was the only wonderful man he had ever known of his lectures on literature a contemporary says his words seem to flow as from a person repeating with grace and energy some delightful poem and of his conversation it is recorded throughout a longdrawn summers day would this man talk to you in low equable but clear and musical tones concerning things human and divine marshalling all history harmonizing all experiment probing the depths of your consciousness and revealing visions of glory and terror to the imagination  the last bright ray of sunlight comes from coleridges own soul from the gentle kindly nature which made men love and respect him in spite of his weaknesses and which caused lamb to speak of him humorously as an archangel a little damaged the universal law of suffering seems to be that it refines and softens humanity and coleridge was no exception to the law in his poetry we find a note of human sympathy more tender and profound than can be found in wordsworth or indeed in any other of the great english poets even in his later poems when he has lost his first inspiration and something of the splendid imaginative power that makes his work equal to the best of blakes we find a soul tender triumphant quiet in the stillness of a great peace he died in 1834 and was buried in highgate church the last stanza of the boatmans song in remorse serves better to express the worlds judgment than any epitaph      hark the cadence dies away     on the quiet moonlit sea     the boatmen rest their oars and say       miserere domini  works of coleridge the works of coleridge naturally divide themselves into three classesthe poetic the critical and the philosophical corresponding to the early the middle and the later periods of his career of his poetry stopford brooke well says all that he did excellently might be bound up in twenty pages but it should be bound in pure gold his early poems show the influence of gray and blake especially of the latter when coleridge begins his day dream with the line my eyes make pictures when theyre shut we recall instantly blakes haunting songs of innocence but there is this difference between the two poetsin blake we have only a dreamer in coleridge we have the rare combination of the dreamer and the profound scholar the quality of this early poetry with its strong suggestion of blake may be seen in such poems as a day dream the devils thoughts the suicides argument and the wanderings of cain his later poems wherein we see his imagination bridled by thought and study but still running very freely may best be appreciated in kubla khan christabel and the rime of the ancient mariner it is difficult to criticise such poems one can only read them and wonder at their melody and at the vague suggestions which they conjure up in the mind kubla khan is a fragment painting a gorgeous oriental dream picture such as one might see in an october sunset the whole poem came to coleridge one morning when he had fallen asleep over purchas and upon awakening he began to write hastily      in xanadu did kubla khan     a stately pleasuredome decree     where alph the sacred river ran     through caverns measureless to man     down to a sunless sea  he was interrupted after fiftyfour lines were written and he never finished the poem  christabel is also a fragment which seems to have been planned as the story of a pure young girl who fell under the spell of a sorcerer in the shape of the woman geraldine it is full of a strange melody and contains many passages of exquisite poetry but it trembles with a strange unknown horror and so suggests the supernatural terrors of the popular hysterical novels to which we have referred on this account it is not wholesome reading though one flies in the face of swinburne and of other critics by venturing to suggest such a thing  the rime of the ancient mariner is coleridges chief contribution to the lyrical ballads of 1798 and is one of the worlds masterpieces though it introduces the reader to a supernatural realm with a phantom ship a crew of dead men the overhanging curse of the albatross the polar spirit and the magic breeze it nevertheless manages to create a sense of absolute reality concerning these manifest absurdities all the mechanisms of the poem its meter rime and melody are perfect and some of its descriptions of the lonely sea have never been equaled perhaps we should say suggestions rather than descriptions for coleridge never describes things but makes a suggestion always brief and always exactly right and our own imagination instantly supplies the details it is useless to quote fragments one must read the entire poem if he reads nothing else of the romantic school of poetry  among coleridges shorter poems there is a wide variety and each reader must be left largely to follow his own taste the beginner will do well to read a few of the early poems to which we have referred and then try the ode to france youth and age dejection love poems fears in solitude religious musings work without hope and the glorious hymn before sunrise in the vale of chamouni one exquisite little poem from the latin the virgins cradle hymn and his version of schillers wallenstein show coleridges remarkable power as a translator the latter is one of the best poetical translations in our literature  of coleridges prose works the biographia literaria or sketches of my literary life and opinions 1817 his collected lectures on shakespeare 1849 and aids to reflection 1825 are the most interesting from a literary view point the first is an explanation and criticism of wordsworths theory of poetry and contains more sound sense and illuminating ideas on the general subject of poetry than any other book in our language the lectures as refreshing as a west wind in midsummer are remarkable for their attempt to sweep away the arbitrary rules which for two centuries had stood in the way of literary criticism of shakespeare in order to study the works themselves no finer analysis and appreciation of the masters genius has ever been written in his philosophical work coleridge introduced the idealistic philosophy of germany into england he set himself in line with berkeley and squarely against bentham malthus mill and all the materialistic tendencies which were and still are the bane of english philosophy the aids to reflection is coleridges most profound work but is more interesting to the student of religion and philosophy than to the readers of literature   robert southey 17741843  closely associated with wordsworth and coleridge is robert southey and the three on account of their residence in the northern lake district were referred to contemptuously as the lakers by the scottish magazine reviewers southey holds his place in this group more by personal association than by his literary gifts he was born at bristol in 1774 studied at westminster school and at oxford where he found himself in perpetual conflict with the authorities on account of his independent views he finally left the university and joined coleridge in his scheme of a pantisocracy for more than fifty years he labored steadily at literature refusing to consider any other occupation he considered himself seriously as one of the greatest writers of the day and a reading of his balladswhich connected him at once with the romantic schoolleads us to think that had he written less he might possibly have justified his own opinion of himself unfortunately he could not wait for inspiration being obliged to support not only his own family but also in large measure that of his friend coleridge  southey gradually surrounded himself with one of the most extensive libraries in england and set himself to the task of of writing something every working day the results of his industry were one hundred and nine volumes besides some hundred and fifty articles for the magazines most of which are now utterly forgotten his most ambitious poems are thalaba a tale of arabian enchantment the curse of kehama a medley of hindoo mythology madoc a legend of a welsh prince who discovered the western world and roderick a tale of the last of the goths all these and many more although containing some excellent passages are on the whole exaggerated and unreal both in manner and in matter southey wrote far better prose than poetry and his admirable life of nelson is still often read besides these are his lives of british admirals his lives of cowper and wesley and his histories of brazil and of the peninsular war  southey was made poet laureate in 1813 and was the first to raise that office from the low estate into which it had fallen since the death of dryden the opening lines of thalaba beginning      how beautiful is night     a dewy freshness fills the silent air  are still sometimes quoted and a few of his best known short poems like the scholar auld cloots the well of st keyne the inchcape rock and lodore will repay the curious reader the beauty of southeys character his patience and helpfulness make him a worthy associate of the two greater poets with whom he is generally named   walter scott 17711832  we have already called attention to two significant movements of the eighteenth century which we must for a moment recall if we are to appreciate scott not simply as a delightful teller of tales but as a tremendous force in modern literature the first is the triumph of romantic poetry in wordsworth and coleridge the second is the success of our first english novelists and the popularization of literature by taking it from the control of a few patrons and critics and putting it into the hands of the people as one of the forces which mold our modern life scott is an epitome of both these movements the poetry of wordsworth and coleridge was read by a select few but scotts marmion and lady of the lake aroused a whole nation to enthusiasm and for the first time romantic poetry became really popular so also the novel had been content to paint men and women of the present until the wonderful series of waverley novels appeared when suddenly by the magic of this wizard of the north all history seemed changed the past which had hitherto appeared as a dreary region of dead heroes became alive again and filled with a multitude of men and women who had the surprising charm of reality it is of small consequence that scotts poetry and prose are both faulty that his poems are read chiefly for the story rather than for their poetic excellence and that much of the evident crudity and barbarism of the middle ages is ignored or forgotten in scotts writings by their vigor their freshness their rapid action and their breezy outofdoor atmosphere scotts novels attracted thousands of readers who else had known nothing of the delights of literature he is therefore the greatest known factor in establishing and in popularizing that romantic element in prose and poetry which has been for a hundred years the chief characteristic of our literature  life scott was born in edinburgh on august 15 1771 on both his mothers and fathers side he was descended from old border families distinguished more for their feuds and fighting than for their intellectual attainments his father was a barrister a just man who often lost clients by advising them to be first of all honest in their lawsuits his mother was a woman of character and education strongly imaginative a teller of tales which stirred young walters enthusiasm by revealing the past as a world of living heroes  as a child scott was lame and delicate and was therefore sent away from the city to be with his grandmother in the open country at sandy knowe in roxburghshire near the tweed this grandmother was a perfect treasure house of legends concerning the old border feuds from her wonderful tales scott developed that intense love of scottish history and tradition which characterizes all his work  by the time he was eight years old when he returned to edinburgh scotts tastes were fixed for life at the high school he was a fair scholar but without enthusiasm being more interested in border stories than in the textbooks he remained at school only six or seven years and then entered his fathers office to study law at the same time attending lectures at the university he kept this up for some six years without developing any interest in his profession not even when he passed his examinations and was admitted to the bar in 1792 after nineteen years of desultory work in which he showed far more zeal in gathering highland legends than in gaining clients he had won two small legal offices which gave him enough income to support him comfortably his home meanwhile was at ashestiel on the tweed where all his best poetry was written  scotts literary work began with the translation from the german of bürgers romantic ballad of lenore 1796 and of goethes götz von berlichingen 1799 but there was romance enough in his own loved highlands and in 18021803 appeared three volumes of his minstrelsy of the scottish border which he had been collecting for many years in 1805 when scott was 34 years old appeared his first original work the lay of the last minstrel its success was immediate and when marmion 1808 and the lady of the lake 1810 aroused scotland and england to intense enthusiasm and brought unexpected fame to the authorwithout in the least spoiling his honest and lovable naturescott gladly resolved to abandon the law in which he had won scant success and give himself wholly to literature unfortunately however in order to increase his earnings he entered secretly into partnership with the firms of constable and the brothers ballantyne as printerpublishersa sad mistake indeed and the cause of that tragedy which closed the life of scotlands greatest writer  the year 1811 is remarkable for two things in scotts life in this year he seems to have realized that notwithstanding the success of his poems he had not yet found himself that he was not a poetic genius like burns that in his first three poems he had practically exhausted his material though he still continued to write verse and that if he was to keep his popularity he must find some other work the fact that only a year later byron suddenly became the popular favorite shows how correctly scott had judged himself and the reading public which was even more fickle than usual in this emotional age in that same year 1811 scott bought the estate of abbotsford on the tweed with which place his name is forever associated here he began to spend large sums and to dispense the generous hospitality of a scotch laird of which he had been dreaming for years in 1820 he was made a baronet and his new title of sir walter came nearer to turning his honest head than had all his literary success his business partnership was kept secret and during all the years when the waverley novels were the most popular books in the world their authorship remained unknown for scott deemed it beneath the dignity of his title to earn money by business or literature and sought to give the impression that the enormous sums spent at abbotsford in improving the estate and in entertaining lavishly were part of the dignity of the position and came from ancestral sources  it was the success of byrons childe harold and the comparative failure of scotts later poems rokeby the bridal of triermain and the lord of the isles which led our author into the new field where he was to be without a rival rummaging through a cabinet one day in search of some fishing tackle scott found the manuscript of a story which he had begun and laid aside nine years before he read this old story eagerly as if it had been anothers work finished it within three weeks and published it without signing his name the success of this first novel waverley 1814 was immediate and unexpected its great sales and the general chorus of praise for its unknown author were without precedent and when guy mannering the antiquary black dwarf old mortality rob roy and the heart of midlothian appeared within the next four years englands delight and wonder knew no bounds not only at home but also on the continent large numbers of these fresh and fascinating stories were sold as fast as they could be printed  during the seventeen years which followed the appearance of waverley scott wrote on an average nearly two novels per year creating an unusual number of characters and illustrating many periods of scotch english and french history from the time of the crusades to the fall of the stuarts in addition to these historical novels he wrote tales of a grandfather demonology and witchcraft biographies of dryden and of swift the life of napoleon in nine volumes and a large number of articles for the reviews and magazines it was an extraordinary amount of literary work but it was not quite so rapid and spontaneous as it seemed he had been very diligent in looking up old records and we must remember that in nearly all his poems and novels scott was drawing upon a fund of legend tradition history and poetry which he had been gathering for forty years and which his memory enabled him to produce at will with almost the accuracy of an encyclopedia  for the first six years scott held himself to scottish history giving us in nine remarkable novels the whole of scotland its heroism its superb faith and enthusiasm and especially its clannish loyalty to its hereditary chiefs giving us also all parties and characters from covenanters to royalists and from kings to beggars after reading these nine volumes we know scotland and scotchmen as we can know them in no other way in 1819 he turned abruptly from scotland and in ivanhoe the most popular of his works showed what a mine of neglected wealth lay just beneath the surface of english history it is hard to realize now as we read its rapid melodramatic action its vivid portrayal of saxon and norman character and all its picturesque details that it was written rapidly at a time when the author was suffering from disease and could hardly repress an occasional groan from finding its way into the rapid dictation it stands today as the best example of the authors own theory that the will of a man is enough to hold him steadily against all obstacles to the task of doing what he has a mind to do kenilworth nigel peveril and woodstock all written in the next few years show his grasp of the romantic side of english annals count robert and the talisman show his enthusiasm for the heroic side of the crusaders nature and quentin durward and anne of geierstein suggest another mine of romance which he discovered in french history  for twenty years scott labored steadily at literature with the double object of giving what was in him and of earning large sums to support the lavish display which he deemed essential to a laird of scotland in 1826 while he was blithely at work on woodstock the crash came not even the vast earnings of all these popular novels could longer keep the wretched business of ballantyne on its feet and the firm failed after years of mismanagement though a silent partner scott assumed full responsibility and at fiftyfive years of age sick suffering and with all his best work behind him he found himself facing a debt of over half a million dollars the firm could easily have compromised with its creditors but scott refused to hear of bankruptcy laws under which he could have taken refuge he assumed the entire debt as a personal one and set resolutely to work to pay every penny times were indeed changed in england when instead of a literary genius starving until some wealthy patron gave him a pension this man aided by his pen alone could confidently begin to earn that enormous amount of money and this is one of the unnoticed results of the popularization of literature without a doubt scott would have accomplished the task had he been granted only a few years of health he still lived at abbotsford which he had offered to his creditors but which they generously refused to accept and in two years by miscellaneous work had paid some two hundred thousand dollars of his debt nearly half of this sum coming from his life of napoleon a new edition of the waverley novels appeared which was very successful financially and scott had every reason to hope that he would soon face the world owing no man a penny when he suddenly broke under the strain in 1830 occurred a stroke of paralysis from which he never fully recovered though after a little time he was again at work dictating with splendid patience and resolution he writes in his diary at this time the blow is a stunning one i suppose for i scarcely feel it it is singular but it comes with as little surprise as if i had a remedy ready yet god knows i am at sea in the dark and the vessel leaky  it is good to remember that governments are not always ungrateful and to record that when it became known that a voyage to italy might improve scotts health the british government promptly placed a naval vessel at the disposal of a man who had led no armies to the slaughter but had only given pleasure to multitudes of peaceable men and women by his stories he visited malta naples and rome but in his heart he longed for scotland and turned homeward after a few months of exile the river tweed the scotch hills the trees of abbotsford the joyous clamor of his dogs brought forth the first exclamation of delight which had passed scotts lips since he sailed away he died in september of the same year 1832 and was buried with his ancestors in the old dryburgh abbey  works of scott scotts work is of a kind which the critic gladly passes over leaving each reader to his own joyous and uninstructed opinion from a literary view point the works are faulty enough if one is looking for faults but it is well to remember that they were intended to give delight and that they rarely fail of their object when one has read the stirring marmion or the more enduring lady of the lake felt the heroism of the crusaders in the talisman the picturesqueness of chivalry in ivanhoe the nobleness of soul of a scotch peasant girl in the heart of midlothian and the quality of scotch faith in old mortality then his own opinion of scotts genius will be of more value than all the criticisms that have ever been written  at the outset we must confess frankly that scotts poetry is not artistic in the highest sense and that it lacks the deeply imaginative and suggestive qualities which make a poem the noblest and most enduring work of humanity we read it now not for its poetic excellence but for its absorbing story interest even so it serves an admirable purpose marmion and the lady of the lake which are often the first long poems read by the beginner in literature almost invariably lead to a deeper interest in the subject and many readers owe to these poems an introduction to the delights of poetry they are an excellent beginning therefore for young readers since they are almost certain to hold the attention and to lead indirectly to an interest in other and better poems aside from this scotts poetry is marked by vigor and youthful abandon its interest lies in its vivid pictures its heroic characters and especially in its rapid action and succession of adventures which hold and delight us still as they held and delighted the first wondering readers and one finds here and there terse descriptions or snatches of song and ballad like the boat song and lochinvar which are among the best known in our literature  in his novels scott plainly wrote too rapidly and too much while a genius of the first magnitude the definition of genius as the infinite capacity for taking pains hardly belongs to him for details of life and history for finely drawn characters and for tracing the logical consequences of human action he has usually no inclination he sketches a character roughly plunges him into the midst of stirring incidents and the action of the story carries us on breathlessly to the end so his stories are largely adventure stories at the best and it is this element of adventure and glorious action rather than the study of character which makes scott a perennial favorite of the young the same element of excitement is what causes mature readers to turn from scott to better novelists who have more power to delineate human character and to create or discover a romantic interest in the incidents of everyday life rather than in stirring adventure225  notwithstanding these limitations it is wellespecially in these days when we hear that scott is outgrownto emphasize four noteworthy things that he accomplished  1 he created the historical novel226 and all novelists of the last century who draw upon history for their characters and events are followers of scott and acknowledge his mastery  2 his novels are on a vast scale covering a very wide range of action and are concerned with public rather than with private interests so with the exception of the bride of lammermoor the love story in his novels is generally pale and feeble but the strife and passions of big parties are magnificently portrayed a glance over even the titles of his novels shows how the heroic side of history for over six hundred years finds expression in his pages and all the parties of these six centuriescrusaders covenanters cavaliers roundheads papists jews gypsies rebelsstart into life again and fight or give a reason for the faith that is in them no other novelist in england and only balzac in france approaches scott in the scope of his narratives  3 scott was the first novelist in any language to make the scene an essential element in the action he knew scotland and loved it and there is hardly an event in any of his scottish novels in which we do not breathe the very atmosphere of the place and feel the presence of its moors and mountains the place morever is usually so well chosen and described that the action seems almost to be the result of natural environment perhaps the most striking illustration of this harmony between scene and incident is found in old mortality where morton approaches the cave of the old covenanter and where the spiritual terror inspired by the fanatics struggle with imaginary fiends is paralleled by the physical terror of a gulf and a roaring flood spanned by a slippery tree trunk a second illustration of the same harmony of scene and incident is found in the meeting of the arms and ideals of the east and west when the two champions fight in the burning desert and then eat bread together in the cool shade of the oasis as described in the opening chapter of the talisman a third illustration is found in that fascinating love scene where ivanhoe lies wounded raging at his helplessness while the gentle rebecca alternately hides and reveals her love as she describes the terrific assault on the castle which goes on beneath her window his thoughts are all on the fight hers on the man she loves and both are natural and both are exactly what we expect under the circumstances these are but striking examples of the fact that in all his work scott tries to preserve perfect harmony between the scene and the action  4 scotts chief claim to greatness lies in the fact that he was the first novelist to recreate the past that he changed our whole conception of history by making it to be not a record of dry facts but a stage on which living men and women played their parts carlyles criticism is here most pertinent these historical novels have taught this truth  unknown to writers of history that the bygone ages of the world were actually filled by living men not by protocols state papers controversies and abstractions of men not only the pages of history but all the hills and vales of his beloved scotland are filled with living characterslords and ladies soldiers pirates gypsies preachers schoolmasters clansmen bailiffs dependentsall scotland is here before our eyes in the reality of life itself it is astonishing with his large numbers of characters that scott never repeats himself naturally he is most at home in scotland and with humble people scotts own romantic interest in feudalism caused him to make his lords altogether too lordly his aristocratic maidens are usually bloodless conventional exasperating creatures who talk like books and pose like figures in an old tapestry but when he describes characters like jeanie deans in the heart of midlothian and the old clansman evan dhu in waverley we know the very soul of scotch womanhood and manhood  perhaps one thing more should be said or rather repeated of scotts enduring work he is always sane wholesome manly inspiring we know the essential nobility of human life better and we are better men and women ourselves because of what he has written   george gordon lord byron 17881824  there are two distinct sides to byron and his poetry one good the other bad and those who write about him generally describe one side or the other in superlatives thus one critic speaks of his splendid and imperishable excellence of sincerity and strength another of his gaudy charlatanry blare of brass and big bowwowishness as both critics are fundamentally right we shall not here attempt to reconcile their differences which arise from viewing one side of the mans nature and poetry to the exclusion of the other before his exile from england in 1816 the general impression made by byron is that of a man who leads an irregular life poses as a romantic hero makes himself out much worse than he really is and takes delight in shocking not only the conventions but the ideals of english society his poetry of this first period is generally though not always shallow and insincere in thought and declamatory or bombastic in expression after his exile and his meeting with shelley in italy we note a gradual improvement due partly to shelleys influence and partly to his own mature thought and experience we have the impression now of a disillusioned man who recognizes his true character and who though cynical and pessimistic is at least honest in his unhappy outlook on society his poetry of this period is generally less shallow and rhetorical and though he still parades his feelings in public he often surprises us by being manly and sincere thus in the third canto of childe harold written just after his exile he says      in my youths summer i did sing of one     the wandering outlaw of his own dark mind  and as we read on to the end of the splendid fourth cantowith its poetic feeling for nature and its stirring rhythm that grips and holds the reader like martial musicwe lay down the book with profound regret that this gifted man should have devoted so much of his talent to describing trivial or unwholesome intrigues and posing as the hero of his own verses the real tragedy of byrons life is that he died just as he was beginning to find himself  life byron was born in london in 1788 the year preceding the french revolution we shall understand him better and judge him more charitably if we remember the tainted stock from which he sprang his father was a dissipated spendthrift of unspeakable morals his mother was a scotch heiress passionate and unbalanced the father deserted his wife after squandering her fortune and the boy was brought up by the mother who alternately petted and abused him in his eleventh year the death of a granduncle left him heir to newstead abbey and to the baronial title of one of the oldest houses in england he was singularly handsome and a lameness resulting from a deformed foot lent a suggestion of pathos to his makeup all this with his social position his pseudoheroic poetry and his dissipated lifeover which he contrived to throw a veil of romantic secrecymade him a magnet of attraction to many thoughtless young men and foolish women who made the downhill path both easy and rapid to one whose inclinations led him in that direction naturally he was generous and easily led by affection he is therefore largely a victim of his own weakness and of unfortunate surroundings  at school at harrow and in the university at cambridge byron led an unbalanced life and was more given to certain sports from which he was not debarred by lameness than to books and study his school life like his infancy is sadly marked by vanity violence and rebellion against every form of authority yet it was not without its hours of nobility and generosity scott describes him as a man of real goodness of heart and the kindest and best feelings miserably thrown away by his foolish contempt of public opinion while at cambridge byron published his first volume of poems hours of idleness in 1807 a severe criticism of the volume in the edinburgh review wounded byrons vanity and threw him into a violent passion the result of which was the now famous satire called english bards and scotch reviewers in which not only his enemies but also scott wordsworth and nearly all the literary men of his day were satirized in heroic couplets after the manner of popes dunciad it is only just to say that he afterwards made friends with scott and with others whom he had abused without provocation and it is interesting to note in view of his own romantic poetry that he denounced all masters of romance and accepted the artificial standards of pope and dryden his two favorite books were the old testament and a volume of popes poetry of the latter he says his is the greatest name in poetry  all the rest are barbarians  in 1809 byron when only twentyone years of age started on a tour of europe and the orient the poetic results of this trip were the first two cantos of childe harolds pilgrimage with their famous descriptions of romantic scenery the work made him instantly popular and his fame overshadowed scotts completely as he says himself i awoke one morning to find myself famous and presently he styles himself the grand napoleon of the realms of rhyme the worst element in byron at this time was his insincerity his continual posing as the hero of his poetry his best works were translated and his fame spread almost as rapidly on the continent as in england even goethe was deceived and declared that a man so wonderful in character had never before appeared in literature and would never appear again now that the tinsel has worn off and we can judge the man and his work dispassionately we see how easily even the critics of the age were governed by romantic impulses  the adulation of byron lasted only a few years in england in 1815 he married miss milbanke an english heiress who abruptly left him a year later with womanly reserve she kept silence but the public was not slow to imagine plenty of reasons for the separation this together with the fact that men had begun to penetrate the veil of romantic secrecy with which byron surrounded himself and found a rather brassy idol beneath turned the tide of public opinion against him he left england under a cloud of distrust and disappointment in 1816 and never returned eight years were spent abroad largely in italy where he was associated with shelley until the latters tragic death in 1822 his house was ever the meeting place for revolutionists and malcontents calling themselves patriots whom he trusted too greatly and with whom he shared his money most generously curiously enough while he trusted men too easily he had no faith in human society or government and wrote in 1817 i have simplified my politics to an utter detestation of all existing governments during his exile he finished childe harold the prisoner of chillon his dramas cain and manfred and numerous other works in some of which as in don juan he delighted in revenging himself upon his countrymen by holding up to ridicule all that they held most sacred  in 1824 byron went to greece to give himself and a large part of his fortune to help that country in its struggle for liberty against the turks how far he was led by his desire for posing as a hero and how far by a certain vigorous viking spirit that was certainly in him will never be known the greeks welcomed him and made him a leader and for a few months he found himself in the midst of a wretched squabble of lies selfishness insincerity cowardice and intrigue instead of the heroic struggle for liberty which he had anticipated he died of fever in missolonghi in 1824 one of his last poems written there on his thirtysixth birthday a few months before he died expresses his own view of his disappointing life      my days are in the yellow leaf     the flowers and fruits of love are gone     the worm the canker and the grief         are mine alone  works of byron in reading byron it is well to remember that he was a disappointed and embittered man not only in his personal life but also in his expectation of a general transformation of human society as he pours out his own feelings chiefly in his poetry he is the most expressive writer of his age in voicing the discontent of a multitude of europeans who were disappointed at the failure of the french revolution to produce an entirely new form of government and society  one who wishes to understand the whole scope of byrons genius and poetry will do well to begin with his first work hours of idleness written when he was a young man at the university there is very little poetry in the volume only a striking facility in rime brightened by the devilmay care spirit of the cavalier poets but as a revelation of the man himself it is remarkable in a vain and sophomoric preface he declares that poetry is to him an idle experiment and that this is his first and last attempt to amuse himself in that line curiously enough as he starts for greece on his last fatal journey he again ridicules literature and says that the poet is a mere babbler it is this despising of the art which alone makes him famous that occasions our deepest disappointment even in his magnificent passages in a glowing description of nature or of a hindoo womans exquisite love his work is frequently marred by a wretched pun or by some cheap buffoonery which ruins our first splendid impression of his poetry  byrons later volumes manfred and cain the one a curious and perhaps unconscious parody of faust the other of paradise lost are his two best known dramatic works aside from the question of their poetic value they are interesting as voicing byrons excessive individualism and his rebellion against society the best known and the most readable of byrons works mazeppa the prisoner of chillon and childe harolds pilgrimage the first two cantos of childe harold 1812 are perhaps more frequently read than any other work of the same author partly because of their melodious verse partly because of their descriptions of places along the lines of european travel but the last two cantos 18161818 written after his exile from england have more sincerity and are in every way better expressions of byrons mature genius scattered through all his works one finds magnificent descriptions of natural scenery and exquisite lyrics of love and despair but they are mixed with such a deal of bombast and rhetoric together with much that is unwholesome that the beginner will do well to confine himself to a small volume of wellchosen selections227  byron is often compared with scott as having given to us europe and the orient just as scott gave us scotland and its people but while there is a certain resemblance in the swing and dash of the verses the resemblance is all on the surface and the underlying difference between the two poets is as great as that between thackeray and bulwerlytton scott knew his country wellits hills and valleys which are interesting as the abode of living and lovable men and women byron pretended to know the secret unwholesome side of europe which generally hides itself in the dark but instead of giving us a variety of living men he never gets away from his own unbalanced and egotistical self all his characters in cain manfred the corsair the giaour childe harold don juan are tiresome repetitions of himselfa vain disappointed cynical man who finds no good in life or love or anything naturally with such a disposition he is entirely incapable of portraying a true woman to nature alone especially in her magnificent moods byron remains faithful and his portrayal of the night and the storm and the ocean in childe harold are unsurpassed in our language   percy bysshe shelley 17921822      make me thy lyre even as the forest is       what if my leaves are falling like its own     the tumult of thy mighty harmonies       will take from both a deep autumnal tone     sweet though in sadness be thou spirit fierce       my spirit be thou me impetuous one  in this fragment from the ode to the west wind we have a suggestion of shelleys own spirit as reflected in all his poetry the very spirit of nature which appeals to us in the wind and the cloud the sunset and the moonrise seems to have possessed him at times and made him a chosen instrument of melody at such times he is a true poet and his work is unrivaled at other times unfortunately shelley joins with byron in voicing a vain rebellion against society his poetry like his life divides itself into two distinct moods in one he is the violent reformer seeking to overthrow our present institutions and to hurry the millennium out of its slow walk into a gallop out of this mood come most of his longer poems like queen mab revolt of islam hellas and the witch of atlas which are somewhat violent diatribes against government priests marriage religion even god as men supposed him to be in a different mood which finds expression alastor adonais and his wonderful lyrics shelley is like a wanderer following a vague beautiful vision forever sad and forever unsatisfied in the latter mood he appeals profoundly to all men who have known what it is to follow after an unattainable ideal  shelleys life there are three classes of men who see visions and all three are represented in our literature the first is the mere dreamer like blake who stumbles through a world of reality without noticing it and is happy in his visions the second is the seer the prophet like langland or wyclif who sees a vision and quietly goes to work in ways that men understand to make the present world a little more like the ideal one which he sees in his vision the third who appears in many formsas visionary enthusiast radical anarchist revolutionary call him what you willsees a vision and straightway begins to tear down all human institutions which have been built up by the slow toil of centuries simply because they seem to stand in the way of his dream to the latter class belongs shelley a man perpetually at war with the present world a martyr and exile simply because of his inability to sympathize with men and society as they are and because of his own mistaken judgment as to the value and purpose of a vision  shelley was born in field place near horsham sussex in 1792 on both his fathers and his mothers side he was descended from noble old families famous in the political and literary history of england from childhood he lived like blake in a world of fancy so real that certain imaginary dragons and headless creatures of the neighboring wood kept him and his sisters in a state of fearful expectancy he learned rapidly absorbed the classics as if by intuition and dissatisfied with ordinary processes of learning seems to have sought like faustus the acquaintance of spirits as shown in his hymn to intellectual beauty      while yet a boy i sought for ghosts and sped       through many a listening chamber cave and ruin       and starlight wood with fearful steps pursuing     hopes of high talk with the departed dead  shelleys first public school kept by a hardheaded scotch master with its floggings and its general brutality seemed to him like a combination of hell and prison and his active rebellion against existing institutions was well under way when at twelve years of age he entered the famous preparatory school at eton he was a delicate nervous marvelously sensitive boy of great physical beauty and like cowper he suffered torments at the hands of his rough schoolfellows unlike cowper he was positive resentful and brave to the point of rashness soul and body rose up against tyranny and he promptly organized a rebellion against the brutal fagging system mad shelley the boys called him and they chivied him like dogs around a little coon that fights and cries defiance to the end one finds what he seeks in this world and it is not strange that shelley after his eton experiences found causes for rebellion in all existing forms of human society and that he left school to war among mankind as he says of himself in the revolt of islam his university days are but a repetition of his earlier experiences while a student at oxford he read some scraps of humes philosophy and immediately published a pamphlet called the necessity of atheism it was a crude foolish piece of work and shelley distributed it by post to every one to whom it might give offense naturally this brought on a conflict with the authorities but shelley would not listen to reason or make any explanation and was expelled from the university in 1811  shelleys marriage was even more unfortunate while living in london on a generous sisters pocket money a certain young schoolgirl harriet westbrook was attracted by shelleys crude revolutionary doctrines she promptly left school as her own personal part in the general rebellion and refused to return or even to listen to her parents upon the subject having been taught by shelley she threw herself upon his protection and this unbalanced couple were presently married as they said in deference to anarch custom the two infants had already proclaimed a rebellion against the institution of marriage for which they proposed to substitute the doctrine of elective affinity for two years they wandered about england ireland and wales living on a small allowance from shelleys father who had disinherited his son because of his illconsidered marriage the pair soon separated and two years later shelley having formed a strong friendship with one godwina leader of young enthusiasts and a preacher of anarchypresently showed his belief in godwins theories by eloping with his daughter mary it is a sad story and the details were perhaps better forgotten we should remember that in shelley we are dealing with a tragic blend of highmindedness and lightheadedness byron wrote of him the most gentle the most amiable and the least worldlyminded person i ever met  led partly by the general hostility against him and partly by his own delicate health shelley went to italy in 1818 and never returned to england after wandering over italy he finally settled in pisa beloved of so many english poetsbeautiful sleepy pisa where one looks out of his window on the main street at the busiest hour of the day and the only living thing in sight is a donkey dozing lazily with his head in the shade and his body in the sunshine here his best poetry was written and here he found comfort in the friendship of byron hunt and trelawney who are forever associated with shelleys italian life he still remained hostile to english social institutions but life is a good teacher and that shelley dimly recognized the error of his rebellion is shown in the increasing sadness of his later poems      o world o life o time     on whose last steps i climb       trembling at that where i had stood before     when will return the glory of your prime       no moreoh never more     out of the day and night     a joy has taken flight       fresh spring and summer and winter hoar     move my faint heart with grief but with delight       no moreoh never more  in 1822 when only thirty years of age shelley was drowned while sailing in a small boat off the italian coast his body was washed ashore several days later and was cremated near viareggio by his friends byron hunt and trelawney his ashes might with all reverence have been given to the winds that he loved and that were a symbol of his restless spirit instead they found a resting place near the grave of keats in the english cemetery at rome one rarely visits the spot now without finding english and american visitors standing in silence before the significant inscription cor cordium  works of shelley as a lyric poet shelley is one of the supreme geniuses of our literature and the reader will do well to begin with the poems which show him at his very best the cloud to a skylark ode to the west wind to nightpoems like these must surely set the reader to searching among shelleys miscellaneous works to find for himself the things worthy to be remembered  in reading shelleys longer poems one must remember that there are in this poet two distinct men one the wanderer seeking ideal beauty and forever unsatisfied the other the unbalanced reformer seeking the overthrow of present institutions and the establishment of universal happiness alastor or the spirit of solitude 1816 is by far the best expression of shelleys greater mood here we see him wandering restlessly through the vast silences of nature in search of a loved dreammaiden who shall satisfy his love of beauty here shelley is the poet of the moonrise and of the tender exquisite fancies that can never be expressed the charm of the poem lies in its succession of dreamlike pictures but it gives absolutely no impressions of reality it was written when shelley after his long struggle had begun to realize that the world was too strong for him alastor is therefore the poets confession not simply of failure but of undying hope in some better thing that is to come  prometheus unbound 18181820 a lyrical drama is the best work of shelleys revolutionary enthusiasm and the most characteristic of all his poems shelleys philosophy if one may dignify a hopeless dream by such a name was a curious aftergrowth of the french revolution namely that it is only the existing tyranny of state church and society which keeps man from growth into perfect happiness naturally shelley forgot like many other enthusiasts that church and state and social laws were not imposed upon man from without but were created by himself to minister to his necessities in shelleys poem the hero prometheus represents mankind itselfa just and noble humanity chained and tortured by jove who is here the personification of human institutions228 in due time demogorgon which is shelleys name for necessity overthrows the tyrant jove and releases prometheus mankind who is presently united to asia the spirit of love and goodness in nature while the earth and the moon join in a wedding song and everything gives promise that they shall live together happy ever afterwards  shelley here looks forward not back to the golden age and is the prophet of science and evolution if we compare his titan with similar characters in faust and cain we shall find this interesting differencethat while goethes titan is cultured and selfreliant and byrons stoic and hopeless shelleys hero is patient under torture seeing help and hope beyond his suffering and he marries love that the earth may be peopled with superior beings who shall substitute brotherly love for the present laws and conventions of society such is his philosophy but the beginner will read this poem not chiefly for its thought but for its youthful enthusiasm for its marvelous imagery and especially for its ethereal music perhaps we should add here that prometheus is and probably always will be a poem for the chosen few who can appreciate its peculiar spiritlike beauty in its purely pagan conception of the world it suggests by contrast miltons christian philosophy in paradise regained  shelleys revolutionary works queen mab 1813 the revolt of islam 1818 hellas 1821 and the witch of atlas 1820 are to be judged in much the same way as is prometheus unbound they are largely invectives against religion marriage kingcraft and priestcraft most impractical when considered as schemes for reform but abounding in passages of exquisite beauty for which alone they are worth reading in the drama called the cenci 1819 which is founded upon a morbid italian story shelley for the first and only time descends to reality the heroine beatrice driven to desperation by the monstrous wickedness of her father kills him and suffers the death penalty in consequence she is the only one of shelleys characters who seems to us entirely human  far different in character is epipsychidion 1821 a rhapsody celebrating platonic love the most impalpable and so one of the most characteristic of all shelleys works it was inspired by a beautiful italian girl emilia viviani who was put into a cloister against her will and in whom shelley imagined he found his longsought ideal of womanhood with this should be read adonais 1821 the best known of all shelleys longer poems adonais is a wonderful threnody or a song of grief over the death of the poet keats even in his grief shelley still preserves a sense of unreality and calls in many shadowy allegorical figuressad spring weeping hours glooms splendors destiniesall uniting in bewailing the loss of a loved one the whole poem is a succession of dream pictures exquisitely beautiful such as only shelley could imagine and it holds its place with miltons lycidas and tennysons in memoriam as one of the three greatest elegies in our language  in his interpretation of nature shelley suggests wordsworth both by resemblance and by contrast to both poets all natural objects are symbols of truth both regard nature as permeated by the great spiritual life which animates all things but while wordsworth finds a spirit of thought and so of communion between nature and the soul of man shelley finds a spirit of love which exists chiefly for its own delight and so the cloud the skylark and the west wind three of the most beautiful poems in our language have no definite message for humanity in his hymn to intellectual beauty shelley is most like wordsworth but in his sensitive plant with its fine symbolism and imagery he is like nobody in the world but himself comparison is sometimes an excellent thing and if we compare shelleys exquisite lament beginning o world o life o time with wordsworths intimations of immortality we shall perhaps understand both poets better both poems recall many happy memories of youth both express a very real mood of a moment but while the beauty of one merely saddens and disheartens us the beauty of the other inspires us with something of the poets own faith and hopefulness in a word wordsworth found and shelley lost himself in nature   john keats 17951821  keats was not only the last but also the most perfect of the romanticists while scott was merely telling stories and wordsworth reforming poetry or upholding the moral law and shelley advocating impossible reforms and byron voicing his own egoism and the political discontent of the times keats lived apart from men and from all political measures worshiping beauty like a devotee perfectly content to write what was in his own heart or to reflect some splendor of the natural world as he saw or dreamed it to be he had moreover the novel idea that poetry exists for its own sake and suffers loss by being devoted to philosophy or politics or indeed to any cause however great or small as he says in lamia                   do not all charms fly     at the mere touch of cold philosophy     there was an awful rainbow once in heaven     we know her woof her texture she is given     in the dull catalogue of common things     philosophy will clip an angels wings     conquer all mysteries by rule and line     empty the haunted air and gnomed mine     unweave a rainbow as it erewhile made     the tenderpersond lamia melt into a shade  partly because of this high ideal of poetry partly because he studied and unconsciously imitated the greek classics and the best works of the elizabethans keatss last little volume of poetry is unequaled by the work of any of his contemporaries when we remember that all his work was published in three short years from 1817 to 1820 and that he died when only twentyfive years old we must judge him to be the most promising figure of the early nineteenth century and one of the most remarkable in the history of literature  life keatss life of devotion to beauty and to poetry is all the more remarkable in view of his lowly origin he was the son of a hostler and stable keeper and was born in the stable of the swan and hoop inn london in 1795 one has only to read the rough stable scenes from our first novelists or even from dickens to understand how little there was in such an atmosphere to develop poetic gifts before keats was fifteen years old both parents died and he was placed with his brothers and sisters in charge of guardians their first act seems to have been to take keats from school at enfield and to bind him as an apprentice to a surgeon at edmonton for five years he served his apprenticeship and for two years more he was surgeons helper in the hospitals but though skillful enough to win approval he disliked his work and his thoughts were on other things the other day during a lecture he said to a friend there came a sunbeam into the room and with it a whole troop of creatures floating in the ray and i was off with them to oberon and fairyland a copy of spensers faery queen which had been given him by charles cowden clark was the prime cause of his abstraction he abandoned his profession in 1817 and early in the same year published his first volume of poems it was modest enough in spirit as was also his second volume endymion 1818 but that did not prevent brutal attacks upon the author and his work by the selfconstituted critics of blackwoods magazine and the quarterly it is often alleged that the poets spirit and ambition were broken by these attacks229 but keats was a man of strong character and instead of quarreling with his reviewers or being crushed by their criticism he went quietly to work with the idea of producing poetry that should live forever as matthew arnold says keats had flint and iron in him and in his next volume he accomplished his own purpose and silenced unfriendly criticism  for the three years during which keats wrote his poetry he lived chiefly in london and in hampstead but wandered at times over england and scotland living for brief spaces in the isle of wight in devonshire and in the lake district seeking to recover his own health and especially to restore that of his brother his illness began with a severe cold but soon developed into consumption and added to this sorrow was anotherhis love for fannie brawne to whom he was engaged but whom he could not marry on account of his poverty and growing illness when we remember all this personal grief and the harsh criticism of literary men the last small volume lamia isabella the eve of st agnes and other poems 1820 is most significant as showing not only keatss wonderful poetic gifts but also his beautiful and indomitable spirit shelley struck by the beauty and promise of hyperion sent a generous invitation to the author to come to pisa and live with him but keats refused having little sympathy with shelleys revolt against society the invitation had this effect however that it turned keatss thoughts to italy whither he soon went in the effort to save his life he settled in rome with his friend severn the artist but died soon after his arrival in february 1821 his grave in the protestant cemetery at rome is still an object of pilgrimage to thousands of tourists for among all our poets there is hardly another whose heroic life and tragic death have so appealed to the hearts of poets and young enthusiasts  the work of keats none but the master shall praise us and none but the master shall blame might well be written on the fly leaf of every volume of keatss poetry for never was there a poet more devoted to his ideal entirely independent of success or failure in strong contrast with his contemporary byron who professed to despise the art that made him famous keats lived for poetry alone and as lowell pointed out a virtue went out of him into everything he wrote in all his work we have the impression of this intense loyalty to his art we have the impression also of a profound dissatisfaction that the deed falls so far short of the splendid dream thus after reading chapmans translation of homer he writes      much have i travelled in the realms of gold     and many goodly states and kingdoms seen     round many western islands have i been     which bards in fealty to apollo hold     oft of one wide expanse had i been told     that deepbrowed homer ruled as his demesne     yet did i never breathe its pure serene     till i heard chapman speak out loud and bold     then felt i like some watcher of the skies     when a new planet swims into his ken     or like stout cortez when with eagle eyes     he stared at the pacificand all his men     looked at each other with a wild surmise     silent upon a peak in darien  in this striking sonnet we have a suggestion of keatss high ideal and of his sadness because of his own ignorance when he published his first little volume of poems in 1817 he knew no greek yet greek literature absorbed and fascinated him as he saw its broken and imperfect reflection in an english translation like shakespeare who also was but poorly educated in the schools he had a marvelous faculty of discerning the real spirit of the classicsa faculty denied to many great scholars and to most of the classic writers of the preceding centuryand so he set himself to the task of reflecting in modern english the spirit of the old greeks  the imperfect results of this attempt are seen in his next volume endymion which is the story of a young shepherd beloved by a moon goddess the poem begins with the striking lines      a thing of beauty is a joy forever     its loveliness increases it will never     pass into nothingness but still will keep     a bower quiet for us and a sleep     full of sweet dreams and health and quiet breathing  which well illustrate the spirit of keatss later work with its perfect finish and melody it has many quotable lines and passages and its hymn to pan should be read in connection with wordsworths famous sonnet beginning the world is too much with us the poem gives splendid promise but as a whole it is rather chaotic with too much ornament and too little design like a modern house that keats felt this defect strongly is evident from his modest preface wherein he speaks of endymion not as a deed accomplished but only as an unsuccessful attempt to suggest the underlying beauty of greek mythology  keatss third and last volume lamia isabella the eve of st agnes and other poems 1820 is the one with which the reader should begin his acquaintance with this master of english verse it has only two subjects greek mythology and mediæval romance hyperion is a magnificent fragment suggesting the first arch of a cathedral that was never finished its theme is the overthrow of the titans by the young sungod apollo realizing his own immaturity and lack of knowledge keats laid aside this work and only the pleadings of his publisher induced him to print the fragment with his completed poems  throughout this last volume and especially in hyperion the influence of milton is apparent while spenser is more frequently suggested in reading endymion  of the longer poems in the volume lamia is the most suggestive it is the story of a beautiful enchantress who turns from a serpent into a glorious woman and fills every human sense with delight until as a result of the foolish philosophy of old apollonius she vanishes forever from her lovers sight the eve of st agnes the most perfect of keatss mediæval poems is not a story after the manner of the metrical romances but rather a vivid painting of a romantic mood such as comes to all men at times to glorify a workaday world like all the work of keats and shelley it has an element of unreality and when we read at the end      and they are gone aye ages long ago     these lovers fled away into the storm  it is as if we were waking from a dreamwhich is the only possible ending to all of keatss greek and mediæval fancies we are to remember however that no beautiful thing though it be intangible as a dream can enter a mans life and leave him quite the same afterwards keatss own word is here suggestive the imagination he said may be likened to adams dream he awoke and found it true  it is by his short poems that keats is known to the majority of presentday readers among these exquisite shorter poems we mention only the four odes on a grecian urn to a nightingale to autumn and to psyche these are like an invitation to a feast one who reads them will hardly be satisfied until he knows more of such delightful poetry those who study only the ode to a nightingale may find four thingsa love of sensuous beauty a touch of pessimism a purely pagan conception of nature and a strong individualismwhich are characteristic of this last of the romantic poets  as wordsworths work is too often marred by the moralizer and byrons by the demagogue and shelleys by the reformer so keatss work suffers by the opposite extreme of aloofness from every human interest so much so that he is often accused of being indifferent to humanity his work is also criticised as being too effeminate for ordinary readers three things should be remembered in this connection first that keats sought to express beauty for its own sake that beauty is as essential to normal humanity as is government or law and that the higher man climbs in civilization the more imperative becomes his need of beauty as a reward for his labors second that keatss letters are as much an indication of the man as is his poetry and in his letters with their human sympathy their eager interest in social problems their humor and their keen insight into life there is no trace of effeminacy but rather every indication of a strong and noble manhood the third thing to remember is that all keatss work was done in three or four years with small preparation and that dying at twentyfive he left us a body of poetry which will always be one of our most cherished possessions he is often compared with the marvelous boy chatterton whom he greatly admired and to whose memory he dedicated his endymion but though both died young chatterton was but a child while keats was in all respects a man it is idle to prophesy what he might have done had he been granted a tennysons long life and scholarly training at twenty five his work was as mature as was tennysons at fifty though the maturity suggests the too rapid growth of a tropical plant which under the warm rains and the flood of sunlight leaps into life grows blooms in a day and dies  as we have stated keatss work was bitterly and unjustly condemned by the critics of his day he belonged to what was derisively called the cockney school of poetry of which leigh hunt was chief and proctor and beddoes were fellowworkmen not even from wordsworth and byron who were ready enough to recommend far less gifted writers did keats receive the slightest encouragement like young lochinvar he rode all unarmed and he rode all alone shelley with his sincerity and generosity was the first to recognize the young genius and in his noble adonaiswritten alas like most of our tributes when the subject of our praise is deadhe spoke the first true word of appreciation and placed keats where he unquestionably belongs among our greatest poets the fame denied him in his sad life was granted freely after his death most fitly does he close the list of poets of the romantic revival because in many respects he was the best workman of them all he seems to have studied words more carefully than did his contemporaries and so his poetic expression or the harmony of word and thought is generally more perfect than theirs more than any other he lived for poetry as the noblest of the arts more than any other he emphasized beauty because to him as shown by his grecian urn beauty and truth were one and inseparable and he enriched the whole romantic movement by adding to its interest in common life the spirit rather than the letter of the classics and of elizabethan poetry for these reasons keats is like spenser a poets poet his work profoundly influenced tennyson and indeed most of the poets of the present era   ii prose writers of the romantic period  aside from the splendid work of the novel writerswalter scott whom we have considered and jane austen to whom we shall presently returnthe early nineteenth century is remarkable for the development of a new and valuable type of critical prose writing if we except the isolated work of dryden and of addison it is safe to say that literary criticism in its modern sense was hardly known in england until about the year 1825 such criticism as existed seems to us now to have been largely the result of personal opinion or prejudice indeed we could hardly expect anything else before some systematic study of our literature as a whole had been attempted in one age a poem was called good or bad according as it followed or ran counter to socalled classic rules in another we have the dogmatism of dr johnson in a third the personal judgment of lockhart and the editors of the edinburgh review and the quarterly who so violently abused keats and the lake poets in the name of criticism early in the nineteenth century there arose a new school of criticism which was guided by knowledge of literature on the one hand and by what one might call the fear of god on the other the latter element showed itself in a profound human sympathythe essence of the romantic movementand its importance was summed up by de quincey when he said not to sympathize is not to understand these new critics with abundant reverence for past masters could still lay aside the dogmatism and prejudice which marked johnson and the magazine editors and read sympathetically the work of a new author with the sole idea of finding what he had contributed or tried to contribute to the magnificent total of our literature coleridge hunt hazlitt lamb and de quincey were the leaders in this new and immensely important development and we must not forget the importance of the new periodicals like the londen magazine founded in 1820 in which lamb de quincey and carlyle found their first real encouragement  of coleridges biographica literaria and his lectures on shakespeare we have already spoken leigh hunt 17841859 wrote continuously for more than thirty years as editor and essayist and his chief object seems to have been to make good literature known and appreciated william hazlitt 17781830 in a long series of lectures and essays treated all reading as a kind of romantic journey into new and pleasant countries to his work largely with that of lamb was due the new interest in elizabethan literature which so strongly influenced keatss last and best volume of poetry for those interested in the art of criticism and in the appreciation of literature both hunt and hazlitt will well repay study but we must pass over their work to consider the larger literary interest of lamb and de quincey who were not simply critics of other mens labor but who also produced some delightful work of their own which the world has carefully put away among the things worthy to be remembered   charles lamb 17751834  in lamb and wordsworth we have two widely different views of the romantic movement one shows the influence of nature and solitude the other of society lamb was a lifelong friend of coleridge and an admirer and defender of the poetic creed of wordsworth but while the latter lived apart from men content with nature and with reading an occasional moral lesson to society lamb was born and lived in the midst of the london streets the city crowd with its pleasures and occupations its endless little comedies and tragedies alone interested him according to his own account when he paused in the crowded street tears would spring to his eyestears of pure pleasure at the abundance of so much good life and when he wrote he simply interpreted that crowded human life of joy and sorrow as wordsworth interpreted the woods and waters without any desire to change or to reform them he has given us the best pictures we possess of coleridge hazlitt landor hood cowden clarke and many more of the interesting men and women of his age and it is due to his insight and sympathy that the life of those faroff days seems almost as real to us as if we ourselves remembered it of all our english essayists he is the most lovable partly because of his delicate oldfashioned style and humor but more because of that cheery and heroic struggle against misfortune which shines like a subdued light in all his writings  life in the very heart of london there is a curious oldfashioned place known as the templean enormous rambling apparently forgotten structure dusty and still in the midst of the endless roar of the city streets originally it was a chapter house of the knights templars and so suggests to us the spirit of the crusades and of the middle ages but now the building is given over almost entirely to the offices and lodgings of london lawyers it is this queer old place which more than all others is associated with the name of charles lamb i was born he says and passed the first seven years of my life in the temple its gardens its halls its fountain its river these are my oldest recollections he was the son of a poor clerk or rather servant of one of the barristers and was the youngest of seven children only three of whom survived infancy of these three john the elder was apparently a selfish creature who took no part in the heroic struggle of his brother and sister at seven years charles was sent to the famous bluecoat charity school of christs hospital here he remained seven years and here he formed his lifelong friendship for another poor neglected boy whom the world remembers as coleridge230  when only fourteen years old lamb left the charity school and was soon at work as a clerk in the south sea house two years later he became a clerk in the famous india house where he worked steadily for thirtythree years with the exception of six weeks in the winter of 17951796 spent within the walls of an asylum in 1796 lambs sister mary who was as talented and remarkable as lamb himself went violently insane and killed her own mother for a long time after this appalling tragedy she was in an asylum at hoxton then lamb in 1797 brought her to his own little house and for the remainder of his life cared for her with a tenderness and devotion which furnishes one of the most beautiful pages in our literary history at times the malady would return to mary giving sure warning of its terrible approach and then brother and sister might be seen walking silently hand in hand to the gates of the asylum their cheeks wet with tears one must remember this as well as lambs humble lodgings and the drudgery of his daily work in thebig commercial house if he would appreciate the pathos of the old familiar faces or the heroism which shines through the most human and the most delightful essays in our language  when lamb was fifty years of age the east india company led partly by his literary fame following his first essays of elia and partly by his thirtythree years of faithful service granted him a comfortable pension and happy as a boy turned loose from school he left india house forever to give himself up to literary work231 he wrote to wordsworth in april 1825 i came home forever on tuesday of last weekit was like passing from life into eternity curiously enough lamb seems to lose power after his release from drudgery and his last essays published in 1833 lack something of the grace and charm of his earlier work he died at edmonton in 1834 and his gifted sister mary sank rapidly into the gulf from which his strength and gentleness had so long held her back no literary man was ever more loved and honored by a rare circle of friends and all who knew him bear witness to the simplicity and goodness which any reader may find for himself between the lines of his essays  works the works of lamb divide themselves naturally into three periods first there are his early literary efforts including the poems signed c l in coleridges poems on various subjects 1796 his romance rosamund gray 1798 his poetical drama john woodvil 1802 and various other immature works in prose and poetry this period comes to an end in 1803 when he gave up his newspaper work especially the contribution of six jokes puns and squibs daily to the morning post at sixpence apiece the second period was given largely to literary criticism and the tales from shakespeare 1807written by charles and mary lamb the former reproducing the tragedies and the latter the comediesmay be regarded as his first successful literary venture the book was written primarily for children but so thoroughly had brother and sister steeped themselves in the literature of the elizabethan period that young and old alike were delighted with this new version of shakespeares stories and the tales are still regarded as the best of their kind in our literature in 1808 appeared his specimens of english dramatic poets contemporary with shakespeare this carried out the splendid critical work of coleridge and was the most noticeable influence in developing the poetic qualities of keats as shown in his last volume  the third period includes lambs criticisms of life which are gathered together in his essays of elia 1823 and his last essays of elia which were published ten years later these famous essays began in 1820 with the appearance of the new london magazine232 and were continued for many years such subjects as the dissertation on roast pig old china praise of chimney sweepers imperfect sympathies a chapter on ears mrs battles opinions on whist mackery end grace before meat dream children and many others being chosen apparently at random but all leading to a delightful interpretation of the life of london as it appeared to a quiet little man who walked unnoticed through its crowded streets in the first and last essays which we have mentioned dissertation on roast pig and dream children we have the extremes of lambs humor and pathos  the style of all these essays is gentle oldfashioned irresistibly attractive lamb was especially fond of old writers and borrowed unconsciously from the style of burtons anatomy of melancholy and from brownes religio medici and from the early english dramatists but this style had become a part of lamb by long reading and he was apparently unable to express his new thought without using their old quaint expressions though these essays are all criticisms or appreciations of the life of his age they are all intensely personal in other words they are an excellent picture of lamb and of humanity without a trace of vanity or selfassertion lamb begins with himself with some purely personal mood or experience and from this he leads the reader to see life and literature as he saw it it is this wonderful combination of personal and universal interests together with lambs rare old style and quaint humor which make the essays remarkable they continue the best tradition of addison and steele our first great essayists but their sympathies are broader and deeper and their humor more delicious than any which preceded them   thomas de quincy 17851859  in de quincey the romantic element is even more strongly developed than in lamb not only in his critical work but also in his erratic and imaginative life he was profoundly educated even more so than coleridge and was one of the keenest intellects of the age yet his wonderful intellect seems always subordinate to his passion for dreaming like lamb he was a friend and associate of the lake poets making his headquarters in wordsworths old cottage at grasmere for nearly twenty years here the resemblance ceases and a marked contrast begins as a man lamb is the most human and lovable of all our essayists while de quincey is the most uncanny and incomprehensible lambs modest works breathe the two essential qualities of sympathy and humor the greater number of de quinceys essays while possessing more or less of both these qualities are characterized chiefly by their brilliant style life as seen through de quinceys eyes is nebulous and chaotic and there is a suspicion of the fabulous in all that he wrote even in the revolt of the tartars the romantic element is uppermost and in much of de quinceys prose the element of unreality is more noticeable than in shelleys poetry of his subjectmatter his facts ideas and criticisms we are generally suspicious but of his style sometimes stately and sometimes headlong now gorgeous as an oriental dream now musical as keatss endymion and always even in the most violent contrasts showing a harmony between the idea and the expression such as no other english writer with the possible exception of newman has ever rivaledsay what you will of the marvelous brilliancy of de quinceys style you have still only half expressed the truth it is the style alone which makes these essays immortal  life de quincey was born in manchester in 1785 in neither his father who was a prosperous merchant nor his mother who was a quiet unsympathetic woman do we see any suggestion of the sons almost uncanny genius as a child he was given to dreams more vivid and intense but less beautiful than those of the young blake to whom he bears a strong resemblance in the grammar school at bath he displayed astonishing ability and acquired greek and latin with a rapidity that frightened his slow tutors at fifteen he not only read greek but spoke it fluently and one of his astounded teachers remarked that boy could harangue an athenian mob better than you or i could address an english one from the grammar school at manchester whither he was sent in 1800 he soon ran away finding the instruction far below his abilities and the rough life absolutely intolerable to his sensitive nature an uncle just home from india interceded for the boy lest he be sent back to the school which he hated and with an allowance of a guinea a week he started a career of vagrancy much like that of goldsmith living on the open hills in the huts of shepherds and charcoal burners in the tents of gypsies wherever fancy led him his fear of the manchester school finally led him to run away to london where without money or friends his life was even more extraordinary than his gypsy wanderings the details of this vagrancy are best learned in his confessions of an english opiumeater where we meet not simply the facts of his life but also the confusion of dreams and fancies in the midst of which he wandered like a man lost on the mountains with storm clouds under his feet hiding the familiar earth after a year of vagrancy and starvation he was found by his family and allowed to go to oxford where his career was marked by the most brilliant and erratic scholarship when ready for a degree in 1807 he passed his written tests successfully but felt a sudden terror at the thought of the oral examination and disappeared from the university never to return  it was in oxford that de quincey began the use of opium to relieve the pains of neuralgia and the habit increased until he was an almost hopeless slave to the drug only his extraordinary will power enabled him to break away from the habit after some thirty years of misery some peculiarity of his delicate constitution enabled de quincey to take enormous quantities of opium enough to kill several ordinary men and it was largely opium working upon a sensitive imagination which produced his gorgeous dreams broken by intervals of weakness and profound depression for twenty years he resided at grasmere in the companionship of the lake poets and here led by the loss of his small fortune he began to write with the idea of supporting his family in 1821 he published his first famous work the confessions of an english opiumeater and for nearly forty years afterwards he wrote industriously contributing to various magazines an astonishing number of essays on a great variety of subjects without thought of literary fame he contributed these articles anonymously but fortunately in 1853 he began to collect his own works and the last of fourteen volumes was published just after his death  in 1830 led by his connection with blackwoods magazine to which he was the chief contributor de quincey removed with his family to edinburgh where his erratic genius and his singularly childlike ways produced enough amusing anecdotes to fill a volume he would take a room in some place unknown to his friends and family would live in it for a few years until he had filled it even to the bath tub with books and with his own chaotic manuscripts allowing no one to enter or disturb his den and then when the place became too crowded he would lock the door and go away and take another lodging where he repeated the same extraordinary performance he died in edinburgh in 1859 like lamb he was a small boyish figure gentle and elaborately courteous though excessively shy and escaping as often as possible to solitude he was nevertheless fond of society and his wide knowledge and vivid imagination made his conversations almost as prized as those of his friend coleridge  works de quinceys works may be divided into two general classes the first includes his numerous critical articles and the second his autobiographical sketches all his works it must be remembered were contributed to various magazines and were hastily collected just before his death hence the general impression of chaos which we get from reading them  from a literary view point the most illuminating of de quinceys critical works is his literary reminiscences this contains brilliant appreciations of wordsworth coleridge lamb shelley keats hazlitt and landor as well as some interesting studies of the literary figures of the age preceding among the best of his brilliant critical essays are on the knocking at the gate in macbeth 1823 which is admirably suited to show the mans critical genius and murder considered as one of the fine arts 1827 which reveals his grotesque humor other suggestive critical works if one must choose among such a multitude are his letters to a young man 1823 joan of arc 1847 the revolt of the tartars 1840 and the english mailcoach 1849 in the lastnamed essay the dream fugue is one of the most imaginative of all his curious works  of de quinceys autobiographical sketches the best known is his confessions of an english opiumeater 1821 this is only partly a record of opium dreams and its chief interest lies in glimpses it gives us of de quinceys own life and wanderings this should be followed by suspiria de profundis 1845 which is chiefly a record of gloomy and terrible dreams produced by opiates the most interesting parts of his suspiria showing de quinceys marvelous insight into dreams are those in which we are brought face to face with the strange feminine creations levana madonna our lady of sighs and our lady of darkness a series of nearly thirty articles which he collected in 1853 called autobiographic sketches completes the revelation of the authors own life among his miscellaneous works may be mentioned in order to show his wide range of subjects klosterheim a novel logic of political economy the essays on style and rhetoric philosophy of herodotus and his articles on goethe pope schiller and shakespeare which he contributed to the encyclopedia britannica  de quinceys style is a revelation of the beauty of the english language and it profoundly influenced ruskin and other prose writers of the victorian age it has two chief faultsdiffuseness which continually leads de quincey away from his object and triviality which often makes him halt in the midst of a marvelous paragraph to make some light jest or witticism that has some humor but no mirth in it notwithstanding these faults de quinceys prose is still among the few supreme examples of style in our language though he was profoundly influenced by the seventeenth century writers he attempted definitely to create a new style which should combine the best elements of prose and poetry in consequence his prose works are often like those of milton more imaginative and melodious than much of our poetry he has been well called the psychologist of style and as such his works will never be popular but to the few who can appreciate him he will always be an inspiration to better writing one has a deeper respect for our english language and literature after reading him  secondary writers of romanticism one has only to glance back over the authors we have been studyingwordsworth coleridge southey byron shelley keats scott lamb de quinceyto realize the great change which swept over the life and literature of england in a single half century under two influences which we now know as the french revolution in history and the romantic movement in literature in life men had rebelled against the too strict authority of state and society in literature they rebelled even more vigorously against the bonds of classicism which had sternly repressed a writers ambition to follow his own ideals and to express them in his own way naturally such an age of revolution was essentially poeticonly the elizabethan age surpasses it in this respectand it produced a large number of minor writers who followed more or less closely the example of its great leaders among novelists we have jane austen frances burney maria edgeworth jane porter and susan ferrierall women be it noted among the poets campbell moore hogg the ettrick shepherd mrs hemans heber keble hood and ingoldsby richard barham and among miscellaneous writers sidney smith christopher north john wilson chalmers lockhart leigh hunt hazlitt hallam and landor here is an astonishing variety of writers and to consider all their claims to remembrance would of itself require a volume though these are generally classed as secondary writers much of their work has claims to popularity and some of it to permanence moores irish melodies campbells lyrics kebles christian year and jane porters thaddeus of warsaw and scottish chiefs have still a multitude of readers where keats lamb and de quincey are prized only by the cultured few and hallams historical and critical works are perhaps better known than those of gibbon who nevertheless occupies a larger place in our literature among all these writers we choose only two jane austen and walter savage landor whose works indicate a period of transition from the romantic to the victorian age   jane austen 17751817  we have so lately rediscovered the charm and genius of this gifted young woman that she seems to be a novelist of yesterday rather than the contemporary of wordsworth and coleridge and few even of her readers realize that she did for the english novel precisely what the lake poets did for english poetryshe refined and simplified it making it a true reflection of english life like the lake poets she met with scanty encouragement in her own generation her greatest novel pride and prejudice was finished in 1797 a year before the appearance of the famous lyrical ballads of wordsworth and coleridge but while the latter book was published and found a few appreciative readers the manuscript of this wonderful novel went begging for sixteen years before it found a publisher as wordsworth began with the deliberate purpose of making poetry natural and truthful so miss austen appears to have begun writing with the idea of presenting the life of english country society exactly as it was in opposition to the romantic extravagance of mrs radcliffe and her school but there was this differencethat miss austen had in large measure the saving gift of humor which wordsworth sadly lacked maria edgeworth at the same time set a sane and excellent example in her tales of irish life the absentee and castle rackrent and miss austen followed up the advantage with at least six works which have grown steadily in value until we place them gladly in the first rank of our novels of common life it is not simply for her exquisite charm therefore that we admire her but also for her influence in bringing our novels back to their true place as an expression of human life it is due partly at least to her influence that a multitude of readers were ready to appreciate mrs gaskells cranford and the powerful and enduring work of george eliot  life jane austens life gives little opportunity for the biographer unless perchance he has something of her own power to show the beauty and charm of commonplace things she was the seventh child of rev george austen rector of steventon and was born in the parsonage of the village in 1775 with her sisters she was educated at home and passed her life very quietly cheerfully in the doing of small domestic duties to which love lent the magic lamp that makes all things beautiful she began to write at an early age and seems to have done her work on a little table in the family sitting room in the midst of the family life when a visitor entered she would throw a paper or a piece of sewing over her work and she modestly refused to be known as the author of novels which we now count among our treasured possessions with the publishers she had little success pride and prejudice went begging as we have said for sixteen years and northanger abbey 1798 was sold for a trivial sum to a publisher who laid it aside and forgot it until the appearance and moderate success of sense and sensibility in 1811 then after keeping the manuscript some fifteen years he sold it back to the family who found another publisher  an anonymous article in the quarterly review following the appearance of emma in 1815 full of generous appreciation of the charm of the new writer was the beginning of jane austens fame and it is only within a few years that we have learned that the friendly and discerning critic was walter scott he continued to be her admirer until her early death but these two the greatest writers of fiction in their age were never brought together both were homeloving people and miss austen especially was averse to publicity and popularity she died quietly as she had lived at winchester in 1817 and was buried in the cathedral she was a bright attractive little woman whose sunny qualities are unconsciously reflected in all her books  works very few english writers ever had so narrow a field of work as jane austen like the french novelists whose success seems to lie in choosing the tiny field that they know best her works have an exquisite perfection that is lacking in most of our writers of fiction with the exception of an occasional visit to the watering place of bath her whole life was spent in small country parishes whose simple country people became the characters of her novels her brothers were in the navy and so naval officers furnish the only exciting elements in her stories but even these alleged heroes lay aside their imposing martial ways and act like themselves and other people such was her literary field in which the chief duties were of the household the chief pleasures in country gatherings and the chief interests in matrimony life with its mighty interests its passions ambitions and tragic struggles swept by like a great river while the secluded interests of a country parish went round and round quietly like an eddy behind a sheltering rock we can easily understand therefore the limitations of jane austen but within her own field she is unequaled her characters are absolutely true to life and all her work has the perfection of a delicate miniature painting the most widely read of her novels is pride and prejudice but three others sense and sensibility emma and mansfield park have slowly won their way to the front rank of fiction from a literary view point northanger abbey is perhaps the best for in it we find that touch of humor and delicate satire with which this gentle little woman combated the grotesque popular novels of the udolpho type reading any of these works one is inclined to accept the hearty indorsement of sir walter scott that young lady has a talent for describing the involvements and feelings and characters of ordinary life which is to me the most wonderful i ever met with the big bowwow strain i can do myself like any now going but the exquisite touch which renders ordinary commonplace things and characters interesting from the truth of the description and the sentiment is denied to me what a pity such a gifted creature died so early   walter savage landor 17751864  while hazlitt lamb de quincey and other romantic critics went back to early english literature for their inspiration landor shows a reaction from the prevailing romanticism by his imitation of the ancient classic writers his life was an extraordinary one and like his work abounded in sharp contrasts on the one hand there are his egoism his unncontrollable anger his perpetual lawsuits and the last sad tragedy with his children which suggests king lear and his daughters on the other hand there is his steady devotion to the classics and to the cultivation of the deep wisdom of the ancients which suggests pindar and cicero in his works we find the wild extravagance of gebir followed by the superb classic style and charm of pericles and aspasia such was landor a man of high ideals perpetually at war with himself and the world  life landers stormy life covers the whole period from wordsworths childhood to the middle of the victorian era he was the son of a physician and was born at warwick in 1775 from his mother he inherited a fortune but it was soon scattered by large expenditures and law quarrels and in his old age refused help by his own children only brownings generosity kept landor from actual want at rugby and at oxford his extreme republicanism brought him into constant trouble and his fitting out a band of volunteers to assist the spaniards against napoleon in 1808 allies him with byron and his quixotic followers the resemblance to byron is even more strikingly shown in the poem gebir published in 1798 a year made famous by the lyrical ballads of wordsworth and coleridge  a remarkable change in landers life is noticeable in 1821 when at fortysix years of age after having lost his magnificent estate of llanthony abbey in glamorganshire and after a stormy experience in como he settled down for a time at fiesole near florence to this period of calm after storm we owe the classical prose works for which he is famous the calm like that at the center of a whirlwind lasted but a short time and landor leaving his family in great anger returned to bath where he lived alone for more than twenty years then in order to escape a libel suit the choleric old man fled back to italy he died at florence in 1864 the spirit of his whole life may be inferred from the defiant farewell which he flung to it      i strove with none for none was worth my strife        nature i loved and next to nature art     i warmed both hands before the fire of life        it sinks and i am ready to depart  works landors reaction from romanticism is all the more remarkable in view of his early efforts such as gebir a wildly romantic poem which rivals any work of byron or shelley in its extravagance notwithstanding its occasional beautiful and suggestive lines the work was not and never has been successful and the same may be said of all his poetical works his first collection of poems was published in 1795 his last a full half century later in 1846 in the latter volume the hellenicswhich included some translations of his earlier latin poems called idyllia heroicaone has only to read the hamadryad and compare it with the lyrics of the first volume in order to realize the astonishing literary vigor of a man who published two volumes a half century apart without any appreciable diminution of poetical feeling in all these poems one is impressed by the striking and original figures of speech which landor uses to emphasize his meaning  it is by his prose works largely that landor has won a place in our literature partly because of their intrinsic worth their penetrating thought and severe classic style and partly because of their profound influence upon the writers of the present age the most noted of his prose works are his six volumes of imaginary conversations 18241846 for these conversations landor brings together sometimes in groups sometimes in couples wellknown characters or rather shadows from the four corners of the earth and from the remotest ages of recorded history thus diogenes talks with plato Æsop with a young slave girl in egypt henry viii with anne boleyn in prison dante with beatrice leofric with lady godivaall these and many others from epictetus to cromwell are brought together and speak of life and love and death each from his own view point occasionally as in the meeting of henry and anne boleyn the situation is tense and dramatic but as a rule the characters simply meet and converse in the same quiet strain which becomes after much reading somewhat monotonous on the other hand one who reads the imaginary conversations is lifted at once into a calm and noble atmosphere which braces and inspires him making him forget petty things like a view from a hilltop by its combination of lofty thought and severely classic style the book has won and deserves a very high place among our literary records  the same criticism applies to pericles and aspasia which is a series of imaginary letters telling the experiences of aspasia a young lady from asia minor who visits athens at the summit of its fame and glory in the great age of pericles this is in our judgment the best worth reading of all landors works one gets from it not only landors classic style butwhat is well worth whilea better picture of greece in the days of its greatness than can be obtained from many historical volumes   summary of the age of romanticism this period extends from the war with the colonies following the declaration of independence in 1776 to the accession of victoria in 1837 both limits being very indefinite as will be seen by a glance at the chronology following during the first part of the period especially england was in a continual turmoil produced by political and economic agitation at home and by the long wars that covered two continents and the wide sea between them the mighty changes resulting from these two causes have given this period the name of the age of revolution the storm center of all the turmoil at home and abroad was the french revolution which had a profound influence on the life and literature of all europe on the continent the overthrow of napoleon at waterloo 1815 apparently checked the progress of liberty which had started with the french revolution233 but in england the case was reversed the agitation for popular liberty which at one time threatened a revolution went steadily forward till it resulted in the final triumph of democracy in the reform bill of 1832 and in a number of exceedingly important reforms such as the extension of manhood suffrage the removal of the last unjust restrictions against catholics the establishment of a national system of schools followed by a rapid increase in popular education and the abolition of slavery in all english colonies 1833 to this we must add the changes produced by the discovery of steam and the invention of machinery which rapidly changed england from an agricultural to a manufacturing nation introduced the factory system and caused this period to be known as the age of industrial revolution  the literature of the age is largely poetical in form and almost entirely romantic in spirit for as we have noted the triumph of democracy in government is generally accompanied by the triumph of romanticism in literature at first the literature as shown especially in the early work of wordsworth byron and shelley reflected the turmoil of the age and the wild hopes of an ideal democracy occasioned by the french revolution later the extravagant enthusiasm subsided and english writers produced so much excellent literature that the age is often called the second creative period the first being the age of elizabeth the six chief characteristics of the age are the prevalence of romantic poetry the creation of the historical novel by scott the first appearance of women novelists such as mrs anne radcliffe jane porter maria edgeworth and jane austen the development of literary criticism in the work of lamb de quincey coleridge and hazlitt the practical and economic bent of philosophy as shown in the work of malthus james mill and adam smith and the establishment of great literary magazines like the edinburgh review the quarterly blackwoods and the athenaeum  in our study we have noted 1 the poets of romanticism the importance of the lyrical ballads of 1798 the life and work of wordsworth coleridge scott byron shelley and keats 2 the prose writers the novels of scott the development of literary criticism the life and work of the essayists

victorian age 18501900  the modern period of progress and unrest  when victoria became queen in 1837 english literature seemed to have entered upon a period of lean years in marked contrast with the poetic fruitfulness of the romantic age which we have just studied coleridge shelley keats byron and scott had passed away and it seemed as if there were no writers in england to fill their places wordsworth had written in 1835      like clouds that rake the mountain summits       or waves that own no curbing hand     how fast has brother followed brother       from sunshine to the sunless land  in these lines is reflected the sorrowful spirit of a literary man of the early nineteenth century who remembered the glory that had passed away from the earth but the leanness of these first years is more apparent than real keats and shelley were dead it is true but already there had appeared three disciples of these poets who were destined to be far more widely read than were their masters tennyson had been publishing poetry since 1827 his first poems appearing almost simultaneously with the last work of byron shelley and keats but it was not until 1842 with the publication of his collected poems in two volumes that england recognized in him one of her great literary leaders so also elizabeth barrett had been writing since 1820 but not till twenty years later did her poems become deservedly popular and browning had published his pauline in 1833 but it was not until 1846 when he published the last of the series called bells and pomegranates that the reading public began to appreciate his power and originality moreover even as romanticism seemed passing away a group of great prose writersdickens thackeray carlyle and ruskinhad already begun to proclaim the literary glory of a new age which now seems to rank only just below the elizabethan and the romantic periods  historical summary amid the multitude of social and political forces of this great age four things stand out clearly first the long struggle of the anglosaxons for personal liberty is definitely settled and democracy becomes the established order of the day the king who appeared in an age of popular weakness and ignorance and the peers who came with the normans in triumph are both stripped of their power and left as figureheads of a past civilization the last vestige of personal government and of the divine right of rulers disappears the house of commons becomes the ruling power in england and a series of new reform bills rapidly extend the suffrage until the whole body of english people choose for themselves the men who shall represent them  second because it is an age of democracy it is an age of popular education of religious tolerance of growing brotherhood and of profound social unrest the slaves had been freed in 1833 but in the middle of the century england awoke to the fact that slaves are not necessarily negroes stolen in africa to be sold like cattle in the market place but that multitudes of men women and little children in the mines and factories were victims of a more terrible industrial and social slavery to free these slaves also the unwilling victims of our unnatural competitive methods has been the growing purpose of the victorian age until the present day  third because it is an age of democracy and education it is an age of comparative peace england begins to think less of the pomp and false glitter of fighting and more of its moral evils as the nation realizes that it is the common people who bear the burden and the sorrow and the poverty of war while the privileged classes reap most of the financial and political rewards moreover with the growth of trade and of friendly foreign relations it becomes evident that the social equality for which england was contending at home belongs to the whole race of men that brotherhood is universal not insular that a question of justice is never settled by fighting and that war is generally unmitigated horror and barbarism tennyson who came of age when the great reform bill occupied attention expresses the ideals of the liberals of his day who proposed to spread the gospel of peace      till the wardrum throbbd no longer and the battleflags were furled     in the parliament of man the federation of the world  fourth the victorian age is especially remarkable because of its rapid progress in all the arts and sciences and in mechanical inventions a glance at any record of the industrial achievements of the nineteenth century will show how vast they are and it is unnecessary to repeat here the list of the inventions from spinning looms to steamboats and from matches to electric lights all these material things as well as the growth of education have their influence upon the life of a people and it is inevitable that they should react upon its prose and poetry though as yet we are too much absorbed in our sciences and mechanics to determine accurately their influence upon literature when these new things shall by long use have became familiar as country roads or have been replaced by newer and better things then they also will have their associations and memories and a poem on the railroads may be as suggestive as wordsworths sonnet on westminster bridge and the busy practical workingmen who today throng our streets and factories may seem to a future and greater age as quaint and poetical as to us seem the slow toilers of the middle ages  literary characteristics when one is interested enough to trace the genealogy of victoria he finds to his surprise that in her veins flowed the blood both of william the conqueror and of cerdic the first saxon king of england and this seems to be symbolic of the literature of her age which embraces the whole realm of saxon and norman lifethe strength and ideals of the one and the culture and refinement of the other the romantic revival had done its work and england entered upon a new free period in which every form of literature from pure romance to gross realism struggled for expression at this day it is obviously impossible to judge the age as a whole but we are getting far enough away from the early half of it to notice certain definite characteristics first though the age produced many poets and two who deserve to rank among the greatest nevertheless this is emphatically an age of prose and since the number of readers has increased a thousandfold with the spread of popular education it is the age of the newspaper the magazine and the modern novelthe first two being the story of the worlds daily life and the last our pleasantest form of literary entertainment as well as our most successful method of presenting modern problems and modern ideals the novel in this age fills a place which the drama held in the days of elizabeth and never before in any age or language has the novel appeared in such numbers and in such perfection  moral purpose the second marked characteristic of the age is that literature both in prose and in poetry seems to depart from the purely artistic standard of art for arts sake and to be actuated by a definite moral purpose tennyson browning carlyle ruskinwho and what were these men if not the teachers of england not vaguely but definitely with superb faith in their message and with the conscious moral purpose to uplift and to instruct even the novel breaks away from scotts romantic influence and first studies life as it is and then points out what life may and ought to be whether we read the fun and sentiment of dickens the social miniatures of thackeray or the psychological studies of george eliot we find in almost every case a definite purpose to sweep away error and to reveal the underlying truth of human life so the novel sought to do for society in this age precisely what lyell and darwin sought to do for science that is to find the truth and to show how it might be used to uplift humanity perhaps for this reason the victorian age is emphatically an age of realism rather than of romancenot the realism of zola and ibsen but a deeper realism which strives to tell the whole truth showing moral and physical diseases as they are but holding up health and hope as the normal conditions of humanity  it is somewhat customary to speak of this age as an age of doubt and pessimism following the new conception of man and of the universe which was formulated by science under the name of involution it is spoken of also as a prosaic age lacking in great ideals both these criticisms seem to be the result of judging a large thing when we are too close to it to get its true proportions just as cologne cathedral one of the worlds most perfect structures seems to be a shapeless pile of stone when we stand too close beneath its mighty walls and buttresses tennysons immature work like that of the minor poets is sometimes in a doubtful or despairing strain but his in memoriam is like the rainbow after storm and browning seems better to express the spirit of his age in the strong manly faith of rabbi ben ezra and in the courageous optimism of all his poetry stedmans victorian anthology is on the whole a most inspiring book of poetry it would be hard to collect more varied cheer from any age and the great essayists like macaulay carlyle ruskin and the great novelists like dickens thackeray george eliot generally leave us with a larger charity and with a deeper faith in our humanity  so also the judgment that this age is too practical for great ideals may be only a description of the husk that hides a very full ear of corn it is well to remember that spenser and sidney judged their own age which we now consider to be the greatest in our literary history to be altogether given over to materialism and to be incapable of literary greatness just as time has made us smile at their blindness so the next century may correct our judgment of this as a material age and looking upon the enormous growth of charity and brotherhood among us and at the literature which expresses our faith in men may judge the victorian age to be on the whole the noblest and most inspiring in the history of the world   i the poets of the victorian age  alfred tennyson 18091892      o young mariner     you from the haven     under the seacliff     you that are watching     the gray magician     with eyes of wonder     i am merlin     and i am dying     i am merlin     who follow the gleam                        o young mariner     down to the haven     call your companions     launch your vessel     and crowd your canvas     and ere it vanishes     over the margin     after it follow it     follow the gleam  one who reads this haunting poem of merlin and the gleam finds in it a suggestion of the spirit of the poets whole lifehis devotion to the ideal as expressed in poetry his early romantic impressions his struggles doubts triumphs and his thrilling message to his race throughout the entire victorian period tennyson stood at the summit of poetry in england not in vain was he appointed laureate at the death of wordsworth in 1850 for almost alone among those who have held the office he felt the importance of his place and filled and honored it for nearly half a century tennyson was not only a man and a poet he was a voice the voice of a whole people expressing in exquisite melody their doubts and their faith their griefs and their triumphs in the wonderful variety of his verse he suggests all the qualities of englands greatest poets the dreaminess of spenser the majesty of milton the natural simplicity of wordsworth the fantasy of blake and coleridge the melody of keats and shelley the narrative vigor of scott and byronall these striking qualities are evident on successive pages of tennysons poetry the only thing lacking is the dramatic power of the elizabethans in reflecting the restless spirit of this progressive age tennyson is as remarkable as pope was in voicing the artificiality of the early eighteenth century as a poet therefore who expresses not so much a personal as a national spirit he is probably the most representative literary man of the victorian era  life tennysons life is a remarkable one in this respect that from beginning to end he seems to have been dominated by a single impulse the impulse of poetry he had no large or remarkable experiences no wild oats to sow no great successes or reverses no business cares or public offices for sixtysix years from the appearance of the poems by two brothers in 1827 until his death in 1892 he studied and practiced his art continually and exclusively only browning his fellowworker resembles him in this but the differences in the two men are worldwide tennyson was naturally shy retiring indifferent to men hating noise and publicity loving to be alone with nature like wordsworth browning was sociable delighting in applause in society in travel in the noise and bustle of the big world  tennyson was born in the rectory of somersby lincolnshire in 1809 the sweet influences of his early natural surroundings can be better understood from his early poems than from any biography he was one of the twelve children of the rev george clayton tennyson a scholarly clergyman and his wife elizabeth fytche a gentle lovable woman not learned save in gracious household ways to whom the poet pays a sons loyal tribute near the close of the princess it is interesting to note that most of these children were poetically inclined and that two of the brothers charles and frederick gave far greater promise than did alfred  when seven years old the boy went to his grandmothers house at louth in order to attend a famous grammar school at that place not even a mans memory which generally makes light of hardship and glorifies early experiences could ever soften tennysons hatred of school life his complaint was not so much at the roughness of the boys which had so frightened cowper as at the brutality of the teachers who put over the school door a wretched latin inscription translating solomons barbarous advice about the rod and the child in these psychologic days when the child is more important than the curriculum and when we teach girls and boys rather than latin and arithmetic we read with wonder carlyles description of his own schoolmaster evidently a type of his kind who knew of the human soul thus much that it had a faculty called memory and could be acted on through the muscular integument by appliance of birch rods after four years of most unsatisfactory school life tennyson returned home and was fitted for the university by his scholarly father with his brothers he wrote many verses and his first efforts appeared in a little volume called poems by two brothers in 1827 the next year he entered trinity college cambridge where he became the center of a brilliant circle of friends chief of whom was the young poet arthur henry hallam  at the university tennyson soon became known for his poetical ability and two years after his entrance he gained the prize of the chancellors medal for a poem called timbuctoo the subject needless to say being chosen by the chancellor soon after winning this honor tennyson published his first signed work called poems chiefly lyrical 1830 which though it seems somewhat crude and disappointing to us now nevertheless contained the germ of all his later poetry one of the most noticeable things in this volume is the influence which byron evidently exerted over the poet in his early days and it was perhaps due largely to the same romantic influence that tennyson and his friend hallam presently sailed away to spain with the idea of joining the army of insurgents against king ferdinand considered purely as a revolutionary venture this was something of a fiasco suggesting the noble duke of york and his ten thousand menhe marched them up a hill one day and he marched them down again from a literary view point however the experience was not without its value the deep impression which the wild beauty of the pyrenees made upon the young poets mind is reflected clearly in the poem oenone  in 1831 tennyson left the university without taking his degree the reasons for this step are not clear but the family was poor and poverty may have played a large part in his determination his father died a few months later but by a generous arrangement with the new rector the family retained the rectory at somersby and here for nearly six years tennyson lived in a retirement which strongly suggests milton at horton he read and studied widely cultivated an intimate acquaintance with nature thought deeply on the problems suggested by the reform bill which was then agitating england and during his leisure hours wrote poetry the first fruits of this retirement appeared late in 1832 in a wonderful little volume bearing the simple name poems as the work of a youth only twentythree this book is remarkable for the variety and melody of its verse among its treasures we still read with delight the lotos eaters palace of art a dream of fair women the millers daughter oenone and the lady of shalott but the critics of the quarterly who had brutally condemned his earlier work were again unmercifully severe the effect of this harsh criticism upon a sensitive nature was most unfortunate and when his friend hallam died in 1833 tennyson was plunged into a period of gloom and sorrow the sorrow may be read in the exquisite little poem beginning break break break on thy cold gray stones o sea which was his first published elegy for his friend and the depressing influence of the harsh and unjust criticism is suggested in merlin and the gleam which the reader will understand only after he has read tennysons biography  for nearly ten years after hallams death tennyson published nothing and his movements are hard to trace as the family went here and there seeking peace and a home in various parts of england but though silent he continued to write poetry and it was in these sad wandering days that he began his immortal in memoriam and his idylls of the king in 1842 his friends persuaded him to give his work to the world and with some hesitation he published his poems the success of this work was almost instantaneous and we can appreciate the favor with which it was received when we read the noble blank verse of ulysses and morte darthur the perfect little song of grief for hallam which we have already mentioned and the exquisite idyls like dora and the gardeners daughter which aroused even wordsworths enthusiasm and brought from him a letter saying that he had been trying all his life to write such an english pastoral as dora and had failed from this time forward tennyson with increasing confidence in himself and his message steadily maintained his place as the best known and best loved poet in england  the year 1850 was a happy one for tennyson he was appointed poet laureate to succeed wordsworth and he married emily sellwood      her whose gentle will has changed my fate       and made my life a perfumed altar flame  whom he had loved for thirteen years but whom his poverty had prevented him from marrying the year is made further remarkable by the publication of in memoriam probably the most enduring of his poems upon which he had worked at intervals for sixteen years three years later with the money that his work now brought him he leased the house farringford in the isle of wight and settled in the first permanent home he had known since he left the rectory at somersby  for the remaining forty years of his life he lived like wordsworth in the stillness of a great peace writing steadily and enjoying the friendship of a large number of people some distinguished some obscure from the kindly and sympathetic victoria to the servants on his own farm all of these he called with equal sincerity his friends and to each one he was the same man simple strong kindly and noble carlyle describes him as a fine largefeatured dimeyed bronzecolored shaggyheaded man  most restful brotherly solidhearted loving solitude and hating publicity as he did the numerous tourists from both sides of the ocean who sought him out in his retreat and insisted upon seeing him made his life at times intolerable influenced partly by the desire to escape such popularity he bought land and built for himself a new house aldworth in surrey though he made his home in farringford for the greater part of the year  his labor during these years and his marvelous freshness and youthfulness of feeling are best understood by a glance at the contents of his complete works inferior poems like the princess which was written in the first flush of his success and his dramas which were written against the advice of his best friends may easily be criticised but the bulk of his verse shows an astonishing originality and vigor to the very end he died very quietly at aldworth with his family about him in the moonlight and beside him a volume of shakespeare open at the dirge in cymbeline      fear no more the heat o the sun       nor the furious winters rages     thou thy worldly task hast done       home art gone and taen thy wages  the strong and noble spirit of his life is reflected in one of his best known poems crossing the bar which was written in his eightyfirst year and which he desired should be placed at the end of his collected works      sunset and evening star       and one clear call for me     and may there be no moaning of the bar       when i put out to sea     but such a tide as moving seems asleep       too full for sound and foam     when that which drew from out the boundless deep       turns again home

far     i hope to see my pilot face to face       when i have crost the bar  works at the outset of our study of tennysons works it may be well to record two things by way of suggestion first tennysons poetry is not so much to be studied as to be read and appreciated he is a poet to have open on ones table and to enjoy as one enjoys his daily exercise and second we should by all means begin to get acquainted with tennyson in the days of our youth unlike browning who is generally appreciated by more mature minds tennyson is for enjoyment for inspiration rather than for instruction only youth can fully appreciate him and youth unfortunately except in a few rare beautiful cases is something which does not dwell with us long after our school days the secret of poetry especially of tennysons poetry is to be eternally young and like adam in paradise to find every morning a new world fresh wonderful inspiring as if just from the hands of god  except by the student eager to understand the whoje range of poetry in this age tennysons earlier poems and his later dramas may well be omitted opinions vary about both but the general judgment seems to be that the earlier poems show too much of byrons influence and their crudeness suffers by comparison with the exquisitely finished work of tennysons middle life of dramatic works he wrote seven his great ambition being to present a large part of the history of england in a series of dramas becket was one of the best of these works and met with considerable favor on the stage but like all the others it indicates that tennyson lacked the dramatic power and the humor necessary for a successful playwright  among the remaining poems there is such a wide variety that every reader must be left largely to follow his own delightful choice235 of the poems of 1842 we have already mentioned those best worth reading the princess a medley 1847 a long poem of over three thousand lines of blank verse is tennysons answer to the question of womans rights and womans sphere which was then as in our own day strongly agitating the public mind in this poem a baby finally solves the problem which philosophers have pondered ever since men began to think connectedly about human society a few exquisite songs like tears idle tears bugle song and sweet and low form the most delightful part of this poem which in general is hardly up to the standard of the poets later work maud 1855 is what is called in literature a monodrama telling the story of a lover who passes from morbidness to ecstasy then to anger and murder followed by insanity and recovery this was tennysons favorite and among his friends he read aloud from it more than from any other poem perhaps if we could hear tennyson read it we should appreciate it better but on the whole it seems overwrought and melodramatic even its lyrics like come into the garden maud which make this work a favorite with young lovers are characterized by prettiness rather than by beauty or strength  perhaps the most loved of all tennysons works is in memoriam which on account of both its theme and its exquisite workmanship is one of the few immortal names that were not born to die the immediate occasion of this remarkable poem was tennysons profound personal grief at the death of his friend hallam as he wrote lyric after lyric inspired by this sad subject the poets grief became less personal and the greater grief of humanity mourning for its dead and questioning its immortality took possession of him gradually the poem became an expression first of universal doubt and then of universal faith a faith which rests ultimately not on reason or philosophy but on the souls instinct for immortality the immortality of human love is the theme of the poem which is made up of over one hundred different lyrics the movement takes us through three years rising slowly from poignant sorrow and doubt to a calm peace and hope and ending with a noble hymn of courage and faitha modest courage and a humble faith loveinspiredwhich will be a favorite as long as saddened men turn to literature for consolation though darwins greatest books had not yet been written science had already overturned many old conceptions of life and tennyson who lived apart and thought deeply on all the problems of his day gave this poem to the world as his own answer to the doubts and questionings of men this universal human interest together with its exquisite form and melody makes the poem in popular favor at least the supreme threnody or elegiac poem of our literature though miltons lycidas is from the critical view point undoubtedly a more artistic work  the idylls of the king ranks among the greatest of tennysons later works its general subject is the celtic legends of king arthur and his knights of the round table and the chief source of its material is malorys morte darthur here in this mass of beautiful legends is certainly the subject of a great national epic yet after four hundred years during which many poets have used the material the great epic is still unwritten milton and spenser as we have already noted considered this material carefully and milton alone of all english writers had perhaps the power to use it in a great epic tennyson began to use these legends in his morte darthur 1842 but the epic idea probably occurred to him later in 1856 when he began geraint and enid and he added the stories of vivien elaine guinevere and other heroes and heroines at intervals until balin the last of the idylls appeared in 1885 later these works were gathered together and arranged with an attempt at unity the result is in no sense an epic poem but rather a series of single poems loosely connected by a thread of interest in arthur the central personage and in his unsuccessful attempt to found an ideal kingdom  entirely different in spirit is another collection of poems called english idyls236 which began in the poems of 1842 and which tennyson intended should reflect the ideals of widely different types of english life of these varied poems dora the gardeners daughter ulysses locksley hall and sir galahad are the best but all are worthy of study one of the most famous of this series is enoch arden 1864 in which tennyson turns from mediæval knights from lords heroes and fair ladies to find the material for true poetry among the lowly people that make up the bulk of english life its rare melody its sympathy for common life and its revelation of the beauty and heroism which hide in humble men and women everywhere made this work an instant favorite judged by its sales alone it was the most popular of his works during the poets lifetime  tennysons later volumes like the ballads 1880 and demeter 1889 should not be overlooked since they contain some of his best work the former contains stirring war songs like the defence of lucknow and pictures of wild passionate grief like rizpah the latter is notable for romneys remorse a wonderful piece of work merlin and the gleam which expresses the poets lifelong ideal and several exquisite little songs like the throstle and the oak which show how marvelously the aged poet retained his youthful freshness and inspiration here certainly is variety enough to give us long years of literary enjoyment and we need hardly mention miscellaneous poems like the brook and the charge of the light brigade which are known to every schoolboy and wages and the higher pantheism which should be read by every man who thinks about the old old problem of life and death  characteristics of tennysons poetry if we attempt to sum up the quality of tennyson as shown in all these works the task is a difficult one but three things stand out more or less plainly first tennyson is essentially the artist no other in his age studied the art of poetry so constantly or with such singleness of purpose and only swinburne rivals him in melody and the perfect finish of his verse second like all the great writers of his age he is emphatically a teacher often a leader in the preceding age as the result of the turmoil produced by the french revolution lawlessness was more or less common and individuality was the rule in literature tennysons theme so characteristic of his age is the reign of orderof law in the physical world producing evolution and of law in the spiritual world working out the perfect man in memoriam idylls of the king the princesshere are three widely different poems yet the theme of each so far as poetry is a kind of spiritual philosophy and weighs its words before it utters them is the orderly development of law in the natural and in the spiritual world  this certainly is a new doctrine in poetry but the message does not end here law implies a source a method an object tennyson after facing his doubts honestly and manfully finds law even in the sorrows and losses of humanity he gives this law an infinite and personal source and finds the supreme purpose of all law to be a revelation of divine love all earthly love therefore becomes an image of the heavenly what first perhaps attracted readers to tennyson as to shakespeare was the character of his womenpure gentle refined beings whom we must revere as our anglo saxon forefathers revered the women they loved like browning the poet had loved one good woman supremely and her love made clear the meaning of all life the message goes one step farther because law and love are in the world faith is the only reasonable attitude toward life and death even though we understand them not such in a few words seems to be tennysons whole message and philosophy  if we attempt now to fix tennysons permanent place in literature as the result of his life and work we must apply to him the same test that we applied to milton and wordsworth and indeed to all our great poets and ask with the german critics what new thing has he said to the world or even to his own country the answer is frankly that we do not yet know surely that we are still too near tennyson to judge him impersonally this much however is clear in a marvelously complex age and amid a hundred great men he was regarded as a leader for a full half century he was the voice of england loved and honored as a man and a poet not simply by a few discerning critics but by a whole people that do not easily give their allegiance to any one man and that for the present is tennysons sufficient eulogy   robert browning 18121889      how good is mans life the mere living how fit to employ     all the heart and the soul and the senses for ever in joy  in this new song of david from brownings saul we have a suggestion of the astonishing vigor and hope that characterize all the works of browning the one poet of the age who after thirty years of continuous work was finally recognized and placed beside tennyson and whom future ages may judge to be a greater poetperhaps even the greatest in our literature since shakespeare  the chief difficulty in reading browning is the obscurity of his style which the critics of half a century ago held up to ridicule their attitude towards the poets early work may be inferred from tennysons humorous criticism of sordello it may be remembered that the first line of this obscure poem is who will may hear sordellos story told and that the last line is who would has heard sordellos story told tennyson remarked that these were the only lines in the whole poem that he understood and that they were evidently both lies if we attempt to explain this obscurity which puzzled tennyson and many less friendly critics we find that it has many sources first the poets thought is often obscure or else so extremely subtle that language expresses it imperfectly      thoughts hardly to be packed     into a narrow act     fancies that broke through language and escaped  second browning is led from one thing to another by his own mental associations and forgets that the readers associations may be of an entirely different kind third browning is careless in his english and frequently clips his speech giving us a series of ejaculations as we do not quite understand his processes of thought we must stop between the ejaculations to trace out the connections fourth brownings allusions are often farfetched referring to some odd scrap of information which he has picked up in his wide reading and the ordinary reader finds it difficult to trace and understand them finally browning wrote too much and revised too little the time which he should have given to making one thought clear was used in expressing other thoughts that flitted through his head like a flock of swallows his field was the individual soul never exactly alike in any two men and he sought to express the hidden motives and principles which govern individual action in this field he is like a miner delving underground sending up masses of mingled earth and ore and the reader must sift all this material to separate the gold from the dross  here certainly are sufficient reasons for brownings obscurity and we must add the word that the fault seems unpardonable for the simple reason that browning shows himself capable at times of writing directly melodiously and with noble simplicity  so much for the faults which must be faced and overlooked before one finds the treasure that is hidden in brownings poetry of all the poets in our literature no other is so completely so consciously so magnificently a teacher of men he feels his mission of faith and courage in a world of doubt and timidity for thirty years he faced indifference or ridicule working bravely and cheerfully the while until he made the world recognize and follow him the spirit of his whole life is well expressed in his paracelsus written when he was only twentytwo years old      i see my way as birds their trackless way     i shall arrivewhat time what circuit first     i ask not but unless god send his hail     or blinding fireballs sleet or stifling snow     in some time his good time i shall arrive     he guides me and the bird in his good time  he is not like so many others an entertaining poet one cannot read him after dinner or when settled in a comfortable easychair one must sit up and think and be alert when he reads browning if we accept these conditions we shall probably find that browning is the most stimulating poet in our language his influence upon our life is positive and tremendous his strength his joy of life his robust faith and his invincible optimism enter into us making us different and better men after reading him and perhaps the best thing he can say of browning is that his thought is slowly but surely taking possession of all welleducated men and women  life brownings father was outwardly a business man a clerk for fifty years in the bank of england inwardly he was an interesting combination of the scholar and the artist with the best tastes of both his mother was a sensitive musical woman evidently very lovely in character the daughter of a german shipowner and merchant who had settled in scotland she was of celtic descent and carlyle describes her as the true type of a scottish gentlewoman from his neck down browning was the typical britonshort stocky largechested robust but even in the lifeless portrait his face changes as we view it from different angles now it is like an english business man now like a german scientist and now it has a curious suggestion of uncle remusthese being no doubt so many different reflections of his mixed and unremembered ancestors  he was born in camberwell on the outskirts of london in 1812 from his home and from his first school at peckham he could see london and the city lights by night and the smoky chimneys by day had the same powerful fascination for the child that the woods and fields and the beautiful country had for his friend tennyson his schooling was short and desultory his education being attended to by private tutors and by his father who left the boy largely to follow his own inclination like the young milton browning was fond of music and in many of his poems especially in abt vogler and a toccata of galuppis he interprets the musical temperament better perhaps than any other writer in our literature but unlike milton through whose poetry there runs a great melody music seems to have had no consistent effect upon his verse which is often so jarring that one must wonder how a musical ear could have endured it  like tennyson this boy found his work very early and for fifty years hardly a week passed that he did not write poetry he began at six to produce verses in imitation of byron but fortunately this early work has been lost then he fell under the influence of shelley and his first known work pauline 1833 must be considered as a tribute to shelley and his poetry tennysons earliest work poems by two brothers had been published and well paid for five years before but browning could find no publisher who would even consider pauline and the work was published by means of money furnished by an indulgent relative this poem received scant notice from the reviewers who had pounced like hawks on a dovecote upon tennysons first two modest volumes two years later appeared paracelsus and then his tragedy strafford was put upon the stage but not till sordello was published in 1840 did he attract attention enough to be denounced for the obscurity and vagaries of his style six years later in 1846 he suddenly became famous not because he finished in that year his bells and pomegranates which is brownings symbolic name for poetry and thought or singing and sermonizing but because he eloped with the best known literary woman in england elizabeth barrett whose fame was for many years both before and after her marriage much greater than brownings and who was at first considered superior to tennyson thereafter until his own work compelled attention he was known chiefly as the man who married elizabeth barrett for years this lady had been an almost helpless invalid and it seemed a quixotic thing when browning having failed to gain her familys consent to the marriage carried her off romantically love and italy proved better than her physicians and for fifteen years browning and his wife lived an ideally happy life in pisa and in florence the exquisite romance of their love is preserved in mrs brownings sonnets from the portuguese and in the volume of letters recently publishedwonderful letters but so tender and intimate that it seems almost a sacrilege for inquisitive eyes to read them  mrs browning died in florence in 1861 the loss seemed at first too much to bear and browning fled with his son to england for the remainder of his life he lived alternately in london and in various parts of italy especially at the palazzo rezzonico in venice which is now an object of pilgrimage to almost every tourist who visits the beautiful city wherever he went he mingled with men and women sociable well dressed courteous loving crowds and popular applause the very reverse of his friend tennyson his earlier work had been much better appreciated in america than in england but with the publication of the ring and the book in 1868 he was at last recognized by his countrymen as one of the greatest of english poets he died in venice on december 12 1889 the same day that saw the publication of his last work asolando though italy offered him an honored resting place england claimed him for her own and he lies buried beside tennyson in westminster abbey the spirit of his whole life is magnificently expressed in his own lines in the epilogue of his last book      one who never turned his back but marched breast forward         never doubted clouds would break     never dreamed tho right were worsted wrong would triumph         held we fall to rise are baffled to fight better                      sleep to wake  works a glance at even the titles which browning gave to his best known volumesdramatic lyrics 1842 dramatic romances and lyrics 1845 men and women 1853 dramatis persona 1864will suggest how strong the dramatic element is in all his work indeed all his poems may be divided into three classespure dramas like strafford and a blot in the scutcheon dramatic narratives like pippa passes which are dramatic in form but were not meant to be acted and dramatic lyrics like the last ride together which are short poems expressing some strong personal emotion or describing some dramatic episode in human life and in which the hero himself generally tells the story  though browning is often compared with shakespeare the reader will understand that he has very little of shakespeares dramatic talent he cannot bring a group of people together and let the actions and words of his characters show us the comedy and tragedy of human life neither can the author be disinterested satisfied as shakespeare was with life itself without drawing any moral conclusions browning has always a moral ready and insists upon giving us his own views of life which shakespeare never does his dramatic power lies in depicting what he himself calls the history of a soul sometimes as in paracelsus he endeavors to trace the progress of the human spirit more often he takes some dramatic moment in life some crisis in the ceaseless struggle between good and evil and describes with wonderful insight the heros own thoughts and feelings but he almost invariably tells us how at such and such a point the good or the evil in his hero must inevitably have triumphed and generally as in my last duchess the speaker adds a word here and there aside from the story which unconsciously shows the kind of man he is it is this power of revealing the soul from within that causes browning to fascinate those who study him long enough his range is enormous and brings all sorts and conditions of men under analysis the musician in abt vogler the artist in andrea del sarto the early christian in a death in the desert the arab horseman in muteykeh the sailor in herve kiel the mediæval knight in childe roland the hebrew in saul the greek in balaustions adventure the monster in caliban the immortal dead in karshishall these and a hundred more histories of the soul show brownings marvelous versatility it is this great range of sympathy with many different types of life that constitutes brownings chief likeness to shakespeare though otherwise there is no comparison between the two men  if we separate all these dramatic poems into three main periodsthe early from 1833 to 1841 the middle from 1841 to 1868 and the late from 1868 to 1889the work of the beginner will be much more easily designated of his early soul studies pauline 1833 paracelsus 1835 and sordello 1840 little need be said here except perhaps this that if we begin with these works we shall probably never read anything else by browning and that were a pity it is better to leave these obscure works until his better poems have so attracted us to browning that we will cheerfully endure his worst faults for the sake of his undoubted virtues the same criticism applies though in less degree to his first drama strafford 1837 which belongs to the early period of his work  the merciless criticism which greeted sordello had a wholesome effect on browning as is shown in the better work of his second period moreover his new power was developing rapidly as may be seen by comparing the eight numbers of his famous bells and pomegranates series 18411846 with his earlier work thus the first number of this wonderful series published in 1841 contains pippa passes which is on the whole the most perfect of his longer poems and another number contains a blot in the scutcheon which is the most readable of his dramas even a beginner must be thrilled by the beauty and the power of these two works two other noteworthy dramas of the period are colombes birthday 1844 and in a balcony 1855 which however met with scant appreciation on the stage having too much subtle analysis and too little action to satisfy the public nearly all his best lyrics dramas and dramatic poems belong to this middle period of labor and when the ring and the book appeared in 1868 he had given to the world the noblest expression of his poetic genius  in the third period beginning when browning was nearly sixty years old he wrote even more industriously than before and published on an average nearly a volume of poetry a year such volumes as fifine at the fair red cotton nightcap country the inn album jocoseria and many others show how browning gains steadily in the power of revealing the hidden springs of human action but he often rambles most tiresomely and in general his work loses in sustained interest it is perhaps significant that most of his best work was done under mrs brownings influence  what to read of the short miscellaneous poems there is such an unusual variety that one must hesitate a little in suggesting this or that to the beginners attention my star evelyn hope wanting iswhat home thoughts from abroad meeting at night one word more an exquisite tribute to his dead wife prospice look forward songs from pippa passes various love poems like by the fireside and the last ride together the inimitable pied piper and the ballads like hervé riel and how they brought the good newsthese are a mere suggestion expressing only the writers personal preference but a glance at the contents of brownings volumes will reveal scores of other poems which another writer might recommend as being better in themselves or more characteristic of browning237  among brownings dramatic soul studies there is also a very wide choice andrea del sarto is one of the best revealing as it does the strength and the weakness of the perfect painter whose love for a soulless woman with a pretty face saddens his life and hampers his best work next in importance to andrea stands an epistle reciting the experiences of karshish an arab physician which is one of the best examples of brownings peculiar method of presenting the truth the halfscoffing halfearnest and wholly bewildered state of this oriental scientists mind is clearly indicated between the lines of his letter to his old master his description of lazarus whom he meets by chance and of the state of mind of one who having seen the glories of immortality must live again in the midst of the jumble of trivial and stupendous things which constitute our life forms one of the most original and suggestive poems in our literature my last duchess is a short but very keen analysis of the soul of a selfish man who reveals his character unconsciously by his words of praise concerning his dead wifes picture in the bishop orders his tomb we have another extraordinarily interesting revelation of the mind of a vain and worldly man this time a churchman whose words tell you far more than he dreams about his own character abt vogler undoubtedly one of brownings finest poems is the study of a musicians soul muléykeh gives us the soul of an arab vain and proud of his fast horse which was never beaten in a race a rival steals the horse and rides away upon her back but used as she is to her masters touch she will not show her best pace to the stranger muléykeh rides up furiously but instead of striking the thief from his saddle he boasts about his peerless mare saying that if a certain spot on her neck were touched with the rein she could never be overtaken instantly the robber touches the spot and the mare answers with a burst of speed that makes pursuit hopeless muléykeh has lost his mare but he has kept his pride in the unbeaten one and is satisfied rabbi ben ezra which refuses analysis and which must be read entire to be appreciated is perhaps the most quoted of all brownings works and contains the best expression of his own faith in life both here and hereafter all these wonderful poems are again merely a suggestion they indicate simply the works to which one reader turns when he feels mentally vigorous enough to pick up browning another list of soul studies citing a toccata of galuppis a grammarians funeral fra lippo lippi saul cleon a death in the desert and soliloquy of the spanish cloister might in anothers judgment be more interesting and suggestive  pippa passes among brownings longer poems there are two at least that well deserve our study pippa passes aside from its rare poetical qualities is a study of unconscious influence the idea of the poem was suggested to browning while listening to a gypsy girl singing in the woods near his home but he transfers the scene of the action to the little mountain town of asolo in italy pippa is a little silk weaver who goes out in the morning to enjoy her one holiday of the whole year as she thinks of her own happiness she is vaguely wishing that she might share it and do some good then with her childish imagination she begins to weave a little romance in which she shares in the happiness of the four greatest and happiest people in asolo it never occurs to her that perhaps there is more of misery than of happiness in the four great ones of whom she dreams and so she goes on her way singing      the years at the spring     and days at the morn     mornings at seven     the hillsides dewpearled     the larks on the wing     the snails on the thorn     gods in his heaven     alls right with the world  fate wills it that the words and music of her little songs should come to the ears of four different groups of people at the moment when they are facing the greatest crises of their lives and turn the scale from evil to good but pippa knows nothing of this she enjoys her holiday and goes to bed still singing entirely ignorant of the good she has done in the world with one exception it is the most perfect of all brownings works at best it is not easy nor merely entertaining reading but it richly repays whatever hours we spend in studying it  the ring and the book is brownings masterpiece it is an immense poem twice as long as paradise lost and longer by some two thousand lines than the iliad and before we begin the undoubted task of reading it we must understand that there is no interesting story or dramatic development to carry us along in the beginning we have an outline of the story such as it isa horrible story of count guidos murder of his beautiful young wife and browning tells us in detail just when and how he found a book containing the record of the crime and the trial there the story element ends and the symbolism of the book begins the title of the poem is explained by the habit of the old etruscan goldsmiths who in making one of their elaborately chased rings would mix the pure gold with an alloy in order to harden it when the ring was finished acid was poured upon it and the acid ate out the alloy leaving the beautiful design in pure gold browning purposes to follow the same plan with his literary material which consists simply of the evidence given at the trial of guido in rome in 1698 he intends to mix a poets fancy with the crude facts and create a beautiful and artistic work  the result of brownings purpose is a series of monologues in which the same story is retold nine different times by the different actors in the drama the count the young wife the suspected priest the lawyers the pope who presides at the trialeach tells the story and each unconsciously reveals the depths of his own nature in the recital the most interesting of the characters are guido the husband who changes from bold defiance to abject fear caponsacchi the young priest who aids the wife in her flight from her brutal husband and is unjustly accused of false motives pompilia the young wife one of the noblest characters in literature fit in all respects to rank with shakespeares great heroines and the pope a splendid figure the strongest of all brownings masculine characters when we have read the story as told by these four different actors we have the best of the poets work and of the most original poem in our language  brownings place and message brownings place in our literature will be better appreciated by comparison with his friend tennyson whom we have just studied in one respect at least these poets are in perfect accord each finds in love the supreme purpose and meaning of life in other respects especially in their methods of approaching the truth the two men are the exact opposites tennyson is first the artist and then the teacher but with browning the message is always the important thing and he is careless too careless of the form in which it is expressed again tennyson is under the influence of the romantic revival and chooses his subjects daintily but alls fish that comes to brownings net he takes comely and ugly subjects with equal pleasure and aims to show that truth lies hidden in both the evil and the good this contrast is all the more striking when we remember that brownings essentially scientific attitude was taken by a man who refused to study science tennyson whose work is always artistic never studied art but was devoted to the sciences while browning whose work is seldom artistic in form thought that art was the most suitable subject for a mans study  the two poets differ even more widely in their respective messages tennysons message reflects the growing order of the age and is summed up in the word law in his view the individual will must be suppressed the self must always be subordinate his resignation is at times almost oriental in its fatalism and occasionally it suggests schopenhauer in its mixture of fate and pessimism brownings message on the other hand is the triumph of the individual will over all obstacles the self is not subordinate but supreme there is nothing oriental nothing doubtful nothing pessimistic in the whole range of his poetry his is the voice of the anglosaxon standing up in the face of all obstacles and saying i can and i will he is therefore far more radically english than is tennyson and it may be for this reason that he is the more studied and that while youth delights in tennyson manhood is better satisfied with browning because of his invincible will and optimism browning is at present regarded as the poet who has spoken the strongest word of faith to an age of doubt his energy his cheerful courage his faith in life and in the development that awaits us beyond the portals of death are like a buglecall to good living this sums up his present influence upon the minds of those who have learned to appreciate him of the future we can only say that both at home and abroad he seems to be gaining steadily in appreciation as the years go by   minor poets of the vistorian age  elizabeth barrett among the minor poets of the past century elizabeth barrett mrs browning occupies perhaps the highest place in popular favor she was born at coxhoe hall near durham in 1806 but her childhood and early youth were spent in herefordshire among the malvern hills made famous by piers plowman in 1835 the barrett family moved to london where elizabeth gained a literary reputation by the publication of the seraphim and other poems 1838 then illness and the shock caused by the tragic death of her brother in 1840 placed her frail life in danger and for six years she was confined to her own room the innate strength and beauty of her spirit here showed itself strongly in her daily study her poetry and especially in her interest in the social problems which sooner or later occupied all the victorian writers my mind to me a kingdom is might well have been written over the door of the room where this delicate invalid worked and suffered in loneliness and in silence  in 1844 miss barrett published her poems which though somewhat impulsive and overwrought met with remarkable public favor such poems as the cry of the children which voices the protest of humanity against child labor appealed tremendously to the readers of the age and this young womans fame as a poet temporarily overshadowed that of tennyson and browning indeed as late as 1850 when wordsworth died she was seriously considered for the position of poet laureate which was finally given to tennyson a reference to browning in lady geraldines courtship is supposed to have first led the poet to write to miss barrett in 1845 soon afterwards he visited the invalid they fell in love almost at first sight and the following year against the wishes of her fatherwho was evidently a selfish old tyrantbrowning carried her off and married her the exquisite romance of their love is reflected in mrs brownings sonnets from the portuguese 1850 this is a noble and inspiring book of love poems and stedman regards the opening sonnet i thought once how theocritus had sung as equal to any in our language  for fifteen years the brownings lived an ideally happy life at pisa and at casa guidi florence sharing the same poetical ambitions and love was the greatest thing in the world      how do i love thee let me count the ways     i love thee to the depth and breadth and height     my soul can reach when feeling out of sight     for the ends of being and ideal grace     i love thee to the level of everydays     most quiet need by sun and candlelight     i love thee freely as men strive for right     i love thee purely as they turn from praise     i love thee with the passion put to use     in my old griefs and with my childhoods faith     i love thee with a love i seemed to lose     with my lost saintsi love thee with the breath     smiles tears of all my lifeand if god choose     i shall but love thee better after death  mrs browning entered with wholesouled enthusiasm into the aspirations of italy in its struggle against the tyranny of austria and her casa guidi windows 1851 is a combination of poetry and politics both it must be confessed a little too emotional in 1856 she published aurora leigh a novel in verse having for its hero a young social reformer and for its heroine a young woman poetical and enthusiastic who strongly suggests elizabeth barrett herself it emphasizes in verse precisely the same moral and social ideals which dickens and george eliot were proclaiming in all their novels her last two volumes were poems before congress 1860 and last poems published after her death she died suddenly in 1861 and was buried in florence brownings famous line o lyric love half angel and half bird may well apply to her frail life and aerial spirit  rossetti dante gabriel rossetti 18281882 the son of an exiled italian painter and scholar was distinguished both as a painter and as a poet he was a leader in the preraphaelite movement238 and published in the first numbers of the germ his hand and soul a delicate prose study and his famous the blessed damozel beginning      the blessed damozel leaned out       from the gold bar of heaven     her eyes were deeper than the depth       of waters stilled at even     she had three lilies in her hand       and the stars in her hair were seven  these two early works especially the blessed damozel with its simplicity and exquisite spiritual quality are characteristic of the ideals of the preraphaelites  in 1860 after a long engagement rossetti married elizabeth siddal a delicate beautiful english girl whom he has immortalized both in his pictures and in his poetry she died two years later and rossetti never entirely recovered from the shock at her burial he placed in her coffin the manuscripts of all his unpublished poems and only at the persistent demands of his friends did he allow them to be exhumed and printed in 1870 the publication of this volume of love poems created a sensation in literary circles and rossetti was hailed as one of the greatest of living poets in 1881 he published his ballads and sonnets a remarkable volume containing among other poems the confession modeled after browning the ballad of sister helen founded on a mediæval superstition the kings tragedy a masterpiece of dramatic narrative and the house of life a collection of one hundred and one sonnets reflecting the poets love and loss this last collection deserves to rank with mrs brownings sonnets from the portuguese and with shakespeares sonnets as one of the three great cycles of love poems in our language it has been well said that both rossetti and morris paint pictures as well in their poems as on their canvases and this pictorial quality of their verse is its chief characteristic  morris william morris 18341896 is a most interesting combination of literary man and artist in the latter capacity as architect designer and manufacturer of furniture carpets and wall paper and as founder of the kelmscott press for artistic printing and bookbinding he has laid us all under an immense debt of gratitude from boyhood he had steeped himself in the legends and ideals of the middle ages and his best literary work is wholly mediæval in spirit the earthly paradise 18681870 is generally regarded as his masterpiece this delightful collection of stories in verse tells of a roving band of vikings who are wrecked on the fabled island of atlantis and who discover there a superior race of men having the characteristics of ideal greeks the vikings remain for a year telling stories of their own northland and listening to the classic and oriental tales of their hosts morriss interest in icelandic literature is further shown by his sigurd the volsung an epic founded upon one of the old sagas and by his prose romances the house of the wolfings the story of the glittering plain and the roots of the mountains later in life he became deeply interested in socialism and two other romances the dream of john ball and news from nowhere are interesting as modern attempts at depicting an ideal society governed by the principles of mores utopia  swinburne algernon charles swinburne 18371909 is chronologically the last of the victorian poets as an artist in techniquehaving perfect command of all old english verse forms and a remarkable faculty for inventing newhe seems at the present time to rank among the best in our literature indeed as stedman says before his advent we did not realize the full scope of english verse this refers to the melodious and constantly changing form rather than to the content of swinburnes poetry at the death of tennyson in 1892 he was undoubtedly the greatest living poet and only his liberal opinions his scorn of royalty and of conventions and the prejudice aroused by the pagan spirit of his early work prevented his appointment as poet laureate he has written a very large number of poems dramas and essays in literary criticism but we are still too near to judge of the permanence of his work or of his place in literature those who would read and estimate his work for themselves will do well to begin with a volume of selected poems especially those which show his love of the sea and his exquisite appreciation of child life his atalanta in calydon 1864 a beautiful lyric drama modeled on the greek tragedy is generally regarded as his masterpiece in all his work swinburne carries tennysons love of melody to an extreme and often sacrifices sense to sound his poetry is always musical and like music appeals almost exclusively to the emotions                                       we have chosen somewhat arbitrarily these four writersmrs browning d g rossetti morris and swinburneas representative of the minor poets of the age but there are many others who are worthy of studyarthur hugh clough and matthew arnold239 who are often called the poets of skepticism but who in reality represent a reverent seeking for truth through reason and human experience frederick william faber the catholic mystic author of some exquisite hymns and the scholarly john keble author of the christian year our best known book of devotional verse and among the women poets adelaide procter jean ingelow and christina rossetti each of whom had a large admiring circle of readers it would be a hopeless task at the present time to inquire into the relative merits of all these minor poets we note only their careful workmanship and exquisite melody their wide range of thought and feeling their eager search for truth each in his own way and especially the note of freshness and vitality which they have given to english poetry   ii the novelists of the victorian age  charles dickens 18121870  when we consider dickenss life and work in comparison with that of the two great poets we have been studying the contrast is startling while tennyson and browning were being educated for the life of literature and shielded most tenderly from the hardships of the world dickens a poor obscure and suffering child was helping to support a shiftless family by pasting labels on blacking bottles sleeping under a counter like a homeless cat and once a week timidly approaching the big prison where his father was confined for debt in 1836 his pickwick was published and life was changed as if a magician had waved his wand over him while the two great poets were slowly struggling for recognition dickens with plenty of money and too much fame was the acknowledged literary hero of england the idol of immense audiences which gathered to applaud him wherever he appeared and there is also this striking contrast between the novelist and the poetsthat while the whole tendency of the age was toward realism away from the extremes of the romanticists and from the oddities and absurdities of the early novel writers it was precisely by emphasizing oddities and absurdities by making caricatures rather than characters that dickens first achieved his popularity  life in dickenss early life we see a stern but unrecognized preparation for the work that he was to do never was there a better illustration of the fact that a boys early hardship and suffering are sometimes only divine messengers disguised and that circumstances which seem only evil are often the source of a mans strength and of the influence which he is to wield in the world he was the second of eight poor children and was born at landport in 1812 his father who is supposed to be the original of mr micawber was a clerk in a navy office he could never make both ends meet and after struggling with debts in his native town for many years moved to london when dickens was nine years old the debts still pursued him and after two years of grandiloquent misfortune he was thrown into the poordebtors prison his wife the original of mrs micawber then set up the famous boarding establishment for young ladies but in dickenss words no young ladies ever came the only visitors were creditors and they were quite ferocious in the picture of the micawber family with its tears and smiles and general shiftlessness we have a suggestion of dickenss own family life  at eleven years of age the boy was taken out of school and went to work in the cellar of a blacking factory at this time he was in his own words a queer small boy who suffered as he worked and we can appreciate the boy and the suffering more when we find both reflected in the character of david copperfield it is a heartrending picture this sensitive child working from dawn till dark for a few pennies and associating with toughs and waifs in his brief intervals of labor but we can see in it the sources of that intimate knowledge of the hearts of the poor and outcast which was soon to be reflected in literature and to startle all england by its appeal for sympathy a small legacy ended this wretchedness bringing the father from the prison and sending the boy to wellington house academya worthless and brutal school evidently whose head master was in dickenss words a most ignorant fellow and a tyrant he learned little at this place being interested chiefly in stories and in acting out the heroic parts which appealed to his imagination but again his personal experience was of immense value and resulted in his famous picture of dotheboys hall in nicholas nickleby which helped largely to mitigate the evils of private schools in england wherever he went dickens was a marvelously keen observer with an active imagination which made stories out of incidents and characters that ordinary men would have hardly noticed moreover he was a born actor and was at one time the leading spirit of a band of amateurs who gave entertainments for charity all over england these three things his keen observation his active imagination and the actors spirit which animated him furnish a key to his life and writings  when only fifteen years old he left the school and again went to work this time as clerk in a lawyers office by night he studied shorthand in order to fit himself to be a reporterthis in imitation of his father who was now engaged by a newspaper to report the speeches in parliament everything that dickens attempted seems to have been done with vigor and intensity and within two years we find him reporting important speeches and writing out his notes as the heavy coach lurched and rolled through the mud of country roads on its dark way to london town it was largely during this period that he gained his extraordinary knowledge of inns and stables and horsey persons which is reflected in his novels he also grew ambitious and began to write on his own account at the age of twentyone he dropped his first little sketch stealthily with fear and trembling into a dark letterbox in a dark office up a dark court in fleet street the name of this first sketch was mr minns and his cousin and it appeared with other stories in his first book sketches by boz in 1835 one who reads these sketches now with their intimate knowledge of the hidden life of london can understand dickenss first newspaper success perfectly his best known work pickwick was published serially in 18361837 and dickenss fame and fortune were made never before had a novel appeared so full of vitality and merriment though crude in design a mere jumble of exaggerated characters and incidents it fairly bubbled over with the kind of humor in which the british public delights and it still remains after three quarters of a century one of our most caredispelling books  the remainder of dickenss life is largely a record of personal triumphs pickwick was followed rapidly by oliver twist nicholas nickleby old curiosity shop and by many other works which seemed to indicate that there was no limit to the new authors invention of odd grotesque uproarious and sentimental characters in the intervals of his novel writing he attempted several times to edit a weekly paper but his power lay in other directions and with the exception of household words his journalistic ventures were not a marked success again the actor came to the surface and after managing a company of amateur actors successfully dickens began to give dramatic readings from his own works as he was already the most popular writer in the english language these readings were very successful crowds thronged to hear him and his journeys became a continuous ovation money poured into his pockets from his novels and from his readings and he bought for himself a home gadshill place which he had always desired and which is forever associated with his memory though he spent the greater part of his time and strength in travel at this period nothing is more characteristic of the man than the intense energy with which he turned from his lecturing to his novels and then for relaxation gave himself up to what he called the magic lantern of the london streets  in 1842 while still a young man dickens was invited to visit the united states and canada where his works were even better known than in england and where he was received as the guest of the nation and treated with every mark of honor and appreciation at this time america was to most europeans a kind of huge fairyland where money sprang out of the earth and life was happy as a long holiday dickens evidently shared this rosy view and his romantic expectations were naturally disappointed the crude unfinished look of the big country seems to have roused a strong prejudice in his mind which was not overcome at the time of his second visit twentyfive years later and which brought forth the harsh criticism of his american notes 1842 and of martin chuzzlewit 18431844 these two unkind books struck a false note and dickens began to lose something of his great popularity in addition he had spent money beyond his income his domestic life which had been at first very happy became more and more irritating until he separated from his wife in 1858 to get inspiration which seemed for a time to have failed he journeyed to italy but was disappointed then he turned back to the london streets and in the five years from 1848 to 1853 appeared dombey and son david copperfield and bleak housethree remarkable novels which indicate that he had rediscovered his own power and genius later he resumed the public readings with their public triumph and applause which soon came to be a necessity to one who craved popularity as a hungry man craves bread these excitements exhausted dickens physically and spiritually and death was the inevitable result he died in 1870 over his unfinished edwin drood and was buried in westminster abbey  dickenss work in view of his life a glance through even this unsatisfactory biography gives us certain illuminating suggestions in regard to all of dickenss work first as a child poor and lonely longing for love and for society he laid the foundation for those heartrending pictures of children which have moved so many readers to unaccustomed tears second as clerk in a lawyers office and in the courts he gained his knowledge of an entirely different side of human life here he learned to understand both the enemies and the victims of society between whom the harsh laws of that day frequently made no distinction third as a reporter and afterwards as manager of various newspapers he learned the trick of racy writing and of knowing to a nicety what would suit the popular taste fourth as an actor always an actor in spirit he seized upon every dramatic possibility every tense situation every peculiarity of voice and gesture in the people whom he met and reproduced these things in his novels exaggerating them in the way that most pleased his audience  when we turn from his outward training to his inner disposition we find two strongly marked elements the first is his excessive imagination which made good stories out of incidents that ordinarily pass unnoticed and which described the commonest thingsa street a shop a fog a lamppost a stagecoachwith a wealth of detail and of romantic suggestion that makes many of his descriptions like lyric poems the second element is his extreme sensibility which finds relief only in laughter and tears like shadow and sunshine these follow one another closely throughout all his books  remembering these two things his training and disposition we can easily foresee the kind of novel he must produce he will be sentimental especially over children and outcasts he will excuse the individual in view of the faults of society he will be dramatic or melodramatic and his sensibility will keep him always close to the public studying its tastes and playing with its smiles and tears if pleasing the public be in itself an art then dickens is one of our greatest artists and it is well to remember that in pleasing his public there was nothing of the hypocrite or demagogue in his makeup he was essentially a part of the great drifting panoramic crowd that he loved his sympathetic soul made all their joys and griefs his own he fought against injustice he championed the weak against the strong he gave courage to the faint and hope to the weary in heart and in the love which the public gave him in return he found his best reward here is the secret of dickenss unprecedented popular success and we may note here a very significant parallel with shakespeare the great different in the genius and work of the two men does not change the fact that each won success largely because he studied and pleased his public  general plan of dickenss novels an interesting suggestion comes to us from a study of the conditions which led to dickenss first three novels pickwick was written at the suggestion of an editor for serial publication each chapter was to be accompanied by a cartoon by seymor a comic artist of the day and the object was to amuse the public and incidentally to sell the paper the result was a series of characters and scenes and incidents which for vigor and boundless fun have never been equaled in our language thereafter no matter what he wrote dickins was lbeled a humorist like a certain american writer of our own generation everything he said whether for a feast or a funeral was spposed to contain a laugh in a word he was the victim of his own book dickens was keen enough to understand his danger and his next novel oliver twist had the serious purpose of  mitigating the evils under which the poor were suffering its hero was a poor child the unfortunate victim of society and in order to draw attention to the real need dickens exaggerated the woeful condition of the poor and filled his pages with sentiment which easily slipped over into sentimentality this also was a popular success and in his third novel nicholas nickleby and indeed in most of his remaining works dickens combined the principles of his first two books giving us mirth on the one hand injustice and suffering on the other mingling humor and pathos tears and laughter as we find them in life itself and in order to increase the lights and shadows in his scenes and to give greater dramatic effect to his narrative he introduced odious and lothsome characters and made vice more hateful by contrasting it with innocence and virtue  we find therefore in most of dickenss novels three or four widely different types of character first the innocent little child like oliver joe paul tiny tim and little nell appealing powerfully to the child love in every human heart scond the horrible or grotesque foil like sqeers fagin quilp uriah heep and bill sykes third the grandiloquent or broadly humorous fellow the fun maker like micawber and sam weller and fourth a tenderly or powerfully drawn figure like lady deadlock of bleak house and sydney carton of a tale of two cities which rise to the dignity of true characters we note also that most of dickenss novels belong decidely to the class of purpose or problem novels thus bleak house attacks the laws delays little dorrit the injustice which persecutes poor debtors nicholas nickleby the abuses of charity schools and brutal schoolmasters and oliver twist the unnecessary degradation and suffering of the poor in english workhouses dickenss serious purpose was to make the novel the instrument of morality and justice and whatver we may think of the exaggeration of his characters it is certain that his stories did more to correct the general selfishness and injustice of society toward the poor than all the works of other literary men of his age combined  the limitations of dickens any severe criticism of dickens as a novelist must seem at first glance unkind an unnecessary in almost every house he is a welcome guest a personal friend who has beguiled many an hour with his stories and who has furnished us much  good laughter and a few good tears moreover he has always a cheery message he emphasizes the fact that this is an excellant world that some errors have crept into it due largely to thoughtlessness but that they can be easily remedied by a little human sympathy that is a most welcome creed to an age overburdened with social problems and to criticise our cheery companion seems as discourteous as to speak unkindly of a guest who has just left our home but we must consider dickens not merely as a friend but as a novelist and apply to his work the same standards of art which we apply to other writers and when we do this we are sometimes a little disappointed we must confess that his novels while they contain many realistic details seldom give the impression of reality his characters though we laugh or weep or shudder at them are sometimes only caricatures each one an exaggeration of some peculiarity which suggest ben jonsons every man in his humour it is dickenss art to give his heroes sufficient reality to make them suggest certain types of men and women whom we know but in reading him we find ourselves often in the mental state of a man who is watching through a microscope the swarming life of a water drop here are lively bustling extraordinary creatures some beautiful some grotesque but all far apart from the life that we know in daily experience it is certainly not the reality of these characters but rather the genius of the author in managing them which interests us and holds our attention notwithstanding this criticism which we would gladly have omitted dickens is excellent reading and his novels will continue to be popular just so long as men enjoy a wholesome and absorbing story  what to read aside from the reforms in schools and prisons and workhouses which dickens accomplished he has laid us all rich and poor alike under a debt of gratitude after the year 1843 the one literary work which he never neglected was to furnish a christmas story for his readers and it is due in some measure to the help of these stories brimming over with good cheer that christmas has become in all englishspeaking countries a season of gladness of gift giving at home and of remembering those less fortunate than ourselves who are still members of a common brotherhood if we read nothing else of dickens once a year at christmas time we should remember him and renew our youth by reading one of his holiday stories the cricket on the hearth the chimes and above all the unrivaled christmas carol the latter especially will be read and loved as long as men are moved by the spirit of christmas  of the novels david copperfield is regarded by many as dickenss masterpiece it is well to begin with this novel not simply for the unusual interest of the story but also for the glimpse it gives us of the authors own boyhood and family for pure fun and hilarity pickwick will always be a favorite but for artistic finish and for the portrayal of one great character sydney carton nothing else that dickens wrote is comparable to a tale of two cities here is an absorbing story with a carefully constructed plot and the action moves swiftly to its thrilling inevitable conclusion usually dickens introduces several pathetic or grotesque or laughable characters besides the main actors and records various unnecessary dramatic episodes for their own sake but in a tale of two cities everything has its place in the development of the main story there are as usual many characterssydney carton the outcast who lays down his life for the happiness of one whom he loves charles darnay an exiled young french noble dr manette who has been recalled to life from a frightful imprisonment and his gentle daughter lucie the heroine jarvis lorry a lovable oldfashioned clerk in the big banking house the terrible madame defarge knitting calmly at the door of her wine shop and recording with the ferocity of a tiger licking its chops the names of all those who are marked for vengeance and a dozen others each well drawn who play minor parts in the tragedy the scene is laid in london and paris at the time of the french revolution and though careless of historical details dickens reproduces the spirit of the reign of terror so well that a tale of two cities is an excellent supplement to the history of the period it is written in dickenss usual picturesque style and reveals his usual imaginative outlook on life and his fondness for fine sentiments and dramatic episodes indeed all his qualities are here shown not brilliantly or garishly as in other novels but subdued and softened like a shaded light for artistic effect  those who are interested in dickenss growth and methods can hardly do better than to read in succession his first three novels pickwick oliver twist and nicholas nickleby which as we have indicated show clearly how he passed from fun to serious purpose and which furnish in combination the general plan of all his later works for the rest we can only indicate those which in our personal judgment seem best worth readingbleak house dombey and son our mutual friend and old curiosity shopbut we are not yet far enough away from the first popular success of these works to determine their permanent value and influence   william makepeace thackeray 18111863  as the two most successful novelists of their day it is natural for us as it was for their personal friends and admirers to compare dickens and thackeray with respect to their life and work and their attitude toward the world in which they lived dickens after a desperately hard struggle in his boyhood without friends or higher education comes into manhood cheery selfconfident energetic filled with the joy of his work and in the world which had at first treated him so harshly he finds good everywhere even in the jails and in the slums simply because he is looking for it thackeray after a boyhood spent in the best of english schools with money friends and comforts of every kind faces life timidly distrustfully and dislikes the literary work which makes him famous he has a gracious and lovable personality is kind of heart and reveres all that is pure and good in life yet he is almost cynical toward the world which uses him so well and finds shams deceptions vanities everywhere because he looks for them one finds what one seeks in this world but it is perhaps significant that dickens sought his golden fleece among plain people and thackeray in high society the chief difference between the two novelists however is not one of environment but of temperament put thackeray in a workhouse and he will still find material for another book of snobs put dickens in society and he cannot help finding undreamedof possibilities among bewigged and bepowdered high lords and ladies for dickens is romantic and emotional and interprets the world largely through his imagination thackeray is the realist and moralist who judges solely by observation and reflection he aims to give us a true picture of the society of his day and as he finds it pervaded by intrigues and snobbery he proceeds to satirize it and point out its moral evils in his novels he is influenced by swift and fielding but he is entirely free from the bitterness of the one and the coarseness of the other and his satire is generally softened by a noble tenderness taken together the novels of dickens and thackeray give us a remarkable picture of all classes of english society in the middle of the nineteenth century  life thackeray was born in 1811 in calcutta where his father held a civil position under the indian government when the boy was five years old his father died and the mother returned with her child to england presently she married again and thackeray was sent to the famous charterhouse school of which he has given us a vivid picture in the newcomes such a school would have been a veritable heaven to dickens who at this time was tossed about between poverty and ambition but thackeray detested it for its rude manners and occasionally referred to it as the slaughterhouse writing to his mother he says there are three hundred and seventy boys in the school i wish there were only three hundred and sixtynine  in 1829 thackeray entered trinity college cambridge but left after less than two years without taking a degree and went to germany and france where he studied with the idea of becoming an artist when he became of age in 1832 he came into possession of a comfortable fortune returned to england and settled down in the temple to study law soon he began to dislike the profession intensely and we have in pendennis a reflection of his mental attitude toward the law and the young men who studied it he soon lost his fortune partly by gambling and speculation partly by unsuccessful attempts at running a newspaper and at twentytwo began for the first time to earn his own living as an artist and illustrator an interesting meeting between thackeray and dickens at this time 1836 suggests the relative importance of the two writers seymour who was illustrating the pickwick papers had just died and thackeray called upon dickens with a few drawings and asked to be allowed to continue the illustrations dickens was at this time at the beginning of his great popularity the better literary artist whose drawings were refused was almost unknown and had to work hard for more than ten years before he received recognition disappointed by his failure as an illustrator he began his literary career by writing satires on society for frasers magazine this was the beginning of his success but though the yellowplush papers the great hoggarty diamond catherine the fitz boodlers the book of snobs barry lyndon and various other immature works made him known to a few readers of punch and of frasers magazine it was not till the publication of vanity fair 18471848 that he began to be recognized as one of the great novelists of his day all his earlier works are satires some upon society others upon the popular novelistsbulwer disraeli and especially dickenswith whose sentimental heroes and heroines he had no patience whatever he had married meanwhile in 1836 and for a few years was very happy in his home then disease and insanity fastened upon his young wife and she was placed in an asylum the whole after life of our novelist was darkened by this loss worse than death he became a man of the clubs rather than of his own home and though his wit and kindness made him the most welcome of clubmen there was an undercurrent of sadness in all that he wrote long afterwards he said that though his marriage ended in shipwreck he would do it over again for behold love is the crown and completion of all earthly good  after the moderate success of vanity fair thackeray wrote the three novels of his middle life upon which his fame chiefly restspendennis in 1850 henry esmond in 1852 and the newcomes in 1855 dickenss great popular success as a lecturer and dramatic reader had led to a general desire on the part of the public to see and to hear literary men and thackeray to increase his income gave two remarkable courses of lectures the first being english humorists of the eighteenth century and the second the four georgesboth courses being delivered with gratifying success in england and especially in america dickens as we have seen was disappointed in america and vented his displeasure in outrageous criticism but thackeray with his usual good breeding saw only the best side of his generous entertainers and in both his public and private utterances emphasized the virtues of the new land whose restless energy seemed to fascinate him unlike dickens he had no confidence in himself when he faced an audience and like most literary men he disliked lecturing and soon gave it up in 1860 he became editor of the cornhill magazine which prospered in his hands and with a comfortable income he seemed just ready to do his best work for the world which has always believed that he was capable of even better things than he ever wrote when he died suddenly in 1863 his body lies buried in kensal green and only a bust does honor to his memory in westminster abbey  works of thackeray the beginner will do well to omit the earlier satires of thackeray written while he was struggling to earn a living from the magazines and open henry esmond 1852 his most perfect novel though not the most widely known and read the fine historical and literary flavor of this story is one of its most marked characteristics and only one who knows something of the history and literature of the eighteenth century can appreciate its value the hero colonel esmond relates his own story carrying the reader through the courts and camps of queen annes reign and giving the most complete and accurate picture of a past age that has ever appeared in a novel thackeray is as we have said a realist and he begins his story by adopting the style and manner of a scholarly gentleman of the period he is describing he has an extraordinary knowledge of eighteenthcentury literature and he reproduces its style in detail going so far as to insert in his narrative an alleged essay from the tatler and so perfectly is it done that it is impossible to say wherein it differs from the style of addison and steele  in his matter also thackeray is realistic reflecting not the pride and pomp of war which are largely delusions but its brutality and barbarism which are all too real painting generals and leaders not as the newspaper heroes to whom we are accustomed but as moved by intrigues petty jealousies and selfish ambitions showing us the great duke of marlborough not as the military hero the idol of warcrazed multitudes but as without personal honor and governed by despicable avarice in a word thackeray gives us the back stairs view of war which is as a rule totally neglected in our histories when he deals with the literary men of the period he uses the same frank realism showing us steele and addison and other leaders not with halos about their heads as popular authors but in slippers and dressing gowns smoking a pipe in their own rooms or else growing tipsy and hilarious in the tavernsjust as they appeared in daily life both in style and in matter therefore esmond deserves to rank as probably the best historical novel in our language  the plot of the story is like most of thackerays plots very slight but perfectly suited to the novelists purpose the plans of his characters fail their ideals grow dim there is a general disappearance of youthful ambitions there is a love story at the center but the element of romance which furnishes the light and music and fragrance of love is inconspicuous the hero after ten years of devotion to a young woman a paragon of beauty finally marries her mother and ends with a few pious observations concerning heavens mercy and his own happy lot such an ending seems disappointing almost bizarre in view of the romantic novels to which we are accustomed but we must remember that thackerays purpose was to paint life as he saw it and that in life men and things often take a different way from that described in romances as we grow acquainted with thackerays characters we realize that no other ending was possible to his story and conclude that his plot like his style is perhaps as near perfection as a realistic novelist can ever come  vanity fair 18471848 is the best known of thackerays novels it was his first great work and was intended to express his own views of the social life about him and to protest against the overdrawn heroes of popular novels he takes for his subject that vanity fair to which christian and faithful were conducted on their way to the heavenly city as recorded in pilgrims progress in this fair there are many different booths given over to the sale of all sorts of vanities and as we go from one to another we come in contact with juggling cheats games plays fools apes knaves rogues and that of every kind evidently this is a picture of one side of social life but the difference between bunyan and thackeray is simply thisthat bunyan made vanity fair a small incident in a long journey a place through which most of us pass on our way to better things while thackeray describing high society in his own day makes it a place of long sojourn wherein his characters spend the greater part of their lives thackeray styles this work a novel without a hero the whole action of the story which is without plot or development revolves about two womenamelia a meek creature of the milkandwater type and becky sharp a keen unprincipled intriguer who lets nothing stand in the way of her selfish desire to get the most out of the fools who largely constitute society on the whole it is the most powerful but not the most wholesome of thackerays works  in his second important novel pendennis 18491850 we have a continuation of the satire on society begun in vanity fair this novel which the beginner should read after esmond is interesting to us for two reasonsbecause it reflects more of the details of thackerays life than all his other writings and because it contains one powerfully drawn character who is a perpetual reminder of the danger of selfishness the hero is neither angel nor imp in thackerays words but the typical young man of society whom he knows thoroughly and whom he paints exactly as he isa careless goodnatured but essentially selfish person who goes through life intent on his own interests pendennis is a profound moral study and the most powerful arraignment of wellmeaning selfishness in our literature not even excepting george eliots romola which it suggests  two other novels the newcomes 1855 and the virginians 1859 complete the list of thackerays great works of fiction the former is a sequel to pendennis and the latter to henry esmond and both share the general fate of sequels in not being quite equal in power or interest to their predecessors the newcomes however deserves a very high place some critics indeed placing it at the head of the authors works like all thackerays novels it is a story of human frailty but here the authors innate gentleness and kindness are seen at their best and the hero is perhaps the most genuine and lovable of all his characters  thackeray is known in english literature as an essayist as well as a novelist his english humorists and the four georges are among the finest essays of the nineteenth century in the former especially thackeray shows not only a wide knowledge but an extraordinary understanding of his subject apparently this nineteenthcentury writer knows addison fielding swift smollett and other great writers of the past century almost as intimately as one knows his nearest friend and he gives us the fine flavor of their humor in a way which no other writer save perhaps larnb has ever rivaled240 the four georges is in a vein of delicate satire and presents a rather unflattering picture of four of englands rulers and of the courts in which they moved both these works are remarkable for their exquisite style their gentle humor their keen literary criticisms and for the intimate knowledge and sympathy which makes the people of a past age live once more in the written pages  general characteristics in treating of thackerays view of life as reflected in his novels critics vary greatly and the following summary must be taken not as a positive judgment but only as an attempt to express the general impression of his works on an uncritical reader he is first of a realist who paints life as he sees it as he says himself i have no brains above my eyes i describe what i see his pictures of certain types notably the weak and vicious elements of society are accurate and true to life but they seem to play too large a part in his books and have perhaps too greatly influenced his general judgment of humanity an excessive sensibility or the capacity for fine feelings and emotions is a marked characteristic of thackeray as it is of dickens and carlyle he is easily offended as they are by the shams of society but he cannot find an outlet as dickens does in laughter and tears and he is too gentle to follow carlyle in violent denunciations and prophecies he turns to satireinfluenced doubtless by eighteenthcentury literature which he knew so well and in which satire played too large a part241 his satire is never personal like popes or brutal like swifts and is tempered by kindness and humor but it is used too freely and generally lays too much emphasis on faults and foibles to be considered a true picture of any large class of english society  besides being a realist and satirist thackeray is essentially a moralist like addison aiming definitely in all his work at producing a moral impression so much does he revere goodness and so determined is he that his pendennis or his becky sharp shall be judged at their true value that he is not content like shakespeare to be simply an artist to tell an artistic tale and let it speak its own message he must explain and emphasize the moral significance of his work there is no need to consult our own conscience over the actions of thackerays characters the beauty of virtue and the ugliness of vice are evident on every page  whatever we may think of thackerays matter there is one point in which critics are agreedthat he is master of a pure and simple english style whether his thought be sad or humorous commonplace or profound he expresses it perfectly without effort or affectation in all his work there is a subtle charm impossible to describe which gives the impression that we are listening to a gentleman and it is the ease the refinement the exquisite naturalness of thackerays style that furnishes a large part of our pleasure in reading him   mary ann evans george eliot 18191880  in nearly all the writers of the victorian age we note on the one hand a strong intellectual tendency to analyze the problems of life and on the other a tendency to teach that is to explain to men the method by which these problems may be solved the novels especially seem to lose sight of the purely artistic ideal of writing and to aim definitely at moral instruction in george eliot both these tendencies reach a climax she is more obviously more consciously a preacher and moralizer than any of her great contemporaries though profoundly religious at heart she was largely occupied by the scientific spirit of the age and finding no religious creed or political system satisfactory she fell back upon duty as the supreme law of life all her novels aim first to show in individuals the play of universal moral forces and second to establish the moral law as the basis of human society aside from this moral teaching we look to george eliot for the reflection of country life in england just as we look to dickens for pictures of the city streets and to thackeray for the vanities of society of all the women writers who have helped and are still helping to place our english novels at the head of the worlds fiction she holds at present unquestionably the highest rank  life mary ann or marian evans known to us by her pen name of george eliot began to write late in life when nearly forty years of age and attained the leading position among living english novelists in the ten years between 1870 and 1880 after thackeray and dickens had passed away she was born at arbury farm warwickshire some twenty miles from stratfordonavon in 1819 her parents were plain honest folk of the farmer class who brought her up in the somewhat strict religious manner of those days her father seems to have been a man of sterling integrity and of practical english senseone of those essentially noble characters who do the worlds work silently and well and who by their solid worth obtain a position of influence among their fellowmen  a few months after george eliots birth the family moved to another home in the parish of griff where her childhood was largely passed the scenery of the midland counties and many details of her own family life are reflected in her earlier novels thus we find her and her brother as maggie and tom tulliver in the mill on the floss her aunt as dinah morris and her mother as mrs poyser in adam bede we have a suggestion of her father in the hero of the latter novel but the picture is more fully drawn as caleb garth in middlemarch for a few years she studied at two private schools for young ladies at nuneaton and coventry but the death of her mother called her at seventeen years of age to take entire charge of the household thereafter her education was gained wholly by miscellaneous reading we have a suggestion of her method in one of her early letters in which she says my mind presents an assemblage of disjointed specimens of history ancient and modern scraps of poetry picked up from shakespeare cowper wordsworth and milton newspaper topics morsels of addison and bacon latin verbs geometry entomology and chemistry reviews and metaphysics all arrested and petrified and smothered by the fastthickening everyday accession of actual events relative anxieties and household cares and vexations  when mary was twentyone years old the family again moved this time to foleshill road near coventry here she became acquainted with the family of charles bray a prosperous ribbon manufacturer whose house was a gathering place for the freethinkers of the neighborhood the effect of this liberal atmosphere upon miss evans brought up in a narrow way with no knowledge of the world was to unsettle many of her youthful convictions from a narrow intense dogmatism she went to the other extreme of radicalism then about 1860 she lost all sympathy with the freethinkers and being instinctively religious seemed to be groping after a definite faith while following the ideal of duty this spiritual struggle which suggests that of carlyle is undoubtedly the cause of that gloom and depression which hang like an english fog over much of her work though her biographer cross tells us that she was not by any means a sad or gloomy woman  in 1849 miss evanss father died and the brays took her abroad for a tour of the continent on her return to england she wrote several liberal articles for the westminster review and presently was made assistant editor of that magazine her residence in london at this time marks a turning point in her career and the real beginning of her literary life she made strong friendships with spencer mill and other scientists of the day and through spencer met george henry lewes a miscellaneous writer whom she afterwards married  under his sympathetic influence she began to write fiction for the magazines her first story being amos barton 1857 which was later included in the scenes of clerical life 1858 her first long novel adam bede appeared early in 1859 and met with such popular favor that to the end of her life she despaired of ever again repeating her triumph but the unexpected success proved to be an inspiration and she completed the mill on the floss and began silas marner during the following year not until the great success of these works led to an insistent demand to know the author did the english public learn that it was a woman and not an english clergyman as they supposed who had suddenly jumped to the front rank of living writers  up to this point george eliot had confined herself to english country life but now she suddenly abandoned the scenes and the people with whom she was most familiar in order to write an historical novel it was in 1860 while traveling in italy that she formed the great project of romolaa mingling of fiction and moral philosophy against the background of the mighty renaissance movement in this she was writing of things of which she had no personal knowledge and the book cost her many months of hard and depressing labor she said herself that she was a young woman when she began the work and an old woman when she finished it romola 1862 1863 was not successful with the public and the same may be said of felix holt the radical 1866 and the spanish gypsy 1868 the lastnamed work was the result of the authors ambition to write a dramatic poem which should duplicate the lesson of romola and for the purpose of gathering material she visited spain which she had decided upon as the scene of her poetical effort with the publication of middlemarch 18711872 george eliot came back again into popular favor though this work is less spontaneous and more labored and pedantic than her earlier novels the fault of too much analysis and moralizing was even more conspicuous in daniei deronda 1876 which she regarded as her greatest book her life during all this time was singularly uneventful and the chief milestones along the road mark the publication of her successive novels  during all the years of her literary success her husband lewes had been a most sympathetic friend and critic and when he died in 1878 the loss seemed to be more than she could bear her letters of this period are touching in their loneliness and their craving for sympathy later she astonished everybody by marrying john walter cross much younger than herself who is known as her biographer deep down below there is a river of sadness but  i am able to enjoy my newly reopened life writes this woman of sixty who ever since she was the girl whom we know as maggie tulliver must always have some one to love and to depend upon her new interest in life lasted but a few months for she died in december of the same year 1880 one of the best indications of her strength and her limitations is her portrait with its strong masculine features suggesting both by resemblance and by contrast that wonderful portrait of savonarola which hangs over his old desk in the monastery at florence  works of george eliot these are conveniently divided into three groups corresponding to the three periods of her life the first group includes all her early essays and miscellaneous work from her translation of strausss leben jesu in 1846 to her union with lewes in 1854 the second group includes scenes of clerical life adam bede mill on the floss and silas marner all published between 1858 and 1861 these four novels of the middle period are founded on the authors own life and experience their scenes are laid in the country and their characters are taken from the stolid people of the midlands with whom george eliot had been familiar since childhood they are probably the authors most enduring works they have a naturalness a spontaneity at times a flash of real humor which are lacking in her later novels and they show a rapid development of literary power which reaches a climax in silas marner  the novel of italian life romola 18621863 marks a transition to the third group which includes three more novelsfelix holt 1866 middlemarch 18711872 daniel deronda 1876 the ambitious dramatic poem the spanish gypsy 1868 and a collection of miscellaneous essays called the impressions of theophrastus such 1879 the general impression of these works is not so favorable as that produced by the novels of the middle period they are more labored and less interesting they contain much deep reflection and analysis of character but less observation less delight in picturing country life as it is and very little of what we call inspiration we must add however that this does not express a unanimous literary judgment for critics are not wanting who assert that daniel deronda is the highest expression of the authors genius  the general character of all these novels may be described in the authors own term as psychologic realism this means that george eliot sought to do in her novels what browning attempted in his poetry that is to represent the inner struggle of a soul and to reveal the motives impulses and hereditary influences which govern human action browning generally stops when he tells his story and either lets you draw your own conclusion or else gives you his in a few striking lines but george eliot is not content until she has minutely explained the motives of her characters and the moral lesson to be learned from them moreover it is the development of a soul the slow growth or decline of moral power which chiefly interests her her heroes and heroines differ radically from those of dickens and thackeray in this respectthat when we meet the men and women of the latter novelists their characters are already formed and we are reasonably sure what they will do under given circumstances in george eliots novels the characters develop gradually as we come to know them they go from weakness to strength or from strength to weakness according to the works that they do and the thoughts that they cherish in romola for instance tito as we first meet him may be either good or bad and we know not whether he will finally turn to the right hand or to the left as time passes we see him degenerate steadily because he follows his selfish impulses while romola whose character is at first only faintly indicated grows into beauty and strength with every act of selfrenunciation  in these two characters tito and romola we have an epitome of our authors moral teaching the principle of law was in the air during the victorian era and we have already noted how deeply tennyson was influenced by it with george eliot law is like fate it overwhelms personal freedom and inclination moral law was to her as inevitable as automatic as gravitation titos degeneration and the sad failure of dorothea and lydgate in middlemarch may be explained as simply as the fall of an apple or as a bruised knee when a man loses his balance a certain act produces a definite moral effect on the individual and character is the added sum of all the acts of a mans lifejust as the weight of a body is the sum of the weights of many different atoms which constitute it the matter of rewards and punishments therefore needs no final judge or judgment since these things take care of themselves automatically in a world of inviolable moral law  perhaps one thing more should be added to the general characteristics of george eliots novelsthey are all rather depressing the gladsomeness of life the sunshine of smiles and laughter is denied her it is said that once when her husband remarked that her novels were all essentially sad she wept and answered that she must describe life as she had found it  what to read george eliots first stories are in some respects her best though her literary power increases during her second period culminating in silas marner and her psychological analysis is more evident in daniel deronda on the whole it is an excellent way to begin with the freshness and inspiration of the scenes of clerical life and read her books in the order in which they were written in the first group of novels adam bede is the most natural and probably interests more readers than all the others combined the mill on the floss has a larger personal interest because it reflects much of george eliots history and the scenes and the friends of her early life the lack of proportion in this story which gives rather too much space to the girlandboy experiences is naturally explained by the tendency in every man and woman to linger over early memories  silas marner is artistically the most perfect of george eliots novels and we venture to analyze it as typical of her ideals and methods we note first the style which is heavy and a little selfconscious lacking the vigor and picturesqueness of dickens and the grace and naturalness of thackeray the characters are the common people of the midlands the hero being a linen weaver a lonely outcast who hoards and gloats over his hardearned money is robbed thrown into utter despair and brought back to life and happiness by the coming of an abandoned child to his fire in the development of her story the author shows herself first a realist by the naturalness of her characters and the minute accuracy with which she reproduces their ways and even the accents of their speech second a psychologist by the continual analysis and explanation of motives third a moralist by showing in each individual the action and reaction of universal moral forces and especially by making every evil act bring inevitable punishment to the man who does it tragedy therefore plays a large part in the story for according to george eliot tragedy and suffering walk close behind us or lurk at every turn in the road of life like all her novels silas marner is depressing we turn away from even the wedding of eppiewhich is just as it should bewith a sense of sadness and incompleteness finally as we close the book we are conscious of a powerful and enduring impression of reality silas the poor weaver godfrey cass the wellmeaning selfish man mr macey the garrulous and observant parish clerk dolly winthrop the kindhearted countrywoman who cannot understand the mysteries of religion and so interprets god in terms of human lovethese are real people whom having once met we can never forget  romola has the same general moral theme as the english novels but the scenes are entirely different and opinion is divided as to the comparative merit of the work it is a study a very profound study of moral development in one character and of moral degeneracy in another its characters and its scenes are both italian and the action takes place during a critical period of the renaissance movement when savonarola was at the height of his power in florence here is a magnificent theme and a superb background for a great novel and george eliot read and studied till she felt sure that she understood the place the time and the people of her story romola is therefore interesting reading in many respects the most interesting of her works it has been called one of our greatest historical novels but as such it has one grievous fault it is not quite true to the people or even to the locality which it endeavors to represent one who reads it here in a new and different land thinks only of the story and of the novelists power but one who reads it on the spot which it describes and amidst the life which it pictures is continually haunted by the suggestion that george eliot understood neither italy nor the italians it is this lack of harmony with italian life itself which caused morris and rossetti and even browning with all his admiration for the author to lay aside the book unable to read it with pleasure or profit in a word romola is a great moral study and a very interesting book but the characters are not italian and the novel as a whole lacks the strong reality which marks george eliots english studies   minor novelists of the victorian age  in the three great novelists just considered we have an epitome of the fiction of the age dickens using the novel to solve social problems thackeray to paint the life of society as he saw it and george eliot to teach the fundamental principles of morality the influence of these three writers is reflected in all the minor novelists of the victorian age thus dickens is reflected in charles reade thackeray in anthony trollope and the brontë sisters and george eliots psychology finds artistic expression in george meredith to these social and moral and realistic studies we should add the element of romance from which few of our modern novelists can long escape the nineteenth century which began with the romanticism of walter scott returns to its first love like a man glad to be home in its delight over blackmores lorna doone and the romances of robert louis stevenson  charles reade in his fondness for stage effects for picturing the romantic side of common life and for using the novel as the instrument of social reform there is a strong suggestion of dickens in the work of charles reade 18141884 thus his peg woffington is a study of stage life from behind the scenes a terrible temptation is a study of social reforms and reformers and put yourself in his place is the picture of a workingman who struggles against the injustice of the trades unions his masterpiece the cloister and the hearth 1861 one of our best historical novels is a somewhat laborious study of student and vagabond life in europe in the days of the german renaissance it has small resemblance to george eliots romola whose scene is laid in italy during the same period but the two works may well be read in succession as the efforts of two very different novelists of the same period to restore the life of an age long past  anthony trollope in his realism and especially in his conception of the novel as the entertainment of an idle hour trollope 18151882 is a reflection of thackeray it would be hard to find a better duplicate of becky sharp the heroine of vanity fair for instance than is found in lizzie eustace the heroine of the eustace diamonds trollope was the most industrious and systematic of modern novelists writing a definite amount each day and the wide range of his characters suggests the human comedy of balzac his masterpiece is barchester towers 1857 this is a study of life in a cathedral town and is remarkable for its minute pictures of bishops and clergymen with their families and dependents it would be well to read this novel in connection with the warden 1855 the last chronicle of barset 1867 and other novels of the same series since the scenes and characters are the same in all these books and they are undoubtedly the best expression of the authors genius hawthorne says of his novels they precisely suit my tastesolid and substantial and  just as real as if some giant had hewn a great lump out of the earth and put it under a glass case with all the inhabitants going about their daily business and not suspecting that they were being made a show of  charlotte brontë we have another suggestion of thackeray in the work of charlotte brontë 18161855 she aimed to make her novels a realistic picture of society but she added to thackerays realism the element of passionate and somewhat unbalanced romanticism the latter element was partly the expression of miss brontës own nature and partly the result of her lonely and griefstricken life which was darkened by a succession of family tragedies it will help us to understand her work if we remember that both charlotte brontë and her sister emily242 turned to literature because they found their work as governess and teacher unendurable and sought to relieve the loneliness and sadness of their own lot by creating a new world of the imagination in this new world however the sadness of the old remains and all the brontë novels have behind them an aching heart charlotte brontës best known work is jane eyre 1847 which with all its faults is a powerful and fascinating study of elemental love and hate reminding us vaguely of one of marlowes tragedies this work won instant favor with the public and the author was placed in the front rank of living novelists aside from its value as a novel it is interesting in many of its early passages as the reflection of the authors own life and experience shirley 1849 and villette 1853 make up the trio of novels by which this gifted woman is generally remembered  bulwer lytton edward bulwer lytton 18031873 was an extremely versatile writer who tried almost every kind of novel known to the nineteenth century in his early life he wrote poems and dramas under the influence of byron but his first notable work pelham 1828 one of the best of his novels was a kind of burlesque on the byronic type of gentleman as a study of contemporary manners in high society pelham has a suggestion of thackeray and the resemblance is more noticeable in other novels of the same type such as ernest maltravers 1837 the caxtons 18481849 my novel 1853 and kenelm chillingly 1873 we have a suggestion of dickens in at least two of lyttons novels paul clifford and eugene aram the heroes of which are criminals pictured as the victims rather than as the oppressors of society lytton essayed also with considerable popular success the romantic novel in the pilgrims of the rhine and zanoni and tried the ghost story in the haunted and the haunters his fame at the present day rests largely upon his historical novels in imitation of walter scott the last days of pompeii 1834 riettza 1835 and harold 1848 the last being his most ambitious attempt to make the novel the supplement of history in all his novels lytton is inclined to sentimentalism and sensationalism and his works though generally interesting seem hardly worthy of a high place in the history of fiction  kingsley entirely different in spirit are the novels of the scholarly clergyman charles kingsley 18191875 his works naturally divide themselves into three classes in the first are his social studies and problem novels such as alton locke 1850 having for its hero a london tailor and poet and yeast 1848 which deals with the problem of the agricultural laborer in the second class are his historical novels hereward the wake hypatia and westward ho hypatia is a dramatic story of christianity in contact with paganism having its scene laid in alexandria at the beginning of the fifth century westward ho 1855 his best known work is a stirring tale of english conquest by land and sea in the days of elizabeth in the third class are his various miscellaneous works not the least of which is waterbabies a fascinating story of a chimney sweep which mothers read to their children at bedtimeto the great delight of the roundeyed little listeners under the counterpane  mrs gaskell mrs elizabeth gaskell 18101865 began like kingsley with the idea of making the novel the instrument of social reform as the wife of a clergyman in manchester she had come in close contact with the struggles and ideals of the industrial poor of a great city and she reflected her sympathy as well as her observation in mary barton 1848 and in north and south 1855 between these two problem novels she published her masterpiece cranford in 1853 the original of this country village which is given over to spinsters is undoubtedly knutsford in cheshire where mrs gaskell had spent her childhood the sympathy the keen observation and the gentle humor with which the small affairs of a country village are described make cranford one of the most delightful stories in the english language we are indebted to mrs gaskell also for the life of charlotte brontë which is one of our best biographies  blackmore richard doddridge blackrhore 18251900 was a prolific writer but he owes his fame almost entirely to one splendid novel lorna doone which was published in 1869 the scene of this fascinating romance is laid in exmoor in the seventeenth century the story abounds in romantic scenes and incidents its descriptions of natural scenery are unsurpassed the rhythmic language is at times almost equal to poetry and the whole tone of the book is wholesome and refreshing altogether it would be hard to find a more delightful romance in any language and it well deserves the place it has won as one of the classics of our literature other works of blackmore which will repay the reader are clara vaughan 1864 his first novel the maid of sker 1872 springhaven 1887 perlycross 1894 and tales from the telling house 1896 but none of these though he counted them his best work has met with the same favor as lorna doone  meredith so much does george meredith 18281909 belong to our own day that it is difficult to think of him as one of the victorian novelists his first notable work the ordeal of richard feverel was published in 1859 the same year as george eliots adam bede but it was not till the publication of diana of the crossways in 1885 that his power as a novelist was widely recognized he resembles browning not only in his condensed style packed with thought but also in this respectthat he labored for years in obscurity and after much of his best work was published and apparently forgotten he slowly won the leading place in english fiction we are still too near him to speak of the permanence of his work but a casual reading of any of his novels suggests a comparison and a contrast with george eliot like her he is a realist and a psychologist but while george eliot uses tragedy to teach a moral lesson meredith depends more upon comedy making vice not terrible but ridiculous for the hero or heroine of her novel george eliot invariably takes an individual and shows in each one the play of universal moral forces meredith constructs a typeman as a hero and makes this type express his purpose and meaning so his characters seldom speak naturally as george eliots do they are more like brownings characters in packing a whole paragraph into a single sentence or an exclamation on account of his enigmatic style and his psychology meredith will never be popular but by thoughtful men and women he will probably be ranked among our greatest writers of fiction the simplest and easiest of his novels for a beginner is the adventures of henry richmond 1871 among the best of his works besides the two mentioned above are beauchamps career 1876 and the egoist 1879 the latter is in our personal judgment one of the strongest and most convincing novels of the victorian age  hardy thomas hardy 1840 seems like meredith to belong to the present rather than to a past age and an interesting comparison may be drawn between these two novelists in style meredith is obscure and difficult while hardy is direct and simple aiming at realism in all things meredith makes man the most important phenomenon in the universe and the struggles of men are brightened by the hope of victory hardy makes man an insignificant part of the world struggling against powers greater than himselfsometimes against systems which he cannot reach or influence sometimes against a kind of grim worldspirit who delights in making human affairs go wrong he is therefore hardly a realist but rather a man blinded by pessimism and his novels though generally powerful and sometimes fascinating are not pleasant or wholesome reading from the readers view point some of his earlier works like the idyllic love story under the greenwood tree 1872 and a pair of blue eyes 1873 are the most interesting hardy became noted however when he published far from the madding crowd a book which when it appeared anonymously in the cornhill magazine 1874 was generally attributed to george eliot for the simple reason that no other novelist was supposed to be capable of writing it the return of the native 1878 and the woodlanders are generally regarded as hardys masterpieces but two novels of our own day tess of the dubervilles 1891 and jude the obscure 1895 are better expressions of hardys literary art and of his gloomy philosophy  stevenson in pleasing contrast with hardy is robert louis stevenson 18501894 a brave cheery wholesome spirit who has made us all braver and cheerier by what he has written aside from their intrinsic value stevensons novels are interesting in this respectthat they mark a return to the pure romanticism of walter scott the novel of the nineteenth century had as we have shown a very definite purpose it aimed not only to represent life but to correct it and to offer a solution to pressing moral and social problems at the end of the century hardys gloom in the face of modern social conditions became oppressive and stevenson broke away from it into that land of delightful romance in which youth finds an answer to all its questions problems differ but youth is ever the same and therefore stevenson will probably be regarded by future generations as one of our most enduring writers to his life with its heroically happy struggle first against poverty then against physical illness it is impossible to do justice in a short article even a longer biography is inadequate for stevensons spirit not the incidents of his life is the important thing and the spirit has no biographer though he had written much better work earlier he first gained fame by his treasure island 1883 an absorbing story of pirates and of a hunt for buried gold dr jekyll and mr hyde 1886 is a profound ethical parable in which however stevenson leaves the psychology and the minute analysis of character to his readers and makes the story the chief thing in his novel kidnapped 1886 the master of ballantrae 1889 and david balfour 1893 are novels of adventure giving us vivid pictures of scotch life two romances left unfinished by his early death in samoa are the weir of hermiston and st ives the latter was finished by quillercouch in 1897 the former is happily just as stevenson left it and though unfinished is generally regarded as his masterpiece in addition to these novels stevenson wrote a large number of essays the best of which are collected in virginibus puerisque familiar studies of men and books and memories and portraits delightful sketches of his travels are found in an inland voyage 1878 travels with a donkey 1879 across the plains 1892 and the amateur emigrant 1894 underwoods 1887 is an exquisite little volume of poetry and a childs garden of verses is one of the books that mothers will always keep to read to their children  in all his books stevenson gives the impression of a man at play rather than at work and the reader soon shares in the happy spirit of the author because of his beautiful personality and because of the love and admiration he awakened for himself in multitudes of readers we are naturally inclined to exaggerate his importance as a writer however that may be a study of his works shows him to be a consummate literary artist his style is always simple often perfect and both in his manner and in his matter he exercises a profound influence on the writers of the present generation   iii essayists of the victorian age  thomas babington macaulay 18001859  macaulay is one of the most typical figures of the nineteenth century though not a great writer if we compare him with browning or thackeray he was more closely associated than any of his literary contemporaries with the social and political struggles of the age while carlyle was proclaiming the gospel of labor and dickens writing novels to better the condition of the poor macaulay went vigorously to work on what he thought to be the most important task of the hour and by his brilliant speeches did perhaps more than any other single man to force the passage of the famous reform bill like many of the elizabethans he was a practical man of affairs rather than a literary man and though we miss in his writings the imagination and the spiritual insight which stamp the literary genius we have the impression always of a keen practical honest mind which looks at present problems in the light of past experience moreover the man himself with his marvelous mind his happy spirit and his absolute integrity of character is an inspiration to better living  life macaulay was born at rothley temple leicestershire in 1800 his father of scotch descent was at one time governor of the sierra leone colony for liberated negroes and devoted a large part of his life to the abolition of the slave trade his mother of quaker parentage was a brilliant sensitive woman whose character is reflected in that of her son the influence of these two and the sons loyal devotion to his family can best be read in trevelyans interesting biography  as a child macaulay is strongly suggestive of coleridge at three years of age he began to read eagerly at five he talked like a book at ten he had written a compendium of universal history besides various hymns verse romances arguments for christianity and one ambitious epic poem the habit of rapid reading begun in childhood continued throughout his life and the number and vari ety of books which he read is almost incredible his memory was phenomenal he could repeat long poems and essays after a single reading he could quote not only passages but the greater part of many books including pilgrims progress paradise lost and various novels like clarissa once to test his memory he recited two newspaper poems which he had read in a coffeehouse forty years before and which he had never thought of in the interval  at twelve years of age this remarkable boy was sent to a private school at little shelford and at eighteen he eqgered trinity college cambridge here he made a reputation as a classical scholar and a brilliant talker but made a failure of his mathematics in a letter to his mother he wrote oh for words to express my abomination of that science discipline of the mind say rather starvation confinement torture annihilation we quote this as a commentary on macaulays later writings which are frequently lacking in the exactness and the logical sequence of the science which he detested  after his college course macaulay studied law was admitted to the bar devoted himself largely to politics entered parliament in 1830 and almost immediately won a reputation as the best debater and the most eloquent speaker of the liberal or whig party gladstone says of him whenever he arose to speak it was a summons like a trumpet call to fill the benches at the time of his election he was poor and the loss of his fathers property threw upon him the support of his brothers and sisters but he took up the burden with cheerful courage and by his own efforts soon placed himself and his family in comfort his political progress was rapid and was due not to favoritism or intrigue but to his ability his hard work and his sterling character he was several times elected to parliament was legal adviser to the supreme council of india was a member of the cabinet and declined many offices for which other men labor a lifetime in 1857 his great ability and services to his country were recognized by his being raised to the peerage with the title of baron macaulay of rothley  macaulays literary work began in college with the contribution of various ballads and essays to the magazines in his later life practical affairs claimed the greater part of his time and his brilliant essays were written in the early morning or late at night his famous essay on milton appeared in the edinburgh review in 1825 it created a sensation and macaulay having gained the ear of the public never once lost it during the twenty years in which he was a contributor to the magazines his lays of ancient rome appeared in 1842 and in the following year three volumes of his collected essays in 1847 he lost his seat in parliament temporarily through his zealous efforts in behalf of religious toleration and the loss was most fortunate since it gave him opportunity to begin his history of englanda monumental work which he had been planning for many years the first two volumes appeared in 1848 and their success can be compared only to that of the most popular novels the third and fourth volumes of the history 1855 were even more successful and macaulay was hard at work on the remaining volumes when he died quite suddenly in 1859 he was buried near addison in the poets corner of westminster abbey a paragraph from one of his letters written at the height of his fame and influence may give us an insight into his life and work  i can truly say that i have not for many years been so happy as i am at present i am free i am independent i am in parliament as honorably seated as man can be my family is comfortably off i have leisure for literature yet i am not reduced to the necessity of writing for money if i had to choose a lot from all that there are in human life i am not sure that i should prefer any to that which has fallen to me i am sincerely and thoroughly contented  works of macaulay macaulay is famous in literature for his essays for his martial ballads and for his history of england his first important work the essay on milton 1825 is worthy of study not only for itself as a critical estimate of the puritan poet but as a key to all macaulays writings here first of all is an interesting work which however much we differ from the authors opinion holds our attention and generally makes us regret that the end comes so soon the second thing to note is the historical flavor of the essay we study not only milton but also the times in which he lived and the great movements of which he was a part history and literature properly belong together and macaulay was one of the first writers to explain the historical conditions which partly account for a writers work and influence the third thing to note is macaulays enthusiasm for his subjectan enthusiasm which is often partisan but which we gladly share for the moment as we follow the breathless narrative macaulay generally makes a hero of his man shows him battling against odds and the heroic side of our own nature awakens and responds to the authors plea the fourth and perhaps most characteristic thing in the essay is the style which is remarkably clear forceful and convincing jeffrey the editor of the edinburgh review wrote enthusiastically when he received the manuscript the more i think the less i can conceive where you picked up that style we still share in the editors wonder but the more we think the less we conceive that such a style could be picked up it was partly the result of a wellstored mind partly of unconscious imitation of other writers and partly of that natural talent for clear speaking and writing which is manifest in all macaulays work  in the remaining essays we find the same general qualities which characterize macaulays first attempt they cover a wide range of subjects but they may be divided into two general classes the literary or critical and the historical of the literary essays the best are those on milton addison goldsmith byron dryden leigh hunt bunyan bacon and johnson among the best known of the historical essays are those on lord clive chatham warren hastings hallams constitutional history von rankes history of the papacy frederick the great horace walpole william pitt sir william temple machiavelli and mirabeau most of these were produced in the vigor of young manhood between 1825 and 1845 while the writer was busy with practical affairs of state they are often onesided and inaccurate but always interesting and from them a large number of busy people have derived their first knowledge of history and literature  the best of macaulays poetical work is found in the lays of ancient rome 1842 a collection of ballads in the style of scott which sing of the old heroic days of the rome roman republic the ballad does not require much thought or emotion it demands clearness vigor enthusiasm action and it suited macaulays genius perfectly he was however much more careful than other ballad writers in making his narrative true to tradition the stirring martial spirit of these ballads their fine workmanship and their appeal to courage and patriotism made them instantly popular even today after more than fifty years such ballads as those on virginius and horatius at the bridge are favorite pieces in many school readers  the history of england macaulays masterpiece is still one of the most popular historical works in the english language originally it was intended to cover the period from the accession of james ii in 1685 to the death of george iv in 1830 only five volumes of the work were finished and so thoroughly did macaulay go into details that these five volumes cover only sixteen years it has been estimated that to complete the work on the same scale would require some fifty volumes and the labor of one man for over a century  in his historical method macaulay suggests gibbon his own knowledge of history was very great but before writing he read numberless pages consulted original documents and visited the scenes which he intended to describe thackerays remark that macaulay reads twenty books to write a sentence and travels one hundred miles to make a line of description is in view of his industry a wellwarranted exaggeration  as in his literary essays he is fond of making heroes and he throws himself so heartily into the spirit of the scene he is describing that his word pictures almost startle us by their vivid reality the story of monmouths rebellion for instance or the trial of the seven bishops is as fascinating as the best chapters of scotts historical novels  while macaulays search for original sources of information suggests the scientific historian his use of his material is much more like that of a novelist or playwright in his essay on machiavelli he writes the best portraits are perhaps those in which there is a slight mixture of caricature and we are not certain that the best histories are not those in which a little of the exaggeration of fictitious narrative is judiciously employed something is lost in accuracy but much is gained in effect243 whether this estimate of historical writing be true or false macaulay employed it in his own work and made his narrative as absorbing as a novel to all his characters he gives the reality of flesh and blood and in his own words he shows us over their houses and seats us at their tables all that is excellent but it has its disadvantages in his admiration for heroism macaulay makes some of his characters too good and others too bad in his zeal for details he misses the importance of great movements and of great leaders who are accustomed to ignore details and in his joy of describing events he often loses sight of underlying causes in a word he is without historical insight and his work though fascinating is seldom placed among the reliable histories of england  general characteristics to the reader who studies macaulays brilliant essays and a few chosen chapters of his history three things soon become manifest first macaulays art is that of a public speaker rather than that of a literary man he has a wonderful command of language and he makes his meaning clear by striking phrases vigorous antitheses anecdotes and illustrations his style is so clear that he who runs may read and from beginning to end he never loses the attention of his readers second macaulays good spirits and enthusiasm are contagious as he said himself he wrote out of a full head chiefly for his own pleasure or recreation and one who writes joyously generally awakens a sense of pleasure in his readers third macaulay has the defect of his qualities he reads and remembers so much that he has no time to think or to form settled opinions as gladstone said macaulay is always conversing or recollecting or reading or composing but reflecting never so he wrote his brilliant essay on milton which took all england by storm and said of it afterward that it contained scarcely a paragraph which his mature judgment approved whether he speaks or writes he has always before him an eager audience and he feels within him the born orators power to hold and fascinate so he gives loose rein to his enthusiasm quotes from a hundred books and in his delight at entertaining us forgets that the first quality of a critical or historical work is to be accurate and the second to be interesting   thomas carlyle 17951881  in marked contrast with macaulay the brilliant and cheerful essayist is thomas carlyle the prophet and censor of the nineteenth century macaulay is the practical man of affairs helping and rejoicing in the progress of his beloved england carlyle lives apart from all practical interests looks with distrust on the progress of his age and tells men that truth justice and immortality are the only worthy objects of human endeavor macaulay is delighted with material comforts he is most at home in brilliant and fashionable company and he writes even when ill and suffering with unfailing hopefulness and good nature carlyle is like a hebrew prophet just in from the desert and the burden of his message is woe to them that are at ease in zion both men are in different ways typical of the century and somewhere between the two extremesthe practical helpful activity of macaulay and the spiritual agony and conflict of carlylewe shall find the measure of an age which has left the deepest impress upon our own  life of carlyle carlyle was born at ecclefechan dumfriesshire in 1795 a few months before burnss death and before scott had published his first work like burns he came of peasant stockstrong simple godfearing folk whose influence in carlyles later life is beyond calculation of his mother he says she was too mild and peaceful for the planet she lived in and of his father a stone mason he writes could i write my books as he built his houses walk my way so manfully through this shadow world and leave it with so little blame it were more than all my hopes  of carlyles early school life we have some interesting glimpses in sartor resartus at nine years he entered the annan grammar school where he was bullied by the older boys who nicknamed him tom the tearful for the teachers of those days he has only ridicule calling them hidebound pedants and he calls the school by the suggestive german name of hinterschlag gymnasium at the wish of his parents who intended carlyle for the ministry he endured this hateful school life till 1809 when he entered edinburgh university there he spent five miserable years of which his own record is i was without friends experience or connection in the sphere of human business was of sly humor proud enough and to spare and had begun my long curriculum of dyspepsia this nagging illness was the cause of much of that irritability of temper which frequently led him to scold the public and for which he has been harshly handled by unfriendly critics  the period following his university course was one of storm and stress for carlyle much to the grief of the father whom he loved he had given up the idea of entering the ministry wherever he turned doubts like a thick fog surrounded himdoubts of god of his fellowmen of human progress of himself he was poor and to earn an honest living was his first problem he tried successively teaching school tutoring the study of law and writing miscellaneous articles for the edinburgh encyclopedia all the while he was fighting his doubts living as he says in a continual indefinite pining fear after six or seven years of mental agony which has at times a suggestion of bunyans spiritual struggle the crisis came in 1821 when carlyle suddenly shook off his doubts and found himself all at once he says in sartor there arose a thought in me and i asked myself what art thou afraid of wherefore like a coward dost thou forever pip and whimper and go cowering and trembling despicable biped what is the sum total of the worst that lies before thee death well death and say the pangs of tophet too and all that the devil and man may will or can do against thee hast thou not a heart canst thou not suffer whatsoever it be and as a child of freedom though outcast trample tophet itself under thy feet while it consumes thee let it come then i will meet it and defy it and as i so thought there rushed like a stream of fire over my whole soul and i shook base fear away from me forever this struggle between fear and faith and the triumph of the latter is recorded in two remarkable chapters the everlasting no and the everlasting yea of sartor resartus  carlyle now definitely resolved on a literary life and began with any work that offered a bare livelihood he translated legendres geometry from the french wrote numerous essays for the magazines and continued his study of german while making translations from that language his translation of goethes wilhelm meister appeared in 1824 his life of schiller in 1825 and his specimens of german romance in 1827 he began at this time a correspondence with goethe his literary hero which lasted till the german poets death in 1832 while still busy with hack work carlyle in 1826 married jane welsh a brilliant and beautiful woman whose literary genius almost equaled that of her husband soon afterwards influenced chiefly by poverty the carlyles retired to a farm at craigen puttoch hawks hill a dreary and lonely spot far from friends and even neighbors they remained here six years during which time carlyle wrote many of his best essays and sartor resartus his most original work the latter went begging among publishers for two years and was finally published serially in frasers magazine in 18331834 by this time carlyle had begun to attract attention as a writer and thinking that one who made his living by the magazines should be in close touch with the editors took his wifes advice and moved to london to seek work and bread he settled in cheyne row chelseaa place made famous by more erasmus bolingbroke smollett leigh hunt and many lesser lights of literatureand began to enjoy the first real peace he had known since childhood in 1837 appeared the french revolution which first made carlyle famous and in the same year led by the necessity of earning money he began the series of lecturesgerman literature 1837 periods of european culture 1838 revolutions of modern europe 1839 heroes and hero worship 1841which created a sensation in london it was says leigh hunt as if some puritan had come to life again liberalized by german philosophy and his own intense reflection and experience  though carlyle set himself against the spirit of his age calling the famous reform bill a progress into darkness and democracy the rule of the worst rather than the best his rough sincerity was unquestioned and his remarks were more quoted than those of any other living man he was supported moreover by a rare circle of friendsedward irving southey sterling landor leigh hunt dickens mill tennyson browning and most helpful of all emerson who had visited carlyle at craigenputtoch in 1833 it was due largely to emersons influence that carlyles works were better appreciated and brought better financial rewards in america than in england  carlyles fame reached its climax in the monumental history of frederick the great 18581865 published after thirteen years of solitary toil which in his own words made entire devastation of home life and happiness the proudest moment of his life was when he was elected to succeed gladstone as lord rector of edinburgh university in 1865 the year in which frederick the great was finished in the midst of his triumph and while he was in scotland to deliver his inaugural address his happiness was suddenly destroyed by the death of his wifea terrible blow from which he never recovered he lived on for fifteen years shorn of his strength and interest in life and his closing hours were like the dull sunset of a november day only as we remember his grief and remorse at the death of the companion who had shared his toil but not his triumph can we understand the sorrow that pervades the pages of his reminiscences he died in 1881 and at his own wish was buried not in westminster abbey but among his humble kinsfolk in ecclefechan however much we may differ from his philosophy or regret the harshness of his minor works we shall probably all agree in this sentiment from one of his own lettersthat the object of all his struggle and writing was that men should find out and believe the truth and match their lives to it  works of carlyle there are two widely different judgments of carlyle as a man and a writer the first which is founded largely on his minor writings like chartism latterday pamphlets and shooting niagara declares that he is a misanthrope and dyspeptic with a barbarous style of writing that he denounces progress democracy science america darwin everybody and everything that he does not understand that his literary opinions are largely prejudices that he began as a prophet and ended as a scold and that in denouncing shams of every sort he was something of a sham himself since his practice was not in accord with his own preaching the second judgment which is founded upon heroes and hero worship cromwell and sartor resartus declares that these works are the supreme manifestation of genius that their rugged picturesque style makes others look feeble or colorless by comparison and that the author is the greatest teacher leader and prophet of the nineteenth century  somewhere between these two extremes will be found the truth about carlyle we only note here that while there are some grounds for the first unfavorable criticism we are to judge an author by his best rather than by his worst work and that a mans aims as well as his accomplishments must be taken into consideration as it is written whereas it was in thine heart to build an house unto my name thou didst well that it was in thine heart whatever the defects of carlyle and his work in his heart he was always planning a house or temple to the god of truth and justice  carlyles important works may be divided into three general classes critical and literary essays historical works and sartor resartus the last being in a class by itself since there is nothing like it in literature to these should be added a biography the admirable life of john sterling and carlyles letters and reminiscences which are more interesting and suggestive than some of his better known works we omit here all consideration of translations and his intemperate denunciations of men and institutions in chartism latterday pamphlets and other essays which add nothing to the authors fame or influence  of the essays which are all characterized by carlyles zeal to get at the heart of things and to reveal the soul rather than the works of a writer the best are those on burns scott novalis goethe characteristics signs of the times and boswells life of johnson244 in the famous essay on burns which is generally selected for special study we note four significant things 1 carlyle is peculiarly well fitted for his task having many points in common with his hero 2 in most of his work carlyle by his style and mannerisms and positive opinions generally attracts our attention away from his subject but in this essay he shows himself capable of forgetting himself for a moment to an unusual extent he sticks to his subject and makes us think of burns rather than of carlyle the style though unpolished is fairly simple and readable and is free from the breaks crudities ejaculations and general nodulosities which disfigure much of his work 3 carlyle has an original and interesting theory of biography and criticism the object of criticism is to show the man himself his aims ideals and outlook on the universe the object of biography is to show what and how produced was the effect of society upon him what and how produced was his effect on society 4 carlyle is often severe even harsh in his estimates of other men but in this case the tragedy of burnss life of fragments attracts and softens him he grows enthusiastic anda rare thing for carlyleapologizes for his enthusiasm in the striking sentence we love burns and we pity him and love and pity are prone to magnify so he gives us the most tender and appreciative of his essays and one of the most illuminating criticisms of burns that has appeared in our language  the central idea of carlyles historical works is found in his heroes and hero worship 1841 his most widely read book universal history he says is at bottom the history of the great men who have worked here to get at the truth of history we must study not movements but men and read not state papers but the biographies of heroes his summary of history as presented in this work has six divisions 1 the hero as divinity having for its general subject odin the type norseman who carlyle thinks was some old heroic chief afterwards deified by his countrymen 2 the hero as prophet treating of mahomet and the rise of islam 3 the hero as poet in which dante and shakespeare are taken as types 4 the hero as priest or religious leader in which luther appears as the hero of the reformation and knox as the hero of puritanism 5 the hero as man of letters in which we have the curious choice of johnson rousseau and burns 6 the hero as king in which cromwell and napoleon appear as the heroes of reform by revolution  it is needless to say that heroes is not a book of history neither is it scientifically written in the manner of gibbon with science in any form carlyle had no patience and he miscalculated the value of that patient search for facts and evidence which science undertakes before building any theories either of kings or cabbages the book therefore abounds in errors but they are the errors of carelessness and are perhaps of small consequence his misconception of history however is more serious with the modern idea of history as the growth of freedom among all classes he has no sympathy the progress of democracy was to him an evil thing a turning of the face towards darkness and anarchy at certain periods according to carlyle god sends us geniuses sometimes as priests or poets sometimes as soldiers or statesmen but in whatever guise they appear these are our real rulers he shows moreover that whenever such men appear multitudes follow them and that a mans following is a sure index of his heroism and kingship  whether we agree with carlyle or not we must accept for the moment his peculiar view of history else heroes can never open its treasures to us the book abounds in startling ideas expressed with originality and power and is pervaded throughout by an atmosphere of intense moral earnestness the more we read it the more we find to admire and to remember  carlyles french revolution 1837 is to be taken more seriously as a historical work but here again his hero worship comes to the front and his book is a series of flashlights thrown upon men in dramatic situations rather than a tracing of causes to their consequences the very titles of his chaptersastraea redux windbags broglie the war goddo violence to our conception of history and are more suggestive of carlyles individualism than of french history he is here the preacher rather than the historian his text is the eternal justice and his message is that all wrongdoing is inevitably followed by vengeance his method is intensely dramatic from a mass of historical details he selects a few picturesque incidents and striking figures and his vivid pictures of the storming of the bastille the rush of the mob to versailles the death of louis xvi and the reign of terror seem like the work of an eyewitness describing some terrible catastrophe at times as it portrays danton robespierre and the great characters of the tragedy carlyles work is suggestive of an historical play of shakespeare and again as it describes the rush and riot of men led by elemental passion it is more like a great prose epic though not a reliable history in any sense it is one of the most dramatic and stirring narratives in our language  two other historical works deserve at least a passing notice the history of frederick the great 18581865 in six volumes is a colossal picture of the life and times of the hero of the prussian empire oliver cromwells letters and speeches is in our personal judgment carlyles best historical work his idea is to present the very soul of the great puritan leader he gives us as of first importance cromwells own words and connects them by a commentary in which other men and events are described with vigor and vividness cromwell was one of carlyles greatest heroes and in this case he is most careful to present the facts which occasion his own enthusiasm the result is on the whole the most lifelike picture of a great historical character that we possess other historians had heaped calumny upon cromwell till the english public regarded him with prejudice and horror and it is an indication of carlyles power that by a single book he revolutionized englands opinion of one of her greatest men  carlyles sartor resartus 1834 his only creative work is a mixture of philosophy and romance of wisdom and nonsensea chaotic jumble of the authors thoughts feelings and experiences during the first thirtyfive years of his life the title which means the tailor patchedup is taken from an old scotch song the hero is diogenes teufelsdroeckh a german professor at the university of weissnichtwo dont know where the narrative concerns this queer professors life and opinions and the central thought of the book is the philosophy of clothes which are considered symbolically as the outward expression of spirit thus mans body is the outward garment of his soul and the universe is the visible garment of the invisible god the arrangement of sartor is clumsy and hard to follow in order to leave himself free to bring in everything he thought about carlyle assumed the position of one who was translating and editing the old professors manuscripts which are supposed to consist of numerous sheets stuffed into twelve paper bags each labeled with a sign of the zodiac the editor pretends to make order out of this chaos but he is free to jump from one subject to another and to state the most startling opinion by simply using quotation marks and adding a note that he is not responsible for teufelsdroeckhs crazy notionswhich are in reality carlyles own dreams and ideals partly because of the matter which is sometimes incoherent partly because of the style which though picturesque is sometimes confused and ungrammatical sartor is not easy reading but it amply repays whatever time and study we give to it many of its passages are more like poetry than prose and one cannot read such chapters as the everlasting no the everlasting yea reminiscences and natural supernaturalism and be quite the same man afterwards for carlyles thought has entered into him and he walks henceforth more gently more reverently through the world as in the presence of the eternal  general characteristics concerning carlyles style there are almost as many opinions as there are readers this is partly because he impresses different people in widely different ways and partly because his expression varies greatly at times he is calm persuasive grimly humorous as if conversing at other times wildly exclamatory as if he were shouting and waving his arms at the reader we have spoken of macaulays style as that of the finished orator and we might reasonably speak of carlyles as that of the exhorter who cares little for methods so long as he makes a strong impression on his hearers every sentence is alive to its finger tips writes a modern critic and though carlyle often violates the rules of grammar and rhetoric we can well afford to let an original genius express his own intense conviction in his own vivid and picturesque way  carlyles message may be summed up in two imperativeslabor and be sincere he lectured and wrote chiefly for the upper classes who had begun to think somewhat sentimentally of the conditions of the laboring men of the world and he demanded for the latter not charity or pity but justice and honor all labor whether of head or hand is divine and labor alone justifies a man as a son of earth and heaven to society which carlyle thought to be occupied wholly with conventional affairs he came with the stamp of sincerity calling upon men to lay aside hypocrisy and to think and speak and live the truth he had none of addisons delicate satire and humor and in his fury at what he thought was false he was generally unsympathetic and often harsh but we must not forget that thackeraywho knew society much better than did carlylegave a very unflattering picture of it in vanity fair and the book of snobs apparently the age needed plain speaking and carlyle furnished it in scripture measure harriet martineau who knew the world for which carlyle wrote summed up his influence when she said that he had infused into the mind of the english nation  sincerity earnestness healthfulness and courage if we add to the above message carlyles conceptions of the world as governed by a god of justice who never forgets and of human history as an inarticulate bible slowly revealing the divine purpose we shall understand better the force of his ethical appeal and the profound influence he exercised on the moral and intellectual life of the past century   john ruskin 18191900  in approaching the study of ruskin we are to remember first of all that we are dealing with a great and good man who is himself more inspiring than any of his books in some respects he is like his friend carlyle whose disciple he acknowledged himself to be but he is broader in his sympathies and in every way more hopeful helpful and humane thus in the face of the drudgery and poverty of the competitive system carlyle proposed with the grim satire of swifts modest proposal to organize an annual hunt in which successful people should shoot the unfortunate and to use the game for the support of the army and navy ruskin facing the same problem wrote i will endure it no longer quietly but henceforward with any few or many who will help do my best to abate this misery then leaving the field of art criticism where he was the acknowledged leader he begins to write of labor and justice gives his fortune in charity in establishing schools and libraries and founds his st georges guild of workingmen to put in practice the principles of brotherhood and cooperation for which he and carlyle contended though his style marks him as one of the masters of english prose he is generally studied not as a literary man but as an ethical teacher and we shall hardly appreciate his works unless we see behind every book the figure of the heroically sincere man who wrote it  life ruskin was born in london in 1819 his father was a prosperous wine merchant who gained a fortune in trade and who spent his leisure hours in the company of good books and pictures on his tombstone one may still read this inscription written by ruskin he was an entirely honest merchant and his memory is to all who keep it dear and helpful his son whom he loved to the uttermost and taught to speak truth says this of him ruskins mother a devout and somewhat austere woman brought her son up with puritanical strictness not forgetting solomons injunction that the rod and reproof give wisdom  of ruskins early years at herne hill on the outskirts of london it is better to read his own interesting record in praeterita it was in some respects a cramped and lonely childhood but certain things which strongly molded his character are worthy of mention first he was taught by word and example in all things to speak the truth and he never forgot the lesson second he had few toys and spent much time in studying the leaves the flowers the grass the clouds even the figures and colors of the carpet and so laid the foundation for that minute and accurate observation which is manifest in all his writings third he was educated first by his mother then by private tutors and so missed the discipline of the public schools the influence of this lonely training is evident in all his work like carlyle he is often too positive and dogmaticthe result of failing to test his work by the standards of other men of his age fourth he was obliged to read the bible every day and to learn long passages verbatim the result of this training was he says to make every word of the scriptures familiar to my ear in habitual music we can hardly read a page of his later work without finding some reflection of the noble simplicity or vivid imagery of the sacred records fifth he traveled much with his father and mother and his innate love of nature was intensified by what he saw on his leisurely journeys through the most beautiful parts of england and the continent  ruskin entered christ church college oxford in 1836 when only seventeen years old he was at this time a shy sensitive boy a lover of nature and of every art which reflects nature but almost entirely ignorant of the ways of boys and men an attack of consumption with which he had long been threatened caused him to leave oxford in 1840 and for nearly two years he wandered over italy searching for health and cheerfulness and gathering materials for the first volume of modern painters the book that made him famous  ruskins literary work began in childhood when he was encouraged to write freely in prose and poetry a volume of poems illustrated by his own drawings was published in 1859 after he had won fame as a prose writer but save for the drawings it is of small importance the first volume of modern painters 1843 was begun as a heated defense of the artist turner but it developed into an essay on art as a true picture of nature not only in her outward aspect but in her inward spirit the work which was signed simply oxford graduate aroused a storm of mingled approval and protest but however much critics warred over its theories of art all were agreed that the unknown author was a master of descriptive prose ruskin now made frequent trips to the art galleries of the continent and produced four more volumes of modern painters during the next seventeen years meanwhile he wrote other booksseven lamps of architecture 1849 stones of venice 18511853 preraphaelitism and numerous lectures and essays which gave him a place in the world of art similar to that held by matthew arnold in the world of letters in 1869 he was appointed professor of art at oxford a position which greatly increased his prestige and influence not only among students but among a great variety of people who heard his lectures and read his published works lectures on art aratra pentelici lectures on sculpture ariadne florentina lectures on engraving michael angela and tintoret the art of england val darno lectures on tuscan art st marks rest a history of venice mornings in florence studies in christian art now much used as a guidebook to the picture galleries of florence the laws of fiesole a treatise on drawing and painting for schools academy of fine arts in venice pleasures of englandall these works on art show ruskins literary industry and we must also record loves meinie a study of birds proserpina a study of flowers deucalion a study of waves and stones besides various essays on political economy which indicate that ruskin like arnold had begun to consider the practical problems of his age  at the height of his fame in 1860 ruskin turned for a time from art to consider questions of wealth and laborterms which were used glibly by the economists of the age without much thought for their fundamental meaning there is no wealth but life announced ruskinlife including all its powers of love of joy and of admiration that country is the richest which nourishes the greatest number of noble and happy human beings such a doctrine proclaimed by goldsmith in his deserted village was regarded as a pretty sentiment but coming from one of the greatest leaders and teachers of england it was like a bombshell ruskin wrote four essays establishing this doctrine and pleading for a more socialistic form of government in which reform might be possible the essays were published in the cornhill magazine of which thackeray was editor and they aroused such a storm that the publication was discontinued ruskin then published the essays in book form with the title unto this last in 1862 munera pulveris 1862 was another work in which the principles of capital and labor and the evils of the competitive system were discussed in such a way that the author was denounced as a visionary or a madman other works of this practical period are time and tide fors clavigera sesame and lilies and the crown of wild olive  the latter part of ruskins life was a time of increasing sadness due partly to the failure of his plans and partly to public attacks upon his motives or upon his sanity he grew bitter at first as his critics ridiculed or denounced his principles and at times his voice is as querulous as that of carlyle we are to remember however the conditions under which he struggled his health had been shattered by successive attacks of disease he had been disappointed in love his marriage was unhappy and his work seemed a failure he had given nearly all his fortune in charity and the poor were more numerous than ever before his famous st georges guild was not successful and the tyranny of the competitive system seemed too deeply rooted to be overthrown on the death of his mother he left london and in 1879 retired to brantwood on coniston lake in the beautiful region beloved of wordsworth here he passed the last quiet years of his life under the care of his cousin mrs severn the angel of the house and wrote at professor nortons suggestion praeterita one of his most interesting books in which he describes the events of his youth from his own view point he died quietly in 1900 and was buried as he wished without funeral pomp or public ceremony in the little churchyard at coniston  works of ruskin there are three little books which in popular favor stand first on the list of ruskins numerous worksethicsofthedust a series of lectures to little housewives which appeals most to women crown of wild olive three lectures on work traffic and war which appeals to thoughtful men facing the problems of work and duty and sesame and lilies which appeals to men and women alike the last is the most widely known of ruskins works and the best with which to begin our reading  the first thing we notice in sesame and lilies is the symbolical title sesame taken from the story of the robbers cave in the arabian nights means a secret word or talisman which unlocks a treasure house it was intended no doubt to introduce the first part of the work called of kings treasuries which treats of books and reading lilies taken from isaiah as a symbol of beauty purity and peace introduces the second lecture of queens gardens which is an exquisite study of womans life and education these two lectures properly constitute the book but a third is added on the mystery of life the last begins in a monologue upon his own failures in life and is pervaded by an atmosphere of sadness sometimes of pessimism quite different from the spirit of the other two lectures  though the theme of the first lecture is books ruskin manages to present to his audience his whole philosophy of life he gives us with a wealth of detail a description of what constitutes a real book he looks into the meaning of words and teaches us how to read using a selection from miltons lycidas as an illustration this study of words gives us the key with which we are to unlock kings treasuries that is the books which contain the precious thoughts of the kingly minds of all ages he shows the real meaning and end of education the value of labor and of a purpose in life he treats of nature science art literature religion he defines the purpose of government showing that soullife not money or trade is the measure of national greatness and he criticises the general injustice of his age quoting a heartrending story of toil and suffering from the newspapers to show how close his theory is to daily needs here is an astonishing variety in a small compass but there is no confusion ruskins mind was wonderfully analytical and one subject develops naturally from the other  in the second lecture of queens gardens he considers the question of womans place and education which tennyson had attempted to answer in the princess ruskins theory is that the purpose of all education is to acquire power to bless and to redeem human society and that in this noble work woman must always play the leading part he searches all literature for illustrations and his description of literary heroines especially of shakespeares perfect women is unrivaled ruskin is always at his best in writing of women or for women and the lofty idealism of this essay together with its rare beauty of expression makes it on the whole the most delightful and inspiring of his works  among ruskins practical works the reader will find in fors clavigera a series of letters to workingmen and unto this last four essays on the principles of political economy the substance of his economic teachings in the latter work starting with the proposition that our present competitive system centers about the idea of wealth ruskin tries to find out what wealth is and the pith of his teaching is thisthat men are of more account than money that a mans real wealth is found in his soul not in his pocket and that the prime object of life and labor is the producing of as many as possible fullbreathed brighteyed and happy hearted human creatures to make this ideal practical ruskin makes four suggestions 1 that training schools be established to teach young men and women three thingsthe laws and practice of health habits of gentleness and justice and the trade or calling by which they are to live 2 that the government establish farms and workshops for the production of all the necessaries of life where only good and honest work shall be tolerated and where a standard of work and wages shall be maintained 3 that any person out of employment shall be received at the nearest government school if ignorant he shall be educated and if competent to do any work he shall have the opportunity to do it 4 that comfortable homes be provided for the sick and for the aged and that this be done in justice not in charity a laborer serves his country as truly as does a soldier or a statesman and a pension should be no more disgraceful in one case than in the other  among ruskins numerous books treating of art we recommend the seven lamps of architecture 1849 stones of venice 18511853 and the first two volumes of modern painters 18431846 with ruskins art theories which as sydney smith prophesied worked a complete revolution in the world of taste we need not concern ourselves here we simply point out four principles that are manifest in all his work 1 that the object of art as of every other human endeavor is to find and to express the truth 2 that art in order to be true must break away from conventionalities and copy nature 3 that morality is closely allied with art and that a careful study of any art reveals the moral strength or weakness of the people that produced it 4 that the main purpose of art is not to delight a few cultured people but to serve the daily uses of common life the giving brightness to pictures is much he says but the giving brightness to life is more in this attempt to make art serve the practical ends of life ruskin is allied with all the great writers of the period who use literature as the instrument of human progress  general characteristics one who reads ruskin is in a state of mind analogous to that of a man who goes through a picture gallery pausing now to admire a face or a landscape for its own sake and again to marvel at the technical skill of the artist without regard to his subject for ruskin is a great literary artist and a great ethical teacher and we admire one page for its style and the next for its message to humanity the best of his prose which one may find in the descriptive passages of præterita and modern painters is written in a richly ornate style with a wealth of figures and allusions and at times a rhythmic melodious quality which makes it almost equal to poetry ruskin had a rare sensitiveness to beauty in every form and more perhaps than any other writer in our language he has helped us to see and appreciate the beauty of the world around us  as for ruskins ethical teaching it appears in so many forms and in so many different works that any summary must appear inadequate for a full half century he was the apostle of beauty in england and the beauty for which he pleaded was never sensuous or pagan as in the renaissance but always spiritual appealing to the soul of man rather than to his eyes leading to better work and better living in his economic essays ruskin is even more directly and positively ethical to mitigate the evils of the unreasonable competitive system under which we labor and sorrow to bring master and man together in mutual trust and helpfulness to seek beauty truth goodness as the chief ends of life and having found them to make our characters correspond to share the best treasures of art and literature with rich and poor alike to labor always and whether we work with hand or head to do our work in praise of something that we love this sums up ruskins purpose and message and the best of it is that like chaucers country parson he practiced his doctrine before he preached it   matthew arnold 18221888  in the world of literature arnold has occupied for many years an authoritative position as critic and teacher similar to that held by ruskin in the world of art in his literary work two very different moods are manifest in his poetry he reflects the doubt of an age which witnessed the conflict between science and revealed religion apparently he never passed through any such decisive personal struggle as is recorded in sartor resartus and he has no positive conviction such as is voiced in the everlasting yea he is beset by doubts which he never settles and his poems generally express sorrow or regret or resignation in his prose he shows the cavalier spiritaggressive lighthearted selfconfident like carlyle he dislikes shams and protests against what he calls the barbarisms of society but he writes with a light touch using satire and banter as the better part of his argument carlyle denounces with the zeal of a hebrew prophet and lets you know that you are hopelessly lost if you reject his message arnold is more like the cultivated greek his voice is soft his speech suave but he leaves the impression if you happen to differ with him that you must be deficient in culture both these men so different in spirit and methods confronted the same problems sought the same ends and were dominated by the same moral sincerity  life arnold was born in laleham in the valley of the thames in 1822 his father was dr thomas arnold head master of rugby with whom many of us have grown familiar by reading tom browns school days after fitting for the university at winchester and at rugby arnold entered balliol college oxford where he was distinguished by winning prizes in poetry and by general excellence in the classics more than any other poet arnold reflects the spirit of his university the scholargipsy and thyrsis contain many references to oxford and the surrounding country but they are more noticeable for their spirit of aloofnessas if oxford men were too much occupied with classic dreams and ideals to concern themselves with the practical affairs of life  after leaving the university arnold first taught the classics at rugby then in 1847 he became private secretary to lord lansdowne who appointed the young poet to the position of inspector of schools under the government in this position arnold worked patiently for the next thirty five years traveling about the country examining teachers and correcting endless examination papers for ten years 18571867 he was professor of poetry at oxford where his famous lectures on translating homer were given he made numerous reports on english and foreign schools and was three times sent abroad to study educational methods on the continent from this it will be seen that arnold led a busy often a laborious life and we can appreciate his statement that all his best literary work was done late at night after a day of drudgery it is well to remember that while carlyle was preaching about labor arnold labored daily that his work was cheerfully and patiently done and that after the days work he hurried away like lamb to the elysian fields of literature he was happily married loved his home and especially loved children was free from all bitterness and envy and notwithstanding his cold manner was at heart sincere generous and true we shall appreciate his work better if we can see the man himself behind all that he has written  arnolds literary work divides itself into three periods which we may call the poetical the critical and the practical he had written poetry since his school days and his first volume the strayed reveller and other poems appeared anonymously in 1849 three years later he published empedocles on etna and other poems but only a few copies of these volumes were sold and presently both were withdrawn from circulation in 18531855 he published his signed poems and twelve years later appeared his last volume of poetry compared with the early work of tennyson these works met with little favor and arnold practically abandoned poetry in favor of critical writing  the chief works of his critical period are the lectures on translating homer 1861 and the two volumes of essays in criticism 18651888 which made arnold one of the best known literary men in england then like ruskin he turned to practical questions and his friendships garland 1871 was intended to satirize and perhaps reform the great middle class of england whom he called the philistines culture and anarchy the most characteristic work of his practical period appeared in 1869 these were followed by four books on religious subjectsst paul and protestantism 1870 literature and dogma 1873 god and the bible 1875 and last essays on church and religion 1877 the discourses in america 1885 completes the list of his important works at the height of his fame and influence he died suddenly in 1888 and was buried in the churchyard at laleham the spirit of his whole life is well expressed in a few lines of one of his own early sonnets      one lesson nature let me learn of thee     one lesson which in every wind is blown     one lesson of two duties kept at one     though the loud world proclaim their enmity     of toil unseverd from tranquillity     of labour that in lasting fruit outgrows     far noisier schemes accomplishd in repose     too great for haste too high for rivalry  works of matthew arnold we shall better appreciate arnolds poetry if we remember two things first he had been taught in his home a simple and devout faith in revealed religion and in college he was thrown into a world of doubt and questioning he faced these doubts honestly reverentlyin his heart longing to accept the faith of his fathers but in his head demanding proof and scientific exactness the same struggle between head and heart between reason and intuition goes on today and that is one reason why arnolds poetry which wavers on the borderland between doubt and faith is a favorite with many readers second arnold as shown in his essay on the study of poetry regarded poetry as a criticism of life under the conditions fixed for such criticism by the laws of poetic truth and poetic beauty naturally one who regards poetry as a criticism will write very differently from one who regards poetry as the natural language of the soul he will write for the head rather than for the heart and will be cold and critical rather than enthusiastic according to arnold each poem should be a unit and he protested against the tendency of english poets to use brilliant phrases and figures of speech which only detract attention from the poem as a whole for his models he went to greek poetry which he regarded as the only sure guidance to what is sound and true in poetical art arnold is however more indebted than he thinks to english masters especially to wordsworth and milton whose influence is noticeable in a large part of his poetry  of arnolds narrative poems the two best known are balder dead 1855 an incursion into the field of norse mythology which is suggestive of gray and sohrab and rustum 1853 which takes us into the field of legendary persian history the theme of the latter poem is taken from the shah namah book of kings of the persian poet firdausi who lived and wrote in the eleventh century  briefly the story is of one rustem or rustum a persian achilles who fell asleep one day when he had grown weary of hunting while he slept a band of robbers stole his favorite horse ruksh in trailing the robbers rustum came to the palace of the king of samengan where he was royally welcomed and where he fell in love with the kings daughter temineh and married her but he was of a roving adventurous disposition and soon went back to fight among his own people the persians while he was gone his son sohrab was born grew to manhood and became the hero of the turan army war arose between the two peoples and two hostile armies were encamped by the oxus each army chose a champion and rustum and sohrab found themselves matched in mortal combat between the lines at this point sohrab whose chief interest in life was to find his father demanded to know if his enemy were not rustum but the latter was disguised and denied his identity on the first day of the fight rustum was overcome but his life was spared by a trick and by the generosity of sohrab on the second day rustum prevailed and mortally wounded his antagonist then he recognized his own son by a gold bracelet which he had long ago given to his wife temineh the two armies rushing into battle were stopped by the sight of father and son weeping in each others arms sohrab died the war ceased and rustum went home to a life of sorrow and remorse  using this interesting material arnold produced a poem which has the rare and difficult combination of classic reserve and romantic feeling it is written in blank verse and one has only to read the first few lines to see that the poet is not a master of his instrument the lines are seldom harmonious and we must frequently change the accent of common words or lay stress on unimportant particles to show the rhythm arnold frequently copies milton especially in his repetition of ideas and phrases but the poem as a whole is lacking in miltons wonderful melody  the classic influence on sohrab and rustum is especially noticeable in arnolds use of materials fights are short grief is long therefore the poet gives few lines to the combat but lingers over the sons joy at finding his father and the fathers quenchless sorrow at the death of his son the last lines especially with their passionate grief set to solemn music make this poem one of the best on the whole that arnold has written and the exquisite ending where the oxus unmindful of the trivial strifes of men flows on sedately to join his luminous home of waters is most suggestive of the poets conception of the orderly life of nature in contrast with the doubt and restlessness of human life  next in importance to the narrative poems are the elegies thyrsis the scholargipsy memorial verses a southern night obermann stanzas from the grande chartreuse and rugby chapel all these are worthy of careful reading but the best is thyrsis a lament for the poet clough which is sometimes classed with miltons lycidas and shelleys adonais among the minor poems the reader will find the best expression of arnolds ideals and methods in dover beach the love lyrics entitled switzerland requiescat shakespeare the future kensington gardens philomela human life callicless song morality and geists gravethe last being an exquisite tribute to a little dog which like all his kind had repaid our scant crumbs of affection with a whole lifes devotion  the first place among arnolds prose works must be given to the essays in criticism which raised the author to the front rank of living critics his fundamental idea of criticism appeals to us strongly the business of criticism he says is neither to find fault nor to display the critics own learning or influence it is to know the best which has been thought and said in the world and by using this knowledge to create a current of fresh and free thought if a choice must be made among these essays which are all worthy of study we would suggest the study of poetry wordsworth byron and emerson the lastnamed essay which is found in the discourses in america is hardly a satisfactory estimate of emerson but its singular charm of manner and its atmosphere of intellectual culture make it perhaps the most characteristic of arnolds prose writings  among the works of arnolds practical period there are two which may be taken as typical of all the rest literature and dogma 1873 is in general a plea for liberality in religion arnold would have us read the bible for instance as we would read any other great work and apply to it the ordinary standards of literary criticism  culture and anarchy 1869 contains most of the termsculture sweetness and light barbarian philistine hebraism and many otherswhich are now associated with arnolds work and influence the term barbarian refers to the aristocratic classes whom arnold thought to be essentially crude in soul notwithstanding their good clothes and superficial graces philistine refers to the middle classesnarrowminded and selfsatisfied people according to arnold whom he satirizes with the idea of opening their minds to new ideas hebraism is arnolds term for moral education carlyle had emphasized the hebraic or moral element in life and arnold undertook to preach the hellenic or intellectual element which welcomes new ideas and delights in the arts that reflect the beauty of the world the uppermost idea with hellenism he says is to see things as they are the uppermost idea with hebraism is conduct and obedience with great clearness sometimes with great force and always with a play of humor and raillery aimed at the philistines arnold pleads for both these elements in life which together aim at culture that is at moral and intellectual perfection  general characteristics arnolds influence in our literature may be summed up in a word as intellectual rather than inspirational one cannot be enthusiastic over his poetry for the simple reason that he himself lacked enthusiasm he is however a true reflection of a very real mood of the past century the mood of doubt and sorrow and a future generation may give him a higher place than he now holds as a poet though marked by the elemental note of sadness all arnolds poems are distinguished by clearness simplicity and the restrained emotion of his classic models  as a prose writer the cold intellectual quality which mars his poetry by restraining romantic feeling is of first importance since it leads him to approach literature with an open mind and with the single desire to find the best which has been thought and said in the world we cannot yet speak with confidence of his rank in literature but by his crystalclear style his scientific spirit of inquiry and comparison illumined here and there by the play of humor and especially by his broad sympathy and intellectual culture he seems destined to occupy a very high place among the masters of literary criticism   john henry newman 18011890  any record of the prose literature of the victorian era which includes the historical essays of macaulay and the art criticism of ruskin should contain also some notice of its spiritual leaders for there was never a time when the religious ideals that inspire the race were kept more constantly before mens minds through the medium of literature  among the religious writers of the age the first place belongs unquestionably to cardinal newman whether we consider him as a man with his powerful yet gracious personality or as a religious reformer who did much to break down old religious prejudices by showing the underlying beauty and consistency of the roman church or as a prose writer whose style is as near perfection as we have ever reached newman is one of the most interesting figures of the whole nineteenth century  life three things stand out clearly in newmans life first his unshaken faith in the divine companionship and guidance second his desire to find and to teach the truth of revealed religion third his quest of an authoritative standard of faith which should remain steadfast through the changing centuries and amid all sorts and conditions of men the first led to that rare and beautiful spiritual quality which shines in all his work the second to his frequent doctrinal and controversial essays the third to his conversion to the catholic church which he served as priest and teacher for the last fortyfive years of his life perhaps we should add one more characteristicthe practical bent of his religion for he was never so busy with study or controversy that he neglected to give a large part of his time to gentle ministration among the poor and needy  he was born in london in 1801 his father was an english banker his mother a member of a french huguenot family was a thoughtful devout woman who brought up her son in a way which suggests the mother of ruskin of his early training his reading of doctrinal and argumentative works and of his isolation from material things in the thought that there were two and only two absolute and luminously selfevident beings in the world himself and his creator it is better to read his own record in the apologia which is a kind of spiritual biography  at the age of fifteen newman had begun his profound study of theological subjects for science literature art natureall the broad interests which attracted other literary men of his agehe cared little his mind being wholly occupied with the history and doctrines of the christian church to which he had already devoted his life he was educated first at the school in ealing then at oxford taking his degree in the latter place in 1820 though his college career was not more brilliant than that of many unknown men his unusual ability was recognized and he was made a fellow of oriel college retaining the fellowship and leading a scholarly life for over twenty years in 1824 he was ordained in the anglican church and four years later was chosen vicar of st marys at oxford where his sermons made a deep impression on the cultivated audiences that gathered from far and near to hear him  a change is noticeable in newmans life after his trip to the mediterranean in 1832 he had begun his life as a calvinist but while in oxford then the center of religious unrest he described himself as drifting in the direction of liberalism then study and bereavement and an innate mysticism led him to a profound sympathy with the mediæval church he had from the beginning opposed catholicism but during his visit to italy where he saw the roman church at the center of its power and splendor many of his prejudices were overcome in this enlargement of his spiritual horizon newman was greatly influenced by his friend hurrell froude with whom he made the first part of the journey his poems of this period afterwards collected in the lyra apostolica among which is the famous lead kindly light are noticeable for their radiant spirituality but one who reads them carefully sees the beginning of that mental struggle which ended in his leaving the church in which he was born thus he writes of the catholic church whose services he had attended as one who in a foreign land receives the gifts of a good samaritan      o that thy creed were sound       for thou dost soothe the heart thou church of rome     by thy unwearied watch and varied round       of service in thy saviours holy home     i cannot walk the citys sultry streets     but the wide porch invites to still retreats       where passions thirst is calmed and cares unthankful gloom  on his return to england in 1833 he entered into the religious struggle known as the oxford or tractarian movement245 and speedily became its acknowledged leader those who wish to follow this attempt at religious reform which profoundly affected the life of the whole english church will find it recorded in the tracts for the times twentynine of which were written by newman and in his parochial and plain sermons 1837 1843 after nine years of spiritual conflict newman retired to littlemore where with a few followers he led a life of almost monastic seclusion still striving to reconcile his changing belief with the doctrines of his own church two years later he resigned his charge at st marys and left the anglican communionnot bitterly but with a deep and tender regret his last sermon at littlemore on the parting of friends still moves us profoundly like the cry of a prophet torn by personal anguish in the face of duty in 1845 he was received into the catholic church and the following year at rome he joined the community of st philip neri the saint of gentleness and kindness as newman describes him and was ordained to the roman priesthood  by his preaching and writing newman had exercised a strong influence over his cultivated english hearers and the effect of his conversion was tremendous into the theological controversy of the next twenty years we have no mind to enter through it all newman retained his serenity and though a master of irony and satire kept his literary power always subordinate to his chief aim which was to establish the truth as he saw it whether or not we agree with his conclusions we must all admire the spirit of the man which is above praise or criticism his most widely read work apologia pro vita sua 1864 was written in answer to an unfortunate attack by charles kingsley which would long since have been forgotten had it not led to this remarkable book in 1854 newman was appointed rector of the catholic university in dublin but after four years returned to england and founded a catholic school at edgbaston in 1879 he was made cardinal by pope leo xiii the grace and dignity of his life quite as much as the sincerity of his apologia had long since disarmed criticism and at his death in 1890 the thought of all england might well be expressed by his own lines in the dream of gerontius      i had a dream yes some one softly said       hes gone and then a sigh went round the room     and then i surely heard a priestly voice         cry subvenite and they knelt in prayer  works of newman readers approach newman from so many different motives some for doctrine some for argument some for a pure prose style that it is difficult to recommend the best works for the beginners use as an expression of newmans spiritual struggle the apologia pro vita sua is perhaps the most significant this book is not light reading and one who opens it should understand clearly the reasons for which it was written newman had been accused of insincerity not only by kingsley but by many other men in the public press his retirement to solitude and meditation at littlemore had been outrageously misunderstood and it was openly charged that his conversion was a cunningly devised plot to win a large number of his followers to the catholic church this charge involved others and it was to defend them as well as to vindicate himself that newman wrote the apologia the perfect sincerity with which he traced his religious history showing that his conversion was only the final step in a course he had been following since boyhood silenced his critics and revolutionized public opinion concerning himself and the church which he had joined as the revelation of a souls history and as a model of pure simple unaffected english this book entirely apart from its doctrinal teaching deserves a high place in our prose literature  in newmans doctrinal works the via media the grammar of assent and in numerous controversial essays the student of literature will have little interest much more significant are his sermons the unconscious reflection of a rare spiritual nature of which professor shairp said his power shows itself clearly in the new and unlookedfor way in which he touched into life old truths moral or spiritual and as he spoke how the old truth became new and how it came home with a meaning never felt before he laid his finger how gently yet how powerfully on some inner place in the hearers heart and told him things about himself he had never known till then subtlest truths which would have taken philosophers pages of circumlocution and big words to state were dropped out by the way in a sentence or two of the most transparent saxon of greater interest to the general reader are the idea of a university discourses delivered at dublin and his two works of fiction loss and gain treating of a mans conversion to catholicism and callista which is in his own words an attempt to express the feelings and mutual relations of christians and heathens in the middle of the third century the latter is in our judgment the most readable and interesting of newmans works the character of callista a beautiful greek sculptor of idols is powerfully delineated the style is clear and transparent as air and the story of the heroines conversion and death makes one of the most fascinating chapters in fiction though it is not the story so much as the authors unconscious revelation of himself that charms us it would be well to read this novel in connection with kingsleys hypatia which attempts to reconstruct the life and ideals of the same period  newmans poems are not so well known as his prose but the reader who examines the lyra apostolica and verses on various occasions will find many short poems that stir a religious nature profoundly by their pure and lofty imagination and future generations may pronounce one of these poems the dream of gerontius to be newmans most enduring work this poem aims to reproduce the thoughts and feelings of a man whose soul is just quitting the body and who is just beginning a new and greater life both in style and in thought the dream is a powerful and original poem and is worthy of attention not only for itself but as a modern critic suggests as a revelation of that high spiritual purpose which animated newmans life from beginning to end  of newmans style it is as difficult to write as it would be to describe the dress of a gentleman we had met who was so perfectly dressed that we paid no attention to his clothes his style is called transparent because at first we are not conscious of his manner and unobtrusive because we never think of newman himself but only of the subject he is discussing he is like the best french prose writers in expressing his thought with such naturalness and apparent ease that without thinking of style we receive exactly the impression which he means to convey in his sermons and essays he is wonderfully simple and direct in his controversial writings gently ironical and satiric and the satire is pervaded by a delicate humor but when his feelings are aroused he speaks with poetic images and symbols and his eloquence is like that of the old testament prophets like ruskins his style is modeled largely on that of the bible but not even ruskin equals him in the poetic beauty and melody of his sentences on the whole he comes nearer than any other of his age to our ideal of a perfect prose writer  other essayists of the victorian age we have selected the above five essayists macaulay carlyle arnold newman and ruskin as representative writers of the victorian age but there are many others who well repay our study notable among these are john addington symonds author of the renaissance in italy undoubtedly his greatest work and of many critical essays walter pater whose appreciations and numerous other works mark him as one of our best literary critics and leslie stephen famous for his work on the monumental dictionary of national biography and for his hours in a library a series of impartial and excellent criticisms brightened by the play of an original and delightful humor  among the most famous writers of the age are the scientists lyell darwin huxley spencer tyndall and wallacea wonderful group of men whose works though they hardly belong to our present study have exercised an incalculable influence on our life and literature darwins origin of species 1859 which apparently established the theory of evolution was an epochmaking book it revolutionized not only our conceptions of natural history but also our methods of thinking on all the problems of human society those who would read a summary of the greatest scientific discovery of the age will find it in wallaces darwinisma most interesting book written by the man who claims with darwin the honor of first announcing the principle of evolution and from a multitude of scientific works we recommend also to the general reader huxleys autobiography and his lay sermons addresses and reviews partly because they are excellent expressions of the spirit and methods of science and partly because huxley as a writer is perhaps the clearest and the most readable of the scientists  the spirit of modern literature as we reflect on the varied work of the victorian writers three marked characteristics invite our attention first our great literary men no less than our great scientists have made truth the supreme object of human endeavor all these eager poets novelists and essayists questing over so many different ways are equally intent on discovering the truth of life men as far apart as darwin and newman are strangely alike in spirit one seeking truth in the natural the other in the spiritual history of the race second literature has become the mirror of truth and the first requirement of every serious novel or essay is to be true to the life or the facts which it represents third literature has become animated by a definite moral purpose it is not enough for the victorian writers to create or attempt an artistic work for its own sake the work must have a definite lesson for humanity the poets are not only singers but leaders they hold up an ideal and they compel men to recognize and follow it the novelists tell a story which pictures human life and at the same time call us to the work of social reform or drive home a moral lesson the essayists are nearly all prophets or teachers and use literature as the chief instrument of progress and education among them all we find comparatively little of the exuberant fancy the romantic ardor and the boyish gladness of the elizabethans they write books not primarily to delight the artistic sense but to give bread to the hungry and water to the thirsty in soul miltons famous sentence a good book is the precious lifeblood of a master spirit might be written across the whole victorian era we are still too near these writers to judge how far their work suffers artistically from their practical purpose but this much is certainthat whether or not they created immortal works their books have made the present world a better and a happier place to live in and that is perhaps the best that can be said of the work of any artist or artisan  summary of the victorian age the year 1830 is generally placed at the beginning of this period but its limits are very indefinite in general we may think of it as covering the reign of victoria 18371901 historically the age is remarkable for the growth of democracy following the reform bill of 1832 for the spread of education among all classes for the rapid development of the arts and sciences for important mechanical inventions and for the enormous extension of the bounds of human knowledge by the discoveries of science  at the accession of victoria the romantic movement had spent its force wordsworth had written his best work the other romantic poets coleridge shelley keats and byron had passed away and for a time no new development was apparent in english poetry though the victorian age produced two great poets tennyson and browning the age as a whole is remarkable for the variety and excellence of its prose a study of all the great writers of the period reveals four general characteristics 1 literature in this age has come very close to daily life reflecting its practical problems and interests and is a powerful instrument of human progress 2 the tendency of literature is strongly ethical all the great poets novelists and essayists of the age are moral teachers 3 science in this age exercises an incalculable influence on the one hand it emphasizes truth as the sole object of human endeavor it has established the principle of law throughout the universe and it has given us an entirely new view of life as summed up in the word evolution that is the principle of growth or development from simple to complex forms on the other hand its first effect seems to be to discourage works of the imagination though the age produced an incredible number of books very few of them belong among the great creative works of literature 4 though the age is generally characterized as practical and materialistic it is significant that nearly all the writers whom the nation delights to honor vigorously attack materialism and exalt a purely ideal conception of life on the whole we are inclined to call this an idealistic age fundamentally since love truth justice brotherhoodall great idealsare emphasized as the chief ends of life not only by its poets but also by its novelists and essayists  in our study we have considered 1 the poets the life and works of tennyson and browning and the chief characteristics of the minor poets elizabeth barrett mrs browning rossetti morris and swinburne 2 the novelists the life and works of dickens thackeray and george eliot and the chief works of charles reade anthony trollope charlotte brontë bulwerlytton kingsley mrs gaskell blackmore george meredith hardy and stevenson 3 the essayists the life and works of macaulay matthew arnold carlyle newman and ruskin these were selected from among many essayists and miscellaneous writers as most typical of the victorian age the great scientists like lyell darwin huxley wallace tyndall and spencer hardly belong to our study of literature though their works are of vast importance and we omit the works of living writers who belong to the present rather than to the past century   selections for reading manlys english poetry and manlys english prose ginn and company

immortality as expressed in in memoriam  3 browning in what respects is browning like shakespeare what is meant by the optimism of his poetry can you explain why many thoughtful persons prefer him to

this book includes two lists one of selected readings the other of special works treating of the history and literature of the period under consideration the following lists include the books most useful for general reference work and for supplementary reading  a knowledge of history is of great advantage in the study of literature in each of the preceding chapters we have given a brief summary of historical events and social conditions but the student should do more than simply read these summaries he should review rapidly the whole history of each period by means of a good textbook montgomerys english history and cheyneys short history of england are recommended but any other reliable textbook will serve the purpose  for literary texts and selections for reading a few general collections such as are given below are useful but the important works of each author may now be obtained in excellent and inexpensive school editions at the beginning of the course the teacher or the home student should write for the latest catalogue of such publications as the standard english classics everymans library etc which offer a very wide range of reading at small cost nearly every

it refers probably to some legend of the anglosaxons which we have supplied from other sources aided by some vague suggestions and glimpses of the past in the poem itself  footnote 3   this is not the beowulf who is hero of the poem  footnote 4   beowulf ll 2650 a free rendering to suggest the alliteration of the original  footnote 5   grendel of the eoten giant race the death shadow the mark stalker the shadow ganger is also variously called gods foe fiend of hell cains brood etc it need hardly be explained that the latter terms are additions to the original poem made probably by monks who copied the manuscript a belief in wyrd the mighty power controlling the destinies of men is the chief religious motive of the epic in line 1056 we find a curious blending of pagan and christian belief where wyrd is withstood by the wise god  footnote 6   summary of ll 710727 we have not indicated in our translation or in quotations from garnett morley brooke etc where parts of the text are

eormanric who died cir 375 and queen ealhhild whose father eadwin died cir 561 the difficulty of fixing a date to the poem is apparent it contains several references to scenes and characters in beowulf  footnote 15   lines 135143 morleys version  footnote 16   a lyric is a short poem reflecting some personal emotion like love or grief two other anglosaxon poems the wifes complaint and the

cynewulf uses each rune to represent not only a letter but a word beginning with that letter thus the runeequivalent of c stands for cene keen courageous y for yfel evil in the sense of wretched n for nyd need w for ivyn joy u for ur our l for lagu lake f for feoh fee wealth using the runes equivalent to these seven letters cynewulf hides and at the same time reveals his name in certain verses of the christ for instance      then the couragehearted quakes when the king lord he hears     speak to those who once on earth but obeyed him weakly     while as yet their yearning fain and their need     most easily comfort might discover gone is then the winsomeness     of the earths adornments what to us as men belonged     of the joys of life was locked long ago in lakeflood     all the fee on

poetry  footnote 34   the source of andreas is an early greek legend of st andrew that found its way to england and was probably known to cynewulf in some brief latin form now lost  footnote 35   our two chief sources are the famous exeter book in exeter cathedral a collection of anglosaxon poems presented by bishop leofric c 1050 and the vercelli book discovered in the monastery of vercelli italy in 1822 the only known manuscript of beowulf was discovered c 1600 and is now in the cotton library of the british museum all these are fragmentary copies and show the marks of fire and of hard usage the exeter book contains the christ guthlac the phoenix juliana widsith the seafarer deors lament the wifes complaint the lovers message ninetyfive riddles and many short hymns and fragmentsan astonishing variety for a single manuscript  footnote 36   from alfreds boethius  footnote 37   it is not certain that the translation of bede is the work of alfred  footnote 38   see translations from old english poetry only a brief account of the fight is given in the chronicle the song known as the battle of maldon or byrhtnoths death is recorded in another manuscript  footnote 39   this is an admirable little book containing the cream of anglosaxon poetry in free translations with notes translations from old english prose is a companion volume  footnote 40   for full titles and publishers of general reference books and for a list of inexpensive texts and helps see general bibliography at the end of this book  footnote 41   the chief object of these questions is not to serve as a review or to prepare for examination but rather to set the student thinking for himself about what he has read a few questions of an advanced nature are inserted which call for special study and research in interesting fields  footnote 42   a romance language is one whose basis is latinnot the classic language of literature but a vulgar or popular latin spoken in the military camps and provinces thus italian spanish and french were originally different dialects of the vulgar latin slightly modified by the mingling of the roman soldiers with the natives of the conquered provinces  footnote 43   see p 51  footnote 44   it is interesting to note that all the chroniclers of the period whether of english or norman birth unite in admiration of the great figures of english history as it was then understood brutus arthur hengist horsa edward the confessor and william of normandy are all alike set down as english heroes in a french poem of the thirteenth century for instance we read that there is no land in the world where so many good kings and saints have lived as in the isle of the english  such as the strong and brave arthur edmund and cnut this national poem celebrating the english edward was written in french by a norman monk of westminster abbey and its first heroes are a celt a saxon and a dane see jusserand literary history of the english people i 112 ff  footnote 45   english literature from the norman conquest to chaucer  footnote 46   anselm was an italian by birth but wrote his famous work while holding the see of canterbury  footnote 47   during the roman occupancy of britain occurred a curious mingling of celtic and roman traditions the welsh began to associate their national hero arthur with roman ancestors hence the story of brutus greatgrandson of aeneas the first king of britain as related by geoffrey and layamon  footnote 48   probably a latin copy of bede  footnote 49   waces translation of geoffrey  footnote 50   only one word in about three hundred and fifty is of french origin a century later robert mannyng uses one french word in eighty while chaucer has one in six or seven this includes repetitions and is a fair estimate rather than an exact computation  footnote 51   the matter of britain refers strictly to the arthurian ie the welsh romances and so another division the matter of england may be noted this includes tales of popular english heroes like bevis of hampton guy of warwick horn child etc  footnote 52   according to mediæval literary custom these songs were rarely signed later when many songs were made over into a long poem the author signed his name to the entire work without indicating what he had borrowed  footnote 53   an english book in which such romances were written was called a gest or jest book so also at the beginning of cursor mundi c 1320 we read      men yernen jestis for to here     and romaunce rede in diverse manere  and then follows a summary of the great cycles of romance which we are considering  footnote 54   tennyson goes farther than malory in making gawain false and irreverent that seems to be a mistake for in all the earliest romances gawain is next to arthur the noblest of knights the most loved and honored of all the heroes of the round table  footnote 55   there were various french versions of the story but it came originally from the irish where the hero was called cuchulinn  footnote 56   it is often alleged that in this romance we have a very poetical foundation for the order of the garter which was instituted by edward iii in 1349 but the history of the order makes this extremely doubtful the reader will be chiefly interested in comparing this romance with beowulf for instance to see what new ideals have taken root in england  footnote 57   originally

for the typography of titles the author has adopted the plan of putting the titles of all books and of all important works generally regarded as single books in italics individual poems essays etc are in roman letters with quotation marks thus we have the knights tale or the story of palamon and arcite in the canterbury tales this system seems on the whole the best though it may result in some

mandeville describes the lands and customs he has seen and brings in all the wonders he has heard about many things he has seen himself he tells us and these are certainly true but others he has heard

travelers here are the dogfaced men and birds that carry off elephants and giants twentyeight feet tall and dangerous women who have bright jewels in their heads instead of eyes and if they behold any man in wrath they slay him with a look as doth the basilisk here also are the folk of ethiopia who have only one leg but who hop about with extraordinary rapidity their one foot is so big that when they lie in the sun they raise it to shade their bodies in rainy weather it is as good as an umbrella at the close of this interesting book of travel which is a guide for pilgrims the author promises

indebted to the norman love of pageantry for the development of the drama in england is an unanswered question during the middle ages it was customary in welcoming a monarch or in celebrating a royal wedding to represent allegorical and mythological scenes like the combat of st george and the dragon for instance on a stage constructed for the purpose these pageants were popular all over europe and developed during the renaissance into the dramatic form known as the masque though the drama was of religious origin we must not overlook these secular pageants as an important factor in the development of dramatic art  footnote 128   miracles were acted on the continent earlier than this the normans undoubtedly brought religious plays with them but it is probable that they began in england before the conquest 1066 see manly specimens of the preshaksperean drama i xix  footnote 129   see jusserand a literary history of the english people i iii vi for our earliest plays and their authors see gayley plays of our forefathers  footnote 130   these three periods are not historically accurate the author uses them to emphasize three different views of our earliest plays rather than to suggest that there was any orderly or chronological development from miracle to morality and thence to the interludes the latter is a prevalent opinion but it seems hardly warranted by the facts thus though the miracles precede the moralities by two centuries the first known morality the play of the lords prayer mentioned by wyclif was given probably about 1375 some of the best known moralities like pride of life precede many of the later york miracles and the term interlude which is often used as symbolical of the transition from the moral to the artistic period of the drama was occasionally used in england fourteenth century as synonymous with miracle and again sixteenth century as synonymous with comedy that the drama had these three stages seems reasonably certain but it is impossible to fix the limits of any one of them and all three are sometimes seen together in one of the later miracles of the wakefield cycle  footnote 131   in fact heywood cribbed from chaucers tales in another interlude called the pardoner and the frere  footnote 132   schelling elizabethan drama i 86  footnote 133   that these gallants were an unmitigated nuisance and had frequently to be silenced by the common people who came to enjoy the play seems certain dekkers gulls hornbook 1609 has an interesting chapter on how a gallant should behave himself in a playhouse  footnote 134   the first actors were classed with thieves and vagabonds but they speedily raised their profession to an art and won a reputation which extended far abroad thus a contemporary fynes moryson writes in his itinerary so i remember that when some of our cast despised stage players came  into germany and played at franckford  having nether a complete number of actors nor any good aparell nor any ornament

baker in his development of shakespeare as a dramatist pp 5762 takes a different view and shows how carefully many of the boy actors were trained it would require however a vigorous use of the imagination to be satisfied with a boys presentation of portia juliet cordelia rosalind or any other of shakespeares wonderful women  footnote 137   these choir masters had royal permits to take boys

doctrine which abolishes the divine right of kings but hobbes immediately destroys democracy by another doctrinethat the power given by the people to the ruler could not be taken away hence the

liberty and the pursuit of happiness the origin and basis of government is in the consent of the governedthese and many more familiar and striking expressions are from locke it is interesting to note

feeling is often manifest in the poetry of donne herbert vaughan and herrick  footnote 186   we have endeavored here simply to show the meaning of terms in general use in our literature but it must be remembered that it is impossible to classify or to give a descriptive name to the writers of any period or century while classic or pseudoclassic may apply to a part of eighteenthcentury literature every age has both its romantic and its classic movements in this period the revolt against classicism is shown in the revival of romantic poetry under gray collins burns and thomson and in the beginning of the english novel under defoe richardson and fielding these poets and novelists who have little or no connection with classicism belong chronologically to the period we are studying they are reserved for special treatment in the sections following  footnote 187   popes satires for instance are strongly suggested in boileau his rape of the lock is much like the mockheroic le lutrin and the essay on criticism which made him famous is an english edition and improvement of lart poétique the last was in turn a combination of the ars poetica of horace and of many wellknown rules of the classicists  footnote 188   these are the four kinds of spirits inhabiting the four elements according to the rosicruciansa fantastic sect of spiritualists of that age in the dedication of the poem

inhabited by writers of small histories dictionaries and temporary poems whence any mean production is called grubstreet  footnote 196   from macaulays review of boswells life of johnson  footnote 197   many of the writers show a mingling of the classic and the romantic tendencies thus goldsmith followed johnson and opposed the romanticists but his deserted village is romantic in spirit though its classic couplets are almost as mechanical as popes so burkes orations are elegantly classic in style but are illumined by bursts of emotion and romantic feeling  footnote 198   a much more interesting work is thomas paines rights of man which was written in answer to burkes essay and which had enormous influence in england and america  footnote 199   in the same year 1775 in which burkes magnificent conciliation oration was delivered patrick henry made a remarkable little speech before a gathering of delegates in virginia both men were pleading the same cause of justice and were actuated by the same high ideals a very interesting contrast however may be drawn between the methods and the effects of henrys speech and of burkes more brilliant oration burke makes us wonder at his learning his brilliancy his eloquence but he does not move us to action patrick henry calls us and we spring to follow him that suggests the essential difference between the two orators  footnote 200   the romantic revival is marked by renewed interest in mediæval ideals and literature and to this interest is due the success of walpoles romance the castle of otranto and of chattertons forgeries

applied appeared almost simultaneously in england france and germany the rapid development of the english novel had an immense influence in all european nations  footnote 212   the name romance was given at first to any story in one of the romance languages like the french metrical romances which we have considered because these stories were brought to england at a time when the childish mind of the middle ages delighted in the most impossible stories the name romance was retained to cover any work of the unbridled imagination  footnote 213   this division of works of fiction into romances and novels is a somewhat arbitrary one but it seems on the whole the most natural and the most satisfactory many writers use the generic term novel to include all prose fiction they divide novels into two classes stories and romances the story being a form of the novel which relates certain incidents of life with as little complexity as possible and the romance being a form of novel which describes life as led by strong emotions into complex and unusual circumstances novels are otherwise divided into novels of personality like vicar of wakefield and silas marner historical novels ivanhoe novels of romance like lorna doone and novels of purpose like oliver twist and uncle toms cabin all such classifications are imperfect and the best of them is open to objections  footnote 214   one of these tales was called the wonderful things beyond thule it is the story of a youth dinias who for love of a girl dercyllis did heroic things and undertook many adventures including a journey to the frozen north and another to the moon a second tale ephesiaca is the story of a man and a maid each of whom scoffs at love they meet and fall desperately in love but the course of true love does not run smooth and they separate and suffer and go through many perils before they live happily ever after this tale is the source of the mediæval story apollonius of tyre which is used in gowers confessio

adventure is here inward rather than outward it faces a ghost instead of a dragon and for this work a nun with her beads is better than a knight in armor so heroines abound instead of heroes the age

nineteenth century the term was first used by a brotherhood of german artists who worked together in the convent of san isodoro in rome with the idea of restoring art to its mediæval purity and simplicity the term now generally refers to a company of seven young mendante gabriel rossetti and his brother william william holman hunt john everett millais james collinson frederick george stevens and thomas woolner who formed the preraphaelite brotherhood in england in 1848 their official literary organ was called the germ in which much of the early work of morris and rossetti appeared they took for their models the early italian painters who they declared were simple sincere and religious their purpose was to encourage simplicity and naturalness in art and literature and one of their chief objects in the face of doubt and materialism was to express the wonder reverence and awe which characterizes mediæval art in its return to the mysticism and symbolism of the mediæval age this

to the preraphaelite movement in art both protested against the materialism of the age and both went back for their models to the middle ages originally the movement was intended to bring new life to the anglican church by a revival of the doctrine and practices of an earlier period recognizing the power of the press the leaders chose literature for their instrument of reform and by their tracts for the times they became known as tractarians to oppose liberalism and to restore the doctrine and authority of the early church was the center of their teaching their belief might be summed up in one great article of the creed with all that it impliesi believe in one catholic and apostolic church the movement began at oxford with kebles famous sermon on national apostasy in 1833 but newman was the real leader of the movement which practically ended when he entered the catholic church in 1845
