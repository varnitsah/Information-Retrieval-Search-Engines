following essays five are new and were written for this volume they are the paper on mr r l stevenson the letter to a young journalist the study of mr kipling the note on homer and the last fashionable novel  the article on the author of oh no we never mention her appeared in the new york sun and was suggested by mr dana the editor of that journal  the papers on thackeray and dickens were published in good words that on dumas appeared in scribners magazine that on m theodore de banville in the new quarterly review the other essays were originally written for a newspaper syndicate they have been recast augmented and to a great extent rewritten  a l     alexandre dumas   alexandre dumas is a writer and his life is a topic of which his devotees never weary  indeed one lifetime is not long enough wherein to tire of them  the long days and years of hilpa and shalum in addisonthe antediluvian age when a picnic lasted for half a century and a courtship for two hundred years might have sufficed for an exhaustive study of dumas  no such study have i to offer in the brief seasons of our perishable days  i own that i have not read and do not in the circumstances expect to read all of dumas nor even the greater part of his thousand volumes  we only dip a cup in that sparkling spring and drink and go onwe cannot hope to exhaust the fountain nor to carry away with us the well itself  it is but a word of gratitude and delight that we can say to the heroic and indomitable master only an ave of friendship that we can call across the bourne to the shade of the porthos of fiction  that his works his best works should be even still more widely circulated than they are that the young should read them and learn frankness kindness generosityshould esteem the tender heart and the gay invincible wit that the old should read them again and find forgetfulness of trouble and taste the anodyne of dreams that is what we desire  dumas said of himself memoires v 13 that when he was young he tried several times to read forbidden booksbooks that are sold sous le manteau  but he never got farther than the tenth page in the        scrofulous french novel    on gray paper with blunt type  he never made his way so far as     the woful sixteenth print  i had thank god a natural sentiment of delicacy and thus out of my six hundred volumes in 1852 there are not four which the most scrupulous mother may not give to her daughter  much later in 1864 when the censure threatened one of his plays he wrote to the emperor of my twelve hundred volumes there is not one which a girl in our most modest quarter the faubourg saintgermain may not be allowed to read the mothers of the faubourg and mothers in general may not take dumas exactly at his word  there is a passage for example in the story of miladi les trois mousquetaires which a parent or guardian may well think undesirable reading for youth  but compare it with the original passage in the memoires of dartagnan  it has passed through a medium as dumas himself declared of natural delicacy and good taste  his enormous popularity the widest in the world of letters owes absolutely nothing to prurience or curiosity  the air which he breathes is a healthy air is the open air and that by his own choice for he had every temptation to seek another kind of vogue and every opportunity  two anecdotes are told of dumas books one by m edmond about the other by his own son which show in brief space why this novelist is so beloved and why he deserves our affection and esteem  m villaud a railway engineer who had lived much in italy russia and spain was the person whose enthusiasm finally secured a statue for dumas  he felt so much gratitude to the unknown friend of lonely nights in long exiles that he could not be happy till his gratitude found a permanent expression  on returning to france he went to consult m victor borie who told him this tale about george sand  m borie chanced to visit the famous novelist just before her death and found dumas novel les quarante cinq one of the cycle about the valois kings lying on her table  he expressed his wonder that she was reading it for the first time  for the first timewhy this is the fifth or sixth time i have read les quarante cinq and the others  when i am ill anxious melancholy tired discouraged nothing helps me against moral or physical troubles like a book of dumas  again m about says that m sarcey was in the same class at school with a little spanish boy  the child was homesick he could not eat he could not sleep he was almost in a decline  you want to see your mother said young sarcey  no she is dead  your father then  no he used to beat me  your brothers and sisters  i have none  then why are you so eager to be back in spain  to finish a book i began in the holidays  and what was its name  los tres mosqueteros  he was homesick for the three musketeers and they cured him easily  that is what dumas does  he gives courage and life to old age he charms away the halfconscious nostalgie the heimweh of childhood  we are all homesick in the dark days and black towns for the land of blue skies and brave adventures in forests and in lonely inns on the battle field in the prison on the desert isle  and then dumas comes and like argive helen in homer he casts a drug into the wine the drug nepenthe that puts all evil out of mind  does any one suppose that when george sand was old and tired and near her death she would have found this anodyne and this stimulant in the novels of m tolstoi m dostoiefsky m zola or any of the scientific observers whom we are actually requested to hail as the masters of a new art the art of the future  would they make her laugh as chicot does make her forget as porthos athos and aramis do take her away from the heavy familiar time as the enchanter dumas takes us  no let it be enough for these new authors to be industrious keen accurate precieux pitiful charitable veracious but give us high spirits now and then a light heart a sharp sword a fair wench a good horse or even that old gascon rouncy of dartagnans  like the good lord james douglas we had liefer hear the lark sing over moor and down with chicot than listen to the starvedmouse squeak in the bouge of therese raquin with m zola  not that there is not a place and an hour for him and others like him but they are not if you please to have the whole world to themselves and all the time and all the praise they are not to turn the world into a dissectingroom time into tedium and the laurels of scott and dumas into crowns of nettles  there is no complete life of alexandre dumas  the age has not produced the intellectual athlete who can gird himself up for that labour  one of the worst books that ever was written if it can be said to be written is i think the english attempt at a biography of dumas  style grammar taste feeling are all bad  the author does not so much write a life as draw up an indictment  the spirit of his work is grudging sneering contemptuous and pitifully peddling  the great charge is that dumas was a humbug that he was not the author of his own books that his books were written by collaboratorsabove all by m maquet  there is no doubt that dumas had a regular system of collaboration which he never concealed  but whereas dumas could turn out books that live whoever his assistants were could any of his assistants write books that live without dumas  one might as well call any barrister in good practice a thief and an impostor because he has juniors to devil for him as make charges of this kind against dumas  he once asked his son to help him the younger alexandre declined  it is worth a thousand a year and you have only to make objections the sire urged but the son was not to be tempted  some excellent novelists of today would be much better if they employed a friend to make objections  but as a rule the collaborator did much more  dumas method apparently was first to talk the subject over with his aidedecamp  this is an excellent practice as ideas are knocked out like sparks an elderly illustration by the contact of minds  then the young man probably made researches put a rough sketch on paper and supplied dumas as it were with his brief  then dumas took the brief and wrote the novel  he gave it life he gave it the spark letincelle and the story lived and moved  it is true that he took his own where he found it like molere and that he took a good deal  in the gallery of an old countryhouse on a wet day i came once on the memoires of dartagnan where they had lain since the family bought them in queen annes time  there were our old friends the musketeers and there were many of their adventures told at great length and breadth  but how much more vivacious they are in dumas m about repeats a story of dumas and his ways of work  he met the great man at marseilles where indeed alexandre chanced to be on with the new love before being completely off with the old  dumas picked up m about literally lifted him in his embrace and carried him off to see a play which he had written in three days  the play was a success the supper was prolonged till three in the morning m about was almost asleep as he walked home but dumas was as fresh as if he had just got out of bed  go to sleep old man he said i who am only fiftyfive have three feuilletons to write which must be posted tomorrow  if i have time i shall knock up a little piece for montignythe idea is running in my head  so next morning m about saw the three feuilletons made up for the post and another packet addressed to m montigny it was the play linvitation a la valse a chefdoeuvre well the material had been prepared for dumas  m about saw one of his novels at marseilles in the chrysalis  it was a stout copybook full of paper composed by a practised hand on the masters design  dumas copied out each little leaf on a big leaf of paper en y semant lesprit a pleines mains  this was his method  as a rule in collaboration one man does the work while the other looks on  is it likely that dumas looked on  that was not the manner of dumas  mirecourt and others m about says have wept crocodile tears for the collaborators the victims of his glory and his talent  but it is difficult to lament over the survivors 1884  the master neither took their moneyfor they are rich nor their famefor they are celebrated nor their meritfor they had and still have plenty  and they never bewailed their fate the reverse  the proudest congratulate themselves on having been at so good a school and m auguste maquet the chief of them speaks with real reverence and affection of his great friend  and m about writes as one who had taken the master redhanded and in the act of collaboration  dumas has a curious note on collaboration in his souvenirs dramatiques  of the two men at work together one is always the dupe and he is the man of talent  there is no biography of dumas but the small change of a biography exists in abundance  there are the many volumes of his memoires there are all the tomes he wrote on his travels and adventures in africa spain italy russia the book he wrote on his beasts the romance of ange pitou partly autobiographical and there are plenty of little studies by people who knew him  as to his memoires as to all he wrote about himself of course his imagination entered into the narrative  like scott when he had a good story he liked to dress it up with a cocked hat and a sword  did he perform all those astonishing and innumerable feats of strength skill courage address in revolutions in voyages in love in war in cookery  the narrative need not be taken at the foot of the letter great as was his force and his courage his fancy was greater still  there is no room for a biography of him here  his descent was noble on one side with or without the bend sinister which he said he would never have disclaimed had it been his but which he did not happen to inherit  on the other side he may have descended from kings but as in the case of the fair cuban he must have added african unfortunately  did his father perform these mythical feats of strength did he lift up a horse between his legs while clutching a rafter with his hands did he throw his regiment before him over a wall as guy heavistone threw the mare which refused the leap memoires i 122  no doubt dumas believed what he heard about this ancestorin whom perhaps one may see a hint of the giant porthos  in the revolution and in the wars his father won the name of monsieur de lhumanite because he made a bonfire of a guillotine and of horatius cocles because he held a pass as bravely as the roman in the brave days of old  this was a father to be proud of and pluck tenderness generosity strength remained the favourite virtues of dumas  these he preached and practised  they say he was generous before he was just it is to be feared this was true but he gave even more freely than he received  a regiment of seedy people sponged on him always he could not listen to a tale of misery but he gave what he had and sometimes left himself short of a dinner  he could not even turn a dog out of doors  at his abbotsford monte cristo the gates were open to everybody but bailiffs  his dog asked other dogs to come and stay twelve came making thirteen in all  the old butler wanted to turn them adrift and dumas consented and repented  michel he said there are some expenses which a mans social position and the character which he has had the illluck to receive from heaven force upon him  i dont believe these dogs ruin me  let them bide  but in the interests of their own good luck see they are not thirteen an unfortunate number  monsieur ill drive one of them away  no no michel let a fourteenth come  these dogs cost me some three pounds a month said dumas  a dinner to five or six friends would cost thrice as much and when they went home they would say my wine was good but certainly that my books were bad  in this fashion dumas fared royally to the dogs and his abbotsford ruined him as certainly as that other unhappy palace ruined sir walter  he too had his miscellaneous kennel he too gave while he had anything to give and when he had nothing else gave the work of his pen  dumas tells how his big dog mouton once flew at him and bit one of his hands while the other held the throat of the brute  luckily my hand though small is powerful what it once holds it holds longmoney excepted  he could not haud a guid grip o the gear  neither scott nor dumas could shut his ears to a prayer or his pockets to a beggar or his doors on whoever knocked at them  i might at least have asked him to dinner scott was heard murmuring when some insufferable bore at last left abbotsford after wasting his time and nearly wearing out his patience  neither man preached socialism both practised it on the aristotelian principle the goods of friends are common and men are our friends        the death of dumas father while the son was a child left madame dumas in great poverty at villers cotterets  dumas education was sadly to seek  like most children destined to be bookish he taught himself to read very young in buffon the bible and books of mythology  he knew all about jupiterlike david copperfields tom jones a childs jupiter an innocent creatureall about every god goddess fawn dryad nymphand he never forgot this useful information  dear lempriere thou art superseded but how much more delightful thou art than the fastidious smith or the learned preller  dumas had one volume of the arabian nights with aladdins lamp therein the sacred lamp which he was to keep burning with a flame so brilliant and so steady  it is pleasant to know that in his boyhood this great romancer loved virgil  little as is my latin i have ever adored virgil his tenderness for exiles his melancholy vision of death his foreboding of an unknown god have always moved me the melody of his verses charmed me most and they lull me still between asleep and awake  school days did not last long madame dumas got a little posta licence to sell tobaccoand at fifteen dumas entered a notarys office like his great scotch forerunner  he was ignorant of his vocation for the stageracine and corneille fatigued him prodigiouslytill he saw hamlet hamlet diluted by ducis  he had never heard of shakespeare but here was something he could appreciate  here was a profound impression full of inexplicable emotion vague desires fleeting lights that so far lit up only a chaos  oddly enough his earliest literary essay was the translation of burgers lenore  here again he encounters scott but scott translated the ballad and dumas failed  les mortes vont vite the same refrain woke poetry in both the frenchman and the scotchman     ha ha the dead can ride with speed       dost fear to ride with me  so dumas literary career began with a defeat but it was always a beginning  he had just failed with lenore when leuven asked him to collaborate in a play  he was utterly ignorant he says he had not succeeded in gallant efforts to read through gil blas and don quixote  to my shame he writes the man has not been more fortunate with those masterpieces than the boy  he had not yet heard of scott cooper goethe he had heard of shakespeare only as a barbarian  other plays the boy wrotefailures of courseand then dumas poached his way to paris shooting partridges on the road and paying the hotel expenses by his success in the chase  he was introduced to the great talma what a moment for talma had he known it  he saw the theatres  he went home but returned to paris drew a small prize in a lottery and sat next a gentleman at the play a gentleman who read the rarest of elzevirs le pastissier francais and gave him a little lecture on elzevirs in general  soon this gentleman began to hiss the piece and was turned out  he was charles nodier and one of the anonymous authors of the play he was hissing  i own that this amusing chapter lacks verisimilitude  it reads as if dumas had chanced to get up the subject of elzevirs and had fashioned his new knowledge into a little story  he could make a story out of anythinghe turned all to favour and to prettiness  could i translate the whole passage and print it here it would be longer than this article but ah how much more entertaining  for whatever dumas did he did with such life spirit wit he told it with such vivacity that his whole career is one long romance of the highest quality lassagne told him he must readmust read goethe scott cooper froissart joinville brantome  he read them to some purpose  he entered the service of the duc dorleans as a clerk for he wrote a clear hand and happily wrote at astonishing speed  he is said to have written a short play in a cottage where he went to rest for an hour or two after shooting all the morning  the practice in a notarys office stood him as it stood scott in good stead  when a dog bit his hand he managed to write a volume without using his thumb  i have tried it but forbearin mercy to the printers  he performed wild feats of rapid caligraphy when a clerk under the duc dorleans and he wrote his plays in one hand his novels in another  the hand used in his dramas he acquired when in days of poverty he used to write in bed  to this habit he also attributed the brutalite of his earlier pieces but there seems to be no good reason why a man should write like a brute because it is in bed that he writes  in those days of small things he fought his first duel and made a study of fear and courage  his earliest impulse was to rush at danger if he had to wait he felt his courage oozing out at the tips of his fingers like bob acres but in the moment of peril he was himself again  in dreams he was a coward because as he argues the natural man is a poltroon and conscience honour all the spiritual and commanding part of our nature goes to sleep in dreams  the animal terror asserts itself unchecked  it is a theory not without exceptions  in dreams one has plenty of conscience at least that is my experience though it usually takes the form of remorse  and in dreams one often affronts dangers which in waking hours one might probably avoid if one could        dumas first play an unimportant vaudeville was acted in 1825  his first novels were also published then he took part of the risk and only four copies were sold  he afterward used the ideas in more mature works as mr sheridan le fanu employed three or four times with perfect candour and fairness the most curious incident in uncle silas  like mr arthur pendennis dumas at this time wrote poetry up to pictures and illustrations  it is easy but seldom lucrative work  he translated a play of schillers into french verse chiefly to gain command of that vehicle for his heart was fixed on dramatic success  then came the visit of kean and other english actors to paris  he saw the true hamlet and for the first time on any stage the play of real passions  emulation woke in him a casual work of art led him to the story of christina of sweden he wrote his play christine afterward reconstructed he read it to baron taylor who applauded the comedie francaise accepted it but a series of intrigues disappointed him after all  his energy at this moment was extraordinary for he was very poor his mother had a stroke of paralysis his bureau was always bullying and interfering with him  but nothing could snub this force of nature and he immediately produced his henri trois the first romantic drama of france  this had an instant and noisy success and the first night of the play he spent at the theatre and at the bedside of his unconscious mother  the poor lady could not even understand whence the flowers came that he laid on her couch the flowers thrown to the young manyesterday unknown and today the most famous of contemporary names  all this tale of triumph checkered by enmities and diversified by duels dumas tells with the vigour and wit of his novels  he is his own hero and loses nothing in the process but the other characterstaylor nodier the duc dorleans the spiteful pressmen the crabbed old officialsall live like the best of the persons in his tales  they call dumas vain he had reason to be vain and no candid or generous reader will be shocked by his pleasant frank and artless enjoyment of himself and of his adventures  oddly enough they are smallminded and smallhearted people who are most shocked by what they call vanity in the great  dumas delight in himself and his doings is only the flower of his vigorous existence and in his memoires at least it is as happy and encouraging as his laugh or the laugh of porthos it is a kind of radiance in which others too may bask and enjoy themselves  and yet it is resented by tiny scribblers frozen in their own chill selfconceit  there is nothing incredible if modern researches are accurate in the stories he tells of his own success in hypnotism as it is called now mesmerism or magnetism as it was called then  who was likely to possess these powers if not this goodhumoured natural force  i believe that by aid of magnetism a bad man might do much mischief  i doubt whether by help of magnetism a good man can do the slightest good he says probably with perfect justice  his dramatic success fired victor hugo and very pleasant it is to read dumas warmhearted praise of that great poet  dumas had no jealousyno more than scott  as he believed in no success without talent so he disbelieved in genius which wins no success  je ne crois pas au talent ignore au genie inconnu moi genius he saluted wherever he met it but was incredulous about invisible and inaudible genius and i own to sharing his scepticism  people who complain of dumas vanity may be requested to observe that he seems just as vain of hugos successes or of scribes as of his own and just as much delighted by them  he was now struck as he walked on the boulevard one day by the first idea of antonyan idea which to be fair seems rather absurd than tragic to some tastes  a lover caught with a married woman kills her to save her character and dies on the scaffold  here is indeed a part to tear a cat in        the performances of m dumas during the revolution of 1830 are they not written in the book of the chronicles of alexandre the great  but they were not literary excellences which he then displayed and we may leave this kingmaker to hover like an eagle above the storms of anarchy  even to sketch his later biography is beyond our province  in 1830 he had forty years to run and he filled the cup of the hours to the brim with activity and adventure  his career was one of unparalleled production punctuated by revolutions voyages exiles and other intervals of repose  the tales he tells of his prowess in 1830 and with garibaldi seem credible to me and are borne out so far by the narrative of m maxime ducamp who met him at naples in the garibaldian camp  like mr jingle in pickwick he banged the fieldpiece twanged the lyre and was potting at the foes of the republic with a doublebarrelled gun when he was not composing plays romances memoirs criticisms  he has told the tale of his adventures with the comedie francaise where the actors laughed at his antony and where madame mars and he quarrelled and made it up again  his plays often won an extravagant success his novelshis great novels that ismade all europe his friend  he gained large sums of money which flowed out of his fingers though it is said by some that his abbotsford monte cristo was no more a palace than the villa which a retired tradesman builds to shelter his old age  but the money disappeared as fast as if monte cristo had really been palatial and worthy of the fantasy of a nero  he got into debt fled to belgium returned founded the mousquetaire a literary paper of the strangest and most shiftless kind  in alexandre dumas a la maison dor m philibert audebrand tells the tale of this micawber of newspapers  everything went into it good or bad and the name of dumas was expected to make all current coin  for dumas unluckily was as prodigal of his name as of his gold and no reputation could bear the drafts he made on his celebrity  his son says in the preface to le fils naturel tragedy dramas history romance comedy travel you cast all of them in the furnace and the mould of your brain and you peopled the world of fiction with new creations  the newspaper the book the theatre burst asunder too narrow for your puissant shoulders you fed france europe america with your works you made the wealth of publishers translators plagiarists printers and copyists toiled after you in vain  in the fever of production you did not always try and prove the metal which you employed and sometimes you tossed into the furnace whatever came to your hand  the fire made the selection what was your own is bronze what was not yours vanished in smoke  the simile is noble and worthy of the cyclopean craftsman dumas  his great works endured the plays which renewed the youth of the french stage the novels which thackeray loved to praise these remain and we trust they may always remain to the delight of mankind and for the sorrow of prigs        so much has been written of dumas novels that criticism can hardly hope to say more that is both new and true about them  it is acknowledged that in such a character as henri iii dumas made history live as magically as scott revived the past in his louis xi or balfour of burley  it is admitted that dumas good tales are told with a vigour and life which rejoice the heart that his narrative is never dull never stands still but moves with a freedom of adventure which perhaps has no parallel  he may fall short of the humour the kindly wisdom the genial greatness of sir walter at his best and he has not that supernatural touch that tragic grandeur which scott inherits from homer and from shakespeare  in another homeric quality greek text as homer himself calls it in the delight of battle and the spirit of the fray scott and dumas are alike masters  their fights and the fights in the icelandic sagas are the best that have ever been drawn by mortal man when swords are aloft in siege or on the greensward or in the midnight chamber where an ambush is laid scott and dumas are indeed themselves the steel rings the bucklers clash the parry and lunge pass and answer too swift for the sight  if dumas has not as he certainly has not the noble philosophy and kindly knowledge of the heart which are scotts he is far more swift more witty more diverting  he is not prolix his style is not involved his dialogue is as rapid and keen as an assault at arms  his favourite virtues and graces we repeat it are loyalty friendship gaiety generosity courage beauty and strength  he is himself the friend of the big stupid excellent porthos of athos the noble and melancholy swordsman of sorrow of dartagnan the indomitable the trusty the inexhaustible in resource but his heart is never on the side of the shifty aramis with all his beauty dexterity bravery and brilliance  the brave bussy and the chivalrous the doomed la mole are more dear to him and if he embellishes their characters giving them charms and virtues that never were theirs history loses nothing and romance and we are the gainers  in all he does at his best as in the chevalier dharmenthal he has movement kindness courage and gaiety his philosophy of life is that old philosophy of the sagas and of homer let us enjoy the movement of the fray the faces of fair women the taste of good wine let us welcome life like a mistress let us welcome death like a friend and with a jestif death comes with honour  dumas is no pessimist  heaven has made but one drama for manthe world he writes and during these three thousand years mankind has been hissing it  it is certain that if a moral censorship could have prevented it this great drama of mortal passions would never have been licensed at all never performed  but dumas for one will not hiss it but applauds with all his mighta charmed spectator a fortunate actor in the eternal piece where all the men and women are only players  you hear his manly laughter you hear his mighty hands approving you see the tears he sheds when he had slain porthosgreat tears like those of pantagruel        his may not be the best nor the ultimate philosophy but it is a philosophy and one of which we may some day feel the want  i read the stilted criticisms the pedantic carpings of some modern men who cannot write their own language and i gather that dumas is out of date  there is a new philosophy of doubts and delicacies of dallyings and refinements of halfhearted lookerson desiring and fearing some new order of the world  dumas does not dally nor doubt he takes his side he rushes into the smoke he strikes his foe but there is never an unkind word on his lip nor a grudging thought in his heart  it may be said that dumas is not a master of words and phrases that he is not a raffine of expression nor a jeweller of style  when i read the maunderings the stilted and staggering sentences the hesitating phrases the farsought and dearbought and worthless wordjuggles the sham scientific verbiage the native pedantries of many modern socalled stylists i rejoice that dumas was not one of these  he told a plain tale in the language suited to a plain tale with abundance of wit and gaiety as in the reflections of his chicot as in all his dialogues  but he did not gnaw the end of his pen in search of some word that nobody had ever used in this or that connection before  the right word came to him the simple straightforward phrase  epithethunting may be a pretty sport and the bag of the epithethunter may contain some agreeable epigrams and rare specimens of style but a plain tale of adventure of love and war needs none of this industry and is even spoiled by inopportune diligence  speed directness lucidity are the characteristics of dumas style and they are exactly the characteristics which his novels required  scott often failed his most loyal admirers may admit in these essentials but it is rarely that dumas fails when he is himself and at his best        in spite of his heedless education dumas had true critical qualities and most admired the best things  we have already seen how he writes about shakespeare virgil goethe scott  but it may be less familiarly known that this burly manofallwork ignorant as he was of greek had a true and keen appreciation of homer  dumas declares that he only thrice criticised his contemporaries in an unfavourable sense and as one wishful to find fault  the victims were casimir delavigne scribe and ponsard  on each occasion dumas declares that after reflecting he saw that he was moved by a little personal pique not by a disinterested love of art  he makes his confession with a rare nobility of candour and yet his review of ponsard is worthy of him  m ponsard who like dumas was no scholar wrote a play styled ulysse and borrowed from the odyssey dumas follows ponsard odyssey in hand and while he proves that the dramatist failed to understand homer proves that he himself was in essentials a capable homeric critic  dumas understands that faroff heroic age  he lives in its life and sympathises with its temper  homer and he are congenial across the great gulf of time they exchange smiles and a salute  oh ancient homer dear and good and noble i am minded now and again to leave all and translate theei who have never a word of greekso empty and so dismal are the versions men make of thee in verse or in prose  how dumas came to divine homer as it were through a language he knew not who shall say  he did divine him by a natural sympathy of excellence and his chapters on the ulysse of ponsard are worth a wilderness of notes by learned and most unhomeric men  for indeed who can be less like the heroic minstrel than the academic philologist  this universality deserves note  the homeric student who takes up a volume of dumas at random finds that he is not only homeric naturally but that he really knows his homer  what did he nor know  his rapidity in reading must have been as remarkable as his pace with the pen  as m blaze de bury says instinct experience memory were all his he sees at a glance he compares in a flash he understands without conscious effort he forgets nothing that he has read  the past and present are photographed imperishably on his brain he knows the manners of all ages and all countries the names of all the arms that men have used all the garments they have worn all the dishes they have tasted all the terms of all professions from swordsmanship to coachbuilding  other authors have to wait and hunt for facts nothing stops dumas he knows and remembers everything  hence his rapidity his facility his positive delight in labour hence it came that he might be heard like dickens laughing while he worked        this is rather a eulogy than a criticism of dumas  his faults are on the surface visible to all men  he was not only rapid he was hasty he was inconsistent his need of money as well as his love of work made him put his hand to dozens of perishable things  a beginner entering the forest of dumas books may fail to see the trees for the wood  he may be counselled to select first the cycle of dartagnanthe musketeers twenty years after and the vicomte de bragelonne  mr stevensons delightful essay on the last may have sent many readers to it i confess to preferring the youth of the musketeers to their old age  then there is the cycle of the valois whereof the dame de monsereau is the bestperhaps the best thing dumas ever wrote  the tulipe noire is a novel girls may read as thackeray said with confidence  the chevalier dharmenthal is nearly not quite as good as quentin durward  monte cristo has the best beginningand loses itself in the sands  the novels on the revolution are not among the most alluring the famed device l p d lilia pedibus destrue has the bad luck to suggest london parcels delivery  that is an accident but the revolution is in itself too terrible and pitiful and too near us on both sides for fiction  on dumas faults it has been no pleasure to dwell  in a recent work i find the jesuit le moyne quoted saying about charles v what need that future ages should be made acquainted so religious an emperor was not always chaste  the same reticence allures one in regard to so delightful an author as dumas  he who had enriched so many died poor he who had told of conquering france died during the terrible year  but he could forgive could appreciate the valour of an enemy  of the scotch at waterloo he writes it was not enough to kill them we had to push them down  dead they still stood shoulder to shoulder  in the same generous temper an english cavalry officer wrote home after waterloo that he would gladly have given the rest of his life to have served on that day in our infantry or in the french cavalry  these are the spirits that warm the heart that make us all friends and to the great the brave the generous dumas we cry across the years and across the tomb our ave atque vale     mr stevensons works   perhaps the first quality in mr stevensons works now so many and so various which strikes a reader is the buoyancy the survival of the child in him  he has told the world often in prose and verse how vivid are his memories of his own infancy  this retention of childish recollections he shares no doubt with other people of genius for example with george sand whose legend of her own infancy is much more entertaining and perhaps will endure longer than her novels  her youth like scotts and like mr stevensons was passed all in fantasy in playing at being some one else in the invention of imaginary characters who were living to her in the fabrication of endless unwritten romances  many persons who do not astonish the world by their genius have lived thus in their earliest youth  but at a given moment the fancy dies out of them this often befalls imaginative boys in their first year at school  many are called few chosen but it may be said with probable truth that there has never been a man of genius in letters whose boyhood was not thus fantastic an isle of dreams  we know how scott and de quincey inhabited airy castles and gillies tells us though lockhart does not that scott in manhood was occasionally so lost in thought that he knew not where he was nor what he was doing  the peculiarity of mr stevenson is not only to have been a fantastic child and to retain in maturity that fantasy ripened into imagination he has also kept up the habit of dramatising everything of playing half consciously many parts of making the world an unsubstantial fairy place  this turn of mind it is that causes his work occasionally to seem somewhat freakish  thus in the fogs and horrors of london he plays at being an arabian taleteller and his new arabian nights are a new kind of romanticismoriental freakish like the work of a changeling  indeed this curious genius springing from a family of scottish engineers resembles nothing so much as one of the fairy children whom the ladies of queen proserpinas court used to leave in the cradles of border keeps or of peasants cottages  of the scot he has little but the power of touching us with a sense of the supernatural and a decided habit of moralising for no scot of genius has been more austere with robert burns  on the other hand one element of mr stevensons ethical disquisitions is derived from his dramatic habit  his optimism his gay courage his habit of accepting the world as very well worth living in and looking at persuaded one of his critics that he was a hardhearted young athlete of iron frame  now of the athlete he has nothing but his love of the open air it is the eternal child that drives him to seek adventures and to sojourn among beachcombers and savages thus an admiring but far from optimistic critic may doubt whether mr stevensons content with the world is not only his fun as lamb said of coleridges preaching whether he is but playing at being the happy warrior in life whether he is not acting that part himself to himself at least it is a part fortunately conceived and admirably sustained a difficult part too whereas that of the pessimist is as easy as whining  mr stevensons work has been very much written about as it has engaged and delighted readers of every age station and character  boys of course have been specially addressed in the books of adventure children in a childs garden of verse young men and maidens in virginibus puerisqueall ages in all the curiously varied series of volumes kidnapped was one of the last books which the late lord iddesleigh read and i trust there is no harm in mentioning the pleasure which mr matthew arnold took in the same story  critics of every sort have been kind to mr stevenson in spite of the fact that the few who first became acquainted with his genius praised it with all the warmth of which they were masters  thus he has become a kind of classic in his own day for an undisputed reputation makes a classic while it lasts  but was ever so much fame won by writings which might be called scrappy and desultory by the advocatus diaboli  it is a most miscellaneous literary baggage that mr stevenson carries  first a few magazine articles then two little books of sentimental journeyings which convince the reader that mr stevenson is as good company to himself as his books are to others then came a volume or two of essays literary and social on books and life  by this time there could be no doubt that mr stevenson had a style of his own modelled to some extent on the essayists of the last century but with touches of thackeray with original breaks and turns with a delicate freakishness in short and a determined love of saying things as the newspapers do not say them  all this work undoubtedly smelt a trifle of the lamp and was therefore dear to some and an offence to others  for my part i had delighted in the essays from the first that appeared in macmillans magazine shortly after the franco german war  in this little study ordered south mr stevenson was employing himself in extracting all the melancholy pleasure which the riviera can give to a wearied body and a mind resisting the clouds of early malady     alas the worn and broken board       how can it bear the painters dye    the harp of strained and tuneless chord       how to the minstrels skill reply    to aching eyes each landscape lowers       to feverish pulse each gale blows chill    and arabys or edens bowers       were barren as this moorland hill  wrote scott in an hour of malady and depression  but this was not the spirit of ordered south the younger soul rose against the tyranny of the body and that familiar glamour which in illness robs tintoretto of his glow did not spoil the midland sea to mr stevenson  his gallant and cheery stoicism were already with him and so perfect if a trifle overstudied was his style that one already foresaw a new and charming essayist  but none of those early works nor the delightful book on edinburgh prophesied of the story teller  mr stevensons first published tales the new arabian nights originally appeared in a quaintly edited weekly paper which nobody read or nobody but the writers in its columns  they welcomed the strange romances with rejoicings but perhaps there was only one of them who foresaw that mr stevensons forte was to be fiction not essay writing that he was to appeal with success to the large public and not to the tiny circle who surround the essayist  it did not seem likely that our incalculable public would make themselves at home in those fantastic purlieus which mr stevensons fancy discovered near the strand  the impossible young man with the cream tarts the ghastly revels of the suicide club the oriental caprices of the hansom cabswho could foresee that the public would taste them  it is true that mr stevensons imagination made the president of the club and the cowardly member mr malthus as real as they were terrible  his romance always goes hand in hand with reality and mr malthus is as much an actual man of skin and bone as silas lapham is a man of flesh and blood  the world saw this and applauded the noctes of prince floristan in a fairy london  yet excellent and unique as these things were mr stevenson had not yet found himself  it would be more true to say that he had only discovered outlying skirts of his dominions  has he ever hit on the road to the capital yet and will he ever enter it laurelled and in triumph that is precisely what one may doubt not as without hope  he is always making discoveries in his realm it is less certain that he will enter its chief city in state  his next work was rather in the nature of annexation and invasion than a settling of his own realms  prince otto is not to my mind a ruler in his proper soil  the provinces of george sand and of mr george meredith have been taken captive  prince otto is fantastic indeed but neither the fantasy nor the style is quite mr stevensons  there are excellent passages and the scotch soldier of fortune is welcome and the ladies abound in subtlety and wit  but the book at least to myself seems an extremely elaborate and skilful pastiche  i cannot believe in the persons  i vaguely smell a moral allegory as in will of the mill  i do not clearly understand what it is all about  the scene is fairyland but it is not the fairyland of perrault  the ladies are beautiful and witty but they are escaped from a novel of mr merediths and have no business here  the book is no more mr stevensons than the tale of two cities was mr dickenss  it was probably by way of mere diversion and childs play that mr stevenson began treasure island  he is an amateur of boyish pleasures of masterpieces at a penny plain and twopence coloured  probably he had looked at the stories of adventure in penny papers which only boys read and he determined sportively to compete with their unknown authors treasure island came out in such a periodical with the emphatic woodcuts which adorn them  it is said that the puerile public was not greatly stirred  a story is a story and they rather preferred the regular purveyors  the very faint archaism of the style may have alienated them  but when treasure island appeared as a real book then every one who had a smack of youth left was a boy again for some happy hours  mr stevenson had entered into another province of his realm the king had come to his own again  they say the seamanship is inaccurate i care no more than i do for the year 30  they say too many people are killed  they all died in fair fight except a victim of john silvers  the conclusion is a little too like part of poes most celebrated tale but nobody has bellowed plagiarist  some people may not look over a fence mr stevenson if he liked might steal a horsethe animal in this case is only a skeleton  a very sober student might add that the hero is impossibly clever but then the hero is a boy and this is a boys book  for the rest the characters live  only genius could have invented john silver that terribly smoothspoken mariner  nothing but genius could have drawn that simple yokel on the island with his craving for cheese as a christian dainty  the blustering billy bones is a little masterpiece the blind pew with his tapping stick there are three such blind tappers in mr stevensons books strikes terror into the boldest  then the treasure is thoroughly satisfactory in kind and there is plenty of it the landscape as in the feverish fogsmothered flat is gallantly painted  and there are no interfering petticoats in the story  as for the black arrow i confess to sharing the disabilities of the critic on the hearth to whom it is dedicated  kidnapped is less a story than a fragment but it is a noble fragment  setting aside the wicked old uncle who in his later behaviour is of the house of ralph nickleby kidnapped is all excellentperhaps mr stevensons masterpiece  perhaps too only a scotchman knows how good it is and only a lowland scot knows how admirable a character is the dour brave conceited david balfour  it is like being in scotland again to come on the green driveroad running wide through the heather where david took his last look of kirk essendean the trees about the manse and the big rowans in the kirkyard where his father and mother lay  perfectly scotch too is the mouldering empty house of the miser with the stamped leather on the walls  and the miser is as good as a scotch trapbois till he becomes homicidal and then one fails to recognise him unless he is a little mad like that other frantic uncle in the merry men  the scenes on the ship with the boy who is murdered are betteri think more realthan the scenes of piratical life in the master of ballantrae  the fight in the round house even if it were exaggerated would be redeemed by the song of the sword of alan  as to alan breck himself with his valour and vanity his good heart his good conceit of himself his fantastic loyalty he is absolutely worthy of the hand that drew callum bey and the dougal creature  it is just possible that we see in kidnapped more signs of determined labour more evidence of touches and retouches than in rob roy  in nothing else which it attempts is it inferior in mastery of landscape as in the scene of the lonely rock in a dry and thirsty land it is unsurpassed  if there are signs of laboured handling on alan there are none in the sketches of cluny and of rob roys son the piper  what a generous artist is alan robin oig he said when it was done ye are a great piper  i am not fit to blow in the same kingdom with you  body of me ye have mair music in your sporran than i have in my head  kidnapped we said is a fragment  it ends anywhere or nowhere as if the pen had dropped from a weary hand  thus and for other reasons one cannot pretend to set what is not really a whole against such a rounded whole as rob roy or against the legend of montrose  again kidnapped is a novel without a woman in it not here is di vernon not here is helen mcgregor  david balfour is the pragmatic lowlander he does not bear comparison excellent as he is with baillie nicol jarvie the humorous lowlander he does not live in the memory like the immortal baillie  it is as a series of scenes and sketches that kidnapped is unmatched among mr stevensons works  in the master of ballantrae mr stevenson makes a gallant effort to enter what i have ventured to call the capital of his kingdom  he does introduce a woman and confronts the problems of love as well as of fraternal hatred  the master is studied is polished ad unguem it is a whole in itself it is a remarkably daring attempt to write the tragedy as in waverley scott wrote the romance of scotland about the time of the fortyfive  with such a predecessor and rival mr stevenson wisely leaves the pomps and battles of the fortyfive its chivalry and gallantry alone  he shows us the seamy side the intrigues domestic and political the needy irish adventurer with the prince a person whom scott had not studied  the book if completely successful would be mr stevensons bride of lammermoor  to be frank i do not think it completely successfula victory all along the line the obvious weak point is secundra dass that indian of unknown nationality for surely his name marks him as no hindoo  the master could not have brought him shivering like jos sedleys black servant to scotland  as in america this alien would have found it too dam cold my power of belief which verges on credulity is staggered by the ghastly attempt to reanimate the buried master  here at least to my taste the freakish changeling has got the better of mr stevenson and has brought in an element out of keeping with the steady lurid tragedy of fraternal hatred  for all the rest it were a hard judge that had anything but praise  the brilliant blackguardism of the master his touch of sentiment as he leaves durisdeer for the last time with a sad old song on his lips his fascination his ruthlessness his ironyall are perfect  it is not very easy to understand the chevalier bourke that barry lyndon with no head and with a good heart that creature of a bewildered kindly conscience but it is easy to like him  how admirable is his undeflected belief in and affection for the master  how excellent and how irish he is when he buffoons himself out of his perils with the pirates  the scenes are brilliant and living as when the master throws the guinea through the hall window or as in the darkling duel in the garden  it needed an austere artistic conscience to make henry the younger brother so unlovable with all his excellence and to keep the lady so true yet so much in shadow  this is the best woman among mr stevensons few women but even she is almost always reserved veiled as it were  the old lord again is a portrait as lifelike as scott could have drawn and more delicately touched than scott would have cared to draw it a french companion picture to the baron bradwardine  the whole piece reads as if mr stevenson had engaged in a struggle with himself as he wrote the sky is never blue the sun never shines we weary for a westland wind  there is something thrawn as the scotch say about the story there is often a touch of this sinister kind in the authors work  the language is extraordinarily artful as in the mad lords words i have felt the hilt dirl on his breastbone  and yet one is hardly thrilled as one expects to be when as mackellar says the weekold corpse looked me for a moment in the face  probably none of mr stevensons many books has made his name so familiar as dr jekyll and mr hyde  i read it first in manuscript alone at night and when the butler and mr urmson came to the doctors door i confess that i threw it down and went hastily to bed  it is the most gruesome of all his writings and so perfect that one can complain only of the slightly too obvious moral and again that really mr hyde was more of a gentleman than the unctuous dr jekyll with his bedside manner  so here not to speak of some admirable short stories like thrawn janet is a brief cataloguelittle moreof mr stevensons literary baggage  it is all good though variously good yet the wise world asks for the masterpiece  it is said that mr stevenson has not ventured on the delicate and dangerous ground of the novel because he has not written a modern love story  but who has  there are love affairs in dickens but do we remember or care for them  is it the love affairs that we remember in scott  thackeray may touch us with clives and jack belsizes misfortunes with esmonds melancholy passion and amuse us with pen in so many toils and interest us in the little heroine of the shabby genteel story  but it is not by virtue of those episodes that thackeray is so great  love stories are best done by women as in mr gilfils love story and perhaps in an ordinary way by writers like trollope  one may defy critics to name a great english author in fiction whose chief and distinguishing merit is in his pictures of the passion of love  still they all give love his due stroke in the battle and perhaps mr stevenson will do so some day  but i confess that if he ever excels himself i do not expect it to be in a love story  possibly it may be in a play  if he again attempt the drama he has this in his favour that he will not deal in supernumeraries  in his tales his minor characters are as carefully drawn as his chief personages consider for example the minister henderland the man who is so fond of snuff in kidnapped and in the master of ballantrae sir william johnson the english governor  they are the work of a mind as attentive to details as ready to subordinate or obliterate details which are unessential  thus mr stevensons writings breathe equally of work in the study and of inspiration from adventure in the open air and thus he wins every vote and pleases every class of reader     thomas haynes bayly   i cannot sing the old songs nor indeed any others but i can read them in the neglected works of thomas haynes bayly  the name of bayly may be unfamiliar but every one almost has heard his ditties chantedevery one much over forty at all events  ill hang my harp on a willow tree and id be a butterfly and oh no we never mention her are dimly dear to every friend of mr richard swiveller  if to be sung everywhere to hear your verses uttered in harmony with all pianos and quoted by the world at large be fame bayly had it  he was an unaffected poet  he wrote words to airs and he is almost absolutely forgotten  to read him is to be carried back on the wings of music to the bowers of youth and to the bowers of youth i have been wafted and to the old booksellers you do not find on every stall the poems of bayly but a copy in two volumes has been discovered edited by mr baylys widow bentley 1844 they saw the light in the same year as the present critic and perhaps they ceased to be very popular before he was breeched  mr bayly according to mrs bayly ably penetrated the sources of the human heart like shakespeare and mr howells  he also gave to minstrelsy the attributes of intellect and wit and reclaimed even festive song from vulgarity in which since the age of anacreon festive song has notoriously wallowed  the poet who did all this was born at bath in oct 1797  his father was a genteel solicitor and his greatgrandmother was sister to lord delamere while he had a remote baronet on the mothers side  to trace the ancestral source of his genius was difficult as in the case of gifted hopkins but it was believed to flow from his maternal grandfather mr freeman whom his friend lord lavington regarded as one of the finest poets of his age  bayly was at school at winchester where he conducted a weekly college newspaper  his father like scotts would have made him a lawyer but the youth took a great dislike to it for his ideas loved to dwell in the regions of fancy which are closed to attorneys  so he thought of being a clergyman and was sent to st marys hall oxford  there he did not apply himself to the pursuit of academical honours but fell in love with a young lady whose brother he had tended in a fatal illness  but they were both too wise to think of living upon love and after mutual tears and sighs they parted never to meet again  the lady though grieved was not heartbroken and soon became the wife of another  they usually do  mr baylys regret was more profound and expressed itself in the touching ditty     oh no we never mention her       her name is never heard    my lips are now forbid to speak       that once familiar word    from sport to sport they hurry me       to banish my regret    and when they only worry me  i beg mr baylys pardon     and when they win a smile from me       they fancy i forget     they bid me seek in change of scene       the charms that others see    but were i in a foreign land       theyd find no change in me    tis true that i behold no more       the valley where we met    i do not see the hawthorn tree       but how can i forget              they tell me she is happy now  and so she was in fact        the gayest of the gay    they hint that shes forgotten me       but heed not what they say    like me perhaps she struggles with       each feeling of regret    tis true shes married mr smith       but ah does she forget  the temptation to parody is really too strong the last lines actually and in an authentic text are     but if she loves as i have loved       she never can forget  bayly had now struck the note the sweet sentimental note of the early innocent victorian age  jeames imitated him     r hangeline r lady mine    dost thou remember jeames  we should do the trick quite differently now more like this     love spake to me and said       oh lips be mute    let that one name be dead    that memory flown and fled       untouched that lute    go forth said love with willow in thy hand       and in thy hair       dead blossoms wear    blown from the sunless land     go forth said love thou never more shalt see    her shadow glimmer by the trysting tree       but she is glad       with roses crowned and clad    who hath forgotten thee       but i made answer love       tell me no more thereof    for she has drunk of that same cup as i    yea though her eyes be dry       she garners there for me       tears salter than the sea    even till the day she die    so gave i love the lie  i declare i nearly weep over these lines for though they are only baylys sentiment hastily recast in a modern manner there is something so very affecting mouldy and unwholesome about them that they sound as if they had been written up to a sketch by a disciple of mr rossettis  in a mood much more manly and moral mr bayly wrote another poem to the young lady     may thy lot in life be happy undisturbed by thoughts of me    the god who shelters innocence thy guard and guide will be    thy heart will lose the chilling sense of hopeless love at last    and the sunshine of the future chase the shadows of the past  it is as easy as prose to sing in this manner  for example     in fact we need not be concerned at last comes very soon and our    emilia quite forgets the memory of the moon the moon that shone on    her and us the woods that heard our vows the moaning of the waters    and the murmur of the boughs  she is happy with another and by her    were quite forgot she never lets a thought of us bring shadow on her    lot and if we meet at dinner shes too clever to repine and mentions    us to mr smith as an old flame of mine  and shall i grieve that it    is thus and would i have her weep and lose her healthy appetite and    break her healthy sleep  not so shes not poetical though neer    shall i forget the fairy of my fancy whom i once thought i had met    the fairy of my fancy  it was fancy most things are her emotions    were not steadfast as the shining of a star but ah i love her image    yet as once it shone on me and swayed me as the low moon sways the    surging of the sea  among other sports his anxious friends hurried the lovelorn bayly to scotland where he wrote much verse and then to dublin which completed his cure  he seemed in the midst of the crowd the gayest of all his laughter rang merry and loud at banquet and hall  he thought no more of studying for the church but went back to bath met a miss hayes was fascinated by miss hayes came saw but did not conquer at once says mrs haynes bayly nee hayes with widows pride  her lovely name was helena and i deeply regret to add that after an education at oxford mr bayly in his poems accentuated the penultimate which of course is short     oh think not helena of leaving us yet  he carolled when it would have been just as easy and a hundred times more correct to sing     oh helena think not of leaving us yet  miss hayes had lands in ireland alas and mr bayly insinuated that like king easter and king wester in the ballad her lovers courted her for her lands and her fee but he like king honour     for her bonny face    and for her fair bodie  in 1825 after being elected to the athenaeum mr bayly at last found favour in the eyes of miss hayes  he presented her with a little ruby heart which she accepted and they were married and at first were well todo miss hayes being the heiress of benjamin hayes esq of marble hill in county cork  a friend of mr baylys described him thus     i never have met on this chilling earth       so merry so kind so frank a youth    in moments of pleasure a smile all mirth       in moments of sorrow a heart of truth    i have heard thee praised i have seen thee led       by fashion along her gay career    while beautiful lips have often shed       their flattering poison in thine ear  yet he says that the poet was unspoiled  on his honeymoon at lord ashdowns mr bayly flying from some fair sirens retreated to a bower and there wrote his worldfamous id be a butterfly     id be a butterfly living a rover    dying when fair things are fading away  the place in which the deathless strains welled from the singers heart was henceforth known as butterfly bower  he now wrote a novel the aylmers which has gone where the old moons go and he became rather a literary lion and made the acquaintance of theodore hook  the loss of a son caused him to write some devotional verses which were not what he did best and now he began to try comedies  one of them sold for a song succeeded very well  in the stagecoach between wycombe abbey and london he wrote a successful little lever de rideau called perfection and it was lucky that he opened this vein for his wifes irish property got into an irish bog of dishonesty and difficulty  thirty five pieces were contributed by him to the british stage  after a long illness he died on april 22nd 1829  he did not live this butterfly minstrel into the winter of human age  of his poems the inevitable criticism must be that he was a tom moore of much lower accomplishments  his business was to carol of the most vapid and obvious sentiment and to string flowers fruits trees breeze sorrow tomorrow knights coalblack steeds regret deception and so forth into fervid anapaestics  perhaps his success lay in knowing exactly how little sense in poetry composers will endure and singers will accept  why words for music are almost invariably trash now though the words of elizabethan songs are better than any music is a gloomy and difficult question  like most poets i myself detest the sister art and dont know anything about it  but any one can see that words like baylys are and have long been much more popular with musical people than words like shelleys keatss shakespeares fletchers lovelaces or carews  the natural explanation is not flattering to musical people at all events the singing world doted on bayly     she never blamed himnever       but received him when he came    with a welcome sort of shiver       and she tried to look the same     but vainly she dissembled       for wheneer she tried to smile    a tear unbidden trembled       in her blue eye all the while  this was pleasant for him but the point is that these are lines to an indian air  shelley also about the same time wrote lines to an indian air but we may swear and save our oath that the singers preferred baylys  tennyson and coleridge could never equal the popularity of what follows  i shall ask the persevering reader to tell me where bayly ends and where parody begins     when the eye of beauty closes       when the weary are at rest    when the shade the sunset throws is       but a vapour in the west    when the moonlight tips the billow       with a wreath of silver foam    and the whisper of the willow       breaks the slumber of the gnome    night may come but sleep will linger       when the spirit all forlorn    shuts its ear against the singer       and the rustle of the corn    round the sad old mansion sobbing       bids the wakeful maid recall    who it was that caused the throbbing       of her bosom at the ball  will this not do to sing just as well as the original and is it not true that almost any man you please could reel it off for days together anything will do that speaks of forgetting people and of being forsaken and about the sunset and the ivy and the rose     tell me no more that the tide of thine anguish       is red as the hearts blood and salt as the sea    that the stars in their courses command thee to languish       that the hand of enjoyment is loosened from thee     tell me no more that forgotten forsaken       thou roamest the wild wood thou sighst on the shore    nay rent is the pledge that of old we had taken       and the words that have bound me they bind thee no more     ere the sun had gone down on thy sorrow the maidens       were wreathing the oranges bud in thy hair    and the trumpets were tuning the musical cadence       that gave thee a bride to the baronets heir     farewell may no thought pierce thy breast of thy treason       farewell and be happy in huberts embrace    be the belle of the ball be the bride of the season       with diamonds bedizened and languid in lace  this is mine and i say with modest pride that it is quite as good as     go mayst thou be happy       though sadly we part    in lifes early summer       grief breaks not the heart     the ills that assail us       as speedily pass    as shades oer a mirror       which stain not the glass  anybody could do it we say in what edgar poe calls the mad pride of intellectuality and it certainly looks as if it could be done by anybody  for example take bayly as a moralist  his ideas are out of the centre  this is about his standard     cruelty     break not the thread the spider       is labouring to weave    i said nor as i eyed her       could dream she would deceive     her brow was pure and candid       her tender eyes above    and i if ever man did       fell hopelessly in love     for who could deem that cruel       so fair a face might be    that eyes so like a jewel       were only paste for me     i wove my thread aspiring       within her heart to climb    i wove with zeal untiring       for ever such a time     but ah that thread was broken       all by her fingers fair    the vows and prayers ive spoken       are vanished into air  did bayly write that ditty or did i  upon my word i can hardly tell  i am being hypnotised by bayly  i lisp in numbers and the numbers come like mad  i can hardly ask for a light without abounding in his artless vein  easy easy it seems and yet it was bayly after all not you nor i who wrote the classic     ill hang my harp on a willow tree       and ill go to the war again    for a peaceful home has no charm for me       a battlefield no pain    the lady i love will soon be a bride       with a diadem on her brow    ah why did she flatter my boyish pride       she is going to leave me now  it is like listening in the sad yellow evening to the strains of a barrel organ faint and sweet and far away  a world of memories come jigging backfoolish fancies dreams desires all beckoning and bobbing to the old tune     oh had i but loved with a boyish love    it would have been well for me  how does bayly manage it  what is the trick of it the obvious simple meretricious trick which somehow after all let us mock as we will bayly could do and we cannot  he really had a slim serviceable smirking and sighing little talent of his own andwell we have not even that  nobody forgets     the lady i love will soon be a bride  nobody remembers our cultivated epics and esoteric sonnets oh brother minor poet mon semblable mon frere  nor can we rival though we publish our books on the largest paper the buried popularity of     gaily the troubadour       touched his guitar    when he was hastening       home from the war    singing from palestine       hither i come    lady love  lady love       welcome me home  of course this is historically a very incorrect rendering of a languedoc crusader and the impression is not mediaeval but of the comic opera  any one of us could get in more local colour for the money and give the crusader a cithern or citole instead of a guitar  this is how we should do gaily the troubadour nowadays     sir ralph he is hardy and mickle of might       ha la belle blanche aubepine    soldans seven hath he slain in fight       honneur a la belle isoline     sir ralph he rideth in riven mail       ha la belle blanche aubepine    beneath his nasal is his dark face pale       honneur a la belle isoline     his eyes they blaze as the burning coal       ha la belle blanche aubepine    he smiteth a stave on his gold citole       honneur a la belle isoline     from her mangonel she looketh forth       ha la belle blanche aubepine    who is he spurreth so late to the north       honneur a la belle isoline     hark for he speaketh a knightly name       ha la belle blanche aubepine    and her wan cheek glows as a burning flame       honneur a la belle isoline     for sir ralph he is hardy and mickle of might       ha la belle blanche aubepine    and his love shall ungirdle his sword tonight       honneur a la belle isoline  such is the romantic esoteric old french way of saying     hark tis the troubadour       breathing her name    under the battlement       softly he came    singing from palestine       hither i come    lady love  lady love       welcome me home  the moral of all this is that minor poetry has its fashions and that the butterfly bayly could versify very successfully in the fashion of a time simpler and less pedantic than our own  on the whole minor poetry for minor poetry this artless singer piping his native drawingroom notes gave a great deal of perfectly harmless if highly uncultivated enjoyment  it must not be fancied that mr bayly had only one string to his bowor rather to his lyre  he wrote a great deal to be sure about the passion of love which count tolstoi thinks we make too much of  he did not dream that the affairs of the heart should be regulated by the stateby the permanent secretary of the marriage office  that is what we are coming to of course unless the enthusiasts of free love and go away as you please failed with their little programme  no doubt there would be poetry if the state regulated or left wholly unregulated the affections of the future  mr bayly living in other times among other manners piped of the hard tyranny of a mother     we met twas in a crowd and i thought he would shun me    he came i could not breathe for his eye was upon me    he spoke his words were cold and his smile was unaltered    i knew how much he felt for his deeptoned voice faltered    i wore my bridal robe and i rivalled its whiteness    bright gems were in my hairhow i hated their brightness    he called me by my name as the bride of another    oh thou hast been the cause of this anguish my mother  in future when the reformers of marriage have had their way we shall read     the world may think me gay for i bow to my fate    but thou hast been the cause of my anguish o state  for even when true love is regulated by the county council or the village community it will still persist in not running smooth  of these passions then mr bayly could chant but let us remember that he could also dally with old romance that he wrote     the mistletoe hung in the castle hall    the holly branch shone on the old oak wall  when the bride unluckily got into the ancient chest     it closed with a spring  and dreadful doom    the bride lay clasped in her living tomb  so that her lover mourned for his fairy bride and never found out her premature casket  this was true romance as understood when peel was consul  mr bayly was rarely political but he commemorated the heroes of waterloo our last victory worth mentioning     yet mourn not for them for in future tradition       their fame shall abide as our tutelar star    to instil by example the glorious ambition       of falling like them in a glorious war    though tears may be seen in the bright eyes of beauty       one consolation must ever remain    undaunted they trod in the pathway of duty       which led them to glory on waterloos plain  could there be a more simple tyrtaeus and who that reads him will not be ambitious of falling in a glorious war  bayly indeed is always simple he is simple sensuous and passionate and milton asked no more from a poet     a wreath of orange blossoms    when next we met she wore    the expression of her features    was more thoughtful than before  on his own principles wordsworth should have admired this unaffected statement but wordsworth rarely praised his contemporaries and said that guy mannering was a respectable effort in the style of mrs radcliffe  nor did he even extol though it is more in his own line     of what is the old man thinking    as he leans on his oaken staff  my own favourite among mr baylys effusions is not a sentimental ode but the following gush of true natural feeling     oh give me new faces new faces new faces       ive seen those around me a fortnight and more    some people grow weary of things or of places       but persons to me are a much greater bore    i care not for features im sure to discover       some exquisite trait in the first that you send    my fondness falls off when the noveltys over       i want a new face for an intimate friend  this is perfectly candid we should all prefer a new face if pretty every fortnight     come i pray you and tell me this       all good fellows whose beards are grey    did not the fairest of the fair    common grow and wearisome ere       ever a month had passed away  for once mr bayly uttered in his new faces a sentiment not usually expressed but universally felt and now he suffers as a poet because he is no longer a new face because we have welcomed his juniors  to bayly we shall not return but he has one rare merithe is always perfectly plainspoken and intelligible     farewell to my bayly farewell to the singer       whose tender effusions my aunts used to sing    farewell for the fame of the bard does not linger       my favourite minstrels no longer the thing    but though on his temples has faded the laurel       though broken the lute and though veiled is the crest    my bayly at worst is uncommonly moral       which is more than some new poets are at their best  farewell to our bayly about whose songs we may say with mr thackeray in vanity fair that they contain numberless goodnatured simple appeals to the affections  we are no longer affectionate goodnatured simple  we are cleverer than baylys audience but are we better fellows     theodore de banville   there are literary reputations in france and england which seem like the fairies to be unable to cross running water  dean swift according to m paul de saintvictor is a great man at dover a pigmy at calaisson talent qui enthousiasme langleterre ninspire ailleurs quun morne etonnement  m paul de saintvictor was a fair example of the french critic and what he says about swift was possibly truefor him  there is not much resemblance between the dean and m theodore de banville except that the latter too is a poet who has little honour out of his own country  he is a charming singer at calais at dover he inspires un morne etonnement a bleak perplexity  one has never seen an english attempt to describe or estimate his genius  his unpopularity in england is illustrated by the fact that the london library that respectable institution does not or did not possess a single copy of any one of his books  he is but feebly represented even in the collection of the british museum  it is not hard to account for our indifference to m de banville  he is a poet not only intensely french but intensely parisian  he is careful of form rather than abundant in manner  he has no story to tell and his sketches in prose his attempts at criticism are not very weighty or instructive  with all his limitations however he represents in company with m leconte de lisle the second of the three generations of poets over whom victor hugo reigned  m de banville has been called by people who do not like and who apparently have not read him un saltimbanque litteraire a literary ropedancer  other critics who do like him but who have limited their study to a certain portion of his books compare him to a worker in gold who carefully chases or embosses dainty processions of fauns and maenads he is in point of fact something more estimable than a literary rope dancer something more serious than a working jeweller in rhymes  he calls himself un raffine but he is not like many persons who are proud of that title un indifferent in matters of human fortune  his earlier poems of course are much concerned with the matter of most early poemswith lydia and cynthia and their light loves  the verses of his second period often deal with the most evanescent subjects and they now retain but a slight petulance and sparkle as of champagne that has been too long drawn  in a prefatory plea for m de banvilles poetry one may add that he has loved our people and that no poet no critic has honoured shakespeare with brighter words of praise  theodore de banville was born at moulin on march 14th 1823 and he is therefore three years younger than the dictionaries of biography would make the world believe  he is the son of a naval officer and according to m charles baudelaire a descendant of the crusaders  he came much too late into the world to distinguish himself in the noisy exploits of 1830 and the chief event of his youth was the publication of les cariatides in 1842  this first volume contained a selection from the countless verses which the poet produced between his sixteenth and his nineteenth year  whatever other merits the songs of minors may possess they have seldom that of permitting themselves to be read  les cariatides are exceptional here  they are above all things readable on peut les lire a peu de frais m de banville says himself  he admits that his lighter works the poems called in england vers de societe are a sort of intellectual cigarette  m emile de girardin said in the later days of the empire that there were too many cigarettes in the air  their stale perfume clings to the literature of that time as the odour of pastilles yet hangs about the verse of dorat the designs of eisen the work of the pompadour period  there is more than smoke in m de banvilles ruling inspiration his lifelong devotion to letters and to great men of lettersshakespeare moliere homer victor hugo  these are his gods the memory of them is his muse  his enthusiasm is worthy of one who though born too late to see and know the noble wildness of 1830 yet lives on the recollections and is strengthened by the example of that revival of letters  whatever one may say of the renouveau of romanticism with its affectations the young men of 1830 were sincere in their devotion to liberty to poetry to knowledge  one can hardly find a more brilliant and touching belief in these great causes than that of edgar quinet as displayed in the letters of his youth  de banville fell on more evil times  when les cariatides was published poets had begun to keep an eye on the bourse and artists dabbled in finance  the new volume of song in the sordid age was a november primrose and not unlike the flower of spring there was a singular freshness and hopefulness in the verse a wonderful certitude dans lexpression lyrique as saintebeuve said  the mastery of musical speech and of various forms of song was already to be recognised as the basis and the note of the talent of de banville  he had style without which a man may write very nice verses about heaven and hell and other matters and may please thousands of excellent people but will write poetrynever  comparing de banvilles boys work with the boys work of mr tennyson one observes in eachles cariatides as in the hesperidesthe timbre of a new voice  poetry so fresh seems to make us aware of some want which we had hardly recognised but now are sensible of at the moment we find it satisfied  it is hardly necessary to say that this gratifying and welcome strangeness this lyric originality is nearly all that m de banville has in common with the english poet whose two priceless volumes were published in the same year as les cariatides  the melody of mr tennysons lines the cloudy palaces of his imagination rose     as ilion like a mist rose into towers  when apollo sang  the architecture was floating at first and confused while the little theatre of m de banvilles poetry where he sat piping to a dance of nixies was brilliantly lit and elegant with fresh paint and gilding  the cariatides support the pediment and roof of a theatre or temple in the graecofrench style  the poet proposed to himself     a cote de venus et du fils de latone    peindre la fee et la peri  the longest poem in the book and the most serious la voie lactee reminds one of the palace of art written before the afterthought before the whiteeyed corpses were found lurking in corners  beginning with homer the ionian father of the rest     ce dieu pere des dieux quadore ionie  the poet glorifies all the chief names of song  there is a long procession of illustrious shadows before shakespeare comesshakespeare whose genius includes them all     toute creation a laquelle on aspire    tout reve toute chose emanent de shakespeare  his mind has lent colour to the flowers and the sky to     la fleur qui brode un point sur les manteau des plaines    les nenuphars penches et les pales roseaux    qui disent leur chant sombre au murmure des eaux  one recognises more sincerity in this hymn to all poets from orpheus to heine than in les baisers de pierrea clever imitation of de mussets stories in verse  love of art and of the masters of art a passion for the figures of old mythology which had returned again after their exile in 1830 gaiety and a revival of the dexterity of villon and marotthese things are the characteristics of m de banvilles genius and all these were displayed in les cariatides  already too his preoccupation with the lighter and more fantastic sort of theatrical amusements shows itself in lines like these     de son lit a baldaquin       le soleil de son beau globe    avait lair dun arlequin       etalant sa garderobe     et sa soeur au front changeant       mademoiselle la lune    avec ses grands yeux dargent       regardait la terre brune  the verse about the sun in bed unconsciously miltonic is in a vein of bad taste which has always had seductions for m de banville  he mars a fine later poem on roncevaux and roland by a similar absurdity  the angel michael is made to stride down the steps of heaven four at a time and m de banville fancies that this sort of thing is like the simplicity of the ages of faith  in les cariatides especially in the poems styled en habit zinzolin m de banville revived old measuresthe rondeau and the poor little triolet  these are forms of verse which it is easy to write badly and hard indeed to write well  they have knocked at the door of the english muses gardena runaway knock  in les cariatides they took a subordinate place and played their pranks in the shadow of the grave figures of mythology or at the close of the procession of dionysus and his maenads  de banville often recalls keats in his choice of classical themes  les exiles a poem of his maturity is a french hyperion le triomphe de bacchus reminds one of the song of the bassarids in endymion     so many and so many and so gay  there is a pretty touch of the pedant who exists says m de banville in the heart of the poet in this verse     il reve a cama lamour aux cinq fleches fleuries    qui lorsque soupire au milieu des roses prairies    la douce vasanta parmi les bosquets de santal    envoie aux cinq sens les fleches du carquois fatal  the bacchus of titian has none of this oriental languor no memories of perfumed places where the throne of indian cama slowly sails  one cannot help admiring the fancy which saw the conquering god still steeped in asiatic ease still unawakened to more vigorous passion by the fresh wind blowing from thrace  of all the olympians diana has been most often hymned by m de banville his imagination is haunted by the figure of the goddess  now she is manifest in her hellenic aspect as homer beheld her taking her pastime in the chase of boars and swift deer and with her the wild woodnymphs are sporting the daughters of zeus and leto is glad at heart for her child towers over them all and is easy to be known where all are fair odyssey vi  again artemis appears more thoughtful as in the sculpture of jean goujon touched with the sadness of moonlight  yet again she is the weary and exiled spirit that haunts the forest of fontainebleau and is a stranger among the woodland folk the fades and nixies  to this goddess being triple in her divided deity m de banville has written his hymn in the characteristic form of the old french ballade  the translator may borrow chaucers apology     and eke to me it is a grete penaunce    syth rhyme in english hath such scarsete    to folowe word by word the curiosite    of banville flower of them that make in france     ballade sur les hotes mysterieux de la foret     still sing the mocking fairies as of old       beneath the shade of thorn and holly tree    the west wind breathes upon them pure and cold       and still wolves dread diana roving free          in secret woodland with her company    tis thought the peasants hovels know her rite    when now the wolds are bathed in silver light       and first the moonrise breaks the dusky grey    then down the dells with blown soft hair and bright       and through the dim wood dian thrids her way     with waterweeds twined in their locks of gold       the strange cold forestfairies dance in glee    sylphs overtimorous and overbold       haunt the dark hollows where the dwarf may be          the wild red dwarf the nixies enemy    then mid their mirth and laughter and affright       the sudden goddess enters tall and white          with one long sigh for summers passed away    the swift feet tear the ivy nets outright       and through the dim wood dian thrids her way     she gleans her sylvan trophies down the wold       she hears the sobbing of the stags that flee    mixed with the music of the hunting rolled       but her delight is all in archery    and nought of ruth and pity wotteth she       more than the hounds that follow on the flight    the tall nymph draws a golden bow of might       and thick she rains the gentle shafts that slay    she tosses loose her locks upon the night       and dian through the dim wood thrids her way     envoi     prince let us leave the din the dust the spite    the gloom and glare of towns the plague the blight       amid the forest leaves and fountain spray    there is the mystic home of our delight       and through the dim wood dian thrids her way  the piece is characteristic of m de banvilles genius  through his throng of operatic nixies and sylphs of the ballet the cold muse sometimes passes strange but not unfriendly  he for his part has never degraded the beautiful forms of old religion to make the laughing stock of fools  his little play diane au bois has grace and gravity and tenderness like the tenderness of keats for the failings of immortals  the gods are jealous exceedingly if any goddess takes a mortal man to her paramour as demeter chose iasion  the least that mortal poets can do is to show the olympians an example of toleration  les cariatides have delayed us too long  they are wonderfully varied vigorous and rich and full of promise in many ways  the promise has hardly been kept  there is more seriousness in les stalactites 1846 it is true but then there is less daring  there is one morsel that must be quoteda fragment fashioned on the air and the simple words that used to waken the musings of george sand when she was a child dancing with the peasant children     nous nirons plus an bois les lauries sont coupes       les amours des bassins les naiades en groupe    voient reluire au soleil en cristaux decoupes       les flots silencieux qui coulaient de leur coupe    les lauriers sont coupes et le cerf aux abois       tressaille au son du cor nous nirons plus au bois    ou des enfants joueurs riait la folle troupe       parmi les lys dargent aux pleurs du ciel trempes    voici lherbe quon fauche et les lauriers quon coupe       nous nirons plus au bois les lauriers sont coupes  in these days banville like gerard de nerval in earlier times ronsardised  the poem a la font georges full of the memories of childhood sweet and rich with the air and the hour of sunset is written in a favourite metre of ronsards  thus ronsard says in his lyrical version of five famous lines of homer     la gresle ni la neige       nont tels lieux pour leur siege          ne la foudre oncques la             ne devala     the snow and wind and hail       may never there prevail          nor thunderbolt doth fall             nor rain at all  de banville chose this metre rapid yet melancholy with its sad emphatic cadence in the fourth line as the vehicle of his childish memories     o champs pleins de silence    ou mon heureuse enfance          avait des jours encor          tout files dor     o ma vieille font georges    vers qui les rougesgorges          et le doux rossignol          prenaient leur vol  so this poem of the fountain of youth begins tout file dor and closes when the dusk is washed with silver     a lheure ou sous leurs voiles       les tremblantes etoiles          brodent le ciel changeant             de fleurs dargent  the stalactites might detain one long but we must pass on after noticing an unnamed poem which is the french counterpart of keats ode to a greek urn     quautour du vase pur trop beau pour la bacchante       la verveine melee a des feuilles dacanthe    fleurisse et que plus bas des vierges lentement       savancent deux a deux dun pas sur et charmant    les bras pendants le long de leurs tuniques droites       et les cheyeux tresses sur leurs tetes etroites  in the same volume of the definite series of poems come les odelettes charming lyrics one of which addressed to theophile gautier was answered in the wellknown verses called lart  if there had been any rivalry between the writers m de banville would hardly have cared to print gautiers odelette beside his own  the tone of it is infinitely more manly one seems to hear a deep decisive voice replying to tones far less sweet and serious  m de banville revenged himself nobly in later verses addressed to gautier verses which criticise the genius of that workman better we think than anything else that has been written of him in prose or rhyme  the less serious poems of de banville are perhaps the better known in this country  his feats of graceful metrical gymnastics have been admired by every one who cares for skill pure and simple  les odes funambulesques and les occidentales are like ornamental skating  the author moves in many circles and cuts a hundred fantastic figures with a perfect ease and smoothness  at the same time naturally he does not advance nor carry his readers with him in any direction  les odes funambulesques were at first unsigned  they appeared in journals and magazines and as m de banville applied the utmost lyrical skill to light topics of the moment they were the most popular of articles de paris  one must admit that they bore the english reader and by this time long scholia are necessary for the enlightenment even of the parisian student  the verses are perhaps the birdchorus of french life but they have not the permanent truth and delightfulness of the birdchorus in aristophanes  one has easily too much of the carnival the masked ball the debardeurs and the pierrots  the people at whom m de banville laughed are dead and forgotten  there was a certain m paul limayrac of those days who barked at the heels of balzac and other great men in the revue des deux mondes  in his honour de banville wrote a song which parodied all popular aspirations to be a flower  m limayrac was supposed to have become a blossom     sur les coteaux et dans les landes       voltigeant comme un oiseleur    buloz en ferait des guirlandes       si limayrac devenait fleur  there is more of high spirits than of wit in the lyric which became as popular as our modern invocation of jingo the god of battles  it chanced one night that m limayrac appeared at a masked ball in the opera house  he was recognised by some one in the crowd  the turbulent waltz stood still the music was silent and the dancers of every hue howled at the critic     si paul limayrac devenait fleur  fancy a british reviewer known as such to the british public and imagine that public taking a lively interest in the feuds of men of letters  paris to be sure was more or less of a university town thirty years ago and the students were certain to be largely represented at the ball  the odes funambulesques contain many examples of m de banvilles skill in reviving old forms of versetriolets rondeaux chants royaux and ballades  most of these were composed for the special annoyance of m buloz m limayrac and a m jacquot who called himself de mirecourt the rondeaux are full of puns in the refrain houssaye ou cest lyre lire lire and so on not very exhilarating  the pantoum where lines recur alternately was borrowed from the distant malay but primitive pantoum in which the last two lines of each stanza are the first two of the next occur in old french folksong  the popular trick of repetition affording a rest to the memory of the singer is perhaps the origin of all refrains  de banvilles later satires are directed against permanent objects of human indignationthe little french debauchee the hypocritical friend of reaction the bloodthirsty chauviniste  tired of the flashy luxury of the empire his memory goes back to his youth     lorsque la levre de laurore       baisait nos yeux souleves    et que nous netions pas encore       la france des petits creves  the poem et tartufe prolongs the note of a satire always popular in francethe satire of scarron moliere la bruyere against the clerical curse of the nation  the roman question was tartufes stronghold at the moment  french interests demanded that italy should be headless     et tartufe  il nous dit entre deux cremus       que pour tout bon francais lempire est a rome    et quayant pour aieux romulus et remus       nous tetterons la louve a jamaisle pauvre homme  the new tartufe worships st chassepot who once it will not be forgotten wrought miracles but he has his doubts as to the morality of explosive bullets  the nymph of modern warfare is addressed as she hovers above the geneva convention     quoi nymphe du canon raye       tu montres ces pudeurs risibles    et ce petit air effraye       devant les balles exploisibles  de banville was for long almost alone among poets in his freedom from weltschmerz from regret and desire for worlds lost or impossible  in the later and stupider corruption of the empire sadness and anger began to vex even his careless muse  she had piped in her time to much wild dancing but could not sing to a waltz of mushroom speculators and decorated capitalists  le sang de la coupe contains a very powerful poem the curse of venus pronounced on paris the city of pleasure which has become the city of greed  this verse is appropriate to our own commercial enterprise     vends les bois ou dormaient viviane et merlin       laigle de mont nest fait que pour ta gibeciere       la neige vierge est la pour fournir ta glaciere    le torrent qui bondit sur le roc sybillin       et vole diamant neige ecume et poussiere       nest plus bon qua tourner tes meules de moulin  in the burning indignation of this poem m de banville reaches his highest mark of attainment  les exiles is scarcely less impressive the outcast gods of hellas wandering in a forest of ancient gaul remind one at once of the fallen deities of heine the decrepit olympians of bruno and the large utterance of keatss hyperion  among great exiles victor hugo le pere labas dans lile is not forgotten     et toi qui laccueillis sol libre et verdoyant       qui prodigues les fleurs sur tes coteaux fertiles    et qui sembles sourire a locean bruyant       sois benie ile verte entre toutes les iles  the hoarsest note of m de banvilles lyre is that discordant one struck in the idylles prussiennes  one would not linger over poetry or prose composed during the siege in hours of shame and impotent scorn  the poet sings how the sword the flashing durendal is rusted and broken how victory is to him            qui se cela    dans un trou sous la terre noire  he can spare a tender lyric to the memory of a prussian officer a lad of eighteen shot dead through a volume of pindar which he carried in his tunic  it is impossible to leave the poet of gaiety and goodhumour in the mood of the prisoner in besieged paris  his trente six ballades joyeuses make a far more pleasant subject for a last word  there is scarcely a more delightful little volume in the french language than this collection of verses in the most difficult of forms which pour forth with absolute ease and fluency notes of mirth banter joy in the spring in letters art and goodfellowship     loiselet retourne aux forets       je suis un poete lyrique  he cries with a note like a birds song  among the thirtysix every one will have his favourites  we venture to translate the ballad de banville     aux enfants perdus     i know cythera long is desolate       i know the winds have stripped the garden green    alas my friends beneath the fierce suns weight       a barren reef lies where loves flowers have been       nor ever lover on that coast is seen    so be it for we seek a fabled shore    to lull our vague desires with mystic lore       to wander where loves labyrinths beguile    there let us land there dream for evermore       it may be we shall touch the happy isle     the sea may be our sepulchre  if fate       if tempests wreak their wrath on us serene    we watch the bolt of heaven and scorn the hate       of angry gods that smite us in their spleen       perchance the jealous mists are but the screen    that veils the fairy coast we would explore    come though the sea be vexed and breakers roar       come for the breath of this old world is vile    haste we and toil and faint not at the oar       it may be we shall touch the happy isle     grey serpents trail in temples desecrate       where cypris smiled the golden maid the queen    and ruined is the palace of our state       but happy loves flit round the mast and keen       the shrill wind sings the silken cords between    heroes are we with wearied hearts and sore    whose flower is faded and whose locks are hoar       haste ye light skiffs where myrtle thickets smile    loves panthers sleep mid roses as of yore       it may be we shall touch the happy isle     envoi     sad eyes the blue sea laughs as heretofore    all singing birds your happy music pour       ah poets leave the sordid earth awhile    flit to these ancient gods we still adore       it may be we shall touch the happy isle  alas the mists that veil the shore of our cythera are not the summer haze of watteau but the smoke and steam of a commercial time  it is as a lyric poet that we have studied m de banville  je ne mentends qua la meurique he says in his ballad on himself but he can write prose when he pleases  it is in his drama of gringoire acted at the theatre francais and familiar in the version of messrs pollock and besant that m de banvilles prose shows to the best advantage  louis xi is supping with his bourgeois friends and with the terrible olivier le daim  two beautiful girls are of the company friends of pierre gringoire the strolling poet  presently gringoire himself appears  he is dying of hunger he does not recognise the king and he is promised a good supper if he will recite the new satirical ballade des pendus which he has made at the monarchs expense  hunger overcomes his timidity and addressing himself especially to the king he enters on this goodly matter     where wide the forest boughs are spread       where flora wakes with sylph and fay    are crowns and garlands of men dead       all golden in the morning gay    within this ancient garden grey       are clusters such as no mail knows    where moor and soldan bear the sway       this is king louis orchard close     these wretched folk wave overhead       with such strange thoughts as none may say    a moment still then sudden sped       they swing in a ring and waste away    the morning smites them with her ray       they toss with every breeze that blows    they dance where fires of dawning play       this is king louis orchard close     all hanged and dead theyve summoned       with hell to aid that hears them pray    new legions of an army dread       now down the blue sky flames the day    the dew dies off the foul array       of obscene ravens gathers and goes    with wings that flap and beaks that flay       this is king louis orchard close     envoi     prince where leaves murmur of the may       a tree of bitter clusters grows    the bodies of men dead are they       this is king louis orchard close  poor gringoire has no sooner committed himself than he is made to recognise the terrible king  he pleads that if he must join the ghastly army of the dead he ought at least to be allowed to finish his supper this the king grants and in the end after gringoire has won the heart of the heroine he receives his life and a fair bride with a full dowry  gringoire is a play very different from m de banvilles other dramas and it is not included in the pretty volume of comedies which closes the lemerre series of his poems  the poet has often declared with an iteration which has been parodied by m richepin that comedy is the child of the ode and that a drama without the lyric element is scarcely a drama at all  while comedy retains either the choral ode in its strict form or its representative in the shape of lyric enthusiasm le lyrisme comedy is complete and living  gringoire to our mind has plenty of lyric enthusiasm but m de banville seems to be of a different opinion  his republished comedies are more remote from experience than gringoire his characters are ideal creatures familiar types of the stage like scapin and le beau leandre or ethereal persons or figures of old mythology like diana in diane au bois and deidamia in the piece which shows achilles among women  m de banvilles dramas have scarcely prose enough in them to suit the modern taste  they are masques for the delicate diversion of an hour and it is not in the nature of things that they should rival the success of blatant buffooneries  his earliest piecesle feuilleton daristophane acted at the odeon dec 26th 1852 and le cousin du roi odeon april 4th 1857were written in collaboration with philoxene boyer a generous but indiscreet patron of singers     dans les salons de philoxene       nous etions quatrevingt rimeurs  m de banville wrote parodying the quatrevingt ramuers of victor hugo  the memory of m boyers enthusiasm for poetry and his amiable hospitality are not unlikely to survive both his compositions and those in which m de banville aided him  the latter poet began to walk alone as a playwright in le beau leandre vaudeville 1856a piece with scarcely more substance than the french scenes in the old francoitalian drama possess  we are taken into an impossible world of gay nonmorality where a wicked old bourgeois orgon his daughter colombine a pretty flirt and her lover leandre a lighthearted scamp bustle through their little hour  leandre who has no notion of being married says le ciel nest pas plus pur que mes intentions  and the artless colombine replies alors marionsnous  to marry colombine without a dowry forms as a modern novelist says no part of leandres profligate scheme of pleasure  there is a sort of treble intrigue orgon wants to give away colombine dowerless leandre to escape from the whole transaction and colombine to secure her dot and her husband  the strength of the piece is the brisk action in the scene when leandre protests that he cant rob orgon of his only daughter and orgon insists that he can refuse nothing except his ducats to so charming a soninlaw the play is redeemed from sordidness by the costumes  leandre is dressed in the attire of watteaus lindifferent in the louvre and wears a diamondhilted sword  the lady who plays the part of colombine may select delightful privilege the prettiest dress in watteaus collection  this love of the glitter of the stage is very characteristic of de banville  in his deidamie odeon nov 18th 1876 the players who took the roles of thetis achilles odysseus deidamia and the rest were accoutred in semibarbaric raiment and armour of the period immediately preceding the graecophoenician about the eighth century bc  again we notice the touch of pedantry in the poet  as for the play the sombre thread in it is lent by the certainty of achilles early death the fate which drives him from deidamies arms and from the sea kings isle to the leagues under the fatal walls of ilion  of comic effect there is plenty for the sisters of deidamie imitate all the acts by which achilles is likely to betray himselfgrasp the sword among the insidious presents of odysseus when he seizes the spear and drink each one of them a huge beaker of wine to the confusion of the trojans 70 on a parisian audience the imitations of the tone of the odyssey must have been thrown away  for example here is a passage which is as near being homeric as french verse can be  deidamie is speaking in a melancholy mood     heureux les epoux rois assis dans leur maison    qui voient tranquillement senfuir chaque saison    lepoux tenant son sceptre environne de gloire    et lepouse filant sa quenouille divoire    mais le jeune heros que la glaive a son franc    court dans le noir combat les mains teintes de sang    laisse sa femme en pleurs dans sa haute demeure  with the accustomed pedantry m de banville in the scene of the banquet makes the cupbearer go round dealing out a little wine with which libation is made and then the feast goes on in proper homeric fashion  these overwrought details are forgotten in the parting scenes where deidamie takes what she knows to be her last farewell of achilles and girds him with his sword     la lame de lepee en sa forme divine    est pareille a la feuille austere du laurier  let it be noted that each of m de banvilles more serious plays ends with the same scene with slight differences  in florise never put on the stage the wandering actress of hardys troupe leaves her lover the young noble and the shelter of his castle to follow where art and her genius beckon her  in diane au bois the goddess that leads the precise life turns her back on eros who has subdued even her and passes from the scene as she waves her hand in sign of a farewell ineffably mournful  nearer tragedy than this m de banville does not care to go and if there is any deeper tragedy in scenes of blood and in stages strewn with corpses from that he abstains  his florise is perhaps too long perhaps too learned and certainly we are asked to believe too much when a kind of etherealised consuelo is set before us as the prima donna of old hardys troupe     mais florise nest pas une femme  je suis    lharmonieuse voix que berce vos ennuis    je suis la lyre aux sons divers que le poete    fait resonner et qui sans lui serait muette    une comedienne enfin  je ne suis pas    une femme  an actress who was not a woman had little to do in the company of scarrons angelique and mademoiselle de lestoile  florise in short is somewhat too allegorical and haughty a creature while colombine and nerine vaudeville june 1864 are rather tricksy imps than women of flesh and blood  m de banvilles stage on the whole is one of glitter and fantasy yet he is too much a greek for the age that appreciates la belle helene too much a lyric dramatist to please the contemporaries of sardou he lends too much sentiment and dainty refinement to characters as flimsy as those of offenbachs drama  like other french poets m de banville has occasionally deigned to write feuilletons and criticisms  not many of these scattered leaves are collected but one volume la mer de nice pouletmalassis et de broise paris 1861 may be read with pleasure even by jealous admirers of gautiers success as a chronicler of the impressions made by southern scenery  to de banville he does not conceal it a journey to a place so far from paris as the riviera was no slight labour  even from the roses the palms the siren sea the wells of water under the fronds of maidenhair fern his mind travels back wistfully to the city of his love  i am i have always been one of those devotees of paris who visit greece only when they gaze on the face so fair and so terrible of the twicevictorious venus of the louvre  one of those obstinate adorers of my town am i who will never see italy save in the glass that reflects the tawny hair of titians violante or in that dread isle of alcinous where lionardo shows you the mountain peaks that waver in the blue behind the mysterious monna lisa  but the faculty of physicians which has i own the right to be sceptical does not believe that neuralgia can be healed by the high sun which titian and veronese have fixed on the canvas  to me the faculty prescribes the real sun of nature and of life and here am i condemned to learn in suffering all that passes in the mind of a poet of paris exiled from that blessed place where he finds the cyclades and the islands blossoming the vale of avalon and all the heavenly homes of the fairies of experience and desire  nice is tomi to this ovid but he makes the best of it and sends to the editor of the moniteur letters much more diverting than the tristia to tell the truth he never overcomes his amazement at being out of paris streets and in a glade of the lower alps he loves to be reminded of his dear city of pleasure  only under the olives of monaco those solemn and ancient trees he feels what surely all men feel who walk at sunset through their shadowthe memory of a mysterious twilight of agony in an olive garden  et ceuxci les pales oliviers nestce pas de ces heures desolees ou comme torture supreme le sauveur acceptait en son ame lirreparable misere du doute nestce pas alors quil ont appris de lui a courber le front sous le poids imperieux des souvenirs  the pages which m de banville consecrates to the villa sardou where rachel died may disenchant perhaps some readers of mr matthew arnolds sonnet  the scene of rachels death has been spoiled by improvements in too theatrical taste  all these notes however were made many years ago and visitors of the riviera though they will find the little book charming where it speaks of seas and hills will learn that france has greatly changed the city which she has annexed  as a practical man and a parisian de banville has printed pp 17981 a recipe for the concoction of the marseilles dish bouillabaisse the mess that thackerays ballad made so famous  it takes genius however to cook bouillabaisse and to parody what de banville says about his own recipe for making a mechanical ballade en employment ce moyen on est sur de faire une mauvaise irremediablement mauvaise bouillabaisse  the poet adds the remark that une bouillabaisse reussie vaut un sonnet sans defaut  there remains one field of m de banvilles activity to be shortly described  of his emaux parisiens short studies of celebrated writers we need say no more than that they are written in careful prose m de banville is not only a poet but in his petit traite de poesie francaise bibliotheque de lecho de la sorbonne sd a teacher of the mechanical part of poetry  he does not of course advance a paradox like that of baudelaire that poetry can be taught in thirty lessons he merely instructs his pupil in the material partthe scansion metres and so onof french poetry  in this little work he introduces these traditional forms of verse which once caused some talk in england the rondel rondeau ballade villanelle and chant royal  it may be worth while to quote his testimony as to the merit of these modes of expression  this cluster of forms is one of our most precious treasures for each of them forms a rhythmic whole complete and perfect while at the same time they all possess the fresh and unconscious grace which marks the productions of primitive times  now there is some truth in this criticism for it is a mark of mans early ingenuity in many arts to seek complexity where you would expect simplicity and yet to lend to that complexity an infantine naturalness  one can see this phenomenon in early decorative art and in early law and custom and even in the complicated structure of primitive languages  now just as early and even savage races are our masters in the decorative use of colour and of carving so the nameless mastersingers of ancient france may be our teachers in decorative poetry the poetry some call vers de societe  whether it is possible to go beyond this and adapt the old french forms to serious modern poetry it is not for any one but time to decide  in this matter as in greater affairs securus judicat orbis terrarum  for my own part i scarcely believe that the revival would serve the nobler ends of english poetry  now let us listen again to de banville  in the rondel as in the rondeau and the ballade all the art is to bring in the refrain without effort naturally gaily and each time with novel effect and with fresh light cast on the central idea  now you can teach no one to do that and m de banville never pretends to give any recipes for cooking rondels or ballades worth reading without poetic vision all is mere marquetery and cabinetmakers work that is so far as poetry is concernednothing  it is because he was a poet not a mere craftsman that villon was and remains the king the absolute master of balladland  about the rondeau m de banville avers that it possesses nimble movement speed grace lightness of touch and as it were an ancient fragrance of the soil that must charm all who love our country and our countrys poetry in its every age  as for the villanelle m de banville declares that it is the fairest jewel in the casket of the muse erato while the chant royal is a kind of fossil poem a relic of an age when kings and allegories flourished the kings and the gods are dead like pan or at least we no longer find them able by touch royal or divine to reanimate the magnificent chant royal  this is m de banvilles apology in pro lyra sua that light lyre of many tones in whose jingle the eternal note of modern sadness is heard so rarely  if he has a lesson to teach english versifiers surely it is a lesson of gaiety  they are only too fond of rue and rosemary and now and then prefer the cypress to the bay  m de banvilles muse is content to wear roses in her locks and perhaps may retain for many years a laurel leaf from the ancient laurel tree which once sheltered the poet at turbia     homer and the study of greek   the greek language is being ousted from education here in france and in america  the speech of the earliest democracies is not democratic enough for modern anarchy  there is nothing to be gained it is said by a knowledge of greek  we have not to fight the battle of life with hellenic waiters and even if we had romaic or modern greek is much more easily learned than the old classical tongue  the reason of this comparative ease will be plain to any one who retaining a vague memory of his greek grammar takes up a modern greek newspaper  he will find that the idioms of the modern newspaper are the idioms of all newspapers that the grammar is the grammar of modern languages that the opinions are expressed in barbarous translations of barbarous french and english journalistic cliches or commonplaces  this ugly and undignified mixture of the ancient greek characters and of ancient greek words with modern grammar and idioms and stereotyped phrases is extremely distasteful to the scholar  modern greek as it is at present printed is not the natural spoken language of the peasants  you can read a greek leading article though you can hardly make sense of a greek rural ballad  the peasant speech is a thing of slow development there is a basis of ancient greek in it with large elements of slavonic turkish italian and other imposed or imported languages  modern literary greek is a hybrid of revived classical words blended with the idioms of the speeches which have arisen since the fall of the roman empire  thus thanks to the modern and familiar element in it modern greek as she is writ is much more easily learned than ancient greek  consequently if any one has need for the speech in business or travel he can acquire as much of it as most of us have of french with considerable ease  people therefore argue that ancient greek is particularly superfluous in schools  why waste time on it they ask which could be expended on science on modern languages or any other branch of education  there is a great deal of justice in this position  the generation of men who are now middleaged bestowed much time and labour on greek and in what it may be asked are they better for it  very few of them keep up their greek  say for example that one was in a form with fifty boys who began the studyit is odds against five of the survivors still reading greek books  the worldly advantages of the study are slight it may lead three of the fifty to a good degree and one to a fellowship but good degrees may be taken in other subjects and fellowships may be abolished or nationalised with all other forms of property  then why maintain greek in schools  only a very minute percentage of the boys who are tormented with it really learn it  only a still smaller percentage can read it after they are thirty  only one or two gain any material advantage by it  in very truth most minds are not framed by nature to excel and to delight in literature and only to such minds and to schoolmasters is greek valuable  this is the case against greek put as powerfully as one can state it  on the other side we may say though the remark may seem absurd at first sight that to have mastered greek even if you forget it is not to have wasted time  it really is an educational and mental discipline  the study is so severe that it needs the earnest application of the mind  the study is averse to indolent intellectual ways it will not put up with a there or thereabouts any more than mathematical ideas admit of being made to seem extremely plausible  he who writes and who may venture to offer himself as an example is naturally of a most slovenly and slatternly mental habit  it is his constant temptation to scamp every kind of work and to say it will do well enough  he hates taking trouble and verifying references  and he can honestly confess that nothing in his experience has so helped in a certain degree to counteract those tendenciesas the labour of thoroughly learning certain greek textsthe dramatists thucydides some of the books of aristotle experience has satisfied him that greek is of real educational value and apart from the acknowledged and unsurpassed merit of its literature is a severe and logical training of the mind  the mental constitution is strengthened and braced by the labour even if the language is forgotten in later life  it is manifest however that this part of education is not for everybody  the real educational problem is to discover what boys greek will be good for and what boys will only waste time and dawdle over it certainly to men of a literary turn a very minute percentage greek is of an inestimable value  great poets even may be ignorant of it as shakespeare probably was as keats and scott certainly were as alexandre dumas was  but dumas regretted his ignorance scott regretted it  we know not how much scotts admitted laxity of style and hurried careless habit might have been modified by a knowledge of greek how much of grace permanence and generally of art his genius might have gained from the language and literature of hellas  the most homeric of modern men could not read homer  as for keats he was born a greek it has been said but had he been born with a knowledge of greek he never probably would have been guilty of his chief literary faults  this is not certain for some modern men of letters deeply read in greek have all the qualities of fustian and effusiveness which longinus most despised  greek will not make a luxuriously asiatic mind hellenic it is certain but it may at least help to restrain effusive and rhetorical gabble  our asiatic rhetoricians might perhaps be even more barbarous than they are if greek were a sealed book to them  however this may be it is at least well to find out in a school what boys are worth instructing in the greek language  now of their worthiness of their chances of success in the study homer seems the best touchstone and he is certainly the most attractive guide to the study  at present boys are introduced to the language of the muses by pedantically written grammars full of the queerest and most arid metaphysical and philological verbiage  the very english in which these deplorable books are composed may be scientific may be comprehensible by and useful to philologists but is utterly heartbreaking to boys  philology might be made fascinating the history of a word and of the processes by which its different forms in different senses were developed might be made as interesting as any other story of events  but grammar is not taught thus boys are introduced to a jargon about matters meaningless and they are naturally as much enchanted as if they were listening to a chimaera bombinans in vacuo  the grammar to them is a mere buzz in a chaos of nonsense  they have to learn the buzz by rote and a pleasant process that isa seductive initiation into the mysteries  when they struggle so far as to be allowed to try to read a piece of greek prose they are only like the marchioness in her experience of beer she once had a sip of it  ten lines of xenophon narrating how he marched so many parasangs and took breakfast do not amount to more than a very unrefreshing sip of greek  nobody even tells the boys who xenophon was what he did there and what it was all about nobody gives a brief and interesting sketch of the great march of its history and objects  the boys straggle along with xenophon knowing not whence or whither     they stray through a desolate region       and often are faint on the march  one by one they fall out of the ranks they mutiny against xenophon they murmur against that commander they desert his flag  they determine that anything is better than greek that nothing can be worse than greek and they move the tender hearts of their parents  they are put to learn german which they do not learn unluckily but which they find it comparatively easy to shirk  in brief they leave school without having learned anything whatever  up to a certain age my experiences at school were precisely those which i have described  our grammar was not so philological abstruse and arid as the instruments of torture employed at present  but i hated greek with a deadly and sickening hatred i hated it like a bully and a thief of time  the verbs in greek text completed my intellectual discomfiture and xenophon routed me with horrible carnage  i could have run away to sea but for a strong impression that a life on the ocean wave did not set my genius as alan breck says  then we began to read homer and from the very first words in which the muse is asked to sing the wrath of achilles peleus son my mind was altered and i was the devoted friend of greek  here was something worth reading about here one knew where one was here was the music of words here were poetry pleasure and life  we fortunately had a teacher dr hodson who was not wildly enthusiastic about grammar  he would set us long pieces of the iliad or odyssey to learn and when the days task was done would make us read on adventuring ourselves in the unseen and construing as gallantly as we might without grammar or dictionary  on the following day we surveyed more carefully the ground we had pioneered or skirmished over and then advanced again  thus to change the metaphor we took homer in large draughts not in sips in sips no epic can be enjoyed  we now revelled in homer like keats in spenser like young horses let loose in a pasture  the result was not the making of many accurate scholars though a few were made others got nothing better than enjoyment in their work and the firm belief opposed to that of most schoolboys that the ancients did not write nonsense  to love homer as steele said about loving a fair lady of quality is a liberal education  judging from this example i venture very humbly to think that any one who even at the age of cato wants to learn greek should begin where greek literature where all profane literature beginswith homer himself  it was thus not with grammars in vacuo that the great scholars of the renaissance began  it was thus that ascham and rabelais began by jumping into greek and splashing about till they learned to swim  first of course a person must learn the greek characters  then his or her tutor may make him read a dozen lines of homer marking the cadence the surge and thunder of the hexametersa music which like that of the sirens few can hear without being lured to the seas and isles of song  then the tutor might translate a passage of moving interest like priams appeal to achilles first of course explaining the situation  then the teacher might go over some lines minutely pointing out how the greek words are etymologically connected with many words in english  next he might take a substantive and a verb showing roughly how their inflections arose and were developed and how they retain forms in homer which do not occur in later greek  there is no reason why even this part of the lesson should be uninteresting  by this time a pupil would know more or less where he was what greek is and what the homeric poems are like  he might thus believe from the first that there are good reasons for knowing greek that it is the key to many worlds of life of action of beauty of contemplation of knowledge then after a few more exercises in homer the grammar being judiciously worked in along with the literature of the epic a teacher might discern whether it was worth while for his pupils to continue in the study of greek  homer would be their guide into the realms of gold  it is clear enough that homer is the best guide  his is the oldest extant greek his matter is the most various and delightful and most appeals to the young who are wearied by scraps of xenophon and who cannot be expected to understand the tragedians  but homer is a poet for all ages all races and all moods  to the greeks the epics were not only the best of romances the richest of poetry not only their oldest documents about their own historythey were also their bible their treasury of religious traditions and moral teaching  with the bible and shakespeare the homeric poems are the best training for life  there is no good quality that they lack manliness courage reverence for old age and for the hospitable hearth justice piety pity a brave attitude towards life and death are all conspicuous in homer  he has to write of battles and he delights in the joy of battle and in all the movement of war  yet he delights not less but more in peace in prosperous cities hearths secure in the tender beauty of children in the love of wedded wives in the frank nobility of maidens in the beauty of earth and sky and sea and seaward murmuring river in sun and snow frost and mist and rain in the whispered talk of boy and girl beneath oak and pine tree  living in an age where every man was a warrior where every city might know the worst of sack and fire where the noblest ladies might be led away for slaves to light the fire and make the bed of a foreign master homer inevitably regards life as a battle  to each man on earth comes the wicked day of destiny as malory unconsciously translates it and each man must face it as hardily as he may  homer encourages them by all the maxims of chivalry and honour  his heart is with the brave of either sidewith glaucus and sarpedon of lycia no less than with achilles and patroclus  ah friend cries sarpedon if once escaped from this battle we were for ever to be ageless and immortal neither would i myself fight now in the foremost ranks nor would i urge thee into the wars that give renown but nowfor assuredly ten thousand fates of death on every side beset us and these may no man shun nor none avoidforward now let us go whether we are to give glory or to win it  and forth they go to give and take renown and death all the shields and helms of lycia shining behind them through the dust of battle the singing of the arrows the hurtling of spears the rain of stones from the locrian slings  and shields are smitten and chariothorses run wild with no man to drive them and sarpedon drags down a portion of the achaean battlement and aias leaps into the trench with his deadly spear and the whole battle shifts and shines beneath the sun  yet he who sings of the war and sees it with his sightless eyes sees also the trojan women working at the loom cheating their anxious hearts with broidery work of gold and scarlet or raising the song to athene or heating the bath for hector who never again may pass within the gates of troy  he sees the poor weaving woman weighing the wool that she may not defraud her employers and yet may win bread for her children  he sees the children the golden head of astyanax his shrinking from the splendour of the heros helm  he sees the child odysseus going with his father through the orchard and choosing out some apple trees for his very own  it is in the mouth of the ruthless achilles the fatal the fated the swiftfooted hero with the hands of death that homer places the tenderest of his similes  wherefore weepest thou patroclus like a fond little maid that runs by her mothers side praying her mother to take her up snatching at her gown and hindering her as she walks and tearfully looking at her till her mother takes her uplike her patroclus dost thou softly weep  this is what chesterfield calls the porterlike language of homers heroes  such are the moods of homer so full of love of life and all things living so rich in all human sympathies so readily moved when the great hound argus welcomes his master whom none knew after twenty years but the hound knew him and died in that welcome  with all this love of the real which makes him dwell so fondly on every detail of armour of implement of art on the diverscoloured goldwork of the shield on the making of tires for chariotwheels on the forging of iron on the rose tinted ivory of the sidonians on cooking and eating and sacrificing on pet dogs on wasps and their ways on fishing on the boar hunt on scenes in baths where fair maidens lave water over the heroes on undiscovered isles with good harbours and rich land on ploughing mowing and sowing on the furniture of houses on the golden vases wherein the white dust of the dead is laidwith all this delight in the real homer is the most romantic of poets  he walks with the surest foot in the darkling realm of dread persephone beneath the poplars on the solemn last beach of ocean  he has heard the sirens music and the song of circe chanting as she walks to and fro casting the golden shuttle through the loom of gold  he enters the cave of the man eater he knows the unsunned land of the cimmerians in the summer of the north he has looked from the fiord of the laestrygons on the midnight sun  he has dwelt on the floating isle of aeolus with its wall of bronze unbroken and has sailed on those phaeacian barks that need no help of helm or oar that fear no stress either of wind or tide that come and go and return obedient to a thought and silent as a dream  he has seen the four maidens of circe daughters of wells and woods and of sacred streams  he is the secondsighted man and beholds the shroud that wraps the living who are doomed and the mystic dripping from the walls of blood yet unshed  he has walked in the garden closes of phaeacia and looked on the face of gods who fare thither and watch the weaving of the dance  he has eaten the honeysweet fruit of the lotus and from the hand of helen he brings us that egyptian nepenthe which puts all sorrow out of mind his real world is as real as that in henry v his enchanted isles are charmed with the magic of the tempest  his young wooers are as insolent as claudio as flushed with youth his beggarmen are brethren of edie ochiltree his nausicaa is sister to rosalind with a different charm of stately purity in love  his enchantresses hold us yet with their sorceries his helen is very beauty she has all the sweetness of ideal womanhood and her repentance is without remorse  his achilles is youth itself glorious cruel pitiful splendid and sad ardent and loving and conscious of its doom  homer in truth is to be matched only with shakespeare and of shakespeare he has not the occasional wilfulness freakishness and modish obscurity  he is a poet all of gold universal as humanity simple as childhood musical now as the flow of his own rivers now as the heavy plunging wave of his own ocean  such then as far as weak words can speak of him is the first and greatest of poets  this is he whom english boys are to be ignorant of if greek be ousted from our schools or are to know only in the distorting mirror of a versified or in the pale shadow of a prose translation  translations are good only as teachers to bring men to homer  english verse has no measure which even remotely suggests the various flow of the hexameter  translators who employ verse give us a feeble homer dashed with their own conceits and moulded to their own style  translators who employ prose tell the story without the song but at least they add no twopenny beauties and cheap conceits of their own  i venture to offer a few examples of original translation in which the mannerisms of poets who have or have not translated homer are parodied and of course except in the case of pope exaggerated  the passage is the speech of the secondsighted man before the slaying of the wooers in the hall     ah wretched men what ill is this ye suffer  in night are swathed    your heads your faces your knees and the voice of wailing is    kindled and cheeks are wet with tears and with blood drip the walls    and the fair main beams of the roof and the porch is full of shadows    and full is the courtyard of ghosts that hasten hellward below the    darkness and the sun has perished out of heaven and an evil mist    sweeps up over all  so much for homer  the first attempt at metric translation here given is meant to be in the manner of pope     caitiffs he cried what heavendirected blight    involves each countenance with clouds of night    what pearly drop the ashen cheek bedews    why do the walls with gouts ensanguined ooze    the court is thronged with ghosts that neath the gloom    seek plutos realm and diss awful doom    in ebon curtains phoebus hides his head    and sable mist creeps upward from the dead  this appears pretty bad and nearly as unhomeric as a translation could possibly be  but pope aided by broome and fenton managed to be much less homeric much more absurd and infinitely more classical in the sense in which pope is classical     o race to death devote with stygian shade    each destined peer impending fates invade    with tears your wan distorted cheeks are drowned    with sanguine drops the walls are rubied round    thick swarms the spacious hall with howling ghosts    to people orcus and the burning coasts    nor gives the sun his golden orb to roll    but universal night usurps the pole  who could have conjectured that even pope would wander away so far from his matchless original  wretches cries theoclymenus the seer and that becomes o race to death devote  your heads are swathed in night turns into with stygian shade each destined peer peer is good impending fates invade where homer says nothing about styx nor peers  the latin orcus takes the place of erebus and the burning coasts are derived from modern popular theology  the very grammar detains or defies the reader is it the sun that does not give his golden orb to roll or who or what  the only place where the latterday broome or fenton can flatter himself that he rivals pope at his own game is     what pearly drop the ashen cheek bedews  this is if possible more classical than popes own     with tears your wan distorted cheeks are drowned  but pope nobly revindicates his unparalleled power of translating funnily when in place of the walls drip with blood he writes     with sanguine drops the walls are rubied round  homer does not appear to have been acquainted with rubies but what of that  and how noble how eminently worthy of pope it is to add that the ghosts howl  i tried to make them gibber but ghosts do gibber in homer though not in this passage so pope fenton broome and co make them howl  no pope is not lightly to be rivalled by a modern translator  the following example a faroff following of a noted contemporary poet may be left unsigned     wretches the bane hath befallen the night and the blight of your    sin    sweeps like a shroud oer the faces and limbs that were gladsome    therein    and the dirge of the dead breaketh forth and the faces of all men are    wet    and the walls are besprinkled with blood and the ghosts in the    gateway are met    ghosts in the court and the gateway are gathered hell opens her lips    and the sun in his splendour is shrouded and sickens in spasm of    eclipse  the next is longer and slower the poet has a difficulty in telling his story     wretches he cried what doom is this what night    clings like a facecloth to the face of each    sweeps like a shroud oer knees and head for lo    the windy wail of death is up and tears    on every cheek are wet each shining wall    and beauteous interspace of beam and beam    weeps tears of blood and shadows in the door    flicker and fill the portals and the court    shadows of men that hellwards yearnand now    the sun himself hath perished out of heaven    and all the land is darkened with a mist  that could never be mistaken for a version by the laureate as perhaps any contemporary hacks works might have been taken for popes  the difficulty perhaps lies here any one knows where to have pope any one knows that he will evade the mot propre though the precise evasion he may select is hard to guess  but the laureate would keep close to his text and yet would write like himself very beautifully but not with an homeric swiftness and strength  who is to imitate him  as to mr william morris he might be fabled to render greek text niddering wights but beyond that conjecture is baffled 91  or is this the kind of thing     niddering wights what a bane do ye bear for your knees in the    night    and your heads and your faces are shrouded and clamour that knows    not delight    rings and your cheeks are begrutten and blood is besprent on the    walls    blood on the tapestry fair woven and barrowwights walk in the halls    fetches and wraiths of the chosen of the norns and the sun from the    lift    shudders and over the midgarth and swans bath the cloudshadows    drift  it may be argued that though this is perhaps a translation it is not english never was and never will be  but it is quite as like homer as the performance of pope  such as these or not so very much better than these as might be wished are our efforts to translate homer  from chapman to avia or mr william morris they are all eminently conscientious and erroneous and futile chapman makes homer a fanciful euphuistic obscure and garrulous elizabethan but chapman has fire  pope makes him a wit spirited occasionally noble full of points and epigrams and queer rococo conventionalisms  cowper makes him slow lumbering a milton without the music  maginn makes him pipe an irish jig     scarcely had she begun to wash    when she was aware of the grisly gash  lord derby makes him respectable and ponderous  lord tennyson makes him not less but certainly not more than tennysonian  homer in the laureates few fragments of experiment is still a poet but he is not homer  mr morris and avia make him icelandic and archaistic and hard to scan though vigorous in his fetters for all that  bohn makes him a crib and of other translators in prose it has been said with a humour which one of them appreciates that they render homer into a likeness of the book of mormon  homer is untranslatable  none of us can bend the bow of eurytus and make the bowstring ring sweetly at the touch like the swallows song the adventure is never to be achieved and if greek is to be dismissed from education not the least of the sorrows that will ensue is english ignorance of homer     the last fashionable novel   the editor of a great american newspaper once offered the author of these lines a commission to explore a lost country the seat of a fallen and forgotten civilisation  it was not in yucatan or central africa or thibet or kafiristan this desolate region once so popular so gaudy so much frequented and desired  it was only the fashionable novels of the forties say from 1835 to 1850 that i was requested to examine and report upon  but i shrank from the colossal task  i am no mr stanley and the length the difficulties the arduousness of the labour appalled me  besides i do not know where that land lies the land of the old fashionable novel the kor of which thackerays lady fanny flummery is the ayesha  what were the names of the old novels and who were the authors and in the circulating library of what undiscoverable watering place are they to be found  we have heard of mrs gore we have heard of tremayne and emilia wyndham and the bachelor of the albany and many of us have read pelham or know him out of carlyles art and those great curses which he spoke  but who was the original or who were the originals that sat for the portrait of the fashionable authoress lady fanny flummery and of what work is lords and liveries a parody the author is also credited with dukes and dejeuners marchionesses and milliners etc  could any candidate in a literary examination name the prototypes  let mantuamakers puff her but not men says thackeray speaking of lady fanny flummery and the fashionable authoress is no more  blessed blessed thought  no more fiddlefaddle novels  when will you arrive o happy golden age  well it has arrived though we are none the happier for all that  the fashionable novel has ceased to exist and the place of the fashionable authoress knows her no more  thackeray plainly detested lady fanny  he writes about her her books her critics her successes with a certain bitterness  can it be possible that a world which rather neglected barry lyndon was devoted to marchionesses and milliners  lady fanny is represented as having editors and reviewers at her feet she sits among the flowers like the sirens and around her are the bones of critics corrupt in death  she is puffed for the sake of her bouquets her dinners her affabilities and condescensions  she gives a reviewer a great garnet pin adorned wherewith he paces the town  her adorers compare her to him who sleeps by avon  in one of mr blacks novels there is a lady of this kind who captivates the tribe of log rollers as mr black calls them  this lady appears to myself to be a quite impossible she  one has never met her with her wiles nor come across her track even and seen the bodies and the bones of those who perished in puffing her  some persons of rank and fashion have a taste for the society of some men of letters but nothing in the way of literary puffery seems to come of it  of course many critics like to give their friends and acquaintances an applausive hand and among their acquaintances may be ladies of fashion who write novels but we read nowhere such extraordinary adulations as augustus timson bestowed on lady fanny  the fashionable authoress is nearly extinct though some persons write well albeit they are fashionable  the fashionable novel is as dead as a door nail lothair was nearly the last of the species  there are novelists who write about society to be sure like mr norris but their tone is quite different  they do not speak as if dukes and earls were some strange superior kind of beings their manner is that of men accustomed to and undazzled by earls writing for readers who do not care whether the hero is a lord or a commoner  they are at ease though not terribly in zion  thackeray himself introduces plenty of the peerage but it cannot be said that he is always at ease in their society  he remembers that they are lords and is on his guard very often and suspicious and sarcastic except perhaps when he deals with a gentleman like lord kew  he examines them like curious wild animals in the jardin des plantes  he is an accomplished naturalist and not afraid of the lion but he remembers that the animal is royal and has a title  mr norris for instance shows nothing of this mood  mr trollope was not afraid of his dukes he thought none the worse of a man because he was the high and puissant prince of omnium  as for most novelists they no longer paint fashionable society with enthusiasm  mr henry james has remarked that young british peers favour the word beastlya point which does not always impress itself into other people so keenly as into mr henry james  in reading him you do not forget that his tufts are tufts  but then tufts are really strange animals to the denizens of the great republic  perhaps the modern realism has made novelists desert the world where dukes and dowagers abound  novelists do not know very much about it they are not wont to haunt the gilded saloons and they prefer to write about the manners which they know  a very good novel in these strange ruinous times might be written with a duke for hero but nobody writes it and if anybody did write it in the modern manner it would not in the least resemble the old fashionable novel  here a curious point arises  we have all studied the ingenious lady who calls herself ouida  now is ouida or rather was ouida in her early state sublime the last of the old fashionable novelists or did thackeray unconsciously prophesy of her when he wrote his burlesque lords and liveries  think of the young earl of bagnigge who was never heard to admire anything except a coulis de dindonneau a la st menehould    or the bouquet of a flask of medoc of carbonnells best quality or a goutte of marasquin from the cellars of briggs and hobson  we have met such young patricians in under two flags and idalia  but then there is a difference ouida never tells us that her hero was blest with a mother of excellent principles who had imbued his young mind with that morality which is so superior to all the vain pomps of the world  but a hero of ouidas might easily have had a father who was struck down by the side of the gallant collingwood in the bay of fundy  the heroes themselves may have looked at the pyramids without awe at the alps without reverence  they do say corpo di bacco and the duca de montepulciano does reply e bellissima certamente  and their creator might conceivably remark non cuivis contigit  but lady fanny flummerys ladies could not dress as ouidas ladies do they could not quote petronius arbiter they had never heard of suetonius  no age reproduces itself  there is much of our old fashionable authoress in ouidas earlier tales there is plenty of the peerage plenty of queer french in old novels and latin yet more queer but where is the elan which takes archaeology with a rush which sticks at no adventure however nobly incredible where is the pathos the simplicity the purple splendour of ouidas manner or manners  no the spirit of the world mirroring itself in the minds of individuals simpered and that simper was lady fanny flummery  but it did many things more portentous than simpering when it reflected itself in ouida  is it that we do no longer gape on the aristocracy admiringly and write of them curiously as if they were creatures in a paradise  is it that thackeray has converted us  in part surely we are just as snobbish as ever though the gods of our adoration totter to their fall and a hideous hum from the mob outside thrills through the temples  in fiction on the other hand the world of fashion is played out  nobody cares to read or write about the dear duchess  if a peer comes into a novel he comes in not as a coroneted curiosity but as a man just as if he were a dentist or a stockbroker  his rank is an accident it used to be the essence of his luminous apparition  i scarce remember a lord in all the many works of mr besant nor do they people the romances of mr black  mr kipling does not deal in them nor mr george meredith much mr haggard hardly gets beyond a baronet and he wears chain mail in central africa and tools with an axe  mrs oliphant has a scotch peer but he is less interesting and prominent than his family ghost  no we have only ouida left and mr norriswho writes about people of fashion indeed but who has nothing in him of the old fashionable novelist  is it to a republic to france that we must look for our fashionable novelsto france and to america  every third person in m guy de maupassants tales has a de and is a marquis or a vicomte  as for m paul bourget one really can be happy with him in the fearless old fashion  with him we meet lord henry bohun and m de casal a vicomte and all the marquises and marquises and all the pale blue boudoirs and sentimental duchesses whose hearts are only too good and who get into the most complicated amorous scrapes  that young republican m bourget sincerely loves a blason a pedigree diamonds lace silver dressing cases silver baths essences pomatums le grand luxe  so does gyp apart from her wit gyp is delightful to read introducing us to the very best of bad company  even m fortune du boisgobey likes a vicomte and is partial to the noblesse while m georges ohnet is accused of entering the golden world of rank like a man without a wedding garment and of being lost and at sea among his aristocrats  they order these things better in france they still appeal to the fine old natural taste for rank and luxury splendour and refinement  what is gyp but a lady fanny flummery reussielady fanny with the trifling additional qualities of wit and daring  observe her noble scorn of m george ohnet it is a fashionable arrogance  to my mind i confess the decay of the british fashionable novel seems one of the most threatening signs of the times  even in france institutions are much more permanent than here  in france they have fashionable novels and very good novels too no man of sense will deny that they are far better than our dilettantism of the slums or our religious and social tracts in the disguise of romance  if there is no new tale of treasure and bandits and fights and lions handy may i have a fashionable novel in french to fall back upon  even count tolstoi does not disdain the genre  there is some uncommonly high life in anna karenine  he adds a great deal of psychology to be sure so does m paul bourget  but he takes you among smart people who have everything handsome about themtitles and lands and rents  is it not a hard thing that an honest british snob if he wants to move in the highest circles of fiction must turn to french novelists or russian or american  as to the american novels of the elite and the beau monde their elegance is obscured to english eyes because that which makes one new yorker better than another that which creates the upper ten thousand dear phrase of new york is so inconspicuous  for example the scientific inquirer may venture himself among the novels of two young american authors  few english students make this voyage of exploration but the romances of these ingenious writers are really or really try to be a kind of fashionable novels  it is a queer domain of fashion to be sure peopled by the strangest aborigines who talk and are talked about in a language most interesting to the philologist  here poor lady fanny flummery would have been sadly to seek for her characters though noble were moral and her pen was wielded on the side of church and state  but these western fashionables have morals and a lingo of their own made in equal parts of the american idioms and of expressions transferred from the jargon of decadence and the parnassiculet contemporain  as one peruses these novels one thinks of a new tale to be toldthe last of the fashionables who died away like the buffalo and the grisly bear in some canon or forest of the wild west  i think this distinguished being ultimus hominum venustiorum will find the last remnants of the gentlemanly party in some indian tribe apaches or sioux  i see him raised to the rank of chief and leading the redskinned and painted cavaliers on the warpath against the vulgarians of the ultimate democracy  to depict this dandy chief would require the art at once of a cooper and a ouida  let me attempt    the last fight of four hairbrushes   by this time the sioux were flying in all directions mowed down by the fire of gatling and maxim guns  the scrub of little big horn creek was strewn with the bodies of writhing braves  on the livid and volcanic heights of mount buncombe the painted tents were blazing merrily  but on a mound above the creek an ancient fortress of some longforgotten people a small group of indian horsemen might be observed steady as rocks in the refluent tide of war  the fire from their winchester repeaters blazed out like the streamers of the northern lights  again and again the flower of the united states army had charged up the mound only to recoil in flight or to line the cliff with their corpses  the first irish cuirassiers had been annihilated parnells own alas in the heat of the combat had turned their fratricidal blackthorns on mcarthys brigade and these two gallant squadrons were mixed and broken falling beneath the blows of brothers estranged  but at last the fire from the redmen on the bluff slackened and grew silent  the ammunition was exhausted  there was a movement in the group of braves  crazy horse and bald coyote turned to four hairbrushes who sat his steed atalanta last winner of the last grand national with all the old careless elegance of the row  four hairbrushes said crazy horse and a tear rolled down his painted cheek nought is left but flight  then fly said four hairbrushes languidly lighting a cigarette which he took from a diamondstudded gold etui the gift of the kaiser in old days  nay not without the white chief said bald coyote and he seized the reins of four hairbrushes to lead him from that stricken field  vous etes trop vieux jeu mon ami murmured four hairbrushes je ne suis ni edouard ii ni charles edouard a culloden  quatrebrosses meurt mais il ne se rend pas  the indian released his hold baffled by the erudition and the calm courage of his captain  i make tracks he said and swinging round so that his horse concealed his body he galloped down the bluff and through the american cavalry scattering death from the arrows which he loosed under his horses neck  four hairbrushes was alone  unarmed as ever he sat save for the huntingwhip in his right hand  scalp him yelled the friendly crows  nay take him alive a seemlier knight never backed steed cried the gallant americans  from their midst rode a courteous cavalier captain john barry the scholar the hero of sword and pen  yield thee sir knight he said doffing his kepi in martial courtesy  four hairbrushes replied to his salute and was opening his curved and delicate lips to speak when a chance bullet struck him full in the breast  he threw up his arms reeled and fell  the gallant american leaping from saddle to ground rushed to raise his head  through the warpaint he recognised him  great heaven he cried it is  hush whispered four hairbrushes with a weary smile let annesley de vere of the blues die unnamed  tell them that i fell in harness  he did indeed  under his feathered and painted cloak barry found that annesley ever careful of his figure ever loyal in love the last of the dandies yet wore the corset of madame de telliere  it was wet with his lifeblood  so dies said barry the last english gentleman     thackeray   i thought how some peoples towering intellects and splendid cultivated geniuses rise upon simple beautiful foundations hidden out of sight thus in his letters to mrs brookfield mr thackeray wrote after visiting the crypt of canterbury cathedral with its charming harmonious powerful combination of arches and shafts beautiful whichever way you see them developed like a fine music  the simile applies to his own character and genius to his own and perhaps to that of most great authors whose works are our pleasure and comfort in this troublesome world  there are critics who profess a desire to hear nothing or as little as may be of the lives of great artists whether their instrument of art was the pen or the brush or the chisel or the strings and reeds of music  with those critics perhaps most of us agree when we read books that gossip about shelley or coleridge or byron give us their poetry we say and leave their characters alone we do not want tattle about claire and chatter about harriet we want to be happy with the skylark or the cloud  possibly this instinct is correct where such a poet as shelley is concerned whose life like his poetry was as the life of winds and tides whose genius unlike the skylarks was more true to the point of heaven than the point of home but reflection shows us that on the whole as mr thackeray says a mans genius must be builded on the foundations of his character  where that genius deals with the mingled stuff of human lifesorrow desire love hatred kindness meannessthen the foundation of character is especially important  people are sometimes glad that we know so little of shakespeare the man yet who can doubt that a true revelation of his character would be not less worthy noble and charming than the general effect of his poems  in him it is certain we should always find an example of nobility of generosity of charity and kindness and selfforgetfulness  indeed we find these qualities as a rule in the biographies of the great sympathetic poets and men of genius of the peni do not say in the lives of rebels of genius meteoric poets like byron the same basis the same foundations of rectitude of honour of goodness of melancholy and of mirth underlie the art of moliere of scott of fielding and as his correspondence shows of thackeray  it seems probable that a complete biography of thackeray will never be written  it was his wish to live in his works alone that wish his descendants respect and we must probably regard the letters to mr and mrs brookfield as the last private and authentic record of the man which will be given at least to this generation  in these letters all sympathetic readers will find the man they have long known from his writingsthe man with a heart so tender that the world often drove him back into a bitterness of opposition into an assumed hardness and defensive cynicism  there are readers so unluckily constituted that they can see nothing in thackeray but this bitterness this cruel sense of meanness and power of analysing shabby emotions sneaking vanities contemptible ambitions  all of us must often feel with regret that he allowed himself to be made too unhappy by the spectacle of failings so common in the world he knew best that he dwelt on them too long and lashed them too complacently  one hopes never to read lovel the widower again and one gladly skips some of the speeches of the old campaigner in the newcomes  they are terrible but not more terrible than life  yet it is hard to understand how mr ruskin for example can let such scenes and characters hide from his view the kindness gentleness and pity of thackerays nature  the letters must open all eyes that are not wilfully closed and should at last overcome every prejudice  in the letters we see a man literally hungering and thirsting after affection after lovea man cut off by a cruel stroke of fate from his natural solace from the centre of a home     god took from me a lady dear  he says in the most touching medley of doggerel and poetry made instead of writing my punch this morning  losing a lady dear he takes refuge as he may he finds comfort as he can in all the affections within his reach in the society of an old college friend and of his wife in the love of all children beginning with his own in a generous liking for all good work and for all good fellows  did any man of letters except scott ever write of his rivals as thackeray wrote of dickens  artists are a jealous race  potter hates potter and poet hates poet as hesiod said so long ago  this jealousy is not mere envy it is really a strong sense of how things ought to be done in any art touched with a natural preference for a mans own way of doing them now what could be more unlike than the ways of dickens and thackeray the subjects chosen by these great authors are not more diverse than their styles  thackeray writes like a scholar not in the narrow sense but rather as a student and a master of all the refinements and resources of language  dickens copies the chaff of the street or he roams into melodramatics drops into poetryblank verse at leastand touches all with peculiarities we might say mannerisms of his own  i have often thought and even tried to act on the thought that some amusing imaginary letters might be written from characters of dickens about characters of thackeray from characters of thackeray about characters of dickens  they might be supposed to meet each other in society and describe each other  can you not fancy captain costigan on dick swiveller blanche amory on agnes pen on david copperfield and that tiger steerforth  what would the family solicitor of the newcomes have to say of mr tulkinghorn  how would george warrington appreciate mr pickwick  yes the two great novelists were as opposed as two men could bein manner in style in knowledge of books and of the world and yet how admirably thackeray writes about dickens in his letters as in his books  how he delights in him  how manly is that emulation which enables an author to see all the points in his rival and not to carp at them but to praise and be stimulated to keener effort  consider this passage  have you read dickens  o it is charming  brave dickens  it has some of his very prettiest touchesthose inimitable dickens touches which make such a great man of him and the reading of the book has done another author a great deal of good  thackeray is just as generous and perhaps more critical in writing of kingsley  a fine honest goahead fellow who charges a subject heartily impetuously with the greatest courage and simplicity but with narrow eyes his are extraordinarily brave blue and honest and with little knowledge of the world i think  but he is superior to us worldlings in many ways and i wish i had some of his honest pluck  i have often wished that great authors when their days of creation were over when their minds grow grey and bald would condescend to tell us the history of their books  sir walter scott did something of this kind in the prefaces to the last edition of the waverley novels published during his life  what can be more interesting than his account in the introduction to the fortunes of nigel of how he worked how he planned and found all his plots and plans overridden by the demon at the end of his pen  but sir walter was failing when he began those literary confessions good as they are he came to them too late  yet these are not confessions which an author can make early  the pagan aztecs only confessed once in a lifetimein old age when they had fewer temptations to fall to their old loves then they made a clean breast of it once for all  so it might be with an author  while he is in his creative vigour we want to hear about his fancied persons about pendennis beatrix becky not about himself and how he invented them  but when he has passed his best then it is he who becomes of interest it is about himself that we wish him to speak as far as he modestly may  who would not give lovel the widower and philip for some autobiographical and literary prefaces to the older novels  they need not have been more egotistic than the roundabout papers  they would have had far more charm  some things cannot be confessed  we do not ask who was the original sir pitt crawley or the original blanche amory  but we might learn in what mood in what circumstances the author wrote this passage or that  the letters contain a few notes of this kind a few literary confessions we hear that emmy sedley was partly suggested by mrs brookfield partly by thackerays mother much by his own wife  there scarce seems room for so many elements in emmys personality  for some reason ladies love her not nor do men adore her  i have been her faithful knight ever since i was ten years old and read vanity fair somewhat stealthily  why does one like her except because she is such a thorough woman  she is not clever she is not very beautiful she is unhappy and she can be jealous  one pities her and that is akin to a more tender sentiment one pities her while she sits in the corner and beckys green eyes flatter her oaf of a husband one pities her in the poverty of her fathers house in the famous battle over daffys elixir in the separation from the younger george  you begin to wish some great joy to come to her it does not come unalloyed you know that dobbin had bad quarters of an hour with this lady and had to disguise a little of his tenderness for his own daughter  yes emmy is more complex than she seems and perhaps it needed three ladies to contribute the various elements of her person and her character  one of them the jealous one lent a touch to helen pendennis to laura to lady castlewood  probably this may be the reason why some persons dislike thackeray so  his very best women are not angels 109  are the very best women angels  it is a pious opinionthat borders on heresy  when the letters began to be written in 1847 thackeray had his worst years in a worldly sense behind him  they were past the times when he wrote in galignani for ten francs a day  has any literary ghoul disinterred his old tenfranc articles in galignani  the time of barry lyndon too was over  he says nothing of that masterpiece and only a word about the great hoggarty diamond  i have been rereading it  upon my word and honour if it doesnt make you cry i shall have a mean opinion of you  it was written at a time of great affliction when my heart was very soft and humble  amen  ich habe auch viel geliebt of pendennis as it goes on he writes that it is awfully stupid which has not been the verdict of the ages  he picks up materials as he passes  he dines with some officers and perhaps he stations them at chatteris  he meets miss g and her converse suggests a love passage between pen and blanche  why did he dislike fair women so  it runs all through his novels  becky is fair  blanche is fair  outside the old yellow covers of pendennis you see the blonde mermaid amusing and clever and depraved dragging the lover to the sea and the nutbrown maid holding him back  angelina of the rose and the ring is the becky of childhood she is fair and the good rosalba is brune  in writing pendennis he had a singular experience  he looked over his own back numbers and found a passage which i had utterly forgotten as if i had never read or written it  in lockharts life of scott james ballantyne says that when the bride of lammermoor was first put into his hands in a complete shape he did not recollect one single incident character or conversation it contained  that is to say he remembered nothing of his own invention though his memory of the traditional parts was as clear as ever  ballantyne remarks the history of the human mind contains nothing more wonderful  the experience of thackeray is a parallel to that of scott  pendennis it must be noted was interrupted by a severe illness and the bride of lammermoor was dictated by sir walter when in great physical pain  on one occasion thackeray lit upon a very stupid part of pendennis i am sorry to say and yet how well written it is  what a shame the author dont write a complete good story  will he die before doing so or come back from america and do it  did he ever write a complete good story  did any one ever do such a thing as write a threevolume novel or a novel of equal length which was a complete good story  probably not or if any mortal ever succeeded in the task it was the great alexander dumas  the three musketeers i take leave to think and twenty years after are complete good stories good from beginning to end stories from beginning to end without a break without needless episode  perhaps one may say as much for old mortality and for quentin durward  but scott and dumas were born storytellers narrative was the essence of their genius at its best the current of romance rolls fleetly on bearing with it persons and events mirroring scenes but never ceasing to be the main thingthe central interest  perhaps narrative like this is the chief success of the novelist  he is triumphant when he carries us on as wolf the famous critic was carried on by the tide of the iliad in that pure and rapid current of action  nobody would claim this especial merit for thackeray  he is one of the greatest of novelists he displays human nature and human conduct so that we forget ourselves in his persons but he does not make us forget ourselves in their fortunes  whether clive does or does not marry ethel or esmond beatrix does not very greatly excite our curiosity  we cannot ring the bells for clives second wedding as the villagers celebrated the bridal of pamela  it is the development of character it is the authors comments it is his own personality and his unmatched and inimitable style that win our admiration and affection  we can take up vanity fair or pendennis or the newcomes just where the book opens by chance and read them with delight as we may read montaigne  when one says one can take up a book anywhere it generally means that one can also lay it down anywhere but it is not so with thackeray  whenever we meet him he holds us with his charm his humour his eloquence his tenderness  if he has not in the highest degree the narrative power he does possess in a degree perhaps beyond any other writer of english that kind of poetic quality which is not incompatible with prose writing  a great deal has been said about prose poetry  as a rule it is very poor stuff  as prose it has a tendency to run into blank verse as poetry it is highly rhetorical and selfconscious  it would be invidious and might be irritating to select examples from modern masters of prose poetry  they have never been poets  but the prose of a poet like milton may be and is poetical in the true sense and so upon occasions was the prose of thackeray  some examples linger always in the memory and dwell with their music in the hearing  one i have quoted elsewhere the passage in the newcomes where clive at the lecture on the poetry of the domestic affections given by sir barnes newcome sees ethel whom he has lost  and the past and its dear histories and youth and its hopes and passions and tones and looks for ever echoing in the heart and present in the memorythose no doubt poor clive saw and heard as he looked across the great gulf of time and parting and grief and beheld the woman he had loved for many years  the great gulf of time and parting and griefsome of us are on the farther side of it and our old selves and our old happiness and our old affections beyond grow near grow clear now and then at the sight of a face met by chance in the world at the chance sound of a voice  such are human fortunes and human sorrows not the worst not the greatest for these old loves do not diethey live in exile and are the better parts of our souls  not the greatest nor the worst of sorrows for shame is worse and hopeless hunger and a life all of barren toil without distractions without joy must be far worse  but of those myriad tragedies of the life of the poor thackeray does not write  how far he was aware of them how deeply he felt them we are not informed  his highest tragedy is that of the hunger of the heart his most noble prose sounds in that meeting of harry esmond with lady castlewood in the immortal speech which has the burden bringing your sheaves with you  all that scene appears to me no less unique no less unsurpassable no less perfect than the ode to the nightingale of keats or the lycidas of milton  it were superfluous to linger over the humour of thackeray  only shakespeare and dickens have graced the language with so many happy memories of queer pleasant people with so many quaint phrases each of which has a kind of freemasonry and when uttered or recalled makes all friends of thackeray into family friends of each other  the sayings of mr harry foker of captain costigan of gumbo are all like old dear family phrases they live imperishable and always new like the words of sir john the fat knight or of sancho panza or of dick swiveller or that other sancho sam weller  they have that shakespearian gift of being ever appropriate and undyingly fresh  these are among the graces of thackeray these and that inimitable style which always tempts and always baffles the admiring and despairing copyist  where did he find the trick of it of the words which are invariably the best words and invariably fall exactly in the best places  the best words in the best places is part of coleridges definition of poetry it is also the essence of thackerays prose  in these letters to mrs brookfield the style is precisely the style of the novels and essays  the style with thackeray was the man  he could not write otherwise  but probably to the last this perfection was not mechanical was not attained without labour and care  in dr john browns works in his essay on thackeray there is an example of a proof sheet on which the master has made corrections and those corrections bring the passage up to his accustomed level to the originality of his rhythm  here is the piece     another finis another slice of life which tempus edax has    devoured  and i may have to write the word once or twice perhaps    and then an end of ends  finite is ever and infinite beginning  oh    the troubles the cares the ennui the complications the    repetitions the old conversations over and over again and here and    there all the delightful passages the dear the brief the forever    remembered     and then  a few chapters more and then the last and behold finis    itself coming to an end and the infinite beginning     how like music this writes dr john brownlike one trying the    same air in different ways as it were searching out and sounding all    its depths  the words were almost the last that thackeray wrote    perhaps the very last  they reply as it were to other words which    he had written long before to mrs brookfield     i dont pity anybody who leaves the world not even a fair young girl    in her prime i pity those remaining  on her journey if it pleases    god to send her depend on it theres no cause for grief thats but    an earthly condition  out of our stormy life and brought nearer the    divine light and warmth there must be a serene climate  cant you    fancy sailing into the calm  ah nowhere else shall we find the golden bride passionless bride divine tranquillity  as human nature persistently demands a moral and as to say truth thackeray was constantly meeting the demand what is the lesson of his life and his writings  so people may ask and yet how futile is the answer  life has a different meaning a different riddle a different reply for each of us  there is not one sphinx but many sphinxesas many as there are women and men  we must all answer for ourselves pascal has one answer believe  moliere has another observe thackerays answer is be good and enjoy but a melancholy enjoyment was his  dr john brown says  his persistent state especially for the later half of his life was profoundly morne there is no other word for it  this arose in part from temperament from a quick sense of the littleness and wretchedness of mankind    this feeling acting on a harsh and savage nature ended in the saeva indignatio of swift acting on the kindly and sensitive nature of mr thackeray it led only to compassionate sadness  a great part of his life and most of his happiness lay in love  ich habe auch viel geliebt he says and it is a hazardous kind of happiness that attends great affection  your capital is always at the mercy of failures of death of jealousy of estrangement  but he had so much love to give that he could not but trust those perilous investments  other troubles he had that may have been diversions from those  he did not always keep that manly common sense in regard to criticism which he shows in a letter to mrs brookfield  did you read the spectators sarcastic notice of vanity fair  i dont think it is just but think kintoul rintoul is a very honest man and rather inclined to deal severely with his private friends lest he should fall into the other extreme to be sure he keeps out of it i mean the other extreme very well  that is the way to take unfavourable criticismsnot to go declaring that a man is your enemy because he does not like your book your ballads your idyls your sermons what you please  why cannot people keep literature and liking apart  am i bound to think jones a bad citizen a bad man a bad householder because his poetry leaves me cold  need he regard me as a malevolent greeneyed monster because i dont want to read him  thackeray was not always true in his later years to these excellent principles  he was troubled about trifles of criticisms and gossip bagatelles not worth noticing still less worth remembering and recording  do not let us record them then  we cannot expect for thackeray we cannot even desire for him a popularity like that of dickens  if ever any man wrote for the people it was dickens  where can we find such a benefactor and who has lightened so many lives with such merriment as he  but thackeray wrote like the mass of authors for the literary classfor all who have the sense of style the delight in the best language  he will endure while english literature endures while english civilisation lasts  we cannot expect all the world to share our affection for this humourist whose mirth springs from his melancholy  his religion his education his life in this unsatisfying world are not the life the education the religion of the great majority of human kind  he cannot reach so many ears and hearts as shakespeare or dickens and some of those whom he reaches will always and inevitably misjudge him  mais cest mon homme one may say as la fontaine said of moliere  of modern writers putting scott aside he is to me the most friendly and sympathetic  great genius as he was he was also a penman a journalist and journalists and penmen will always look to him as their big brother the man in their own line of whom they are proudest  as devout catholics did not always worship the greatest saints but the friendliest saints their own so we scribes burn our cheap incense to st william makepeace  he could do all that any of us could do and he did it infinitely better  a piece of verse for punch a paragraph a caricature were not beneath the dignity of the author of esmond  he had the kindness and helpfulness which i for one have never met a journalist who lacked  he was a good englishman the boy within him never died he loved children and boys and a little slang and a boxing match  if he had failings who knew them better than he  how often he is at once the boy at the swishing block and dr birch who does not spare the rod  let us believe with that beloved physician our old friend dr john brown that mr thackeray was much greater much nobler than his works great and noble as they are  let us part with him remembering his own words     come wealth or want come good or ill       let young and old accept their part    and bow before the awful will       and bear it with an honest heart     dickens   i cannot read dickens  how many people make this confession with a front of brass and do not seem to know how poor a figure they cut george eliot says that a difference of taste in jokes is a great cause of domestic discomfort  a difference of taste in books when it is decided and vigorous breaks many a possible friendship and nips many a young liking in the bud  i would not willingly seem intolerant  a man may not like sophocles may speak disrespectfully of virgil and even sneer at herodotus and yet may be endured  but he or she it is usually she who contemns scott and cannot read dickens is a person with whom i would fain have no further converse  if she be a lady and if one meets her at dinner she must of course be borne with and suffered gladly  but she has dug a gulf that nothing can bridge she may be fair clever and popular but she is anathema  i feel towards her or him if he wears a beard as bucklaw did towards the person who should make inquiries about that bridal night of lammermoor  but this admission does not mean that one is sealed of the tribe of charlesthat one is a dickensite pure and simple convinced and devoutany more than mr matthew arnold was a wordsworthian  dickens has many such worshippers especially and this is an argument in favour of the faith among those who knew him in his life  he must have had a wonderful charm for his friends in life are his literary partisans his uncompromising partisans even to this day  they will have no halfhearted admiration and scout him who tries to speak of dickens as of an artist not flawless no less than they scorn him who cannot read dickens at all  at one time this honourable enthusiasm as among the wordsworthians took the shape of endless imitation  that is over only here and there is an imitator of the master left in the land  all his own genius was needed to carry his mannerisms the mannerisms without the genius were an armour that no devoted david had proved that none could wear with success  of all great writers since scott dickens is probably the man to whom the world owes most gratitude  no other has caused so many sad hearts to be lifted up in laughter no other has added so much mirth to the toilsome and perplexed life of men of poor and rich of learned and unlearned  a vast hope has passed across the world says alfred de musset we may say that with dickens a happy smile a joyous laugh went round this earth to have made us laugh so frequently so inextinguishably so kindlythat is his great good deed  it will be said and with a great deal of truth that he has purged us with pity and terror as well as with laughter  but it is becoming plain that his command of tears is less assured than of old and i cannot honestly regret that some of his pathosnot all by any meansis losing its charm and its certainty of appeal  dickenss humour was rarely too obvious it was essentially personal original quaint unexpected and his own  his pathos was not infrequently derived from sources open to all the world and capable of being drawn from by very commonplace writers  little nells and dombeys children unhappy overthrown early in the melee of the world and dying among weeping readers no longer affect us as they affected another generation  mrs beecher stowe and the author of misunderstood once made some people weep like anything by these simple means  ouida can do it plenty of people can do it  dickens lives by virtue of what none but he can do by virtue of sairey gamp and sam weller and dick swiveller and mr squeers with a thousand other old friends of whom we can never weary no more than cleopatras can custom stale their infinite variety  i do not say that dickens pathos is always of the too facile sort which plays round childrens deathbeds  other pathos he has more fine and not less genuine  it may be morbid and contemptible to feel a great inclination to cry over david copperfields boyish infatuation for steerforth but i feel it  steerforth was a tigeras major pendennis would have said a tiger with his curly hair and his ambrosial whiskers but when a little boy loses his heart to a big boy he does not think of this  traddles thought of it  shame j steerforth cried traddles when steerforth bullied the usher  traddles had not lost his heart nor set up the big boy as a god in the shrine thereof  but boys do these things most of us have had our steerforthstall strong handsome brave goodhumoured  far off across the years i see the face of such an one and remember that emotion which is described in david copperfield chap xix towards the end of the chapter  i dont know any other novelist who has touched this young and absolutely disinterested belief of a little boy in a big onetouched it so kindly and seriously that is there is a hint of it in dr birchs school days  but dickens is always excellent in his boys of whom he has drawn dozens of typesall capital  there is tommy traddles for example  and how can people say that dickens could not draw a gentleman  the boy who shouted shame j steerforth was a gentleman if one may pretend to have an opinion about a theme so difficult  the dodger and charley bates are delightful boysespecially bates  pip in the good old days when he was the prowling boy and fought herbert pocket was not less attractive and herbert himself with his theory and practice of the art of selfdefencecould nelson have been more brave or shelley as in mr matthew arnolds opinion more ineffectual  even the boys at dotheboys hall are each of them quite distinct  dickenss boys are almost as dear to me as thackeraysas little rawdon himself  there is one exception i cannot interest myself in little dombey  little david copperfield is a jewel of a boy with a turn for books  doubtless he is created out of dickenss memories of himself as a child  that is true pathos again and not overwrought when david is sent to creakles and his poor troubled mother dare hardly say farewell to him  and this brings us back to that debatable thingthe pathos of dickensfrom which one has been withdrawn by the attractions of his boys  little dombey is a prize example of his pathos  little nell is another  jeffrey of the edinburgh review who criticised marmion and the lady of the lake so vindictively shed tears over little nell it is a matter of taste or as science might say of the lachrymal glands as developed in each individual  but the lachrymal glands of this amateur are not developed in that direction  little dombey and little nell leave me with a pair of dry eyes  i do not melt visibly over little dombey like the weakeyed young man who took out his books and trunk to the coach  the poor little chap was feeble and feverish and had dreams of trying to stop a river with his childish hands or to choke it with sand  it may be very good pathology but i cannot see that it is at all right pathos  one does not like copy to be made out of the sufferings of children or of animals  ones heart hardens the object is too manifest the trick is too easy  conceive a child of dombeys age remarking with his latest breath tell them that the picture on the stairs at school is not divine enough  that is not the delirium of infancy that is artcriticism it is the athenaeum on mr holman hunt it is not true to nature it is not good in art it is the kind of thing that appears in sundayschool books about the virtuous little boy who died  there is more true pathos in many a page of huckleberry finn yet this is what jeffrey gushed over  there has been nothing like the actual dying of that sweet paul  so much can age enfeeble the intellect that he who had known scott and yet nibbled at his fame descended to admiring the feeblest of false sentiment  as for little nell who also has caused floods of tears to be shed her case is sufficiently illustrated by the picture in the first edition master humphreys clock 1840 p 210              when i die    put near me something that has loved the light    and had the sky above it always  those    were her words     dear gentle patient noble nell was dead  the pathos is about as good as the prose and that is blank verse  are the words in the former quotation in the least like anything that a little girl would say  a german sentimentalist might have said them obermann might have murmured them in his weaker moments  let us try a piece of domestic pathos by another hand  it is the dawn of waterloo  heartstained and shamestricken he stood at the beds foot and looked at the sleeping girl  how dared hewho was heto pray for one so spotless  god bless her  god bless her  he came to the bedside and looked at the hand the little soft hand lying asleep and he bent over the pillow noiselessly towards the gentle pale face  two fair arms closed tenderly round his neck as he stooped down  i am awake george the poor child said with a sob  i know i am making enemies of a large proportion of the readers of this page  odious sneering beast is the quotation which they will apply perhaps unconscious of its origin to a critic who is humble but would fain be honest to a critic who thinks that dickens has his weak places and that his pathos is one of these  it cannot be helped  each of us has his author who is a favourite a friend an idol whose immaculate perfection he maintains against all comers  for example things are urged against scott i receive them in the attitude of the deaf adder of st augustine who stops one ear with his tail and presses the other against the dust  the same with moliere m scherer utters complaints against moliere  he would not convince me even if i were convinced  so with regard to dickens the true believer will not listen he will not be persuaded  but if any one feels a little shaken let him try it another way  there is a character in m alphonse daudets froment jeune et rissler ainea character who people say is taken bodily from dickens this is desiree delobelle the deformed girl the daughter of un rate a pretentious imbecile actor  she is poor stunted laborious toiling at a small industry she is in love is rejected she tries to drown herself she dies  the sequence of ideas is in dickenss vein but read the tale and i think you will see how little the thing is overdone how simple and unforced it is compared with analogous persons and scenes in the work of the english master  the idiotic yell of plagiarism has been raised of course by critical cretins  m daudet as i understand what he says in trente ans de paris had not read dickens at all when he wrote froment jeunecertainly had not read our mutual friend  but there is something of dickenss genius in m daudets and that something is kept much better in hand by the frenchman is more subordinated to the principles of taste and of truth  on the other hand to be done with this point look at delobelle the father of desiree and compare him with dickenss splendid strollers with mr vincent crummles and mr lenville and the rest  as in desiree so in delobelle m daudets picture is much the more truthful  but it is truthful with a bitter kind of truth  now there is nothing not genial and delightful in crummles and mrs crummles and the infant phenomenon  here dickens has got into a region unlike the region of the pathetic into a world that welcomes charge or caricature the world of humour  we do not know we never meet crummleses quite so unsophisticated as vincent who is not a prussian who cant think who puts these things into the papers  but we do meet stage people who come very near to this naivete of selfadvertisement and some of whom are just as dismal as crummles is delightful  here no doubt is dickenss forte  here his genius is all pure gold in his successful studies or inventions of the humorous of character parts  one literally does not know where to begin or end in ones admiration for this creative power that peopled our fancies with such troops of dear and impossible friends  pickwick comes practically first and he never surpassed pickwick  he was a poor storyteller and in pickwick he had no story to tell he merely wandered at adventure in that merrier england which was before railways were pickwick is the last of the stories of the road that begin in the wandering aimless adventurous romances of greece or in petronius arbiter and that live with the life of gil blas and don quixote of le roman comique of tom jones and joseph andrews  these tales are progresses along highways bristling with adventure and among inns full of confusion mr pickwicks affair with the lady with yellow curlpapers being a mild example  though tom jones has a plot so excellent no plot is needed here and no consecutive story is required  detached experiences vagrants of every rank that come and go as in real life are all the material of the artist  with such materials dickens was exactly suited he was at home on highroad and lane street and field path in inns and yeomens warm hospitable houses  never a humour escaped him and he had such a wealth of fun and high spirits in these glad days as never any other possessed before  he was not in the least a bookish man not in any degree a scholar but nature taught him and while he wrote with nature for his teacher with men and women for his matter with diversion for his aim he was unsurpassablenay he was unapproachable  he could not rest here he was after all a child of an age that grew sad and earnest and thoughtful  he saw abuses round himinjustice and oppression and cruelty  he had a heart to which those things were not only abhorrent but as it were maddening  he knew how great an influence he wielded and who can blame him for using it in any cause he thought good  very possibly he might have been a greater artist if he had been less of a man if he had been quite disinterested and had never written with a purpose  that is common and even rather obsolete critical talk  but when we remember that fielding too very often wrote with a purpose and that purpose the protection of the poor and unfriended and when we remember what an artist fielding was i do not see how we can blame dickens  occasionally he made his art and his purpose blend so happily that his work was all the better for his benevolent intentions  we owe mr squeers mrs squeers fanny squeers wackford and all to dickenss indignation against the nefarious school pirates of his time  if he is less successful in attacking the court of chancery and very much less successful still with the red tape and circumlocution office affairs that may be merely because he was less in the humour and not because he had a purpose in his mind  every one of a mans books cannot be his masterpiece  there is nothing in literary talk so annoying as the spiteful joy with which many people declare that an author is worked out because his last book is less happy than some that went before  there came a time in dickens career when his works to my own taste and that of many people seemed laboured artificialin fact more or less failures  these books range from dombey and son through little dorrit i dare not say to our mutual friend  one is afraid that edwin drood too suggests the malady which sir walter already detected in his own peveril of the peak  the intense strain on the faculties of dickensas author editor reader and man of the worldcould not but tell on him and years must tell  philip is not worthy of the author of esmond nor daniel deronda of the author of silas marner  at that timethe time of the dorrits and dombeysblackwoods magazine published a remonstrance with boz nor was it quite superfluous  but dickens had abundance of talent still to displayabove all in great expectations and a tale of two cities the former is after pickwick copperfield martin chuzzlewit and nicholas nicklebyafter the classics in factthe most delightful of dickenss books  the story is embroiled no doubt  what are we to think of estelle  has the minx any purpose  is she a kind of ethel newcome of odd life  it is not easy to say still for a story of dickenss the plot is comparatively clear and intelligible  for a study of a childs life of the nature dickens drew bestthe river and the marshesand for plenty of honest explosive fun there is no later book of dickenss like great expectations  miss havisham too in her mouldy bridal splendour is really impressive not like ralph nickleby and monk in oliver twista book of which the plot remains to me a mystery 128 pip and pumblechook and mr wopsle and jo are all immortal and cause laughter inextinguishable  the rarity of this book by the way in its first editionthe usual library three volumesis rather difficult to explain  one very seldom sees it come into the market and then it is highly priced  i have mentioned more than once the obscurity of dickenss plots  this difficulty may be accounted for in a very flattering manner  where do we lose ourselves  not in the bare highroad but among lanes between hedges hung with roses blackberries morning glories where all about us is so full of pleasure that our attention is distracted and we miss our way  now in dickensin oliver twist in martin chuzzlewit in nicholas nicklebythere is as in the lanes so much to divert and beguile that we cease to care very much where the road leadsa road so full of happy marvels  the dark plotting villainslike the tramp who frightened sir walter scott so terribly as he came from miss baillies at hampsteadpeer out from behind the hedges now and then  but we are too much amused by the light hearts that go all the way by the dodger and crummles and mrs gamp to care much for what ralph and monk and jonas chuzzlewit are plotting  it may not be that the plot is so confused but that we are too much diverted to care for the plot for the incredible machinations of uriah heap to choose another example  mr micawber cleared these up but it is mr micawber that hinders us from heeding them  this at least is a not unfriendly explanation  yet i cannot but believe that though dickens took great pains with his plots he was not a great plotter  he was not any more than thackeray a storyteller first and foremost  we can hold in our minds every thread of mr wilkie collins web or of m fortune du boisgobeys or of m gaboriausall great weavers of intrigues  but dickens goes about darkening his intrigue giving it an extra knot an extra twist hinting here ominously laughing there till we get mystified and bored and give ourselves up to the fun of the humours indifferent to the destinies of villains and victims  look at edwin drood  a constant war about the plot rages in the magazines  i believe for one that edwin drood was resuscitated but it gives me no pleasure  he was too uninteresting dickenss hints nods mutterings forebodings do not at all impress one like that deepening and darkening of the awful omens in the bride of lammermoor  here scottunconsciously no doubtused the very manner of homer in the odyssey and nowhere was his genius more homeric  that was romance  the tale of two cities is a great test of the faiththat is in dickensites  of all his works it is the favourite with the wrong sort ladies prefer it  many people can read it who cannot otherwise read dickens at all  this in itself proves that it is not a good example of dickens that it is not central that it is an outlying province which he conquered  it is not a favourite of mine  the humour of the humorous characters rings falsefor example the fun of the resurrectionman with the wife who flops  but sidney carton has drawn many tears down cheeks not accustomed to what mr b in pamela calls pearly fugitives  it sometimes strikes one that certain weaknesses in our great novelists in thackeray as well as dickens were caused by their method of publication  the green and yellow leaves flourished on the trees for two whole years  who except alexandre the great could write so much and yet all good  do we not all feel that david copperfield should have been compressed  as to pendennis mr thackerays bad health when he wrote it might well cause a certain languor in the later pages  moreover he frankly did not care for the story and bluffly says in the preface that he respited colonel altamont almost at the foot of the gallows dickens took himself more in earnest and having so many pages to fill conscientiously made uriah heap wind and wriggle through them all  to try to see blots in the sun and to pick holes in dickens seems ungrateful and is indeed an ungrateful task to no mortal man have more people owed mirth pleasure forgetfulness of care knowledge of life in strange places  there never was such another as charles dickens nor shall we see his like sooner than the like of shakespeare  and he owed all to native genius and hard work he owed almost nothing to literature and that little we regret  he was influenced by carlyle he adopted his method of nicknames and of hammering with wearisome iteration on some peculiarityfor example on carkers teeth and the patriarchs white hair  by the way how incredible is all the carker episode in dombey surely dickens can never have intended edith from the first to behave as she did  people may have influenced him as they influenced scott about st ronans well  it has been said that save for carlyle dickens was in letters a selftaught artist that he was no mans pupil and borrowed from none  no doubt this makes him less acceptable to the literary class than a man of letters like thackeraythan a man in whose treasure chamber of memory all the wealth of the middle ages was stored like scott  but the native naked genius of dickenshis heart his mirth his observation his delightful high spirits his intrepid loathing of wrong his chivalrous desire to right itthese things will make him for ever we hope and believe the darling of the english people     adventures of buccaneers   most of us as boys have envied the buccaneers  the greatest of all boys canon kingsley once wrote a pleasing and regretful poem in which the last buccaneer represents himself as a kind of picturesque philanthropist     there were forty craft in aves that were both swift and stout    all furnished well with small arms and cannons round about    and a thousand men in aves made laws so fair and free    to choose their valiant captains and obey them loyally    thence we sailed against the spaniard with his hoards of plate and    gold    which he wrung with cruel tortures from indian folk of old    likewise the merchant captains with hearts as hard as stone    who flog men and keelhaul them and starve them to the bone  the buccaneer is a gallant sailor according to kingsleys poema robin hood of the waters who preys only on the wicked rich or the cruel and popish spaniard and the extortionate shipowner  for his own part when he is not rescuing poor indians the buccaneer lives mainly for climate and the affections     oh sweet it was in aves to hear the landward breeze    a swing with good tobacco in a net between the trees    with a negro lass to fan you while you listened to the roar    of the breakers on the reef outside that never touched the shore  this is delightfully idyllic like the lives of the tahitian shepherds in the antijacobinthe shepherds whose occupation was a sinecure as there were no sheep in tahiti  yet the vocation was not really so touchingly chivalrous as the poet would have us deem  one joseph esquemeling himself a buccaneer has written the history and described the exploits of his companions in plain prose warning eager youths that piecesofeight do not grow on every tree as many raw recruits have believed  mr esquemelings account of these matters may be purchased with a great deal else that is instructive and entertaining in the history of the buccaneers in america  my edition of 1810 is a dumpy little book in very small type and quite a crowd of publishers took part in the venture  the older editions are difficult to procure if your pockets are not stuffed with piecesofeight  you do not often find even this volume but when found make a note of and you have a reply to canon kingsley  a charitable old scotch lady who heard our ghostly foe evil spoken of remarked that if we were all as diligent and conscientious as the devil it would be better for us  now the buccaneers were certainly models of diligence and conscientiousness in their own industry which was to torture people till they gave up their goods and then to run them through the body and spend the spoils over drink and dice  except dampier who was a clever man but a poor buccaneer mr clark russell has written his life they were the most hideously ruthless miscreants that ever disgraced the earth and the sea  but their courage and endurance were no less notable than their greed and cruelty so that a moral can be squeezed even out of these abandoned miscreants  the soldiers and sailors who made their way within gunshot of khartoum overcoming thirst hunger heat the desert and the gallant children of the desert did not fight march and suffer more bravely than the scoundrels who sacked mairaibo and burned panama  their good qualities were no less astounding and exemplary than their almost incredible wickedness  they did not lie about in hammocks much listening to the landward wind among the woodsthe true buccaneers  to tell the truth most of them had no particular cause to love the human species  they were often europeans who had been sold into slavery on the west indian plantations where they learned lessons of cruelty by suffering it  thus mr joseph esquemeling our historian was beaten tortured and nearly starved to death in tortuga so i determined not knowing how to get any living to enter into the order of the pirates or robbers of the sea the poor indians of the isles much pitied by kingsleys buccaneer had a habit of sticking their prisoners all over with thorns wrapped in oily cotton whereto they then set fire  these cruelties many christians have seen while they lived among these barbarians  mr esquemeling was to see and inflict plenty of this kind of torment which was not out of the way nor unusual  one planter alone had killed over a hundred of his servantsthe english did the same with theirs  a buccaneer voyage began in stealing a ship collecting desperadoes and torturing the local herdsmen till they gave up their masters flocks which were salted as provisions  articles of service were then drawn up on the principle no prey no pay  the spoils when taken were loyally divided as a rule though captain morgan of wales made no more scruple about robbing his crew than about barbecuing a spanish priest  they are very civil and charitable to each other so that if any one wants what another has with great willingness they give it to one another  in other matters they did not in the least resemble the early christians  a fellow nicknamed the portuguese may be taken as our first example of their commendable qualities  with a small ship of four guns he had taken a great one of twenty guns with 70000 piecesofeight    he himself however was presently captured by a larger vessel and imprisoned on board  being carelessly watched he escaped on two earthen jars for he could not swim reached the woods in campechy and walked for a hundred and twenty miles through the bush  his only food was a few shellfish and by way of a knife he had a large nail which he whetted to an edge on a stone  having made a kind of raft he struck a river and paddled to golpho triste where he found congenial pirates  with twenty of these and a boat he returned to campechy where he had been a prisoner and actually captured the large ship in which he had lain captive  bad luck pursued him however his prize was lost in a storm he reached jamaica in a canoe and never afterwards was concerned as leader in any affair of distinction  not even odysseus had more resource nor was more longenduring but fortune was the portugueses foe  braziliano another buccaneer served as a pirate before the mast and was beloved and respected by all  being raised to command he took a plate ship but this success was of indifferent service to his otherwise amiable character  he would often appear foolish and brutish when in drink and has been known to roast spaniards alive on wooden spits for not showing him hog yards where he might steal swine  one can hardly suppose that kingsley would have regretted this buccaneer even if he had been the last which unluckily he was not  his habit of sitting in the street beside a barrel of beer and shooting all passersby who would not drink with him provoked remark and was an act detestable to all friends of temperance principles  francois lolonnois from southern france had been kidnapped and sold as a slave in the caribbee islands  recovering his freedom he plundered the spanish says my buccaneer author till his unfortunate death  with two canoes he captured a ship which had been sent after him carrying ten guns and a hangman for his express benefit  this hangman much to the fellows chagrin lolonnois put to death like the rest of his prisoners his great achievements were in the gulf of venezuela or bay of maracaibo the gulf is a strong place the mouth no wider than a gunshot is guarded by two islands  far up the inlet is maracaibo a town of three thousand people fortified and surrounded by woods  yet farther up is the town of gibraltar  to attack these was a desperate enterprise but lolonnois stole past the forts and frightened the townsfolk into the woods  as a rule the spaniards made the poorest resistance there were examples of courage but none of conduct  with strong forts heavy guns many men provisions and ammunition they quailed before the desperate valour of the pirates  the towns were sacked the fugitives hunted out in the woods and the most abominable tortures were applied to make them betray their friends and reveal their treasures  when they were silent or had no treasures to declare they were hacked twisted burned and starved to death  such were the manners of lolonnois and captain morgan of wales was even more ruthless  gibraltar was well fortified and strengthened after maracaibo fell new batteries were raised the way through the woods was barricaded and no fewer than eight hundred men were under arms to resist a small pirate force exhausted by debauch and having its retreat cut off by the forts at the mouth of the great saltwater loch  but lolonnois did not blench he told the men that audacity was their one hope also that he would pistol the first who gave ground  the men cheered enthusiastically and a party of three hundred and fifty landed  the barricaded way they could not force and in a newly cut path they met a strong battery which fired grape  but lolonnois was invincible  he tried that old trick which rarely fails a sham retreat and this lured the spaniards from their earthwork on the path  the pirates then turned sword in hand slew two hundred of the enemy and captured eight guns the town yielded the people fled to the woods and then began the wonted sport of torturing the prisoners  maracaibo they ransomed afresh obtained a pilot passed the forts with ease and returned after sacking a small province  on a dividend being declared they parted 260000 piecesofeight among the band and spent the pillage in a revel of three weeks  lolonnois got great repute by this conduct but i rejoice to add that in a raid on nicaragua he miserably perished and met what mr esquemeling calls his unfortunate death  for lolonnois was really an ungentlemanly character  he would hack a spaniard to pieces tear out his heart and gnaw it with his teeth like a ravenous wolf saying to the rest i will serve you all alike if you show me not another way to a town which he designed attacking  in nicaragua he was taken by the indians who being entirely on the spanish side tore him to pieces and burned him  thus we really must not be deluded by the professions of mr kingsleys sentimental buccaneer with his pity for the indian folk of old  except denis scott a worthy bandit in his day captain henry morgan is the first renowned british buccaneer  he was a young welshman who after having been sold as a slave in barbadoes became a sailor of fortune  with about four hundred men he assailed puerto bello  if our number is small he said our hearts are great and so he assailed the third city and place of arms which spain then possessed in the west indies  the entrance of the harbour was protected by two strong castles judged as almost impregnable while morgan had no artillery of any avail against fortresses  morgan had the luck to capture a spanish soldier whom he compelled to parley with the garrison of the castle this he stormed and blew up massacring all its defenders while with its guns he disarmed the sister fortress  when all but defeated in a new assault the sight of the english colours animated him afresh  he made the captive monks and nuns carry the scaling ladders in this unwonted exploit the poor religious folk lost many of their numbers  the wall was mounted the soldiers were defeated though the governor fought like a spaniard of the old school slew many pirates with his own hand and pistolled some of his own men for cowardice  he died at his post refusing quarter and falling like a gentleman of spain  morgan too was not wanting in fortitude he extorted 100000 piecesofeight from the governor of panama and sent him a pistol as a sample of the gun wherewith he took so great a city  he added that he would return and take this pistol out of panama nor was he less good than his word  in cuba he divided 250000 piecesofeight and a great booty in other treasure  a few weeks saw it all in the hands of the tavernkeepers and women of the place  morgans next performance was a new sack of maracaibo now much stronger than lolonnois had found it  after the most appalling cruelties not fit to be told he returned passing the castles at the mouth of the port by an ingenious stratagem  running boatload after boatload of men to the land side he brought them back by stealth leading the garrison to expect an attack from that quarter  the guns were massed to landward and no sooner was this done than morgan sailed up through the channel with but little loss  why the spaniards did not close the passage with a boom does not appear  probably they were glad to be quit of morgan on any terms  a great spanish fleet he routed by the ingenious employment of a fire ship  in a later expedition a strong place was taken by a curious accident  one of the buccaneers was shot through the body with an arrow he drew it out wrapped it in cotton fired it from his musket and so set light to a roof and burned the town  his raid on panama was extraordinary for the endurance of his men  for days they lived on the leather of bottles and belts  some who were never out of their mothers kitchens may ask how these pirates could eat and digest these pieces of leather so hard and dry  whom i answerthat could they once experience what hunger or rather famine is they would find the way as the pirates did  it was at the close of this march that the indians drove wild bulls among them but they cared very little for these new allies of the spaniards beef in any form was only too welcome  morgan burned the fair cedar houses of panama but lost the plate ship with all the gold and silver out of the churches  how he tortured a poor wretch who chanced to wear a pair of taffety trousers belonging to his master with a small silver key hanging out it is better not to repeat the men only got two hundred piecesofeight each after all their toil for their welshman was indeed a thief and bilked his crews no less than he plundered the spaniards without remorse  finally he sneaked away from the fleet with a ship or two and it is to be feared that captain morgan made rather a good thing by dint of his incredible cruelty and villainy  and so we leave mr esquemeling whom captain morgan also deserted for who would linger long when there is not even honour among thieves alluring as the pirates profession is we must not forget that it had a seamy side and was by no means all rum and piecesofeight  and there is something repulsive to a generous nature in roasting men because they will not show you where to steal hogs     the sagas   the general reader says a frank critic hates the very name of a saga  the general reader in that case is to be pitied and if possible converted  but just as pascal admits that the sceptic can only become religious by living as if he were religiousby stupefying himself as pascal plainly puts it with holy waterso it is to be feared that there is but a single way of winning over the general reader to the sagas  preaching and example as in this brief essay will not avail with him  he must take pascals advice and live for an hour or two as if he were a lover of sagas  he must in brief give that old literature a fair chance  he has now his opportunity mr william morris and mr eirikr magnusson are publishing a series of cheap translationscheap only in coin of the realma saga library  if a general reader tries the first tale in the first volume story of howard the haltif he tries it honestly and still can make no way with it then let him take comfort in the doctrine of invincible ignorance  let him go back to his favourite literature of gossiping reminiscence or of realistic novels  we have all probably a drop of the northmens blood in us but in that general reader the blood is dormant  what is a saga  it is neither quite a piece of history nor wholly a romance  it is a very old story of things and adventures that really happened but happened so long ago and in times so superstitious that marvels and miracles found their way into the legend  the best sagas are those of iceland and those in translations are the finest reading that the natural man can desire  if you want true pictures of life and character which are always the same at bottom or true pictures of manners which are always changing and of strange customs and lost beliefs in the sagas they are to be found  or if you like tales of enterprise of fighting by land and sea fighting with men and beasts with storms and ghosts and fiends the sagas are full of this entertainment  the stories of which we are speaking were first told in iceland perhaps from 950 to 1100 bc  when norway and sweden were still heathen a thousand years ago they were possessed by families of noble birth owning no master and often at war with each other when the men were not sailing the seas to rob and kill in scotland england france italy and away east as far as constantinople or farther  though they were wild sea robbers and warriors they were sturdy farmers great shipbuilders every man of them however wealthy could be his own carpenter smith shipwright and ploughman  they forged their own good short swords hammered their own armour ploughed their own fields  in short they lived like odysseus the hero of homer and were equally skilled in the arts of war and peace  they were mighty lawyers too and had a most curious and minute system of laws on all subjectsland marriage murder trade and so forth  these laws were not written though the people had a kind of letters called runes  but they did not use them much for documents but merely for carving a name on a sword blade or a tombstone or on great gold rings such as they wore on their arms  thus the laws existed in the memory and judgment of the oldest and wisest and most righteous men of the country  the most important was the law of murder  if one man slew another he was not tried by a jury but any relation of the dead killed him at sight wherever he found him even in an earls hall kari struck the head off one of his friend njals burners and the head bounded on the board among the trenchers of meat and the cups of mead or ale  but it was possible if the relations of a slain man consented for the slayer to pay his priceevery man was valued at so muchand then revenge was not taken  but as a rule one revenge called for another  say hrut slew hrap then atli slew hrut and gisli slew atli and kari slew gisli and so on till perhaps two whole families were extinct and there was peace  the gods were not offended by manslaughter openly done but were angry with treachery cowardice meanness theft perjury and every kind of shabbiness  this was the state of affairs in norway when a king arose harold fair hair who tried to bring all these proud people under him and to make them pay taxes and live more regularly and quietly  they revolted at this and when they were too weak to defy the king they set sail and fled to iceland  there in the lonely north between the snow and fire the hotwater springs the volcano of hecla the great rivers full of salmon that rush down such falls as golden foot there they lived their oldfashioned life cruising as pirates and merchants taking foreign service at mickle garth or in england or egypt filling the world with the sound of their swords and the sky with the smoke of their burnings for they feared neither god nor man nor ghost and were no less cruel than brave the best of soldiers laughing at death and torture like the zulus who are a kind of black vikings of africa  on some of them bersarks gang would fallthat is they would become in a way mad slaying all and sundry biting their shields and possessed with a furious strength beyond that of men which left them as weak as children when it passed away  these bersarks were outlaws all mens enemies and to kill them was reckoned a great adventure and a good deed  the women were worthy of the menbold quarrelsome revengeful  some were loyal like bergthora who foresaw how all her sons and her husband were to be burned but who would not leave them and perished in the burning without a cry  some were as brave as howards wife who enabled her husband old and childless to overthrow the wealthy bully the slayer of his only son  some were treacherous as halgerda the fair  three husbands she had and was the death of every man of them  her last lord was gunnar of lithend the bravest and most peaceful of men  once she did a mean thing and he slapped her face  she never forgave him  at last enemies besieged him in his house  the doors were lockedall was quiet within one of the enemies climbed up to a window slit and gunnar thrust him through with his lance  is gunnar at home said the besiegers  i know notbut his lance is said the wounded man and died with that last jest on his lips  for long gunnar kept them at bay with his arrows but at last one of them cut the arrow string  twist me a string with thy hair he said to his wife halgerda whose yellow hair was very long and beautiful  is it a matter of thy life or death she asked ay he said  then i remember that blow thou gavest me and i will see thy death  so gunnar died overcome by numbers and they killed samr his hound but not before samr had killed a man  so they lived always with sword or axe in handso they lived and fought and died  then christianity was brought to them from norway by thangbrand and if any man said he did not believe a word of it thangbrand had the schoolboy argument will you fight  so they fought a duel on a holm or island that nobody might interfereholmgang they called itand thangbrand usually killed his man  in norway saint olaf did the like killing and torturing those who held by the old godsthor odin and freya and the rest  so partly by force and partly because they were somewhat tired of bloodshed horsefights and the rest they received the word of the white christ and were baptised and lived by written law and did not avenge themselves by their own hands  they were christians now but they did not forget the old times the old feuds and fightings and bersarks and dealings with ghosts and with dead bodies that arose and wrought horrible things haunting houses and strangling men  the icelandic ghosts were ablebodied well materialised and grettir and olaf howards son fought them with strength of arm and edge of steel  true stories of the ancient days were told at the fireside in the endless winter nights by story tellers or scalds  it was thought a sin for any one to alter these old stories but as generations passed more and more wonderful matters came into the legend  it was believed that the dead gunnar the famed archer sang within his cairn or howe the mound wherein he was buried and his famous bill or cutting spear was said to have been made by magic and to sing in the night before the wounding of men and the waking of war people were thought to be secondsightedthat is to have prophetic vision  the night when njals house was burned his wife saw all the meat on the table one gore of blood just as in homer the prophet theoclymenus beheld blood falling in gouts from the walls before the slaying of the wooers  the valkyries the choosers of the slain and the norns who wove the fates of men at a ghastly loom were seen by living eyes  in the graves where treasures were hoarded the barrowwights dwelt ghosts that were sentinels over the gold witchwives changed themselves into wolves and other monstrous animals and for many weeks the heroes signy and sinfjotli ran wild in the guise of wolves  these and many other marvels crept into the sagas and made the listeners feel a shudder of cold beside the great fire that burned in the centre of the skali or hall where the chief sat giving meat and drink to all who came where the women span and the saga man told the tales of long ago finally at the end of the middle ages these sagas were written down in icelandic and in latin occasionally and many of them have been translated into english  unluckily these translations have hitherto been expensive to buy and were not always to be had easily  for the wise world which reads newspapers all day and half the night does not care much for books still less for good books least of all for old books  you can make no money out of reading sagas they have nothing to say about stocks and shares nor about prime ministers and politics  nor will they amuse a man if nothing amuses him but accounts of races and murders or gossip about mrs nokess new novel mrs stokess new dresses or lady joness diamonds  the sagas only tell how brave menof our own blood very likelylived and loved and fought and voyaged and died before there was much reading or writing when they sailed without steam travelled without railways and warred handtohand not with hidden dynamite and sunk torpedoes  but for stories of gallant life and honest purpose the sagas are among the best in the world  of sagas in english one of the best is the volsunga the story of the niflungs and volsungs  this book thanks to mr william morris can be bought for a shilling  it is a strange tale in which gods have their parts the tale of that oldest treasure hunt the hunt for the gold of the dwarf andvari  this was guarded by the serpent fafnir who had once been a man and who was killed by the hero sigurd  but andvari had cursed the gold because his enemies robbed him of it to the very last ring and had no pity  then the brave sigurd was involved in the evil luck  he it was who rode through the fire and woke the fair enchanted brynhild the shieldmaiden  and she loved him and he her with all their hearts always to the death  but by ill fate she was married to another man sigurds chief friend and sigurd to another woman  and the women fell to jealousy and quarrelling as women will and they dragged the friends into the feud and one manslaying after another befell till that great murder of men in the hall of atli the king  the curse came on one and all of thema curse of blood and of evil loves and of witchwork destroying good and bad all fearless and all fallen in one red ruin  the volsunga saga has this unique and unparalleled interest that it gives the spectacle of the highest epic genius struggling out of savagery into complete and free and conscious humanity  it is a mark of the savage intellect not to discriminate abruptly between man and the lower animals  in the tales of the lower peoples the characters are just as often beasts as men and women  now in the earlier and wilder parts of the volsunga saga otters and dragons play human parts  signy and his son and the mother of their enemy put on the skins of wolves become wolves and pass through hideous adventures  the story reeks with blood and ravins with lust of blood  but when sigurd arrives at full years of manhood the barbarism yields place the saga becomes human and conscious  these legends deal little with love  but in the volsunga saga the permanent interest is the true and deathless love of sigurd and brynhild their separation by magic arts the revival of their passion too late the mans resigned and heroic acquiescence the fiercer passion of the woman who will neither bear her fate nor accept her bliss at the price of honour and her plighted word  the situation the nodus is neither ancient merely nor modern merely but of all time  sigurd having at last discovered the net in which he was trapped was content to make the best of marriage and of friendship brynhild was not  the hearts of women are the hearts of wolves says the ancient sanskrit commentary on the rig veda  but the shewolfs heart broke like a womans when she had caused sigurds slaying  both man and woman face life as they conceive it with eyes perfectly clear  the magic and the supernatural wiles are accidental the human heart is essential and eternal  there is no scene like this in the epics of greece  this is a passion that homer did not dwell upon  in the iliad and odyssey the repentance of helen is facile she takes life easily clytemnestra is not brought on the stage to speak for herself  in this respect the epic of the north without the charm and the delightfulness of the southern epic excels it in this and in a certain bare veracity but in nothing else  we cannot put the germanic legend on the level of the greek for variety for manysided wisdom for changing beauty of a thousand colours  but in this one passion of love the volsunga saga excels the iliad  the greek and the northern stories are alike in one thing  fate is all powerful over gods and men  odin cannot save balder nor thetis achilles nor zeus sarpedon  but in the sagas fate is more constantly present to the mind  much is thought of being lucky or unlucky howards good luck is to be read in his face by the wise even when to the common gaze he seems a halfparalytic dotard dying of grief and age  fate and evil luck dog the heroes of the sagas  they seldom end well as people sayunless when a brave man lies down to die on the bed he has strewn of the bodies of his foes you call that ending well  so died grettir the strong  even from a boy he was strong and passionate short of temper quick of stroke but loyal brave and always unlucky his worst luck began after he slew glam  this glam was a wicked heathen herdsman who would not fast on christmas eve  so on the hills his dead body was found swollen as great as an ox and as blue as death  what killed him they did not know  but he haunted the farmhouse riding the roof kicking the sides with his heels killing cattle and destroying all things  then grettir came that way and he slept in the hall  at night the dead glam came in and grettir arose and to it they went struggling and dashing the furniture to bits  glam even dragged grettir to the door that he might slay him under the sky and for all his force grettir yielded ground  then on the very threshold he suddenly gave way when glam was pulling hardest and they fell glam undermost  then grettir drew the short sword karis loom that he had taken from a haunted grave and stabbed the dead thing that had lived again  but as glam lay adying in the second death the moon fell on his awful eyes and grettir saw the horror of them and from that hour he could not endure to be in the dark and he never dared to go alone  this was his death for he had an evil companion who betrayed him to his enemies but when they set on grettir though he was tired and sick of a wound many died with him  no man died like grettir the strong nor slew so many in his death  besides those sagas there is the best of all but the longest njala pronounced nyoula the story of burnt njal  that is too long to sketch here but it tells how through the hard hearts and jealousy of women ruin came at last on the gentle gunnar and the reckless skarphedin of the axe the ogress of war and how njal the wisest the most peaceful the most righteous of men was burned with all his house and how that evil deed was avenged on the burners of kari  the site of njals house is yet to be seen after these nine hundred years and the little glen where kari hid when he leaped through the smoke and the flame that made his swordblade blue  yes the very black sand that bergthora and her maids threw on the fire lies there yet and remnants of the whey they cast on the flames when water failed them they were still there beneath the earth when an english traveller dug up some of the ground last year and it is said that an american gentleman found a gold ring in the house of njal  the story of him and of his brave sons and of his slaves and of his kindred and of queens and kings of norway and of the coming of the white christ are all in the njala  that and the other sagas would bear being shortened for general readers once they were all that the people had by way of books and they liked them long  but shortened or not they are brave books for men for the world is a place of battle still and life is war  these old heroes knew it and did not shirk it but fought it out and left honourable names and a glory that widens year by year  for the story of njal and gunnar and skarphedin was told by captain speedy to the guards of theodore king of abyssinia  they liked it well and with queer altered names and changes of the tale that saga will be told in abyssinia and thence carried all through africa where white men have never wandered  so wide so longenduring a renown could be given by a nameless sagaman     charles kingsley   when i was very young a distinguished review was still younger  i remember reading one of the earliest numbers being then myself a boy of ten and coming on a review of a novel  never as it seemed to me or seems to my memory was a poor novel more heavily handled and yet i felt that the book must be a book to read on the very earliest opportunity  it was westward ho the most famous and perhaps the best novel of charles kingsley  often one has read it since and it is an example of those large rich wellfed romances at which you can cut and come again as it were laying it down and taking it up on occasion with the certainty of being excited amusedand preached at  lately i have reread westward ho and some of kingsleys other books hypatia hereward the wake and the poems over again  the old pleasure in them is not gone indeed but it is modified  one must be a boy to think kingsley a humourist  at the age of twelve or ten you take the comic passages which he conscientiously provides without being vexed or offended you take them merely in the way of business  better things are coming struggles with the inquisition storms at sea duels the armada wanderings in the lotus land of the tropical west and for the sake of all this a boy puts up goodnaturedly with kingsleys humour perhaps he even grins over amyas burying alternately his face in the pasty and the pasty in his face or he tries to feel diverted by the elizabethan waggeries of frank  but there is no fun in themthey are mechanical they are worse than the humours of scotts sir percy shafto which are not fine  the same sense of everything not being quite so excellent as one remembered it haunts one in hereward the wake the last of the english kingsley calls him the last of the english but he is really the first of the literary vikings  in the essay on the sagas here i have tried to show very imperfectly what the norsemen were actually like  they caught kingsleys fancy and his hereward though born on english soil is really norsenot english  but kingsley did not write about the vikings nor about his elizabethan heroes in westward ho in a perfectly simple straightforward way  he was always thinking of our own times and referring to them  that is why even the rather ruffianly hereward is so great an enemy of saints and monks  that is why in hypatia which opens so well we have those prodigiously dull stupid pedantic and conceited reflections of raphael ben ezra  that is why in all kingsleys novels he is perpetually exciting himself in defence of marriage and the family life as if any monkish ideas about the blessedness of bachelorhood were ever likely to drive the great anglo saxon race into convents and monasteries  that is the very last thing we have to be afraid of but kingsley was afraid of it and was eternally attacking everything popish and monkish  boys and young people then can read westward ho and hypatia and hereward the wake with far more pleasure than their elders  they hurry on with the adventures and do not stop to ask what the moralisings mean  they forgive the humour of kingsley because it is well meant  they get in short the real good of this really great and noble and manly and blundering genius  they take pleasure in his love of strong men gallant fights desperate encounters with human foes with raging seas with pestilence or in haunted forests  for in all that is good of his talentin his courage his frank speech his love of sport his clear eyes his devotion to field and wood river moor sea and stormskingsley is a boy  he has the brave rather hasty and not over wellinformed enthusiasm of sixteen for persons and for causes  he saw an opponent it might be father newman his heart lusted for a fight he called his opponent names he threw his cap into the ring he took his coat off he fought he got a terrible scientific drubbing  it was like a sixthform boy matching himself against the champion  and then he bore no malice  he took his defeat bravely  nay are we not left with a confused feeling that he was not far in the wrong though he had so much the worse of the fight  such was kingsley a man with a boys heart a hater of cruelty and injustice and also with a brave indomitable belief that his own country and his own cause were generally in the right whatever the quarrel  he loved england like a mistress and hated her enemies spain and the pope though even in them he saw the good  he is for ever scolding the spanish for their cruelties to the indians but he defends our doings to the irish which at that time were neither more nor less oppressive than the spanish performances in america  go it our side you always hear this good kingsley crying and ones heart goes out to him for it in an age when everybody often proves his own country to be in the wrong  simple brave resolute manly a little given to robustiousness kingsley transfigured all these qualities by possessing the soul and the heart of a poet  he was not a very great poet indeed but a true poetone of the very small band who are cut off by a gulf that can never be passed from mere writers of verse however clever educated melodious ingenious amiable and refined  he had the real spark of fire the true note though the spark might seldom break into flame and the note was not always clear  never let us confuse true poets with writers of verse still less with writers of poetic prose  kingsley wrote a great deal of thatperhaps too much his descriptions of scenes are not always as good as in herewards ride round the fens or when the tall spanish galleon staggers from the revenge of man to the vengeance of god to her doom through the mist to her rest in the sea  perhaps only a poet could have written that prose it is certain no writer of poetic prose could have written kingsleys poems  his songs are his best things they really are songs not merely lyric poems  they have the merit of being truly popular whether they are romantic like the sands o dee which actually reproduces the best qualities of the old ballad or whether they are pathetic like the dolls song in water babies or whether they attack an abuse as in the song of the merry brown hares or whether they soar higher as in deep deep love within thine own abyss abiding or whether they are mere noble nonsense as in lorraine loree     she mastered young vindictive oh the gallant lass was she    and kept him straight and won the race as near as near could be    but he killed her at the brook against a pollard willow tree    oh he killed her at the brook the brute for all the world to see    and no one but the baby cried for poor lorraine loree  the truth about charles kingsley seems to be that he rather made a brave and cheery noise in this nightbattle of modern life than that he directed any movement of forces  he kept cheering as it were and waving his sword with a contagious enthusiasm  being a poet and a man both of heart and of sentiment he was equally attached to the best things of the old world and to the best of the new world as far as one can forecast what it is to be  he loved the stately homes of england the ancient graduated order of society the sports of the past the military triumphs the patriotic glories  but he was also on the side of the poor as parson lot he attempted to be a christian socialist  now the socialists are the people who want to take everything the christians are the persons who do not want to give more than they find convenient  kingsley himself was ready to give and did give his time his labour his health and probably his money to the poor  but he was by no means minded that they should swallow up the old england with church and castle manorhouse and tower wealth beauty learning refinement  the man who wrote alton locke the story of the starved tailorpoet was the man who nearly wept when he heard a fox bark and reflected that the days of foxhunting were numbered  he had a poets politics colonel newcomes politics  he was for england for the poor for the rich for the storied houses of the chivalrous past for the cottage for the hall and was dead against the ideas of manchester and of mr john bright  my father he says in a letter would have put his hand to a spade or an axe with any man and so could i pretty well too when i was in my prime and my eldest son is now working with his own hands at farming previous to emigrating to south america where he will do the drudgery of his own cattlepens and sheepfolds and if i were twentyfour and unmarried i would go out there too and work like an englishman and live by the sweat of my brow  this was the right side of his love of the vikings it was thus they lived when not at warthus that every gentleman who has youth and health should work winning new worlds for his class in place of this miserable overcrowded brawling england  this i think was or should have been the real lesson and message of kingsley for the generations to come  like scott the scion of an old knightly line he had that drop of wild blood which drives men from town into the air and the desert wherever there are savage lands to conquer beasts to hunt and a hardy life to be lived  but he was the son of a clergyman and a clergyman himself  the spirit that should have gone into action went into talking preaching writingall sources of great pleasure to thousands of people and so not wasted  yet these were not the natural outlets of kingsleys life he should have been a soldier or an explorer at least we may believe that he would have preferred such fortune  he did his best the best he knew and it is all on the side of manliness courage kindness perhaps he tried too many thingsscience history fairy tales religious and political discussions romance poetry  poetry was what he did best romance next his science and his history are entertaining but without authority  this when one reads it again seems a cold unfriendly estimate of a man so ardent and so genuine a writer so vivacious and courageous as kingsley  even the elderly reviewer bears to him and to his brother henry a debt he owes to few of their generation  the truth is we should read kingsley we must not criticise him  we must accept him and be glad of him as we accept a windy sunny autumn daybeautiful and blusterousto be enjoyed and struggled with  if once we stop and reflect and hesitate he seems to preach too much and with a confidence which his knowledge of the world and of history does not justify  to be at one with kingsley we must be boys again and that momentary change cannot but be good for us  soon enoughtoo soonwe shall drop back on manhood and on all the difficulties and dragons that kingsley drove away by a blast on his chivalrous and cheery horn     charles lever his books adventures and misfortunes   surely it is a pleasant thing that there are books like other enjoyments for all ages  you would not have a boy prefer whist to fives nor tobacco to toffee nor tolstoi to charles lever  the ancients reckoned tyrtaecus a fine poet not that he was particularly melodious or reflective but that he gave men heart to fight for their country charles lever has done as much  in his biography by mr fitzpatrick it is told that a widow lady had but one son and for him she obtained an appointment at woolwich  the boy was timid and nervous and she fancied that she must find for him some other professionperhaps that of literature  but he one day chanced on levers novels and they put so much heart into him that his character quite altered and he became the bravest of the brave  lever may not do as much for every one but he does teach contempt of danger or rather delight in it a gay spontaneous boyish kind of courageirish courage at its best  we may get more good from that than harm from all his tales of much punch and many drinking bouts  these are no longer in fashion and are not very gay reading perhaps but his stories and songs his duels and battles and hunting scenes are as merry and as good as ever  wild as they seem in the reading they are not far from the truth as may be gathered out of barringtons memoirs and their tales of the reckless irish life some eighty years ago  there were two men in charles levera glad man and a sad man  the gaiety was for his youth when he poured out his lorrequers and omalleys all the mirth and memories of his boyhood all the tales of fighting and feasting he gleaned from battered seasoned old warriors like major monsoon  even then mr thackeray who knew him and liked and laughed at him recognised through his merriment the fund of sadness beneath  the authors character is not humour but sentiment    extreme delicacy sweetness and kindliness of heart  the spirits are mostly artificial the fond is sadness as appears to me to be that of most irish writing and people   even in charles omalley what a true dark picture that is of the duel beside the broad angry river on the level waste under the wide grey sky  charles has shot his opponent bodkin and with considine his second is making his escape  considine cried out suddenly too infamous by jove we are murdered men  what do you mean said i  dont you see that said he pointing to something black which floated from a pole at the opposite side of the river  yes what is it  its his coat theyve put upon an oar to show the people hes killedthats all  every man heres his tenant and look there theyre not giving us much doubt as to their intentions  here a tremendous yell burst forth from the mass of people along the shore which rising to a terrific cry sank gradually down to a low wailing then rose and fell several times as the irish deathcry filled the air and rose to heaven as if imploring vengeance on a murderer  passages like this and that which followsthe dangerous voyage through the storm on the flooded shannon and through the reefsare what mr thackeray may have had in his mind when he spoke of levers underlying melancholy  like other men with very high spirits he had hours of gloom and the sadness and the thoughtfulness that were in him came forth then and informed his later books  these are far more carefully written far more cunningly constructed than the old chapters written from month to month as the fit took him with no more plan or premeditation than pickwick  but it is the early stories that we remember and that he lives bythe pages thrown off at a heat when he was a lively doctor with few patients and was not overattentive to them  these were the days of harry lorrequer and tom burke characters that ran away with him and took their own path through a merry world of diversion  like the knights in sir thomas malory these heroes ride at adventure ride amazing horses that dread no leap be it an irish stone wall on a mountain crest or be it the bayonets of a french square  mr levers biographer has not been wholly successful in pleasing the critics and he does not seem to affect very critical airs himself but he tells a straightforward tale  the life of charles lever is the natural commentary on his novels  he was born at dublin in 1806 the son of a builder or architect  at school he was very much flogged and the odds are that he deserved these attentions for he had high spirits beyond the patience of dominies  handsome merry and clever he read novels in school hours wore a ring and set up as a dandy  even then he was in love with the young lady whom he married in the end  at a fight with boys of another school he and a friend placed a mine under the ground occupied by the enemy and blew them more or less into the air many an eyebrow was singed off on that fatal day when for the only time this romancer of the wars smelled powder  he afterwards pleaded for his party before the worthy police magistrate and showed great promise as a barrister  at trinity college dublin he was full of his fun made ballads sang them through the streets in disguise like fergusson the scottish poet and one night collected thirty shillings in coppers  the original of frank webber in charles omalley was a chum of his and he took part in the wonderful practical jokes which he has made immortal in that novel  from trinity college dublin lever went to gottingen where he found fun and fighting enough among the german students  from that hour he became a citizen of the world or at least of europe and perhaps like the prophets was most honoured when out of his own country  he returned to dublin and took his degree in medicine after playing a famous practical joke  a certain medical professor was wont to lecture in bed  one night he left town unexpectedly  lever by chance came early to lecture found the professor absent slipped into his bed put on his nightcap and took the class himself  on another day he was standing outside the foundling hospital with a friend a small man  now a kind of stone cradle for foundlings was built outside the door and when a baby was placed therein a bell rang  lever lifted up his friend popped him into the cradle and had the joy of seeing the promising infant picked out by the porter  it seems a queer education for a man of letters but like sir walter scott when revelling in liddesdale he was making himself all the time he was collecting myriads of odd experiences and treasures of anecdotes he was learning to know men of all sorts and later as a country doctor he had experiences of mess tables of hunting and of all the ways of his remarkable countrymen  when cholera visited his district he stuck to his work like a man of heart and courage  but the usual tasks of a country doctor wearied him he neglected them he became unpopular with the authorities he married his first love and returned to brussels where he practised as a physician  he had already begun his first notable book harry lorrequer in the university magazine  it is merely a string of irish and other stories good bad and indifferenta picture gallery full of portraits of priests soldiers peasants and odd characters  the plot is of no importance we are not interested in harrys love affairs but in his scrapes adventures duels at home and abroad  he fights people by mistake whom he does not know by sight he appears on parade with his face blackened he wins large piles at trente et quarante he disposes of coopers of claret and bowls of punch and the sheep on a thousand hills provide him with devilled kidneys  the critics and the authors thought little of the merry medley but the public enjoyed it and defied the reviewers  one paper preferred the book to a wilderness of pickwicks and as this opinion was advertised everywhere by mglashan the publisher mr dickens was very much annoyed indeed authors are easily annoyed  but lever writes ut placeat pueris and there was a tremendous fight at rugby between two boys the slogger williams and tom brown of the period for the possession of harry lorrequer  when an author has the boys of england on his side he can laugh at the critics  not that lever laughed he too was easily vexed and much depressed when the reviews assailed him  next he began charles omalley and if any man reads this essay who has not read the irish dragoon let him begin at once  omalley is what you can recommend to a friend  here is every species of diversion duels and steeplechases practical jokes at college good practical jokes not booby traps and applepie beds here is fighting in the peninsula  if any student is in doubt let him try chapter xivthe battle on the douro  this is indeed excellent military writing and need not fear comparison as art with napiers famous history  lever has warmed to his work his heart is in it he had the best information from an eyewitness and the brief beginning on the peace of nature before the strife of men is admirably poetical  to reach the french under soult wellesley had to cross the deep and rapid douro in face of their fire and without regular transport  he dared the deed  what must have been his confidence in the men he commanded what must have been his reliance on his own genius  you hold your breath as you read while english and germans charge till at last the field is won and the dust of the french columns retreating in the distance blows down the road to spain  the great duke read this passage and marvelled how lever knew certain things that he tells  he learned this and much more the humours of war from the original of major monsoon  falstaff is alone in the literature of the world but if ever there came a later falstaff monsoon was the man  and where have you such an irish sancho panza as micky free that independent minstrel or such an irish di vernon as baby blake  the critics may praise levers thoughtful and careful later novels as they will but charles omalley will always be the pattern of a military romance  the anecdote of a virtuous weakness in oshaughnessys fathers character would alone make the fortune of many a story  the truth is it is not easy to lay down charles omalley to leave off reading it and get on with the account of lever  his excellent and delightful novel scarcely received one favourable notice from the press  this may have been because it was so popular but lever became so nervous that he did not like to look at the papers  when he went back to dublin and edited a magazine there he was more fiercely assailed than ever  it is difficult for an irishman to write about the irish or for a scot to write about the scottish without hurting the feelings of his countrymen  while their literary brethren are alive they are not very dear to the newspaper scribes of these gallant nations and thus jeffrey was more severe to scott than he need have been while the irish press it appears made an onslaught on lever  mr thackeray met lever in dublin and he mentions this unkind behaviour  lorrequers military propensities have been objected to strongly by his squeamish hibernian brethren    but is lorrequer the only man in ireland who is fond of military spectacles  why does the nation publish these edifying and christian war songs    and who is it that prates about the irish at waterloo and the irish at fontenoy and the irish at seringapatam and the irish at timbuctoo  if mr oconnell like a wise rhetorician chooses and very properly to flatter the national military passion why not harry lorrequer  why not indeed  but mr lever was a successful irishman of letters and a good many other irish gentlemen of letters honest doolan and his friends were not successful  that is the humour of it  though you my youthful reader if i have one do not detest jones because he is in the eleven nor brown because he has got his cap nor smith because he does greek iambics like sophocles though you rather admire and applaud these champions you may feel very differently when you come to thirty years or more and see other men doing what you cannot do and gaining prizes beyond your grasp  and then if you are a reviewer you will find fault with a book for what it does not give as thus to take mr thackerays example  lady smigsmags novel is amusing but lamentably deficient in geological information  mr levers novels are trashy and worthless for his facts are not borne out by any authority and he gives us no information about the political state of ireland  oh our country our green and beloved our beautiful and oppressed and so forth  it was not altogether a happy time that lever passed at home  not only did his native critics belabour him most ungrudgingly for tom burke that vivid and chivalrous romance but he made enemies of authors  he edited a magazine  is not that enough  he wearied of wading through waggonloads of that pure unmitigated rubbish which people are permitted to shoot at editorial doors  how much dust there is in it to how few pearls  he did not return mss punctually and politely  the office cat could edit the volunteered contributions of many a magazine but lever was even more casual and careless than an experienced office cat  he grew crabbed and tried to quarrel with mr thackeray for that delightful parody phil fogarty nearly as good as a genuine story by lever  beset by critics burlesqued by his friend he changed his style mr fitzpatrick tells us and became more soberand not so entertaining  he actually published a criticism of beyle of stendhal that psychological prig the darling of culture and of m paul bourget  harry lorrequer on stendhalit beggars belief  he nearly fought a duel with the gentleman who is said to have suggested mr pecksniff to dickens  yet they call his early novels improbable  nothing could be less plausible than a combat between harry lorrequer and a gentleman who even remotely resembled the father of cherry and merry  lever went abroad again and in florence or the baths of lucca in trieste or spezia he passed the rest of his life  he saw the italian revolution of 1848 and it added to his melancholy  this is plain from one of his novels with a curious historycon cregan  he wrote it at the same time as the daltons and he did not sign it  the reviewers praised con cregan at the expense of the signed work rejoicing that lever as the daltons proved was exhausted and that a new irish author the author of con cregan was coming to eclipse him  in short he eclipsed himself and he did not like it  his right hand was jealous of what his left hand did  it seems odd that any human being however dull and envious failed to detect lever in the rapid and vivacious adventures of his irish gil blas hero of one of the very best among his books a piece not unworthy of dumas  con was written after midnight the daltons in the morning and there can be no doubt which set of hours was more favourable to levers genius  of course he liked the daltons best of all people authors appear to be their own worst critics  it is not possible even to catalogue levers later books here  again he drove a pair of novels abreastthe dodds and sir jasper carewwhich contain some of his most powerful situations  when almost an old man sad outworn in body straitened in circumstances he still produced excellent tales in this later mannerlord kilgobbin that boy of norcotts a days ride and many more  these are the thoughts of a tired man of the world who has done and seen everything that such men see and do  he says that he grew fat and bald and grave he wrote for the grave and the bald not for the happier world which is young and curly and merry  he died at last it is said in his sleep and it is added that he did what harry lorrequer would not have donehe left his affairs in perfect order  lever lived in an age so full of great novelists that perhaps he is not prized as he should be  dickens bulwer thackeray trollope george eliot were his contemporaries  but when we turn back and read him once more we see that lever too was a worthy member of that famous companya romancer for boys and men     the poems of sir walter scott   yesterday as the sun was very bright and there was no wind i took a fishingrod on chance and scotts poems and rowed into the middle of st marys loch  every hill every tuft of heather was reflected in the lake as in a silver mirror  there was no sound but the lapping of the water against the boat the cry of the blackcock from the hill and the pleasant plash of a trout rising here and there  so i read the lay of the last minstrel over again here in the middle of the scenes where the story is laid and where the fights were fought  for when the baron went on pilgrimage     and took with him this elvish page    to marys chapel of the lowes  it was to the ruined chapel here that he came     for there beside our ladyes lake    an offering he had sworn to make       and he would pay his vows  but his enemy the lady of branksome gathered a band     of the best that would ride at her command  and they all came from the country round  branksome where the lady lived is twenty miles off towards the south across the ranges of lonely green hills  harden where her ally wat of harden abode is within twelve miles and deloraine where william dwelt is nearer still and john of thirlestane had his square tower in the heather where victual never grew on ettrick water within ten miles  these gentlemen and their kinsfolk and retainers being at feud with the kers tried to slay the baron in the chapel of lone st mary of the waves     they were three hundred spears and three    through douglas burn up yarrow stream    their horses prance their lances gleam    they came to st marys lake ere day    but the chapel was void and the baron away    they burned the chapel for very rage    and cursed lord cranstouns goblinpage  the scotts were a rough clan enough to burn a holy chapel because they failed to kill their enemy within the sacred walls  but as i read again for the twentieth time sir walters poem floating on the lonely breast of the lake in the heart of the hills where yarrow flows among the little green mounds that cover the ruins of chapel and castle and ladys bower i asked myself whether sir walter was indeed a great and delightful poet or whether he pleases me so much because i was born in his own country and have one drop of the blood of his border robbers in my own veins  it is not always pleasant to go back to places or to meet people whom we have loved well long ago  if they have changed little we have changed much  the little boy whose first book of poetry was the lady of the lake and who naturally believed that there was no poet like sir walter is sadly changed into the man who has read most of the worlds poets and who hears on many sides that scott is outworn and doomed to deserved oblivion  are they right or wrong the critics who tell us occasionally that scotts good novels make up for his bad verse or that verse and prose all must go  pro captu lectoris by the readers taste they stand or fall yet even pessimism can scarcely believe that the waverley novels are mortal  they were once the joy of every class of minds they cannot cease to be the joy of those who cling to the permanently good and can understand and forgive lapses carelessnesses and the leisurely literary fashion of a former age  but as to the poems many give them up who cling to the novels  it does not follow that the poems are bad  in the first place they are of two kindslyric and narrative  now the fashion of narrative in poetry has passed away for the present  the true greek epics are read by a few in greek by perhaps fewer still in translations  but so determined are we not to read tales in verse that prose renderings even of the epics nay even of the attic dramas have come more or less into vogue  this accounts for the comparative neglect of sir walters lays  they are spoken of as waverley novels spoiled  this must always be the opinion of readers who will not submit to stories in verse it by no means follows that the verse is bad  if we make an exception which we must in favour of chaucer where is there better verse in story telling in the whole of english literature  the readers who despise marmion or the lady of the lake do so because they dislike stories told in poetry  from poetry they expect other things especially a lingering charm and magic of style a reflective turn criticism of life  these things except so far as life can be criticised in action are alien to the muse of narrative  stories and pictures are all she offers scotts pictures certainly are fresh enough his tales are excellent enough his manner is sufficiently direct  to take examples every one who wants to read scotts poetry should begin with the lay  from opening to close it never falters     nine and twenty knights of fame    hung their shields in branksome hall    nine and twenty squires of name    brought their steeds to bower from stall    nine and twenty yeomen tall    waited duteous on them all       ten of them were sheathed in steel    with belted sword and spur on heel    they quitted not their harness bright    neither by day nor yet by night          they lay down to rest          with corslet laced    pillowed on buckler cold and hard          they carved at the meal          with gloves of steel    and they drank the red wine through the helmet barred  now is not that a brave beginning  does not the verse clank and chime like sword sheath on spur like the bits of champing horses  then when william of deloraine is sent on his lonely midnight ride across the haunted moors and wolds does the verse not gallop like the heavy armoured horse     unchallenged thence passed deloraine    to ancient riddells fair domain    where aill from mountains freed    down from the lakes did raving come    each wave was crested with tawny foam    like the mane of a chestnut steed    in vain no torrent deep or broad    might bar the bold mosstroopers road    at the first plunge the horse sunk low    and the water broke oer the saddlebow  these last two lines have the very movement and note the deep heavy plunge the still swirl of the water  well i know the lochs whence aill comes red in flood many a trout have i taken in aill long ago  this of course causes a favourable prejudice a personal bias towards admiration  but i think the poetry itself is good and stirs the spirit even of those who know not ailmoor the mother of aill that lies dark among the melancholy hills  the spirit is stirred throughout by the chivalry and the courage of scotts men and of his women  thus the lady of branksome addresses the english invaders who have taken her boy prisoner     for the young heir of branksomes line    god be his aid and god be mine    through me no friend shall meet his doom    here while i live no foe finds room    then if thy lords their purpose urge    take our defiance loud and high    our slogan is their lykewake dirge    our moat the grave where they shall lie  ay and though the minstrel says he is no love poet and though indeed he shines more in war than in ladys bower is not this a noble stanza on true love and worthy of what old malory writes in his mort darthur because here scott speaks for himself and of his own unhappy and immortal affection     true loves the gift which god has given    to man alone beneath the heaven    it is not fantasys hot fire    whose wishes soon as granted fly    it liveth not in fierce desire    with dead desire it dock not die    it is the secret sympathy    the silver link the silken tie    which heart to heart and mind to mind    in body and in soul can bind  truth and faith courage and chivalry a free life in the hills and by the streams a shrewd brain an open heart a kind word for friend or foeman these are what you learn from the lay if you want to learn lessons from poetry  it is a rude legend perhaps as the critics said at once when critics were disdainful of wizard priests and ladies magical  but it is a deathless legend i hope it appeals to every young heart that is not early spoiled by low cunning and cynicism and love of gain  the minstrels own prophecy is true and still and always     yarrow as he rolls along    bears burden to the minstrels song  after the lay came marmion a tale of flodden field  it is far more ambitious and complicated than the lay and is not much worse written sir walter was ever a rapid and careless poet and as he took more pains with his plot he took less with his verse  his friends reproved him but he answered to one of them     since oft thy judgment could refine    my flattened thought and cumbrous line    still kind as is thy wont attend    and in the minstrel spare the friend    though wild as cloud as stream as gale    flow forth flow unrestrained my tale  any one who knows scotts country knows how cloud and stream and gale all sweep at once down the valley of ettrick or of tweed  west wind wild cloud red river they pour forth as by one impulseforth from the far off hills  he let his verse sweep out in the same stormy sort and many a cumbrous line many a flattened thought you may note if you will in marmion  for example     and think what he must next have felt    at buckling of the falchion belt  the lay is a tale that only verse could tell much of marmion might have been told in prose and most of rokeby  but prose could never give the picture of edinburgh nor tell the tale of flodden fight in marmion which i verily believe is the best battlepiece in all the poetry of all time better even than the stand of aias by the ships in the iliad better than the slaying of the wooers in the odyssey  nor could prose give us the hunting of the deer and the long gallop over hillside and down valley with which the lady of the lake begins opening thereby the enchanted gates of the highlands to the world  the lady of the lake except in the battlepiece is told in a less rapid metre than that of the lay less varied than that of marmion rokeby lives only by its songs the lord of the isles by bannockburn the field of waterloo by the repulse of the cuirassiers  but all the poems are interspersed with songs and ballads as the beautiful ballad of alice brand and scotts fame rests on these far more than on his later versified romances  coming immediately after the very tamest poets who ever lived like hayley scott wrote songs and ballads as wild and free as melancholy or gay as ever shepherd sang or gipsy carolled or witchwife moaned or old forgotten minstrel left to the world music with no makers name  for example take the outlaws rhyme     with burnished brand and musketoon       so gallantly you come    i read you for a bold dragoon       that lists the tuck of drum    i list no more the tuck of drum       no more the trumpet hear    but when the beetle sounds his hum       my comrades take the spear    and oh though brignal banks be fair       and greta woods be gay    yet mickle must the maiden dare       would reign my queen of may  how musical again is this     this morn is merry june i trow       the rose is budding fain    but she shall bloom in winter snow       ere we two meet again    he turned his charger as he spake       upon the river shore    he gave his bridlereins a shake       said adieu for evermore                my love       adieu for evermore  turning from the legends in verse let it not be forgotten that scott was a great lyrical poet  mr palgrave is not too lenient a judge and his golden treasury is a touchstone as well as a treasure of poetic gold in this volume wordsworth contributes more lyrics than any other poet shelley and shakespeare come next then sir walter  for my part i would gladly sacrifice a few of wordsworths for a few more of scotts  but this may be prejudice  mr palgrave is not prejudiced and we see how high is his value for sir walter  there are scores of songs in his works touching and sad or gay as a hunters waking that tell of lovely things lost by tradition and found by him on the moors all thesenot prized by sir walter himselfare in his gift and in that of no other man  for example his eve of st john is simply a masterpiece a ballad among ballads  nothing but an old song moves us like     are these the links o forth she said    are these the bends o dee  he might have done more of the best had he very greatly cared  alone among poets he had neither vanity nor jealousy he thought little of his own verse and his own fame would that he had thought more would that he had been more careful of what was so precious  but he turned to prose bade poetry farewell     yet once again farewell thou minstrel harp    yet once again forgive my feeble sway    and little reck i of the censure sharp    may idly cavil at an idle lay  people still cavil idly complaining that scott did not finish or did not polish his pieces that he was not keats or was not wordsworth  he was himself he was the last minstrel the latest the greatest the noblest of natural poets concerned with natural things  he sang of free fierce and warlike life of streams yet rich in salmon and moors not yet occupied by brewers of lonely places haunted in the long grey twilights of the north of crumbling towers where once dwelt the lady of branksome or the flower of yarrow  nature summed up in him many a past age a world of ancient faiths and before the great time of britain wholly died to britain as to greece she gave her homer  when he was old and tired and near his deathso worn with trouble and labour that he actually signed his own name wronghe wrote his latest verse for a lady  it ends     my country be thou glorious still  and so he died within the sound of the whisper of tweed foreseeing the years when his country would no more be glorious thinking of his country only forgetting quite the private sorrow of his own later days  people will tell you that scott was not a great poet that his bolt is shot his fame perishing  little he cared for his fame  but for my part i think and hope that scott can never die till men grow up into manhood without ever having been boystill they forget that     one glorious hour of crowded life    is worth an age without a name  thus the charges against sir walters poetry are on the whole little more than the old critical fallacy of blaming a thing for not being something else  it takes all sorts to make a world in poetry as in life  sir walters sort is a very good sort and in english literature its place was empty and waiting for him  think of what he did  english poetry had long been very tame and commonplace written in couplets like popes very artificial and smart or sensible and slow  he came with poems of which the music seemed to gallop like thundering hoofs and ringing bridles of a rushing border troop  here were goblin ghost and fairy fight and foray fair ladies and true lovers gallant knights and hard blows blazing beacons on every hill crest and on the bartisan of every tower  here was a world made alive again that had been dead for three hundred yearsa world of men and women  they say that the archaeology is not good  archaeology is a science in its application to poetry scott was its discoverer  others can name the plates of a coat of armour more learnedly than he but he made men wear them  they call his gothic art false his armour pasteboard but he put living men under his castled roofs living men into his breastplates and taslets  science advances old knowledge becomes ignorance it is poetry that does not die and that will not die while     the triple pride    of eildon looks over strathclyde     john bunyan   dr johnson once took bishop percys little daughter on his knee and asked her what she thought of the pilgrims progress  the child answered that she had not read it  no replied the doctor then i would not give one farthing for you and he set her down and took no further notice of her  this story if true proves that the doctor was rather intolerant  we must not excommunicate people because they have not our taste in books the majority of people do not care for books at all  there is a descendant of john bunyans alive now or there was lately who never read the pilgrims progress  books are not in his line  nay bunyan himself who wrote sixty works was no great reader  an oxford scholar who visited him in his study found no books at all except some of bunyans own and foxes book of martyrs  yet little as the world in general cares for reading it has read bunyan more than most  one hundred thousand copies of the pilgrim are believed to have been sold in his own day and the story has been done into the most savage languages as well as into those of the civilised world  dr johnson who did not like dissenters praises the invention imagination and conduct of the story and knew no other book he wished longer except robinson crusoe and don quixote  well dr johnson would not have given a farthing for me as i am quite contented with the present length of these masterpieces  what books do you wish longer  i wish homer had written a continuation of the odyssey and told us what odysseus did among the faroff men who never tasted salt nor heard of the sea  a land epic after the sea epic how good it would have beenfrom homer  but it would have taxed the imagination of dante to continue the adventures of christian and his wife after they had once crossed the river and reached the city  john bunyan has been more fortunate than most authors in one of his biographies  his life has been written by the rev dr brown who is now minister of his old congregation at bedford and an excellent life it is  dr brown is neither roundhead nor cavalier for though he is of course on bunyans side he does not throw stones at the beautiful church of england  probably most of us are on bunyans side now  it might be a good thing that we should all dwell together in religious unity but history shows that people cannot be bribed into brotherhood  they tried to bully bunyan they arrested and imprisoned himunfairly even in law according to dr brown not unfairly mr froude thinksand he would not be bullied  what was much more extraordinary he would not be embittered  in spite of all he still called charles ii a gracious prince  when a subject is in conscience at variance with the law bunyan said he has but one courseto accept peaceably the punishment which the law awards  he was never soured never angered by twelve years of durance not exactly in a loathsome dungeon but in very uncomfortable quarters  when there came a brief interval of toleration he did not occupy himself in brawling but in preaching and looking after the manners and morals of the little church including one woman who brought disagreeable charges against brother honeylove  the church decided that there was nothing in the charges but somehow the name of brother honeylove does not inspire confidence  almost everybody knows the main facts of bunyans life  they may not know that he was of norman descent as dr brown seems to succeed in proving nor that the bunyans came over with the conqueror nor that he was a gipsy as others hold  on dr browns showing bunyans ancestors lost their lands in process of time and change and bunyans father was a tinker  he preferred to call himself a brazierhis was the rather unexpected trade to which mr dick proposed apprenticing david copperfield  bunyan himself the wondrous babe as dr brown enthusiastically styles him was christened on november 30th 1628  he was born in a cottage long fallen and hard by was a marshy place a veritable slough of despond  bunyan may have had it in mind when he wrote of the slough where christian had so much trouble  he was not a travelled man all his knowledge of people and places he found at his doors  he had some schooling according to the rate of other poor mens children and assuredly it was enough  the great civil war broke out and bunyan was a soldier he tells us not on which side  dr brown and mr lewis morris think he was on that of the parliament but his old father the tinker stood for the king  mr froude is rather more inclined to hold that he was among the gay gallants who struck for the crown  he does not seem to have been much under fire but he got that knowledge of the appearance of war which he used in his siege of the city of mansoul  one can hardly think that bunyan liked warcertainly not from cowardice but from goodness of heart  in 1646 the army was disbanded and bunyan went back to elstow village and his tinkering his bellringing his dancing with the girls his playing at cat on a sunday after service  he married very young and poor  he married a pious wife and read all her librarythe plain mans pathway to heaven and the practice of piety  he became very devout in the spirit of the church of england and he gave up his amusements  then he fell into the slough of despond then he went through the valley of the shadow and battled with apollyon  people have wondered why he fancied himself such a sinner  he confesses to having been a liar and a blasphemer  if i may guess i fancy that this was merely the literary genius of bunyan seeking for expression  his lies i would go bail were tremendous romances wild fictions told for fun never lies of cowardice or for gain  as to his blasphemies he had an extraordinary power of language and that was how he gave it play  fancy swearing was his only literary safetyvalve in those early days when he played cat on elstow green  then he heard a voice dart from heaven into his soul which said wilt thou leave thy sins and go to heaven or have thy sins and go to hell so he fell on repentance and passed those awful years of mental torture when all nature seemed to tempt him to the unknown sin  what did all this mean  it meant that bunyan was within an ace of madness  it happens to a certain proportion of men religiously brought up to suffer like bunyan  they hear voices they are afraid of that awful unknown iniquity and of eternal death as bunyan and cowper were afraid  was it not de quincey who was at school with a bully who believed he had been guilty of the unpardonable offence  bullying is an offence much less pardonable than most men are guilty of  their best plan in bunyans misery is to tell apollyon that the devil is an ass to do their work and speak the truth  bunyan got quit of his terror at last briefly by believing in the goodness of god  he did not say like mr carlyle well if all my fears are true what then  his was a christian not a stoical deliverance  the church in which bunyan found shelter had for minister a converted major in a royalist regiment  it was a quaint little community the members living like the early disciples correcting each others faults and keeping a severe eye on each others lives  bunyan became a minister in it but puritan as he was he lets his pilgrims dance on joyful occasions and even mr readytohalt waltzes with a young lady of the pilgrim company  as a minister and teacher bunyan began to write books of controversy with quakers and clergymen  the points debated are no longer important to us the main thing was that he got a pen into his hand and found a proper outlet for his genius a better way than fancy swearing  if he had not been cast into bedford jail for preaching in a cottage he might never have dreamed his immortal dream nor become all that he was the leisures of gaol were long  in that den the muse came to him the fair kind muse of the home beautiful  he saw all that company of his so like and so unlike chaucers faithful and hopeful and christian the fellowship of fiends the truculent cavaliers of vanity fair and giant despair with his grievous crabtree cudgel and other people he saw who are with us alwaysthe handsome madam bubble and the young woman whose name was dull and mr worldly wiseman and mr facing bothways and byends all the persons of the comedy of human life  he hears the angelic songs of the city beyond the river he hears them but repeat them to us he cannot for im no poet as he says himself he beheld the country of beulah and the delectable mountains that earthly paradise of nature where we might be happy yet and wander no farther if the world would let usfair mountains in whose streams izaak walton was then even casting angle  it is pleasant to fancy how walton and bunyan might have met and talked under a plane tree by the ouse while the may showers were falling surely bunyan would not have likened the good old man to formalist and certainly walton would have enjoyed travelling with christian though the book was by none of his dear bishops but by a nonconformist  they were made to like but not to convert each other in matters ecclesiastical they saw the opposite sides of the shield  each wrote a masterpiece  it is too late to praise the complete angler or the pilgrims progress you may put ingenuity on the rack but she can say nothing new that is true about the best romance that ever was wedded to allegory nor about the best idyl of old english life  the people are living nowall the people the noisy bullying judges as of the french revolutionary courts or the hanging courts after monmouths war the demure grave puritan girls and matthew who had the gripes and lazy feckless ignorance who came to so ill an end poor fellow and sturdy old honest and timid mr fearing not single persons but dozens arise on the memory  they come as fresh as vivid as if they were out of scott or moliere the tinker is as great a master of character and fiction as the greatest almost his style is pure and plain and sound full of old idioms and even of something like old slang  but even his slang is classical  bunyan is everybodys author  the very catholics have their own edition of the pilgrim they have cut out giant pope but have been too goodnatured to insert giant protestant in his place  unheralded unannounced though not uncriticised they accused the tinker of being a plagiarist of course bunyan outshone the court wits the learned the poets of the restoration and even the great theologians  his other books except grace abounding an autobiography the holy war and mr badman are only known to students nor much read by them  the fashion of his theology as of all theology passed away it is by virtue of his imagination of his romance that he lives  the allegory of course is full of flaws  it would not have been manly of christian to run off and save his own soul leaving his wife and family  but bunyan shrank from showing us how difficult if not impossible it is for a married man to be a saint  christiana was really with him all through that pilgrimage and how he must have been hampered by that woman of the world  but had the allegory clung more closely to the skirts of truth it would have changed from a romance to a satire from the pilgrims progress to vanity fair  there was too much love in bunyan for a satirist of that kind he had just enough for a humourist  born in another class he might have been he would have been a writer more refined in his strength more uniformly excellent but never so universal nor so popular in the best sense of the term  in the change of times and belief it is not impossible that bunyan will live among the class whom he least thought of addressingscholars lovers of worldly literaturefor devotion and poverty are parting company while art endures till civilisation perishes  are we better or worse for no longer believing as bunyan believed no longer seeing that abyss of pascals open beside our armchairs  the question is only a form of that wide riddle does any theological or philosophical opinion make us better or worse  the vast majority of men and women are little affected by schemes and theories of this life and the next  they who even ask for a reply to the riddle are the few most of us take the easygoing morality of our world for a guide as we take bradshaw for a railway journey  it is the few who must find out an answer on that answer their lives depend and the lives of others are insensibly raised towards their level  bunyan would not have been a worse man if he had shared the faith of izaak walton  izaak had his reply to all questions in the church catechism and the articles  bunyan found his in the theology of his sect appealing more strongly than orthodoxy to a nature more bellicose than izaaks  men like him with his indomitable courage will never lack a solution of the puzzle of the earth  at worst they will live by law whether they dare to speak of it as gods law or dare not  they will always be our leaders our captain greathearts in the pilgrimage to the city where led or unled we must all at last arrive  they will not fail us while loyalty and valour are human qualities  the day may conceivably come when we have no christian to march before us but we shall never lack the company of greatheart     to a young journalist   dear smith  you inform me that you desire to be a journalist and you are kind enough to ask my advice  well be a journalist by all means in any honest and honourable branch of the profession  but do not be an eavesdropper and a spy  you may fly into a passion when you receive this very plainly worded advice  i hope you will but for several reasons which i now go on to state i fear that you wont  i fear that either by natural gift or by acquired habit you already possess the imperturbable temper which will be so useful to you if you do join the army of spies and eavesdroppers  if i am right you have made up your mind to refuse to take offence as long as by not taking offence you can wriggle yourself forward in the band of journalistic reptiles  you will be revenged on me in that case some day you will lie in wait for me with a dirty bludgeon and steal on me out of a sewer  if you do permit me to assure you that i dont care  but if you are already in a rage if you are about tearing up this epistle and are starting to assault me personally or at least to answer me furiously then there is every hope for you and for your future  i therefore venture to state my reasons for supposing that you are inclined to begin a course which your father if he were alive would deplore as all honourable men in their hearts must deplore it  when you were at the university let me congratulate you on your degree you edited or helped to edit the bulldog  it was not a very brilliant nor a very witty but it was an extremely racy periodical  it spoke of all men and dons by their nicknames  it was full of secondhand slang  it contained many personal anecdotes to the detriment of many people  it printed garbled and spiteful versions of private conversations on private affairs  it did not even spare to make comments on ladies and on the details of domestic life in the town and in the university  the copies which you sent me i glanced at with extreme disgust  in my time more than a score of years ago a similar periodical but a much more clever periodical was put forth by members of the university it contained a novel which even now would be worth several illgotten guineas to the makers of the chronique scandaleuse  but nobody bought it and it died an early death  times have altered i am a fogey but the ideas of honour and decency which fogies hold now were held by young men in the sixties of our century  i know very well that these ideas are obsolete  i am not preaching to the world nor hoping to convert society but to you and purely in your own private spiritual interest  if you enter on this path of tattle mendacity and malice and if with your cleverness and light hand you are successful society will not turn its back on you  you will be feared in many quarters and welcomed in others  of your paragraphs people will say that it is a shame of course but it is very amusing  there are so many shames in the world shames not at all amusing that you may see no harm in adding to the number  if i dont do it you may argue some one else will undoubtedly but why should you do it  you are not a starving scribbler if you determine to write you can write well though not so easily on many topics  you have not that last sad excuse of hunger which drives poor women to the streets and makes unhappy men act as public blabs and spies  if you take to this metier it must be because you like it which means that you enjoy being a listener to and reporter of talk that was never meant for any ears except those in which it was uttered  it means that the hospitable board is not sacred for you it means that with you friendship honour all that makes human life better than a low smokingroom are only valuable for what their betrayal will bring  it means that not even the welfare of your country will prevent you from running to the press with any secret which you may have been entrusted with or which you may have surprised  it means this peculiar kind of profession that all things open and excellent and conspicuous to all men are with you of no account  art literature politics are to cease to interest you  you are to scheme to surprise gossip about the private lives dress and talk of artists men of letters politicians  your professional work will sink below the level of servants gossip in a publichouse parlour  if you happen to meet a man of known name you will watch him will listen to him will try to sneak into his confidence and you will blab for money about him and your blab will inevitably be mendacious  in short like the most pitiable outcasts of womankind and without their excuse you will live by selling your honour  you will not suffer much nor suffer long  your conscience will very speedily be seared with a redhot iron  you will be on the road which leads from mere dishonour to crime and you may find yourself actually practising chantage and extorting money as the price of your silence  this is the lowest deep the vast majority even of social mouchards do not sink so low as this  the profession of the critic even in honourable and open criticism is beset with dangers  it is often hard to avoid saying an unkind thing a cruel thing which is smart and which may even be deserved  who can say that he has escaped this temptation and what man of heart can think of his own fall without a sense of shame  there are i admit authors so antipathetic to me that i cannot trust myself to review them  would that i had never reviewed them  they cannot be so bad as they seem to me they must have qualities which escape my observation  then there is the temptation to hit back  some one writes unjustly or unkindly as you think of you or of your friends  you wait till your enemy has written a book and then you have your innings  it is not in nature that your review should be fair you must inevitably be more on the lookout for faults than merits  the ereintage the smashing of a literary foe is very delightful at the moment but it does not look well in the light of reflection  but these deeds are mere peccadilloes compared with the confirmed habit of regarding all men and women as fair game for personal tattle and the sating of private spite  nobody perhaps begins with this intention  most men and women can find ready sophistries  if a report about any one reaches their ears they say that they are doing him a service by publishing it and enabling him to contradict it  as if any mortal ever listened to a contradiction  and there are chargesthat of plagiarism for examplewhich can never be disproved even if contradictions were listened to by the public  the accusation goes everywhere is copied into every printed rag the contradiction dies with the daily death of a single newspaper  you may reply that a man of sense will be indifferent to false accusations  he may or may not bethat is not the question for you the question for you is whether you will circulate news that is false probably and spiteful certainly  in short the whole affair regards yourself more than it regards the world  plenty of poison is sold is it well for you to be one of the merchants  is it the business of an educated gentleman to live by the trade of an eavesdropper and a blab  in the memoirs of m blowitz he tells you how he began his illustrious career by procuring the publication of remarks which m thiers had made to him  he then went to see m thiers not without some apprehension  is that the kind of emotion which you wish to be habitual in your experience  do you think it agreeable to become shamefaced when you meet people who have conversed with you frankly  do you enjoy being a sneak and feeling like a sneak  do you find blushing pleasant  of course you will soon lose the power of blushing but is that an agreeable prospect  depend on it there are discomforts in the progress to the brazen in the journey to the shameless  you may if your tattle is political become serviceable to men engaged in great affairs  they may even ask you to their houses if that is your ambition  you may urge that they condone your deeds and are even art and part in them  but you must also be aware that they call you and think you a reptile  you are not one of those who will do the devils work without the devils wages but do you seriously think that the wages are worth the degradation  many men think so and are not in other respects bad men  they may even be kindly and genial  gentlemen they cannot be nor men of delicacy nor men of honour  they have sold themselves and their selfrespect some with ease they are the least blamable some with a struggle  they have seen better things and perhaps vainly long to return to them  these are st satans penitents and their remorse is vain     virtutem videant intabescantque relicta  if you dont wish to be of this dismal company there is only one course open to you  never write for publication one line of personal tattle let all mens persons and private lives be as sacred to you as your fathersthough there are tattlers who would sell paragraphs about their own mothers if there were a market for the ware  there is no half way house on this road  once begin to print private conversation and you are lostlost that is to delicacy and gradually to many other things excellent and of good report  the whole question for you is do you mind incurring this damnation  if there is nothing in it which appals and revolts you if your conscience is satisfied with a few ready sophisms or if you dont care a pin for your conscience fall to  vous irez loin  you will prattle in print about mens private lives their hidden motives their waistcoats their wives their boots their businesses their incomes  most of your prattle will inevitably be lies but go on nobody will kick you i deeply regret to say  you will earn money  you will be welcomed in society  you will live and die content and without remorse  i do not suppose that any particular inferno will await you in the future life  whoever watches this world with larger other eyes than ours will doubtless make allowance for you as for us all  i am not pretending to be a whit better than you probably i am worse in many ways but not in your way  putting it merely as a matter of taste i dont like the way  it makes me sickthat is all  it is a sin which i can comfortably damn as i am not inclined to it  you may put it in that light and i have no way of converting you nor if i have not dissuaded you of dissuading you from continuing on a larger scale your practices in the bulldog     mr kiplings stories   the wind bloweth where it listeth  but the wind of literary inspiration has rarely shaken the bungalows of india as in the tales of the old jesuit missionaries the magical air shook the frail medicine tents where huron conjurors practised their mysteries  with a world of romance and of character at their doors englishmen in india have seen as if they saw it not  they have been busy in governing in making war making peace building bridges laying down roads and writing official reports our literature from that continent of our conquest has been sparse indeed except in the way of biographies of histories and of rather local and unintelligible facetiae  except the novels by the author of tara and sir henry cunninghams brilliant sketches such as dustypore and sir alfred lyalls poems we might almost say that india has contributed nothing to our finer literature  that old haunt of history the wealth of character brought out in that confusion of races of religions and the old and new has been wealth untouched a treasure house sealed those pagoda trees have never been shaken  at last there comes an englishman with eyes with a pen extraordinarily deft an observation marvellously rapid and keen and by good luck this englishman has no official duties he is neither a soldier nor a judge he is merely a man of letters  he has leisure to look around him he has the power of making us see what he sees and when we have lost india when some new power is ruling where we ruled when our empire has followed that of the moguls future generations will learn from mr kiplings works what india was under english sway  it is one of the surprises of literature that these tiny masterpieces in prose and verse were poured as rich men give that care not for their gifts into the columns of angloindian journals  there they were thought clever and ephemeralpart of the chatter of the week  the subjects no doubt seemed so familiar that the strength of the handling the brilliance of the colour were scarcely recognised  but mr kiplings volumes no sooner reached england than the people into whose hands they fell were certain that here were the beginnings of a new literary force  the books had the strangeness the colour the variety the perfume of the east  thus it is no wonder that mr kiplings repute grew up as rapidly as the mysterious mango tree of the conjurors  there were critics of course ready to say that the thing was merely a trick and had nothing of the supernatural  that opinion is not likely to hold its ground  perhaps the most severe of the critics has been a young scotch gentleman writing french and writing it wonderfully well in a parisian review  he chose to regard mr kipling as little but an imitator of bret harte deriving his popularity mainly from the novel and exotic character of his subjects  no doubt if mr kipling has a literary progenitor it is mr bret harte  among his earlier verses a few are what an imitator of the american might have written in india  but it is a wild judgment which traces mr kiplings success to his use for example of angloindian phrases and scraps of native dialects  the presence of these elements is among the causes which have made englishmen think angloindian literature tediously provincial and india a bore  mr kipling on the other hand makes us regard the continent which was a bore an enchanted land full of marvels and magic which are real  there has indeed arisen a taste for exotic literature people have become alive to the strangeness and fascination of the world beyond the bounds of europe and the united states  but that is only because men of imagination and literary skill have been the new conquerorsthe corteses and balboas of india africa australia japan and the isles of the southern seas  all such conquerors whether they write with the polish of m pierre loti or with the carelessness of mr boldrewood have at least seen new worlds for themselves have gone out of the streets of the overpopulated lands into the open air have sailed and ridden walked and hunted have escaped from the fog and smoke of towns  new strength has come from fresher air into their brains and blood hence the novelty and buoyancy of the stories which they tell  hence too they are rather to be counted among romanticists than realists however real is the essential truth of their books  they have found so much to see and to record that they are not tempted to use the microscope and pore for ever on the minute in character  a great deal of realism especially in france attracts because it is novel because m zola and others have also found new worlds to conquer  but certain provinces in those worlds were not unknown to but were voluntarily neglected by earlier explorers  they were the bad lands of life and character surely it is wiser to seek quite new realms than to build mud huts and dunghills on the bad lands  mr kiplings work like all good work is both real and romantic  it is real because he sees and feels very swiftly and keenly it is romantic again because he has a sharp eye for the reality of romance for the attraction and possibility of adventure and because he is young  if a reader wants to see petty characters displayed in all their meannesses if this be realism surely certain of mr kiplings painted and frisky matrons are realistic enough  the seamy side of angloindian life the intrigues amorous or semipoliticalthe slang of people who describe dining as mangling garbage the games of tennis with the seventh commandmenthe has not neglected any of these  probably the sketches are true enough and pity tis true for example the sketches in under the deodars and in the gadsbys  that worthy pair with their friends are to myself as unsympathetic almost as the characters in la conquete de plassans  but mr kipling is too much a true realist to make their selfishness and pettiness unbroken unceasing  we know that gaddy is a brave modest and hardworking soldier and when his little silly bride who prefers being kissed by a man with waxed moustaches lies near to death certainly i am nearer to tears than when i am obliged to attend the bed of little dombey or of little nell  probably there is a great deal of slangy and unrefined angloindian society and no doubt to sketch it in its true colours is not beyond the province of art  at worst it is redeemed in part by its constancy in the presence of various perilsfrom disease and from the bullet flying down the pass mr kipling may not be and very probably is not a reader of gyp but the gadsbys especially reads like the work of an angloindian disciple trammelled by certain english conventions  the more pharisaic realiststhose of the strictest sectwould probably welcome mr kipling as a younger brother so far as under the deodars and the gadsbys are concerned if he were not occasionally witty and even flippant as well as realistic  but very fortunately he has not confined his observation to the leisures and pleasures of simla he has looked out also on war and on sport on the life of all native tribes and castes and has even glanced across the borders of the undiscovered country  among mr kiplings discoveries of new kinds of characters probably the most popular is his invention of the british soldier in india  he avers that he loves that very strong man thomas atkins but his affection has not blinded him to the faults of the beloved  mr atkins drinks too much is too careless a gallant in love has been educated either too much or too little and has other faults partly due apparently to recent military organisation partly to the feverish and unsettled state of the civilised world  but he is still brave when he is well led still loyal above all to his trusty chum  every englishman must hope that if terence mulvaney did not take the city of lungtung pen as described yet he is ready and willing so to take it  mr mulvaney is as humorous as micky free but more melancholy and more truculent  he has perhaps won his way to the mythical already and is not so much a soldier as an incarnation not of krishna but of many soldierly qualities  on the other hand private ortheris especially in his frenzy seems to shew all the truth and much more than the life of a photograph  such we presume is the soldier and such are his experiences and temptations and repentance  but nobody ever dreamed of telling us all this till mr kipling came  as for the soldier in action the taking of lungtung pen and the drums of the fore and aft and that other tale of the battle with the pathans in the gorge are among the good fights of fiction  they stir the spirit and they should be distributed in addition of course to the soldiers pocket book in the ranks of the british army  mr kipling is as well informed about the soldiers womenkind as about the soldier about dinah shadd as about terence mulvaney  lever never instructed us on these matters micky free if he loves rides away but terence mulvaney is true to his old woman  gallant loyal reckless vain swaggering and tenderhearted terence mulvaney if there were enough of him would take st petersburg in his drawers  can we be too grateful to an author who has extended as mr kipling in his military sketches has extended the frontiers of our knowledge and sympathy  it is a mere question of individual taste but for my own part had i to make a small selection from mr kiplings tales i would include more of his studies in black than in white and many of his excursions beyond the probable and natural  it is difficult to have one special favourite in this kind but perhaps the story of the two english adventurers among the freemasons of unknown kafiristan in the phantom rickshaw would take a very high place  the gasheated air of the indian newspaper office is so real and into it comes a wanderer who has seen new faces of death and who carries with him a head that has worn a royal crown  the contrasts are of brutal force the legend is among the best of such strange fancies  then there is in the same volume the strange ride of morrowbie jukes the most dreadful nightmare of the most awful bunker in the realms of fancy  this is a very early work if nothing else of mr kiplings existed his memory might live by it as does the memory of the american irishman by the diamond lens  the sham magic of in the house of suddhu is as terrible as true necromancy could be and i have a faiblesse for the bisara of pooree  the gate of the hundred sorrows is a realistic version of the english opium eater and more powerful by dint of less rhetoric  as for the sketches of native lifefor example on the city wallto english readers they are no less than revelations  they testify more even than the military stories to the authors swift and certain vision his certainty in his effects  in brief mr kipling has conquered worlds of which as it were we knew not the existence  his faults are so conspicuous so much on the surface that they hardly need to be named  they are curiously visible to some readers who are blind to his merits  there is a false air of hardness quite in contradiction to the sentiment in his tales of childish life there is a knowing air there are mannerisms such as but that is another story there is a display of slang there is the too obtrusive knocking of the nail on the head  everybody can mark these errors a few cannot overcome their antipathy and so lose a great deal of pleasure  it is impossible to guess how mr kipling will fare if he ventures on one of the usual novels of the orthodox length  few men have succeeded both in the conte and the novel  mr bret harte is limited to the conte m guy de maupassant is probably at his best in it  scott wrote but three or four short tales and only one of these is a masterpiece  poe never attempted a novel  hawthorne is almost alone in his command of both kinds  we can live only in the hope that mr kipling so skilled in so many species of the conte so vigorous in so many kinds of verse will also be triumphant in the novel though it seems unlikely that its scene can be in england and though it is certain that a writer who so cuts to the quick will not be happy with the novels almost inevitable padding  mr kiplings longest effort the light which failed can perhaps hardly be considered a test or touchstone of his powers as a novelist  the central interest is not powerful enough the characters are not so sympathetic as are the interest and the characters of his short pieces  many of these persons we have met so often that they are not mere passing acquaintances but already find in us the loyalty due to old friends     footnotes   70  the subject has been much more gravely treated in mr robert bridgess achilles in scyros  91  conjecture may cease as mr morris has translated the odyssey  109  for helen pendennis see the letters p 97  128  mr henley has lately as a loyal dickensite been defending the plots of dickens and his tragedy  pro captu lectoris if the reader likes them then they are good for the reader good absolute not for me though perhaps  the plot of martin chuzzlewit may be good but the conduct of old martin would strike me as improbable if i met it in the arabian nights  that the creator of pecksniff should have taken his misdeeds seriously as if mr pecksniff had been a tartuffe not a delight seems curious
