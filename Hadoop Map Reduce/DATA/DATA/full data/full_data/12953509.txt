12953509	an international episode  by henry james      part i   four years agoin 1874two young englishmen had occasion to go to the united states they crossed the ocean at midsummer and arriving in new york on the first day of august were much struck with the fervid temperature of that city disembarking upon the wharf they climbed into one of those huge highhung coaches which convey passengers to the hotels and with a great deal of bouncing and bumping took their course through broadway the midsummer aspect of new york is not perhaps the most favorable one still it is not without its picturesque and even brilliant side nothing could well resemble less a typical english street than the interminable avenue rich in incongruities through which our two travelers advancedlooking out on each side of them at the comfortable animation of the sidewalks the highcolored heterogeneous architecture the huge white marble facades glittering in the strong crude light and bedizened with gilded lettering the multifarious awnings banners and streamers the extraordinary number of omnibuses horsecars and other democratic vehicles the vendors of cooling fluids the white trousers and big straw hats of the policemen the tripping gait of the modish young persons on the pavement the general brightness newness juvenility both of people and things the young men had exchanged few observations but in crossing union square in front of the monument to washingtonin the very shadow indeed projected by the image of the pater patriaeone of them remarked to the other it seems a rumlooking place  ah very odd very odd said the other who was the clever man of the two  pity its so beastly hot resumed the first speaker after a pause  you know we are in a low latitude said his friend  i daresay remarked the other  i wonder said the second speaker presently if they can give one a bath  i daresay not rejoined the other  oh i say cried his comrade  this animated discussion was checked by their arrival at the hotel which had been recommended to them by an american gentleman whose acquaintance they madewith whom indeed they became very intimateon the steamer and who had proposed to accompany them to the inn and introduce them in a friendly way to the proprietor this plan however had been defeated by their friends finding that his partner was awaiting him on the wharf and that his commercial associate desired him instantly to come and give his attention to certain telegrams received from st louis but the two englishmen with nothing but their national prestige and personal graces to recommend them were very well received at the hotel which had an air of capacious hospitality they found that a bath was not unattainable and were indeed struck with the facilities for prolonged and reiterated immersion with which their apartment was supplied after bathing a good dealmore indeed than they had ever done before on a single occasionthey made their way into the dining room of the hotel which was a spacious restaurant with a fountain in the middle a great many tall plants in ornamental tubs and an array of french waiters the first dinner on land after a sea voyage is under any circumstances a delightful occasion and there was something particularly agreeable in the circumstances in which our young englishmen found themselves they were extremely good natured young men they were more observant than they appeared in a sort of inarticulate accidentally dissimulative fashion they were highly appreciative this was perhaps especially the case with the elder who was also as i have said the man of talent they sat down at a little table which was a very different affair from the great clattering seesaw in the saloon of the steamer the wide doors and windows of the restaurant stood open beneath large awnings to a wide pavement where there were other plants in tubs and rows of spreading trees and beyond which there was a large shady square without any palings and with marblepaved walks and above the vivid verdure rose other facades of white marble and of pale chocolatecolored stone squaring themselves against the deep blue sky here outside in the light and the shade and the heat there was a great tinkling of the bells of innumerable streetcars and a constant strolling and shuffling and rustling of many pedestrians a large proportion of whom were young women in pompadourlooking dresses within the place was cool and vaguely lighted with the plash of water the odor of flowers and the flitting of french waiters as i have said upon soundless carpets  its rather like paris you know said the younger of our two travelers  its like parisonly more so his companion rejoined  i suppose its the french waiters said the first speaker why dont they have french waiters in london  fancy a french waiter at a club said his friend  the young englishman started a little as if he could not fancy it in paris im very apt to dine at a place where theres an english waiter dont you know whatshisnames close to the thingumbob they always set an english waiter at me i suppose they think i cant speak french  well you cant and the elder of the young englishmen unfolded his napkin  his companion took no notice whatever of this declaration i say he resumed in a moment i suppose we must learn to speak american i suppose we must take lessons  i cant understand them said the clever man  what the deuce is he saying asked his comrade appealing from the french waiter  he is recommending some softshell crabs said the clever man  and so in desultory observation of the idiosyncrasies of the new society in which they found themselves the young englishmen proceeded to dinegoing in largely as the phrase is for cooling draughts and dishes of which their attendant offered them a very long list after dinner they went out and slowly walked about the neighboring streets the early dusk of waning summer was coming on but the heat was still very great the pavements were hot even to the stout boot soles of the british travelers and the trees along the curbstone emitted strange exotic odors the young men wandered through the adjoining squarethat queer place without palings and with marble walks arranged in black and white lozenges there were a great many benches crowded with shabbylooking people and the travelers remarked very justly that it was not much like belgrave square on one side was an enormous hotel lifting up into the hot darkness an immense array of open brightly lighted windows at the base of this populous structure was an eternal jangle of horsecars and all round it in the upper dusk was a sinister hum of mosquitoes the ground floor of the hotel seemed to be a huge transparent cage flinging a wide glare of gaslight into the street of which it formed a sort of public adjunct absorbing and emitting the passersby promiscuously the young englishmen went in with everyone else from curiosity and saw a couple of hundred men sitting on divans along a great marblepaved corridor with their legs stretched out together with several dozen more standing in a queue as at the ticket office of a railway station before a brilliantly illuminated counter of vast extent these latter persons who carried portmanteaus in their hands had a dejected exhausted look their garments were not very fresh and they seemed to be rendering some mysterious tribute to a magnificent young man with a waxed mustache and a shirtfront adorned with diamond buttons who every now and then dropped an absent glance over their multitudinous patience they were american citizens doing homage to a hotel clerk  im glad he didnt tell us to go there said one of our englishmen alluding to their friend on the steamer who had told them so many things they walked up the fifth avenue where for instance he had told them that all the first families lived but the first families were out of town and our young travelers had only the satisfaction of seeing some of the secondor perhaps even the thirdtaking the evening air upon balconies and high flights of doorsteps in the streets which radiate from the more ornamental thoroughfare they went a little way down one of these side streets and they saw young ladies in white dressescharminglooking personsseated in graceful attitudes on the chocolatecolored steps in one or two places these young ladies were conversing across the street with other young ladies seated in similar postures and costumes in front of the opposite houses and in the warm night air their colloquial tones sounded strange in the ears of the young englishmen one of our friends neverthelessthe younger oneintimated that he felt a disposition to interrupt a few of these soft familiarities but his companion observed pertinently enough that he had better be careful we must not begin with making mistakes said his companion  but he told us you knowhe told us urged the young man alluding again to the friend on the steamer  never mind what he told us answered his comrade who if he had greater talents was also apparently more of a moralist  by bedtimein their impatience to taste of a terrestrial couch again our seafarers went to bed earlyit was still insufferably hot and the buzz of the mosquitoes at the open windows might have passed for an audible crepitation of the temperature we cant stand this you know the young englishmen said to each other and they tossed about all night more boisterously than they had tossed upon the atlantic billows on the morrow their first thought was that they would reembark that day for england and then it occured to them that they might find an asylum nearer at hand the cave of aeolus became their ideal of comfort and they wondered where the americans went when they wished to cool off they had not the least idea and they determined to apply for information to mr j l westgate this was the name inscribed in a bold hand on the back of a letter carefully preserved in the pocketbook of our junior traveler beneath the address in the lefthand corner of the envelope were the words introducing lord lambeth and percy beaumont esq the letter had been given to the two englishmen by a good friend of theirs in london who had been in america two years previously and had singled out mr j l westgate from the many friends he had left there as the consignee as it were of his compatriots he is a capital fellow the englishman in london had said and he has got an awfully pretty wife hes tremendously hospitablehe will do everything in the world for you and as he knows everyone over there it is quite needless i should give you any other introduction he will make you see everyone trust to him for putting you into circulation he has got a tremendously pretty wife it was natural that in the hour of tribulation lord lambeth and mr percy beaumont should have bethought themselves of a gentleman whose attractions had been thus vividly depicted all the more so that he lived in the fifth avenue and that the fifth avenue as they had ascertained the night before was contiguous to their hotel ten to one hell be out of town said percy beaumont but we can at least find out where he has gone and we can immediately start in pursuit he cant possibly have gone to a hotter place you know  oh theres only one hotter place said lord lambeth and i hope he hasnt gone there  they strolled along the shady side of the street to the number indicated upon the precious letter the house presented an imposing chocolatecolored expanse relieved by facings and window cornices of florid sculpture and by a couple of dusty rose trees which clambered over the balconies and the portico this lastmentioned feature was approached by a monumental flight of steps  rather better than a london house said lord lambeth looking down from this altitude after they had rung the bell  it depends upon what london house you mean replied his companion you have a tremendous chance to get wet between the house door and your carriage  well said lord lambeth glancing at the burning heavens i guess it doesnt rain so much here  the door was opened by a long negro in a white jacket who grinned familiarly when lord lambeth asked for mr westgate  he aint at home sah hes downtown at his ofice  oh at his office said the visitors and when will he be at home  well sah when he goes out dis way in de moning he aint liable to come home all day  this was discouraging but the address of mr westgates office was freely imparted by the intelligent black and was taken down by percy beaumont in his pocketbook the two gentlemen then returned languidly to their hotel and sent for a hackney coach and in this commodious vehicle they rolled comfortably downtown they measured the whole length of broadway again and found it a path of fire and then deflecting to the left they were deposited by their conductor before a fresh light ornamental structure ten stories high in a street crowded with keenfaced lightlimbed young men who were running about very quickly and stopping each other eagerly at corners and in doorways passing into this brilliant building they were introduced by one of the keenfaced young menhe was a charming fellow in wonderful creamcolored garments and a hat with a blue ribbon who had evidently perceived them to be aliens and helplessto a very snug hydraulic elevator in which they took their place with many other persons and which shooting upward in its vertical socket presently projected them into the seventh horizontal compartment of the edifice here after brief delay they found themselves face to face with the friend of their friend in london his office was composed of several different rooms and they waited very silently in one of them after they had sent in their letter and their cards the letter was not one which it would take mr westgate very long to read but he came out to speak to them more instantly than they could have expected he had evidently jumped up from his work he was a tall lean personage and was dressed all in fresh white linen he had a thin sharp familiar face with an expression that was at one and the same time sociable and businesslike a quick intelligent eye and a large brown mustache which concealed his mouth and made his chin beneath it look small lord lambeth thought he looked tremendously clever  how do you do lord lambethhow do you do sir he said holding the open letter in his hand im very glad to see you i hope youre very well you had better come in here i think its cooler and he led the way into another room where there were law books and papers and windows wide open beneath striped awning just opposite one of the windows on a line with his eyes lord lambeth observed the weathervane of a church steeple the uproar of the street sounded infinitely far below and lord lambeth felt very high in the air i say its cooler pursued their host but everything is relative how do you stand the heat  i cant say we like it said lord lambeth but beaumont likes it better than i  well it wont last mr westgate very cheerfully declared nothing unpleasant lasts over here it was very hot when captain littledale was here he did nothing but drink sherry cobblers he expressed some doubt in his letter whether i will remember himas if i didnt remember making six sherry cobblers for him one day in about twenty minutes i hope you left him well two years having elapsed since then  oh yes hes all right said lord lambeth  i am always very glad to see your countrymen mr westgate pursued i thought it would be time some of you should be coming along a friend of mine was saying to me only a day or two ago its time for the watermelons and the englishmen  the englishmen and the watermelons just now are about the same thing percy beaumont observed wiping his dripping forehead  ah well well put you on ice as we do the melons you must go down to newport  well go anywhere said lord lambeth  yes you want to go to newport thats what you want to do mr westgate affirmed but lets seewhen did you get here  only yesterday said percy beaumont  ah yes by the russia where are you staying  at the hanover i think they call it  pretty comfortable inquired mr westgate  it seems a capital place but i cant say we like the gnats said lord lambeth  mr westgate stared and laughed oh no of course you dont like the gnats we shall expect you to like a good many things over here but we shant insist upon your liking the gnats though certainly youll admit that as gnats they are fine eh but you oughtnt to remain in the city  so we think said lord lambeth if you would kindly suggest something  suggest something my dear sir and mr westgate looked at him narrowing his eyelids open your mouth and shut your eyes leave it to me and ill put you through its a matter of national pride with me that all englishmen should have a good time and as i have had considerable practice i have learned to minister to their wants i find they generally want the right thing so just please to consider yourselves my property and if anyone should try to appropriate you please to say hands off too late for the market but lets see continued the american in his slow humorous voice with a distinctness of utterance which appeared to his visitors to be part of a humorous intentiona strangely leisurely speculative voice for a man evidently so busy and as they felt so professionallets see are you going to make something of a stay lord lambeth  oh dear no said the young englishman my cousin was coming over on some business so i just came across at an hours notice for the lark  is it your first visit to the united states  oh dear yes  i was obliged to come on some business said percy beaumont and i brought lambeth along  and you have been here before sir  nevernever  i thought from your referring to business said mr westgate  oh you see im by way of being a barrister percy beaumont answered i know some people that think of bringing a suit against one of your railways and they asked me to come over and take measures accordingly  whats your railroad he asked  the tennessee central  the american tilted back his chair a little and poised it an instant well im sorry you want to attack one of our institutions he said smiling but i guess you had better enjoy yourself first  im certainly rather afraid i cant work in this weather the young barrister confessed  leave that to the natives said mr westgate leave the tennessee central to me mr beaumont some day well talk it over and i guess i can make it square but i didnt know you englishmen ever did any work in the upper classes  oh we do a lot of work dont we lambeth asked percy beaumont  i must certainly be at home by the 19th of september said the younger englishman irrelevantly but gently  for the shooting eh or is it the hunting or the fishing inquired his entertainer  oh i must be in scotland said lord lambeth blushing a little  well then rejoined mr westgate you had better amuse yourself first also you must go down and see mrs westgate  we should be so happy if you would kindly tell us the train said percy beaumont  it isnt a trainits a boat  oh i see and what is the name ofatheatown  it isnt a town said mr westgate laughing its awell what shall i call it its a watering place in short its newport youll see what it is its cool thats the principal thing you will greatly oblige me by going down there and putting yourself into the hands of mrs westgate it isnt perhaps for me to say it but you couldnt be in better hands also in those of her sister who is staying with her she is very fond of englishmen she thinks there is nothing like them  mrs westgate oraher sister asked percy beaumont modestly yet in the tone of an inquiring traveler  oh i mean my wife said mr westgate i dont suppose my sisterinlaw knows much about them she has always led a very quiet life she has lived in boston  percy beaumont listened with interest that i believe he said is the mostaintellectual town  i believe it is very intellectual i dont go there much responded his host  i say we ought to go there said lord lambeth to his companion  oh lord lambeth wait till the great heat is over mr westgate interposed boston in this weather would be very trying its not the temperature for intellectual exertion at boston you know you have to pass an examination at the city limits and when you come away they give you a kind of degree  lord lambeth stared blushing a little and percy beaumont stared a little alsobut only with his fine natural complexionglancing aside after a moment to see that his companion was not looking too credulous for he had heard a great deal of american humor i daresay it is very jolly said the younger gentleman  i daresay it is said mr westgate only i must impress upon you that at presenttomorrow morning at an early houryou will be expected at newport we have a house there half the people in new york go there for the summer i am not sure that at this very moment my wife can take you in she has got a lot of people staying with her i dont know who they all are only she may have no room but you can begin with the hotel and meanwhile you can live at my house in that waysimply sleeping at the hotelyou will find it tolerable for the rest you must make yourself at home at my place you mustnt be shy you know if you are only here for a month that will be a great waste of time mrs westgate wont neglect you and you had better not try to resist her i know something about that i expect youll find some pretty girls on the premises i shall write to my wife by this afternoons mail and tomorrow morning she and miss alden will look out for you just walk right in and make yourself comfortable your steamer leaves from this part of the city and i will immediately send out and get you a cabin then at half past four oclock just call for me here and i will go with you and put you on board its a big boat you might get lost a few days hence at the end of the week i will come down to newport and see how you are getting on  the two young englishmen inaugurated the policy of not resisting mrs westgate by submitting with great docility and thankfulness to her husband he was evidently a very good fellow and he made an impression upon his visitors his hospitality seemed to recommend itself consciouslywith a friendly wink as it wereas if it hinted judicially that you could not possibly make a better bargain lord lambeth and his cousin left their entertainer to his labors and returned to their hotel where they spent three or four hours in their respective shower baths percy beaumont had suggested that they ought to see something of the town but oh damn the town his noble kinsman had rejoined they returned to mr westgates office in a carriage with their luggage very punctually but it must be reluctantly recorded that this time he kept them waiting so long that they felt themselves missing the steamer and were deterred only by an amiable modesty from dispensing with his attendance and starting on a hasty scramble to the wharf but when at last he appeared and the carriage plunged into the purlieus of broadway they jolted and jostled to such good purpose that they reached the huge white vessel while the bell for departure was still ringing and the absorption of passengers still active it was indeed as mr westgate had said a big boat and his leadership in the innumerable and interminable corridors and cabins with which he seemed perfectly acquainted and of which anyone and everyone appeared to have the entree was very grateful to the slightly bewildered voyagers he showed them their staterooma spacious apartment embellished with gas lamps mirrors en pied and sculptured furnitureand then long after they had been intimately convinced that the steamer was in motion and launched upon the unknown stream that they were about to navigate he bade them a sociable farewell  well goodbye lord lambeth he said goodbye mr percy beaumont i hope youll have a good time just let them do what they want with you ill come down byandby and look after you  the young englishmen emerged from their cabin and amused themselves with wandering about the immense labyrinthine steamer which struck them as an extraordinary mixture of a ship and a hotel it was densely crowded with passengers the larger number of whom appeared to be ladies and very young children and in the big saloons ornamented in white and gold which followed each other in surprising succession beneath the swinging gaslight and among the small side passages where the negro domestics of both sexes assembled with an air of philosophic leisure everyone was moving to and fro and exchanging loud and familiar observations eventually at the instance of a discriminating black our young men went and had some supper in a wonderful place arranged like a theater where in a gilded gallery upon which little boxes appeared to open a large orchestra was playing operatic selections and below people were handing about bills of fare as if they had been programs all this was sufficiently curious but the agreeable thing later was to sit out on one of the great white decks of the steamer in the warm breezy darkness and in the vague starlight to make out the line of low mysterious coast the young englishmen tried american cigarsthose of mr westgateand talked together as they usually talked with many odd silences lapses of logic and incongruities of transition like people who have grown old together and learned to supply each others missing phrases or more especially like people thoroughly conscious of a common point of view so that a style of conversation superficially lacking in finish might suffice for reference to a fund of associations in the light of which everything was all right  we really seem to be going out to sea percy beaumont observed upon my word we are going back to england he has shipped us off again i call that real mean  i suppose its all right said lord lambeth i want to see those pretty girls at newport you know he told us the place was an island and arent all islands in the sea  well resumed the elder traveler after a while if his house is as good as his cigars we shall do very well  he seems a very good fellow said lord lambeth as if this idea had just occurred to him  i say we had better remain at the inn rejoined his companion presently i dont think i like the way he spoke of his house i dont like stopping in the house with such a tremendous lot of women  oh i dont mind said lord lambeth and then they smoked a while in silence fancy his thinking we do no work in england the young man resumed  i daresay he didnt really think so said percy beaumont  well i guess they dont know much about england over here declared lord lambeth humorously and then there was another long pause he was devilish civil observed the young nobleman  nothing certainly could have been more civil rejoined his companion  littledale said his wife was great fun said lord lambeth  whose wifelittledales  this americansmrs westgate whats his name jl  beaumont was silent a moment what was fun to littledale he said at last rather sententiously may be death to us  what do you mean by that asked his kinsman i am as good a man as littledale  my dear boy i hope you wont begin to flirt said percy beaumont  i dont care i daresay i shant begin  with a married woman if shes bent upon it its all very well beaumont expounded but our friend mentioned a young ladya sister a sisterinlaw for gods sake dont get entangled with her  how do you mean entangled  depend upon it she will try to hook you  oh bother said lord lambeth  american girls are very clever urged his companion  so much the better the young man declared  i fancy they are always up to some game of that sort beaumont continued  they cant be worse than they are in england said lord lambeth judicially  ah but in england replied beaumont you have got your natural protectors you have got your mother and sisters  my mother and sisters began the young nobleman with a certain energy but he stopped in time puffing at his cigar  your mother spoke to me about it with tears in her eyes said percy beaumont she said she felt very nervous i promised to keep you out of mischief  you had better take care of yourself said the object of maternal and ducal solicitude  ah rejoined the young barrister i havent the expectation of a hundred thousand a year not to mention other attractions  well said lord lambeth dont cry out before youre hurt  it was certainly very much cooler at newport where our travelers found themselves assigned to a couple of diminutive bedrooms in a faraway angle of an immense hotel they had gone ashore in the early summer twilight and had very promptly put themselves to bed thanks to which circumstance and to their having during the previous hours in their commodious cabin slept the sleep of youth and health they began to feel toward eleven oclock very alert and inquisitive they looked out of their windows across a row of small green fields bordered with low stone walls of rude construction and saw a deep blue ocean lying beneath a deep blue sky and flecked now and then with scintillating patches of foam a strong fresh breeze came in through the curtainless casements and prompted our young men to observe generally that it didnt seem half a bad climate they made other observations after they had emerged from their rooms in pursuit of breakfasta meal of which they partook in a huge bare hall where a hundred negroes in white jackets were shuffling about upon an uncarpeted floor where the flies were superabundant and the tables and dishes covered over with a strange voluminous integument of coarse blue gauze and where several little boys and girls who had risen late were seated in fastidious solitude at the morning repast these young persons had not the morning paper before them but they were engaged in languid perusal of the bill of fare  this latter document was a great puzzle to our friends who on reflecting that its bewildering categories had relation to breakfast alone had an uneasy prevision of an encyclopedic dinner list they found a great deal of entertainment at the hotel an enormous wooden structure for the erection of which it seemed to them that the virgin forests of the west must have been terribly deflowered it was perforated from end to end with immense bare corridors through which a strong draught was blowingbearing along wonderful figures of ladies in white morning dresses and clouds of valenciennes lace who seemed to float down the long vistas with expanded furbelows like angels spreading their wings in front was a gigantic veranda upon which an army might have encampeda vast wooden terrace with a roof as lofty as the nave of a cathedral here our young englishmen enjoyed as they supposed a glimpse of american society which was distributed over the measureless expanse in a variety of sedentary attitudes and appeared to consist largely of pretty young girls dressed as if for a fete champetre swaying to and fro in rocking chairs fanning themselves with large straw fans and enjoying an enviable exemption from social cares lord lambeth had a theory which it might be interesting to trace to its origin that it would be not only agreeable but easily possible to enter into relations with one of these young ladies and his companion as he had done a couple of days before found occasion to check the young noblemans colloquial impulses  you had better take care said percy beaumont or you will have an offended father or brother pulling out a bowie knife  i assure you it is all right lord lambeth replied you know the americans come to these big hotels to make acquaintances  i know nothing about it and neither do you said his kinsman who like a clever man had begun to perceive that the observation of american society demanded a readjustment of ones standard  hang it then lets find out cried lord lambeth with some impatience you know i dont want to miss anything  we will find out said percy beaumont very reasonably we will go and see mrs westgate and make all proper inquiries  and so the two inquiring englishmen who had this ladys address inscribed in her husbands hand upon a card descended from the veranda of the big hotel and took their way according to direction along a large straight road past a series of freshlooking villas embosomed in shrubs and flowers and enclosed in an ingenious variety of wooden palings the morning was brilliant and cool the villas were smart and snug and the walk of the young travelers was very entertaining everything looked as if it had received a coat of fresh paint the day beforethe red roofs the green shutters the clean bright browns and buffs of the housefronts the flower beds on the little lawns seemed to sparkle in the radiant air and the gravel in the short carriage sweeps to flash and twinkle along the road came a hundred little basket phaetons in which almost always a couple of ladies were sittingladies in white dresses and long white gloves holding the reins and looking at the two englishmen whose nationality was not elusive through thick blue veils tied tightly about their faces as if to guard their complexions at last the young men came within sight of the sea again and then having interrogated a gardener over the paling of a villa they turned into an open gate here they found themselves face to face with the ocean and with a very picturesque structure resembling a magnified chalet which was perched upon a green embankment just above it the house had a veranda of extraordinary width all around it and a great many doors and windows standing open to the veranda these various apertures had in common such an accessible hospitable air such a breezy flutter within of light curtains such expansive thresholds and reassuring interiors that our friends hardly knew which was the regular entrance and after hesitating a moment presented themselves at one of the windows the room within was dark but in a moment a graceful figure vaguely shaped itself in the richlooking gloom and a lady came to meet them then they saw that she had been seated at a table writing and that she had heard them and had got up she stepped out into the light she wore a frank charming smile with which she held out her hand to percy beaumont  oh you must be lord lambeth and mr beaumont she said i have heard from my husband that you would come i am extremely glad to see you and she shook hands with each of her visitors her visitors were a little shy but they had very good manners they responded with smiles and exclamations and they apologized for not knowing the front door the lady rejoined with vivacity that when she wanted to see people very much she did not insist upon those distinctions and that mr westgate had written to her of his english friends in terms that made her really anxious he said you were so terribly prostrated said mrs westgate  oh you mean by the heat replied percy beaumont we were rather knocked up but we feel wonderfully better we had such a jollyavoyage down here its so very good of you to mind  yes its so very kind of you murmured lord lambeth  mrs westgate stood smiling she was extremely pretty well i did mind she said and i thought of sending for you this morning to the ocean house i am very glad you are better and i am charmed you have arrived you must come round to the other side of the piazza and she led the way with a light smooth step looking back at the young men and smiling  the other side of the piazza was as lord lambeth presently remarked a very jolly place it was of the most liberal proportions and with its awnings its fanciful chairs its cushions and rugs its view of the ocean close at hand tumbling along the base of the low cliffs whose level tops intervened in lawnlike smoothness it formed a charming complement to the drawing room as such it was in course of use at the present moment it was occupied by a social circle there were several ladies and two or three gentlemen to whom mrs westgate proceeded to introduce the distinguished strangers she mentioned a great many names very freely and distinctly the young englishmen shuffling about and bowing were rather bewildered but at last they were provided with chairslow wicker chairs gilded and tied with a great many ribbonsand one of the ladies a very young person with a little snub nose and several dimples offered percy beaumont a fan the fan was also adorned with pink love knots but percy beaumont declined it although he was very hot presently however it became cooler the breeze from the sea was delicious the view was charming and the people sitting there looked exceedingly fresh and comfortable several of the ladies seemed to be young girls and the gentlemen were slim fair youths such as our friends had seen the day before in new york the ladies were working upon bands of tapestry and one of the young men had an open book in his lap beaumont afterward learned from one of the ladies that this young man had been reading aloud that he was from boston and was very fond of reading aloud beaumont said it was a great pity that they had interrupted him he should like so much from all he had heard to hear a bostonian read couldnt the young man be induced to go on  oh no said his informant very freely he wouldnt be able to get the young ladies to attend to him now  there was something very friendly beaumont perceived in the attitude of the company they looked at the young englishmen with an air of animated sympathy and interest they smiled brightly and unanimously at everything either of the visitors said lord lambeth and his companion felt that they were being made very welcome mrs westgate seated herself between them and talking a great deal to each they had occasion to observe that she was as pretty as their friend littledale had promised she was thirty years old with the eyes and the smile of a girl of seventeen and she was extremely light and graceful elegant exquisite mrs westgate was extremely spontaneous she was very frank and demonstrative and appeared alwayswhile she looked at you delightedly with her beautiful young eyesto be making sudden confessions and concessions after momentary hesitations  we shall expect to see a great deal of you she said to lord lambeth with a kind of joyous earnestness we are very fond of englishmen here that is there are a great many we have been fond of after a day or two you must come and stay with us we hope you will stay a long time newports a very nice place when you come really to know it when you know plenty of people of course you and mr beaumont will have no difficulty about that englishmen are very well received here there are almost always two or three of them about i think they always like it and i must say i should think they would they receive ever so much attention i must say i think they sometimes get spoiled but i am sure you and mr beaumont are proof against that my husband tells me you are a friend of captain littledale he was such a charming man he made himself most agreeable here and i am sure i wonder he didnt stay it couldnt have been pleasanter for him in his own country though i suppose it is very pleasant in england for english people i dont know myself i have been there very little i have been a great deal abroad but i am always on the continent i must say im extremely fond of paris you know we americans always are we go there when we die did you ever hear that before that was said by a great wit i mean the good americans but we are all good youll see that for yourself all i know of england is london and all i know of london is that place on that little corner you know where you buy jacketsjackets with that coarse braid and those big buttons they make very good jackets in london i will do you the justice to say that and some people like the hats but about the hats i was always a heretic i always got my hats in paris you cant wear an english hatat least i never couldunless you dress your hair a langlaise and i must say that is a talent i have never possessed in paris they will make things to suit your peculiarities but in england i think you like much more to havehow shall i say itone thing for everybody i mean as regards dress i dont know about other things but i have always supposed that in other things everything was different i mean according to the peopleaccording to the classes and all that i am afraid you will think that i dont take a very favorable view but you know you cant take a very favorable view in dover street in the month of november that has always been my fate do you know joness hotel in dover street thats all i know of england of course everyone admits that the english hotels are your weak point there was always the most frightful fog i couldnt see to try my things on when i got over to americainto the lighti usually found they were twice too big the next time i mean to go in the season i think i shall go next year i want very much to take my sister she has never been to england i dont know whether you know what i mean by saying that the englishmen who come here sometimes get spoiled i mean that they take things as a matter of coursethings that are done for them now naturally they are only a matter of course when the englishmen are very nice but of course they are almost always very nice of course this isnt nearly such an interesting country as england there are not nearly so many things to see and we havent your country life i have never seen anything of your country life when i am in europe i am always on the continent but i have heard a great deal about it i know that when you are among yourselves in the country you have the most beautiful time of course we have nothing of that sort we have nothing on that scale i dont apologize lord lambeth some americans are always apologizing you must have noticed that we have the reputation of always boasting and bragging and waving the american flag but i must say that what strikes me is that we are perpetually making excuses and trying to smooth things over the american flag has quite gone out of fashion its very carefully folded up like an old tablecloth why should we apologize the english never apologizedo they no i must say i never apologize you must take us as we comewith all our imperfections on our heads of course we havent your country life and your old ruins and your great estates and your leisure class and all that but if we havent i should think you might find it a pleasant changei think any country is pleasant where they have pleasant manners captain littledale told me he had never seen such pleasant manners as at newport and he had been a great deal in european society hadnt he been in the diplomatic service he told me the dream of his life was to get appointed to a diplomatic post in washington but he doesnt seem to have succeeded i suppose that in england promotionand all that sort of thingis fearfully slow with us you know its a great deal too fast you see i admit our drawbacks but i must confess i think newport is an ideal place i dont know anything like it anywhere captain littledale told me he didnt know anything like it anywhere its entirely different from most watering places its a most charming life i must say i think that when one goes to a foreign country one ought to enjoy the differences of course there are differences otherwise what did one come abroad for look for your pleasure in the differences lord lambeth thats the way to do it and then i am sure you will find american societyat least newport societymost charming and most interesting i wish very much my husband were here but hes dreadfully confined to new york i suppose you think that is very strangefor a gentleman but you see we havent any leisure class  mrs westgates discourse delivered in a soft sweet voice flowed on like a miniature torrent and was interrupted by a hundred little smiles glances and gestures which might have figured the irregularities and obstructions of such a stream lord lambeth listened to her with it must be confessed a rather ineffectual attention although he indulged in a good many little murmurs and ejaculations of assent and deprecation he had no great faculty for apprehending generalizations there were some three or four indeed which in the play of his own intelligence he had originated and which had seemed convenient at the moment but at the present time he could hardly have been said to follow mrs westgate as she darted gracefully about in the sea of speculation fortunately she asked for no especial rejoinder for she looked about at the rest of the company as well and smiled at percy beaumont on the other side of her as if he too much understand her and agree with her he was rather more successful than his companion for besides being as we know cleverer his attention was not vaguely distracted by close vicinity to a remarkably interesting young girl with dark hair and blue eyes this was the case with lord lambeth to whom it occurred after a while that the young girl with blue eyes and dark hair was the pretty sister of whom mrs westgate had spoken she presently turned to him with a remark which established her identity  its a great pity you couldnt have brought my brotherinlaw with you its a great shame he should be in new york in these days  oh yes its so very hot said lord lambeth  it must be dreadful said the young girl  i daresay he is very busy lord lambeth observed  the gentlemen in america work too much the young girl went on  oh do they i daresay they like it said her interlocutor  i dont like it one never sees them  dont you really asked lord lambeth i shouldnt have fancied that  have you come to study american manners asked the young girl  oh i dont know i just came over for a lark i havent got long here there was a pause and lord lambeth began again but mr westgate will come down here will not he  i certainly hope he will he must help to entertain you and mr beaumont  lord lambeth looked at her a little with his handsome brown eyes do you suppose he would have come down with us if we had urged him  mr westgates sisterinlaw was silent a moment and then i daresay he would she answered  really said the young englishman he was immensely civil to beaumont and me he added  he is a dear good fellow the young lady rejoined and he is a perfect husband but all americans are that she continued smiling  really lord lambeth exclaimed again and wondered whether all american ladies had such a passion for generalizing as these two  he sat there a good while there was a great deal of talk it was all very friendly and lively and jolly everyone present sooner or later said something to him and seemed to make a particular point of addressing him by name two or three other persons came in and there was a shifting of seats and changing of places the gentlemen all entered into intimate conversation with the two englishmen made them urgent offers of hospitality and hoped they might frequently be of service to them they were afraid lord lambeth and mr beaumont were not very comfortable at their hotel that it was not as one of them said so private as those dear little english inns of yours this last gentleman went on to say that unfortunately as yet perhaps privacy was not quite so easily obtained in america as might be desired still he continued you could generally get it by paying for it in fact you could get everything in america nowadays by paying for it american life was certainly growing a great deal more private it was growing very much like england everything at newport for instance was thoroughly private lord lambeth would probably be struck with that it was also represented to the strangers that it mattered very little whether their hotel was agreeable as everyone would want them to make visits they would stay with other people and in any case they would be a great deal at mrs westgates they would find that very charming it was the pleasantest house in newport it was a pity mr westgate was always away he was a man of the highest abilityvery acute very acute he worked like a horse and he left his wifewell to do about as she liked he liked her to enjoy herself and she seemed to know how she was extremely brilliant and a splendid talker some people preferred her sister but miss alden was very different she was in a different style altogether some people even thought her prettier and certainly she was not so sharp she was more in the boston style she had lived a great deal in boston and she was very highly educated boston girls it was propounded were more like english young ladies  lord lambeth had presently a chance to test the truth of this proposition for on the company rising in compliance with a suggestion from their hostess that they should walk down to the rocks and look at the sea the young englishman again found himself as they strolled across the grass in proximity to mrs westgates sister though she was but a girl of twenty she appeared to feel the obligation to exert an active hospitality and this was perhaps the more to be noticed as she seemed by nature a reserved and retiring person and had little of her sisters fraternizing quality she was perhaps rather too thin and she was a little pale but as she moved slowly over the grass with her arms hanging at her sides looking gravely for a moment at the sea and then brightly for all her gravity at him lord lambeth thought her at least as pretty as mrs westgate and reflected that if this was the boston style the boston style was very charming he thought she looked very clever he could imagine that she was highly educated but at the same time she seemed gentle and graceful for all her cleverness however he felt that she had to think a little what to say she didnt say the first thing that came into her head he had come from a different part of the world and from a different society and she was trying to adapt her conversation the others were scattering themselves near the rocks mrs westgate had charge of percy beaumont  very jolly place isnt it said lord lambeth its a very jolly place to sit  very charming said the young girl i often sit here there are all kinds of cozy cornersas if they had been made on purpose  ah i suppose you have had some of them made said the young man  miss alden looked at him a moment oh no we have had nothing made its pure nature  i should think you would have a few little benchesrustic seats and that sort of thing it might be so jolly to sit here you know lord lambeth went on  i am afraid we havent so many of those things as you said the young girl thoughtfully  i daresay you go in for pure nature as you were saying nature over here must be so grand you know and lord lambeth looked about him  the little coast line hereabouts was very pretty but it was not at all grand and miss alden appeared to rise to a perception of this fact i am afraid it seems to you very rough she said its not like the coast scenery in kingsleys novels  ah the novels always overdo it you know lord lambeth rejoined you must not go by the novels  they were wandering about a little on the rocks and they stopped and looked down into a narrow chasm where the rising tide made a curious bellowing sound it was loud enough to prevent their hearing each other and they stood there for some moments in silence the young girl looked at her companion observing him attentively but covertly as women even when very young know how to do lord lambeth repaid observation tall straight and strong he was handsome as certain young englishmen and certain young englishmen almost alone are handsome with a perfect finish of feature and a look of intellectual repose and gentle good temper which seemed somehow to be consequent upon his wellcut nose and chin and to speak of lord lambeths expression of intellectual repose is not simply a civil way of saying that he looked stupid he was evidently not a young man of an irritable imagination he was not as he would himself have said tremendously clever but though there was a kind of appealing dullness in his eye he looked thoroughly reasonable and competent and his appearance proclaimed that to be a nobleman an athlete and an excellent fellow was a sufficiently brilliant combination of qualities the young girl beside him it may be attested without further delay thought him the handsomest young man she had ever seen and bessie aldens imagination unlike that of her companion was irritable he however was also making up his mind that she was uncommonly pretty  i daresay its very gay here that you have lots of balls and parties he said for if he was not tremendously clever he rather prided himself on having with women a sufficiency of conversation  oh yes there is a great deal going on bessie alden replied there are not so many balls but there are a good many other things you will see for yourself we live rather in the midst of it  its very kind of you to say that but i thought you americans were always dancing  i suppose we dance a good deal but i have never seen much of it we dont do it much at any rate in summer and i am sure said bessie alden that we dont have so many balls as you have in england  really exclaimed lord lambeth ah in england it all depends you know  you will not think much of our gaieties said the young girl looking at him with a little mixture of interrogation and decision which was peculiar to her the interrogation seemed earnest and the decision seemed arch but the mixture at any rate was charming those things with us are much less splendid than in england  i fancy you dont mean that said lord lambeth laughing  i assure you i mean everything i say the young girl declared certainly from what i have read about english society it is very different  ah well you know said her companion those things are often described by fellows who know nothing about them you mustnt mind what you read  oh i shall mind what i read bessie alden rejoined when i read thackeray and george eliot how can i help minding them  ah well thackeray and george eliot said the young nobleman i havent read much of them  dont you suppose they know about society asked bessie alden  oh i daresay they know they were so very clever but these fashionable novels said lord lambeth they are awful rot you know  his companion looked at him a moment with her dark blue eyes and then she looked down in the chasm where the water was tumbling about do you mean mrs gore for instance she said presently raising her eyes  i am afraid i havent read that either was the young mans rejoinder laughing a little and blushing i am afraid youll think i am not very intellectual  reading mrs gore is no proof of intellect but i like reading everything about english lifeeven poor books i am so curious about it  arent ladies always curious asked the young man jestingly  but bessie alden appeared to desire to answer his question seriously i dont think soi dont think we are enough sothat we care about many things so its all the more of a compliment she added that i should want to know so much about england  the logic here seemed a little close but lord lambeth made conscious of a compliment found his natural modesty just at hand i am sure you know a great deal more than i do  i really think i know a great dealfor a person who has never been there  have you really never been there cried lord lambeth fancy  neverexcept in imagination said the young girl  fancy repeated her companion but i daresay youll go soon wont you  its the dream of my life declared bessie alden smiling  but your sister seems to know a tremendous lot about london lord lambeth went on  the young girl was silent a moment my sister and i are two very different persons she presently said she has been a great deal in europe she has been in england several times she has known a great many english people  but you must have known some too said lord lambeth  i dont think that i have ever spoken to one before you are the first englishman thatto my knowledgei have ever talked with  bessie alden made this statement with a certain gravityalmost as it seemed to lord lambeth an impressiveness attempts at impressiveness always made him feel awkward and he now began to laugh and swing his stick ah you would have been sure to know he said and then he added after an instant im sorry i am not a better specimen  the young girl looked away but she smiled laying aside her impressiveness you must remember that you are only a beginning she said then she retraced her steps leading the way back to the lawn where they saw mrs westgate come toward them with percy beaumont still at her side perhaps i shall go to england next year miss alden continued i want to immensely my sister is going to europe and she has asked me to go with her if we go i shall make her stay as long as possible in london  ah you must come in july said lord lambeth thats the time when there is most going on  i dont think i can wait till july the young girl rejoined by the first of may i shall be very impatient they had gone further and mrs westgate and her companion were near them kitty said miss alden i have given out that we are going to london next may so please to conduct yourself accordingly  percy beaumont wore a somewhat animatedeven a slightly irritatedair he was by no means so handsome a man as his cousin although in his cousins absence he might have passed for a striking specimen of the tall muscular fairbearded cleareyed englishman just now beaumonts clear eyes which were small and of a pale gray color had a rather troubled light and after glancing at bessie alden while she spoke he rested them upon his kinsman mrs westgate meanwhile with her superfluously pretty gaze looked at everyone alike  you had better wait till the time comes she said to her sister perhaps next may you wont care so much about london mr beaumont and i she went on smiling at her companion have had a tremendous discussion we dont agree about anything its perfectly delightful  oh i say percy exclaimed lord lambeth  i disagree said beaumont stroking down his back hair even to the point of not thinking it delightful  oh i say cried lord lambeth again  i dont see anything delightful in my disagreeing with mrs westgate said percy beaumont  well i do mrs westgate declared and she turned to her sister you know you have to go to town the phaeton is there you had better take lord lambeth  at this point percy beaumont certainly looked straight at his kinsman he tried to catch his eye but lord lambeth would not look at him his own eyes were better occupied i shall be very happy cried bessie alden i am only going to some shops but i will drive you about and show you the place  an american woman who respects herself said mrs westgate turning to beaumont with her bright expository air must buy something every day of her life if she can not do it herself she must send out some member of her family for the purpose so bessie goes forth to fulfill my mission  the young girl had walked away with lord lambeth by her side to whom she was talking still and percy beaumont watched them as they passed toward the house she fulfills her own mission he presently said that of being a very attractive young lady  i dont know that i should say very attractive mrs westgate rejoined she is not so much that as she is charming when you really know her she is very shy  oh indeed said percy beaumont  extremely shy mrs westgate repeated but she is a dear good girl she is a charming species of girl she is not in the least a flirt that isnt at all her line she doesnt know the alphabet of that sort of thing she is very simple very serious she has lived a great deal in boston with another sister of minethe eldest of uswho married a bostonian she is very cultivated not at all like me i am not in the least cultivated she has studied immensely and read everything she is what they call in boston thoughtful  a rum sort of girl for lambeth to get hold of his lordships kinsman privately reflected  i really believe mrs westgate continued that the most charming girl in the world is a boston superstructure upon a new york fonds or perhaps a new york superstructure upon a boston fonds at any rate its the mixture said mrs westgate who continued to give percy beaumont a great deal of information  lord lambeth got into a little basket phaeton with bessie alden and she drove him down the long avenue whose extent he had measured on foot a couple of hours before into the ancient town as it was called in that part of the world of newport the ancient town was a curious affaira collection of freshlooking little wooden houses painted white scattered over a hillside and clustered about a long straight street paved with enormous cobblestones there were plenty of shopsa large proportion of which appeared to be those of fruit vendors with piles of huge watermelons and pumpkins stacked in front of them and drawn up before the shops or bumping about on the cobblestones were innumerable other basket phaetons freighted with ladies of high fashion who greeted each other from vehicle to vehicle and conversed on the edge of the pavement in a manner that struck lord lambeth as demonstrative with a great many oh my dears and little quick exclamations and caresses his companion went into seventeen shopshe amused himself with counting themand accumulated at the bottom of the phaeton a pile of bundles that hardly left the young englishman a place for his feet as she had no groom nor footman he sat in the phaeton to hold the ponies where although he was not a particularly acute observer he saw much to entertain himespecially the ladies just mentioned who wandered up and down with the appearance of a kind of aimless intentness as if they were looking for something to buy and who tripping in and out of their vehicles displayed remarkably pretty feet it all seemed to lord lambeth very odd and bright and gay of course before they got back to the villa he had had a great deal of desultory conversation with bessie alden  the young englishmen spent the whole of that day and the whole of many successive days in what the french call the intimite of their new friends they agreed that it was extremely jolly that they had never known anything more agreeable it is not proposed to narrate minutely the incidents of their sojourn on this charming shore though if it were convenient i might present a record of impressions nonetheless delectable that they were not exhaustively analyzed many of them still linger in the minds of our travelers attended by a train of harmonious imagesimages of brilliant mornings on lawns and piazzas that overlooked the sea of innumerable pretty girls of infinite lounging and talking and laughing and flirting and lunching and dining of universal friendliness and frankness of occasions on which they knew everyone and everything and had an extraordinary sense of ease of drives and rides in the late afternoon over gleaming beaches on long sea roads beneath a sky lighted up by marvelous sunsets of suppers on the return informal irregular agreeable of evenings at open windows or on the perpetual verandas in the summer starlight above the warm atlantic the young englishmen were introduced to everybody entertained by everybody intimate with everybody at the end of three days they had removed their luggage from the hotel and had gone to stay with mrs westgatea step to which percy beaumont at first offered some conscientious opposition i call his opposition conscientious because it was founded upon some talk that he had had on the second day with bessie alden he had indeed had a good deal of talk with her for she was not literally always in conversation with lord lambeth he had meditated upon mrs westgates account of her sister and he discovered for himself that the young lady was clever and appeared to have read a great deal she seemed very nice though he could not make out as mrs westgate had said she was shy if she was shy she carried it off very well  mr beaumont she had said please tell me something about lord lambeths family how would you say it in englandhis position  his position percy beaumont repeated  his rank or whatever you call it unfortunately we havent got a peerage like the people in thackeray  thats a great pity said beaumont you would find it all set forth there so much better than i can do it  he is a peer then  oh yes he is a peer  and has he any other title than lord lambeth  his title is the marquis of lambeth said beaumont and then he was silent bessie alden appeared to be looking at him with interest he is the son of the duke of bayswater he added presently  the eldest son  the only son  and are his parents living  oh yes if his father were not living he would be a duke  so that when his father dies pursued bessie alden with more simplicity than might have been expected in a clever girl he will become duke of bayswater  of course said percy beaumont but his father is in excellent health  and his mother  beaumont smiled a little the duchess is uncommonly robust  and has he any sisters  yes there are two  and what are they called  one of them is married she is the countess of pimlico  and the other  the other is unmarried she is plain lady julia  bessie alden looked at him a moment is she very plain  beaumont began to laugh again you would not find her so handsome as her brother he said and it was after this that he attempted to dissuade the heir of the duke of bayswater from accepting mrs westgates invitation depend upon it he said that girl means to try for you  it seems to me you are doing your best to make a fool of me the modest young nobleman answered  she has been asking me said beaumont all about your people and your possessions  i am sure it is very good of her lord lambeth rejoined  well then observed his companion if you go you go with your eyes open  damn my eyes exclaimed lord lambeth if one is to be a dozen times a day at the house it is a great deal more convenient to sleep there i am sick of traveling up and down this beastly avenue  since he had determined to go percy beaumont would of course have been very sorry to allow him to go alone he was a man of conscience and he remembered his promise to the duchess it was obviously the memory of this promise that made him say to his companion a couple of days later that he rather wondered he should be so fond of that girl  in the first place how do you know how fond i am of her asked lord lambeth and in the second place why shouldnt i be fond of her  i shouldnt think she would be in your line  what do you call my line you dont set her down as fast  exactly so mrs westgate tells me that there is no such thing as the fast girl in america that its an english invention and that the term has no meaning here  all the better its an animal i detest  you prefer a bluestocking  is that what you call miss alden  her sister tells me said percy beaumont that she is tremendously literary  i dont know anything about that she is certainly very clever  well said beaumont i should have supposed you would have found that sort of thing awfully slow  in point of fact lord lambeth rejoined i find it uncommonly lively  after this percy beaumont held his tongue but on the 10th of august he wrote to the duchess of bayswater he was as i have said a man of conscience and he had a strong incorruptible sense of the proprieties of life his kinsman meanwhile was having a great deal of talk with bessie aldenon the red sea rocks beyond the lawn in the course of long island rides with a slow return in the glowing twilight on the deep veranda late in the evening lord lambeth who had stayed at many houses had never stayed at a house in which it was possible for a young man to converse so frequently with a young lady this young lady no longer applied to percy beaumont for information concerning his lordship she addressed herself directly to the young nobleman she asked him a great many questions some of which bored him a little for he took no pleasure in talking about himself  lord lambeth said bessie alden are you a hereditary legislator  oh i say cried lord lambeth dont make me call myself such names as that  but you are a member of parliament said the young girl  i dont like the sound of that either  dont you sit in the house of lords bessie alden went on  very seldom said lord lambeth  is it an important position she asked  oh dear no said lord lambeth  i should think it would be very grand said bessie alden to possess simply by an accident of birth the right to make laws for a great nation  ah but one doesnt make laws its a great humbug  i dont believe that the young girl declared it must be a great privilege and i should think that if one thought of it in the right wayfrom a high point of viewit would be very inspiring  the less one thinks of it the better lord lambeth affirmed  i think its tremendous said bessie alden and on another occasion she asked him if he had any tenantry hereupon it was that as i have said he was a little bored  do you want to buy up their leases he asked  well have you got any livings she demanded  oh i say he cried have you got a clergyman that is looking out but she made him tell her that he had a castle he confessed to but one it was the place in which he had been born and brought up and as he had an oldtime liking for it he was beguiled into describing it a little and saying it was really very jolly bessie alden listened with great interest and declared that she would give the world to see such a place whereuponit would be awfully kind of you to come and stay there said lord lambeth he took a vague satisfaction in the circumstance that percy beaumont had not heard him make the remark i have just recorded  mr westgate all this time had not as they said at newport come on his wife more than once announced that she expected him on the morrow but on the morrow she wandered about a little with a telegram in her jeweled fingers declaring it was very tiresome that his business detained him in new york that he could only hope the englishmen were having a good time i must say said mrs westgate that it is no thanks to him if you are and she went on to explain while she continued that slowpaced promenade which enabled her welladjusted skirts to display themselves so advantageously that unfortunately in america there was no leisure class it was lord lambeths theory freely propounded when the young men were together that percy beaumont was having a very good time with mrs westgate and that under the pretext of meeting for the purpose of animated discussion they were indulging in practices that imparted a shade of hypocrisy to the ladys regret for her husbands absence  i assure you we are always discussing and differing said percy beaumont she is awfully argumentative american ladies certainly dont mind contradicting you upon my word i dont think i was ever treated so by a woman before shes so devilish positive  mrs westgates positive quality however evidently had its attractions for beaumont was constantly at his hostesss side he detached himself one day to the extent of going to new york to talk over the tennessee central with mr westgate but he was absent only fortyeight hours during which with mr westgates assistance he completely settled this piece of business they certainly do things quickly in new york he observed to his cousin and he added that mr westgate had seemed very uneasy lest his wife should miss her visitorhe had been in such an awful hurry to send him back to her im afraid youll never come up to an american husband if thats what the wives expect he said to lord lambeth  mrs westgate however was not to enjoy much longer the entertainment with which an indulgent husband had desired to keep her provided on the 21st of august lord lambeth received a telegram from his mother requesting him to return immediately to england his father had been taken ill and it was his filial duty to come to him  the young englishman was visibly annoyed what the deuce does it mean he asked of his kinsman what am i to do  percy beaumont was annoyed as well he had deemed it his duty as i have narrated to write to the duchess but he had not expected that this distinguished woman would act so promptly upon his hint it means he said that your father is laid up i dont suppose its anything serious but you have no option take the first steamer but dont be alarmed  lord lambeth made his farewells but the few last words that he exchanged with bessie alden are the only ones that have a place in our record of course i neednt assure you he said that if you should come to england next year i expect to be the first person that you inform of it  bessie alden looked at him a little and she smiled oh if we come to london she answered i should think you would hear of it  percy beaumont returned with his cousin and his sense of duty compelled him one windless afternoon in midatlantic to say to lord lambeth that he suspected that the duchesss telegram was in part the result of something he himself had written to her i wrote to heras i explicitly notified you i had promised to dothat you were extremely interested in a little american girl  lord lambeth was extremely angry and he indulged for some moments in the simple language of indignation but i have said that he was a reasonable young man and i can give no better proof of it than the fact that he remarked to his companion at the end of half an hour you were quite right after all i am very much interested in her only to be fair he added you should have told my mother also that she is notseriouslyinterested in me  percy beaumont gave a little laugh there is nothing so charming as modesty in a young man in your position that speech is a capital proof that you are sweet on her  she is not interestedshe is not lord lambeth repeated  my dear fellow said his companion you are very far gone      part ii   in point of fact as percy beaumont would have said mrs westgate disembarked on the 18th of may on the british coast she was accompanied by her sister but she was not attended by any other member of her family to the deprivation of her husbands society mrs westgate was however habituated she had made half a dozen journeys to europe without him and she now accounted for his absence to interrogative friends on this side of the atlantic by allusion to the regrettable but conspicuous fact that in america there was no leisure class the two ladies came up to london and alighted at joness hotel where mrs westgate who had made on former occasions the most agreeable impression at this establishment received an obsequious greeting bessie alden had felt much excited about coming to england she had expected the associations would be very charming that it would be an infinite pleasure to rest her eyes upon the things she had read about in the poets and historians she was very fond of the poets and historians of the picturesque of the past of retrospect of mementos and reverberations of greatness so that on coming into the english world where strangeness and familiarity would go hand in hand she was prepared for a multitude of fresh emotions they began very promptlythese tender fluttering sensations they began with the sight of the beautiful english landscape whose dark richness was quickened and brightened by the season with the carpeted fields and flowering hedgerows as she looked at them from the window of the train with the spires of the rural churches peeping above the rookhaunted treetops with the oakstudded parks the ancient homes the cloudy light the speech the manners the thousand differences mrs westgates impressions had of course much less novelty and keenness and she gave but a wandering attention to her sisters ejaculations and rhapsodies  you know my enjoyment of england is not so intellectual as bessies she said to several of her friends in the course of her visit to this country and yet if it is not intellectual i cant say it is physical i dont think i can quite say what it is my enjoyment of england when once it was settled that the two ladies should come abroad and should spend a few weeks in england on their way to the continent they of course exchanged a good many allusions to their london acquaintance  it will certainly be much nicer having friends there bessie alden had said one day as she sat on the sunny deck of the steamer at her sisters feet on a large blue rug  whom do you mean by friends mrs westgate asked  all those english gentlemen whom you have known and entertained captain littledale for instance and lord lambeth and mr beaumont added bessie alden  do you expect them to give us a very grand reception  bessie reflected a moment she was addicted as we know to reflection well yes  my poor sweet child murmured her sister  what have i said that is so silly asked bessie  you are a little too simple just a little it is very becoming but it pleases people at your expense  i am certainly too simple to understand you said bessie  shall i tell you a story asked her sister  if you would be so good that is what they do to amuse simple people  mrs westgate consulted her memory while her companion sat gazing at the shining sea did you ever hear of the duke of greenerin  i think not said bessie  well its no matter her sister went on  its a proof of my simplicity  my story is meant to illustrate that of some other people said mrs westgate the duke of greenerin is what they call in england a great swell and some five years ago he came to america he spent most of his time in new york and in new york he spent his days and his nights at the butterworths you have heard at least of the butterworths bien they did everything in the world for himthey turned themselves inside out they gave him a dozen dinner parties and balls and were the means of his being invited to fifty more at first he used to come into mrs butterworths box at the opera in a tweed traveling suit but someone stopped that at any rate he had a beautiful time and they parted the best friends in the world two years elapse and the butterworths come abroad and go to london the first thing they see in all the papersin england those things are in the most prominent placeis that the duke of greenerin has arrived in town for the season they wait a little and then mr butterworthas polite as evergoes and leaves a card they wait a little more the visit is not returned they wait three weekssilence de mortthe duke gives no sign the butterworths see a lot of other people put down the duke of greenerin as a rude ungrateful man and forget all about him one fine day they go to ascot races and there they meet him face to face he stares a moment and then comes up to mr butterworth taking something from his pocketbooksomething which proves to be a banknote im glad to see you mr butterworth he says so that i can pay you that ten pounds i lost to you in new york i saw the other day you remembered our bet here are the ten pounds mr butterworth goodbye mr butterworth and off he goes and thats the last they see of the duke of greenerin  is that your story asked bessie alden  dont you think its interesting her sister replied  i dont believe it said the young girl  ah cried mrs westgate you are not so simple after all believe it or not as you please there is no smoke without fire  is that the way asked bessie after a moment that you expect your friends to treat you  i defy them to treat me very ill because i shall not give them the opportunity with the best will in the world in that case they cant be very offensive  bessie alden was silent a moment i dont see what makes you talk that way she said the english are a great people  exactly and that is just the way they have grown greatby dropping you when you have ceased to be useful people say they are not clever but i think they are very clever  you know you have liked themall the englishmen you have seen said bessie  they have liked me her sister rejoined it would be more correct to say that and of course one likes that  bessie alden resumed for some moments her studies in sea green well she said whether they like me or not i mean to like them and happily she added lord lambeth does not owe me ten pounds  during the first few days after their arrival at joness hotel our charming americans were much occupied with what they would have called looking about them they found occasion to make a large number of purchases and their opportunities for conversation were such only as were offered by the deferential london shopmen bessie alden even in driving from the station took an immense fancy to the british metropolis and at the risk of exhibiting her as a young woman of vulgar tastes it must be recorded that for a considerable period she desired no higher pleasure than to drive about the crowded streets in a hansom cab to her attentive eyes they were full of a strange picturesque life and it is at least beneath the dignity of our historic muse to enumerate the trivial objects and incidents which this simple young lady from boston found so entertaining it may be freely mentioned however that whenever after a round of visits in bond street and regent street she was about to return with her sister to joness hotel she made an earnest request that they should be driven home by way of westminster abbey she had begun by asking whether it would not be possible to take the tower on the way to their lodgings but it happened that at a more primitive stage of her culture mrs westgate had paid a visit to this venerable monument which she spoke of ever afterward vaguely as a dreadful disappointment so that she expressed the liveliest disapproval of any attempt to combine historical researches with the purchase of hairbrushes and notepaper the most she would consent to do in this line was to spend half an hour at madame tussauds where she saw several dusty wax effigies of members of the royal family she told bessie that if she wished to go to the tower she must get someone else to take her bessie expressed hereupon an earnest disposition to go alone but upon this proposal as well mrs westgate sprinkled cold water  remember she said that you are not in your innocent little boston it is not a question of walking up and down beacon street then she went on to explain that there were two classes of american girls in europethose that walked about alone and those that did not you happen to belong my dear she said to her sister to the class that does not  it is only answered bessie laughing because you happen to prevent me and she devoted much private meditation to this question of effecting a visit to the tower of london  suddenly it seemed as if the problem might be solved the two ladies at joness hotel received a visit from willie woodley such was the social appellation of a young american who had sailed from new york a few days after their own departure and who having the privilege of intimacy with them in that city had lost no time on his arrival in london in coming to pay them his respects he had in fact gone to see them directly after going to see his tailor than which there can be no greater exhibition of promptitude on the part of a young american who has just alighted at the charing cross hotel he was a slim pale youth of the most amiable disposition famous for the skill with which he led the german in new york indeed by the young ladies who habitually figured in this terpsichorean revel he was believed to be the best dancer in the world it was in these terms that he was always spoken of and that his identity was indicated he was the gentlest softest young man it was possible to meet he was beautifully dressedin the english styleand he knew an immense deal about london he had been at newport during the previous summer at the time of our young englishmens visit and he took extreme pleasure in the society of bessie alden whom he always addressed as miss bessie she immediately arranged with him in the presence of her sister that he should conduct her to the scene of anne boleyns execution  you may do as you please said mrs westgate onlyif you desire the informationit is not the custom here for young ladies to knock about london with young men  miss bessie has waltzed with me so often observed willie woodley she can surely go out with me in a hansom  i consider waltzing said mrs westgate the most innocent pleasure of our time  its a compliment to our time exclaimed the young man with a little laugh in spite of himself  i dont see why i should regard what is done here said bessie alden why should i suffer the restrictions of a society of which i enjoy none of the privileges  thats very goodvery good murmured willie woodley  oh go to the tower and feel the ax if you like said mrs westgate i consent to your going with mr woodley but i should not let you go with an englishman  miss bessie wouldnt care to go with an englishman mr woodley declared with a faint asperity that was perhaps not unnatural in a young man who dressing in the manner that i have indicated and knowing a great deal as i have said about london saw no reason for drawing these sharp distinctions he agreed upon a day with miss bessiea day of that same week  an ingenious mind might perhaps trace a connection between the young girls allusion to her destitution of social privileges and a question she asked on the morrow as she sat with her sister at lunch  dont you mean to write toto anyone said bessie  i wrote this morning to captain littledale mrs westgate replied  but mr woodley said that captain littledale had gone to india  he said he thought he had heard so he knew nothing about it  for a moment bessie alden said nothing more then at last and dont you intend to write toto mr beaumont she inquired  you mean to lord lambeth said her sister  i said mr beaumont because he was so good a friend of yours  mrs westgate looked at the young girl with sisterly candor i dont care two straws for mr beaumont  you were certainly very nice to him  i am nice to everyone said mrs westgate simply  to everyone but me rejoined bessie smiling  her sister continued to look at her then at last are you in love with lord lambeth she asked  the young girl stared a moment and the question was apparently too humorous even to make her blush not that i know of she answered  because if you are mrs westgate went on i shall certainly not send for him  that proves what i said declared bessie smilingthat you are not nice to me  it would be a poor service my dear child said her sister  in what sense there is nothing against lord lambeth that i know of  mrs westgate was silent a moment you are in love with him then  bessie stared again but this time she blushed a little ah if you wont be serious she answered we will not mention him again  for some moments lord lambeth was not mentioned again and it was mrs westgate who at the end of this period reverted to him of course i will let him know we are here because i think he would be hurtjustly enoughif we should go away without seeing him it is fair to give him a chance to come and thank me for the kindness we showed him but i dont want to seem eager  neither do i said bessie with a little laugh  though i confess added her sister that i am curious to see how he will behave  he behaved very well at newport  newport is not london at newport he could do as he liked but here it is another affair he has to have an eye to consequences  if he had more freedom then at newport argued bessie it is the more to his credit that he behaved well and if he has to be so careful here it is possible he will behave even better  betterbetter repeated her sister my dear child what is your point of view  how do you meanmy point of view  dont you care for lord lambetha little  this time bessie alden was displeased she slowly got up from the table turning her face away from her sister you will oblige me by not talking so she said  mrs westgate sat watching her for some moments as she moved slowly about the room and went and stood at the window i will write to him this afternoon she said at last  do as you please bessie answered and presently she turned round i am not afraid to say that i like lord lambeth i like him very much  he is not clever mrs westgate declared  well there have been clever people whom i have disliked said bessie alden so that i suppose i may like a stupid one besides lord lambeth is not stupid  not so stupid as he looks exclaimed her sister smiling  if i were in love with lord lambeth as you said just now it would be bad policy on your part to abuse him  my dear child dont give me lessons in policy cried mrs westgate the policy i mean to follow is very deep  the young girl began to walk about the room again then she stopped before her sister i have never heard in the course of five minutes she said so many hints and innuendoes i wish you would tell me in plain english what you mean  i mean that you may be much annoyed  that is still only a hint said bessie  her sister looked at her hesitating an instant it will be said of you that you have come after lord lambeththat you followed him  bessie alden threw back her pretty head like a startled hind and a look flashed into her face that made mrs westgate rise from her chair who says such things as that she demanded  people here  i dont believe it said bessie  you have a very convenient faculty of doubt but my policy will be as i say very deep i shall leave you to find out this kind of thing for yourself  bessie fixed her eyes upon her sister and mrs westgate thought for a moment there were tears in them do they talk that way here she asked  you will see i shall leave you alone  dont leave me alone said bessie alden take me away  no i want to see what you make of it her sister continued  i dont understand  you will understand after lord lambeth has come said mrs westgate with a little laugh  the two ladies had arranged that on this afternoon willie woodley should go with them to hyde park where bessie alden expected to derive much entertainment from sitting on a little green chair under the great trees beside rotten row the want of a suitable escort had hitherto rendered this pleasure inaccessible but no escort now for such an expedition could have been more suitable than their devoted young countryman whose mission in life it might almost be said was to find chairs for ladies and who appeared on the stroke of halfpast five with a white camellia in his buttonhole  i have written to lord lambeth my dear said mrs westgate to her sister on coming into the room where bessie alden drawing on her long gray gloves was entertaining their visitor  bessie said nothing but willie woodley exclaimed that his lordship was in town he had seen his name in the morning post  do you read the morning post asked mrs westgate  oh yes its great fun willie woodley affirmed  i want so to see it said bessie there is so much about it in thackeray  i will send it to you every morning said willie woodley  he found them what bessie alden thought excellent places under the great trees beside the famous avenue whose humors had been made familiar to the young girls childhood by the pictures in punch the day was bright and warm and the crowd of riders and spectators and the great procession of carriages were proportionately dense and brilliant the scene bore the stamp of the london season at its height and bessie alden found more entertainment in it than she was able to express to her companions she sat silent under her parasol and her imagination according to its wont let itself loose into the great changing assemblage of striking and suggestive figures they stirred up a host of old impressions and preconceptions and she found herself fitting a history to this person and a theory to that and making a place for them all in her little private museum of types but if she said little her sister on one side and willie woodley on the other expressed themselves in lively alternation  look at that green dress with blue flounces said mrs westgate quelle toilette  thats the marquis of blackborough said the young manthe one in the white coat i heard him speak the other night in the house of lords it was something about ramrods he called them wamwods hes an awful swell  did you ever see anything like the way they are pinned back mrs westgate resumed they never know where to stop  they do nothing but stop said willie woodley it prevents them from walking here comes a great celebritylady beatrice bellevue shes awfully fast see what little steps she takes  well my dear mrs westgate pursued i hope you are getting some ideas for your couturiere  i am getting plenty of ideas said bessie but i dont know that my couturiere would appreciate them  willie woodley presently perceived a friend on horseback who drove up beside the barrier of the row and beckoned to him he went forward and the crowd of pedestrians closed about him so that for some ten minutes he was hidden from sight at last he reappeared bringing a gentleman with hima gentleman whom bessie at first supposed to be his friend dismounted but at a second glance she found herself looking at lord lambeth who was shaking hands with her sister  i found him over there said willie woodley and i told him you were here  and then lord lambeth touching his hat a little shook hands with bessie fancy your being here he said he was blushing and smiling he looked very handsome and he had a kind of splendor that he had not had in america bessie aldens imagination as we know was just then in exercise so that the tall young englishman as he stood there looking down at her had the benefit of it he is handsomer and more splendid than anything i have ever seen she said to herself and then she remembered that he was a marquis and she thought he looked like a marquis  i say you know he cried you ought to have let a man know you were here  i wrote to you an hour ago said mrs westgate  doesnt all the world know it asked bessie smiling  i assure you i didnt know it cried lord lambeth upon my honor i hadnt heard of it ask woodley now had i woodley  well i think you are rather a humbug said willie woodley  you dont believe thatdo you miss alden asked his lordship you dont believe im a humbug eh  no said bessie i dont  you are too tall to stand up lord lambeth mrs westgate observed you are only tolerable when you sit down be so good as to get a chair  he found a chair and placed it sidewise close to the two ladies if i hadnt met woodley i should never have found you he went on should i woodley  well i guess not said the young american  not even with my letter asked mrs westgate  ah well i havent got your letter yet i suppose i shall get it this evening it was awfully kind of you to write  so i said to bessie observed mrs westgate  did she say so miss alden lord lambeth inquired i daresay you have been here a month  we have been here three said mrs westgate  have you been here three months the young man asked again of bessie  it seems a long time bessie answered  i say after that you had better not call me a humbug cried lord lambeth i have only been in town three weeks but you must have been hiding away i havent seen you anywhere  where should you have seen uswhere should we have gone asked mrs westgate  you should have gone to hurlingham said willie woodley  no let lord lambeth tell us mrs westgate insisted  there are plenty of places to go to said lord lambeth each one stupider than the other i mean peoples houses they send you cards  no one has sent us cards said bessie  we are very quiet her sister declared we are here as travelers  we have been to madame tussauds bessie pursued  oh i say cried lord lambeth  we thought we should find your image there said mrs westgateyours and mr beaumonts  in the chamber of horrors laughed the young man  it did duty very well for a party said mrs westgate all the women were decolletes and many of the figures looked as if they could speak if they tried  upon my word lord lambeth rejoined you see people at london parties that look as if they couldnt speak if they tried  do you think mr woodley could find us mr beaumont asked mrs westgate  lord lambeth stared and looked round him i daresay he could beaumont often comes here dont you think you could find him woodley make a dive into the crowd  thank you i have had enough diving said willie woodley i will wait till mr beaumont comes to the surface  i will bring him to see you said lord lambeth where are you staying  you will find the address in my letterjoness hotel  oh one of those places just out of piccadilly beastly hole isnt it lord lambeth inquired  i believe its the best hotel in london said mrs westgate  but they give you awful rubbish to eat dont they his lordship went on  yes said mrs westgate  i always feel so sorry for the people that come up to town and go to live in those places continued the young man they eat nothing but filth  oh i say cried willie woodley  well how do you like london miss alden lord lambeth asked unperturbed by this ejaculation  i think its grand said bessie alden  my sister likes it in spite of the filth mrs westgate exclaimed  i hope you are going to stay a long time  as long as i can said bessie  and where is mr westgate asked lord lambeth of this gentlemans wife  hes where he always isin that tiresome new york  he must be tremendously clever said the young man  i suppose he is said mrs westgate  lord lambeth sat for nearly an hour with his american friends but it is not our purpose to relate their conversation in full he addressed a great many remarks to bessie alden and finally turned toward her altogether while willie woodley entertained mrs westgate bessie herself said very little she was on her guard thinking of what her sister had said to her at lunch little by little however she interested herself in lord lambeth again as she had done at newport only it seemed to her that here he might become more interesting he would be an unconscious part of the antiquity the impressiveness the picturesqueness of england and poor bessie alden like many a yankee maiden was terribly at the mercy of picturesqueness  i have often wished i were at newport again said the young man those days i spent at your sisters were awfully jolly  we enjoyed them very much i hope your father is better  oh dear yes when i got to england he was out grouse shooting it was what you call in america a gigantic fraud my mother had got nervous my three weeks at newport seemed like a happy dream  america certainly is very different from england said bessie  i hope you like england better eh lord lambeth rejoined almost persuasively  no englishman can ask that seriously of a person of another country  her companion looked at her for a moment you mean its a matter of course  if i were english said bessie it would certainly seem to me a matter of course that everyone should be a good patriot  oh dear yes patriotism is everything said lord lambeth not quite following but very contented now what are you going to do here  on thursday i am going to the tower  the tower  the tower of london did you never hear of it  oh yes i have been there said lord lambeth i was taken there by my governess when i was six years old its a rum idea your going there  do give me a few more rum ideas said bessie i want to see everything of that sort i am going to hampton court and to windsor and to the dulwich gallery  lord lambeth seemed greatly amused i wonder you dont go to the rosherville gardens  are they interesting asked bessie  oh wonderful  are they very old thats all i care for said bessie  they are tremendously old they are all falling to ruins  i think there is nothing so charming as an old ruinous garden said the young girl we must certainly go there  lord lambeth broke out into merriment i say woodley he cried heres miss alden wants to go to the rosherville gardens  willie woodley looked a little blank he was caught in the fact of ignorance of an apparently conspicuous feature of london life but in a moment he turned it off very well he said ill write for a permit  lord lambeths exhilaration increased gad i believe you americans would go anywhere he cried  we wish to go to parliament said bessie thats one of the first things  oh it would bore you to death cried the young man  we wish to hear you speak  i never speakexcept to young ladies said lord lambeth smiling  bessie alden looked at him a while smiling too in the shadow of her parasol you are very strange she murmured i dont think i approve of you  ah now dont be severe miss alden said lord lambeth smiling still more please dont be severe i want you to like meawfully  to like you awfully you must not laugh at me then when i make mistakes i consider it my rightas a freeborn americanto make as many mistakes as i choose  upon my word i didnt laugh at you said lord lambeth  and not only that bessie went on but i hold that all my mistakes shall be set down to my credit you must think the better of me for them  i cant think better of you than i do the young man declared  bessie alden looked at him a moment again you certainly speak very well to young ladies but why dont you address the houseisnt that what they call it  because i have nothing to say said lord lambeth  havent you a great position asked bessie alden  he looked a moment at the back of his glove ill set that down he said as one of your mistakesto your credit and as if he disliked talking about his position he changed the subject i wish you would let me go with you to the tower and to hampton court and to all those other places  we shall be most happy said bessie  and of course i shall be delighted to show you the house of lordssome day that suits you there are a lot of things i want to do for you i want to make you have a good time and i should like very much to present some of my friends to you if it wouldnt bore you then it would be awfully kind of you to come down to branches  we are much obliged to you lord lambeth said bessie what is branches  its a house in the country i think you might like it  willie woodley and mrs westgate at this moment were sitting in silence and the young mans ear caught these last words of lord lambeths hes inviting miss bessie to one of his castles he murmured to his companion  mrs westgate foreseeing what she mentally called complications immediately got up and the two ladies taking leave of lord lambeth returned under mr woodleys conduct to joness hotel  lord lambeth came to see them on the morrow bringing percy beaumont with himthe latter having instantly declared his intention of neglecting none of the usual offices of civility this declaration however when his kinsman informed him of the advent of their american friends had been preceded by another remark  here they are then and you are in for it  what am i in for demanded lord lambeth  i will let your mother give it a name with all respect to whom added percy beaumont i must decline on this occasion to do any more police duty her grace must look after you herself  i will give her a chance said her graces son a trifle grimly i shall make her go and see them  she wont do it my boy  well see if she doesnt said lord lambeth  but if percy beaumont took a somber view of the arrival of the two ladies at joness hotel he was sufficiently a man of the world to offer them a smiling countenance he fell into animated conversationconversation at least that was animated on her sidewith mrs westgate while his companion made himself agreeable to the younger lady mrs westgate began confessing and protesting declaring and expounding  i must say london is a great deal brighter and prettier just now than it was when i was here lastin the month of november there is evidently a great deal going on and you seem to have a good many flowers i have no doubt it is very charming for all you people and that you amuse yourselves immensely it is very good of you to let bessie and me come and sit and look at you i suppose you will think i am very satirical but i must confess that thats the feeling i have in london  i am afraid i dont quite understand to what feeling you allude said percy beaumont  the feeling that its all very well for you english people everything is beautifully arranged for you  it seems to me it is very well for some americans sometimes rejoined beaumont  for some of them yesif they like to be patronized but i must say i dont like to be patronized i may be very eccentric and undisciplined and outrageous but i confess i never was fond of patronage i like to associate with people on the same terms as i do in my own country thats a peculiar taste that i have but here people seem to expect something elseheaven knows what i am afraid you will think i am very ungrateful for i certainly have received a great deal of attention the last time i was here a lady sent me a message that i was at liberty to come and see her  dear me i hope you didnt go observed percy beaumont  you are deliciously naive i must say that for you mrs westgate exclaimed it must be a great advantage to you here in london i suppose that if i myself had a little more naivete i should enjoy it more i should be content to sit on a chair in the park and see the people pass and be told that this is the duchess of suffolk and that is the lord chamberlain and that i must be thankful for the privilege of beholding them i daresay it is very wicked and critical of me to ask for anything else but i was always critical and i freely confess to the sin of being fastidious i am told there is some remarkably superior secondrate society provided here for strangers merci i dont want any superior secondrate society i want the society that i have been accustomed to  i hope you dont call lambeth and me second rate beaumont interposed  oh i am accustomed to you said mrs westgate do you know that you english sometimes make the most wonderful speeches the first time i came to london i went out to dineas i told you i have received a great deal of attention after dinner in the drawing room i had some conversation with an old lady i assure you i had i forget what we talked about but she presently said in allusion to something we were discussing oh you know the aristocracy do soandso but in ones own class of life it is very different in ones own class of life what is a poor unprotected american woman to do in a country where she is liable to have that sort of thing said to her  you seem to get hold of some very queer old ladies i compliment you on your acquaintance percy beaumont exclaimed if you are trying to bring me to admit that london is an odious place youll not succeed im extremely fond of it and i think it the jolliest place in the world  pour vous autres i never said the contrary mrs westgate retorted i make use of this expression because both interlocutors had begun to raise their voices percy beaumont naturally did not like to hear his country abused and mrs westgate no less naturally did not like a stubborn debater  hallo said lord lambeth what are they up to now and he came away from the window where he had been standing with bessie alden  i quite agree with a very clever countrywoman of mine mrs westgate continued with charming ardor though with imperfect relevancy she smiled at the two gentlemen for a moment with terrible brightness as if to toss at their feetupon their native heaththe gauntlet of defiance for me there are only two social positions worth speaking ofthat of an american lady and that of the emperor of russia  and what do you do with the american gentlemen asked lord lambeth  she leaves them in america said percy beaumont  on the departure of their visitors bessie alden told her sister that lord lambeth would come the next day to go with them to the tower and that he had kindly offered to bring his trap and drive them thither mrs westgate listened in silence to this communication and for some time afterward she said nothing but at last if you had not requested me the other day not to mention it she began there is something i should venture to ask you bessie frowned a little her dark blue eyes were more dark than blue but her sister went on as it is i will take the risk you are not in love with lord lambeth i believe it perfectly very good but is there by chance any danger of your becoming so its a very simple question dont take offense i have a particular reason said mrs westgate for wanting to know  bessie alden for some moments said nothing she only looked displeased no there is no danger she answered at last curtly  then i should like to frighten them declared mrs westgate clasping her jeweled hands  to frighten whom  all these people lord lambeths family and friends  how should you frighten them asked the young girl  it wouldnt be iit would be you it would frighten them to think that you should absorb his lordships young affections  bessie alden with her clear eyes still overshadowed by her dark brows continued to interrogate why should that frighten them  mrs westgate poised her answer with a smile before delivering it because they think you are not good enough you are a charming girl beautiful and amiable intelligent and clever and as bienelevee as it is possible to be but you are not a fit match for lord lambeth  bessie alden was decidedly disgusted where do you get such extraordinary ideas she asked you have said some such strange things lately my dear kitty where do you collect them  kitty was evidently enamored of her idea yes it would put them on pins and needles and it wouldnt hurt you mr beaumont is already most uneasy i could soon see that  the young girl meditated a moment do you mean that they spy upon himthat they interfere with him  i dont know what power they have to interfere but i know that a british mama may worry her sons life out  it has been intimated that as regards certain disagreeable things bessie alden had a fund of skepticism she abstained on the present occasion from expressing disbelief for she wished not to irritate her sister but she said to herself that kitty had been misinformedthat this was a travelers tale though she was a girl of a lively imagination there could in the nature of things be to her sense no reality in the idea of her belonging to a vulgar category what she said aloud was i must say that in that case i am very sorry for lord lambeth  mrs westgate more and more exhilarated by her scheme was smiling at her again if i could only believe it was safe she exclaimed when you begin to pity him i on my side am afraid  afraid of what  of your pitying him too much  bessie alden turned away impatiently but at the end of a minute she turned back what if i should pity him too much she asked  mrs westgate hereupon turned away but after a moments reflection she also faced her sister again it would come after all to the same thing she said  lord lambeth came the next day with his trap and the two ladies attended by willie woodley placed themselves under his guidance and were conveyed eastward through some of the duskier portions of the metropolis to the great turreted donjon which overlooks the london shipping they all descended from their vehicle and entered the famous inclosure and they secured the services of a venerable beefeater who though there were many other claimants for legendary information made a fine exclusive party of them and marched them through courts and corridors through armories and prisons he delivered his usual peripatetic discourse and they stopped and stared and peeped and stooped according to the official admonitions bessie alden asked the old man in the crimson doublet a great many questions she thought it a most fascinating place lord lambeth was in high good humor he was constantly laughing he enjoyed what he would have called the lark willie woodley kept looking at the ceilings and tapping the walls with the knuckle of a pearlgray glove and mrs westgate asking at frequent intervals to be allowed to sit down and wait till they came back was as frequently informed that they would never come back to a great many of bessies questionschiefly on collateral points of english historythe ancient warder was naturally unable to reply whereupon she always appealed to lord lambeth but his lordship was very ignorant he declared that he knew nothing about that sort of thing and he seemed greatly diverted at being treated as an authority  you cant expect everyone to know as much as you he said  i should expect you to know a great deal more declared bessie alden  women always know more than men about names and dates and that sort of thing lord lambeth rejoined there was lady jane grey we have just been hearing about who went in for latin and greek and all the learning of her age  you have no right to be ignorant at all events said bessie  why havent i as good a right as anyone else  because you have lived in the midst of all these things  what things do you mean axes and blocks and thumbscrews  all these historical things you belong to a historical family  bessie is really too historical said mrs westgate catching a word of this dialogue  yes you are too historical said lord lambeth laughing but thankful for a formula upon my honor you are too historical  he went with the ladies a couple of days later to hampton court willie woodley being also of the party the afternoon was charming the famous horse chestnuts were in blossom and lord lambeth who quite entered into the spirit of the cockney excursionist declared that it was a jolly old place bessie alden was in ecstasies she went about murmuring and exclaiming  its too lovely said the young girl its too enchanting its too exactly what it ought to be  at hampton court the little flocks of visitors are not provided with an official bellwether but are left to browse at discretion upon the local antiquities it happened in this manner that in default of another informant bessie alden who on doubtful questions was able to suggest a great many alternatives found herself again applying for intellectual assistance to lord lambeth but he again assured her that he was utterly helpless in such mattersthat his education had been sadly neglected  and i am sorry it makes you unhappy he added in a moment  you are very disappointing lord lambeth she said  ah now dont say that he cried thats the worst thing you could possibly say  no she rejoined it is not so bad as to say that i had expected nothing of you  i dont know give me a notion of the sort of thing you expected  well said bessie alden that you would be more what i should like to bewhat i should try to bein your place  ah my place exclaimed lord lambeth you are always talking about my place  the young girl looked at him he thought she colored a little and for a moment she made no rejoinder  does it strike you that i am always talking about your place she asked  i am sure you do it a great honor he said fearing he had been uncivil  i have often thought about it she went on after a moment i have often thought about your being a hereditary legislator a hereditary legislator ought to know a great many things  not if he doesnt legislate  but you do legislate its absurd your saying you dont you are very much looked up to herei am assured of that  i dont know that i ever noticed it  it is because you are used to it then you ought to fill the place  how do you mean to fill it asked lord lambeth  you ought to be very clever and brilliant and to know almost everything  lord lambeth looked at her a moment shall i tell you something he asked a young man in my position as you call it  i didnt invent the term interposed bessie alden i have seen it in a great many books  hang it you are always at your books a fellow in my position then does very well whatever he does thats about what i mean to say  well if your own people are content with you said bessie alden laughing it is not for me to complain but i shall always think that properly you should have been a great minda great character  ah thats very theoretic lord lambeth declared depend upon it thats a yankee prejudice  happy the country said bessie alden where even peoples prejudices are so elevated  well after all observed lord lambeth i dont know that i am such a fool as you are trying to make me out  i said nothing so rude as that but i must repeat that you are disappointing  my dear miss alden exclaimed the young man i am the best fellow in the world  ah if it were not for that said bessie alden with a smile  mrs westgate had a good many more friends in london than she pretended and before long she had renewed acquaintance with most of them their hospitality was extreme so that one thing leading to another she began as the phrase is to go out bessie alden in this way saw something of what she found it a great satisfaction to call to herself english society she went to balls and danced she went to dinners and talked she went to concerts and listened at concerts bessie always listened she went to exhibitions and wondered her enjoyment was keen and her curiosity insatiable and grateful in general for all her opportunities she especially prized the privilege of meeting certain celebrated personsauthors and artists philosophers and statesmenof whose renown she had been a humble and distant beholder and who now as a part of the habitual furniture of london drawing rooms struck her as stars fallen from the firmament and become palpablerevealing also sometimes on contact qualities not to have been predicted of sidereal bodies bessie who knew so many of her contemporaries by reputation had a good many personal disappointments but on the other hand she had innumerable satisfactions and enthusiasms and she communicated the emotions of either class to a dear friend of her own sex in boston with whom she was in voluminous correspondence some of her reflections indeed she attempted to impart to lord lambeth who came almost every day to joness hotel and whom mrs westgate admitted to be really devoted captain littledale it appeared had gone to india and of several others of mrs westgates expensionersgentlemen who as she said had made in new york a clubhouse of her drawing roomno tidings were to be obtained but lord lambeth was certainly attentive enough to make up for the accidental absences the short memories all the other irregularities of everyone else he drove them in the park he took them to visit private collections of pictures and having a house of his own invited them to dinner mrs westgate following the fashion of many of her compatriots caused herself and her sister to be presented at the english court by her diplomatic representativefor it was in this manner that she alluded to the american minister to england inquiring what on earth he was put there for if not to make the proper arrangements for ones going to a drawing room  lord lambeth declared that he hated drawing rooms but he participated in the ceremony on the day on which the two ladies at joness hotel repaired to buckingham palace in a remarkable coach which his lordship had sent to fetch them he had on a gorgeous uniform and bessie alden was particularly struck with his appearanceespecially when on her asking him rather foolishly as she felt if he were a loyal subject he replied that he was a loyal subject to her this declaration was emphasized by his dancing with her at a royal ball to which the two ladies afterward went and was not impaired by the fact that she thought he danced very ill he seemed to her wonderfully kind she asked herself with growing vivacity why he should be so kind it was his dispositionthat seemed the natural answer she had told her sister that she liked him very much and now that she liked him more she wondered why she liked him for his disposition to this question as well that seemed the natural answer when once the impressions of london life began to crowd thickly upon her she completely forgot her sisters warning about the cynicism of public opinion it had given her great pain at the moment but there was no particular reason why she should remember it it corresponded too little with any sensible reality and it was disagreeable to bessie to remember disagreeable things so she was not haunted with the sense of a vulgar imputation she was not in love with lord lambethshe assured herself of that it will immediately be observed that when such assurances become necessary the state of a young ladys affections is already ambiguous and indeed bessie alden made no attempt to dissimulateto herself of coursea certain tenderness that she felt for the young nobleman she said to herself that she liked the type to which he belongedthe simple candid manly healthy english temperament she spoke to herself of him as women speak of young men they likealluded to his bravery which she had never in the least seen tested to his honesty and gentlemanliness and was not silent upon the subject of his good looks she was perfectly conscious moreover that she liked to think of his more adventitious merits that her imagination was excited and gratified by the sight of a handsome young man endowed with such large opportunitiesopportunities she hardly knew for what but as she supposed for doing great thingsfor setting an example for exerting an influence for conferring happiness for encouraging the arts she had a kind of ideal of conduct for a young man who should find himself in this magnificent position and she tried to adapt it to lord lambeths deportment as you might attempt to fit a silhouette in cut paper upon a shadow projected upon a wall but bessie aldens silhouette refused to coincide with his lordships image and this want of harmony sometimes vexed her more than she thought reasonable when he was absent it was of course less striking then he seemed to her a sufficiently graceful combination of high responsibilities and amiable qualities but when he sat there within sight laughing and talking with his customary good humor and simplicity she measured it more accurately and she felt acutely that if lord lambeths position was heroic there was but little of the hero in the young man himself then her imagination wandered away from himvery far away for it was an incontestable fact that at such moments he seemed distinctly dull i am afraid that while bessies imagination was thus invidiously roaming she cannot have been herself a very lively companion but it may well have been that these occasional fits of indifference seemed to lord lambeth a part of the young girls personal charm it had been a part of this charm from the first that he felt that she judged him and measured him more freely and irresponsiblymore at her ease and her leisure as it werethan several young ladies with whom he had been on the whole about as intimate to feel this and yet to feel that she also liked him was very agreeable to lord lambeth he fancied he had compassed that gratification so desirable to young men of title and fortunebeing liked for himself it is true that a cynical counselor might have whispered to him liked for yourself yes but not so very much he had at any rate the constant hope of being liked more  it may seem perhaps a trifle singularbut it is nevertheless truethat bessie alden when he struck her as dull devoted some time on grounds of conscience to trying to like him more i say on grounds of conscience because she felt that he had been extremely nice to her sister and because she reflected that it was no more than fair that she should think as well of him as he thought of her this effort was possibly sometimes not so successful as it might have been for the result of it was occasionally a vague irritation which expressed itself in hostile criticism of several british institutions bessie alden went to some entertainments at which she met lord lambeth but she went to others at which his lordship was neither actually nor potentially present and it was chiefly on these latter occasions that she encountered those literary and artistic celebrities of whom mention has been made after a while she reduced the matter to a principle if lord lambeth should appear anywhere it was a symbol that there would be no poets and philosophers and in consequencefor it was almost a strict consequenceshe used to enumerate to the young man these objects of her admiration  you seem to be awfully fond of those sort of people said lord lambeth one day as if the idea had just occurred to him  they are the people in england i am most curious to see bessie alden replied  i suppose thats because you have read so much said lord lambeth gallantly  i have not read so much it is because we think so much of them at home  oh i see observed the young nobleman in boston  not only in boston everywhere said bessie we hold them in great honor they go to the best dinner parties  i daresay you are right i cant say i know many of them  its a pity you dont bessie alden declared it would do you good  i daresay it would said lord lambeth very humbly but i must say i dont like the looks of some of them  neither do iof some of them but there are all kinds and many of them are charming  i have talked with two or three of them the young man went on and i thought they had a kind of fawning manner  why should they fawn bessie alden demanded  im sure i dont know why indeed  perhaps you only thought so said bessie  well of course rejoined her companion thats a kind of thing that cant be proved  in america they dont fawn said bessie  ah well then they must be better company  bessie was silent a moment that is one of the things i dont like about england she said your keeping the distinguished people apart  how do you mean apart  why letting them come only to certain places you never see them  lord lambeth looked at her a moment what people do you mean  the eminent peoplethe authors and artiststhe clever people  oh there are other eminent people besides those said lord lambeth  well you certainly keep them apart repeated the young girl  and there are other clever people added lord lambeth simply  bessie alden looked at him and she gave a light laugh not many she said  on another occasionjust after a dinner partyshe told him that there was something else in england she did not like  oh i say he cried havent you abused us enough  i have never abused you at all said bessie but i dont like your precedence  it isnt my precedence lord lambeth declared laughing  yes it is yoursjust exactly yours and i think its odious said bessie  i never saw such a young lady for discussing things has someone had the impudence to go before you asked his lordship  it is not the going before me that i object to said bessie it is their thinking that they have a right to do ita right that i recognize  i never saw such a young lady as you are for not recognizing i have no doubt the thing is beastly but it saves a lot of trouble  it makes a lot of trouble its horrid said bessie  but how would you have the first people go asked lord lambeth they cant go last  whom do you mean by the first people  ah if you mean to question first principles said lord lambeth  if those are your first principles no wonder some of your arrangements are horrid observed bessie alden with a very pretty ferocity i am a young girl so of course i go last but imagine what kitty must feel on being informed that she is not at liberty to budge until certain other ladies have passed out  oh i say she is not informed cried lord lambeth no one would do such a thing as that  she is made to feel it the young girl insistedas if they were afraid she would make a rush for the door no you have a lovely country said bessie alden but your precedence is horrid  i certainly shouldnt think your sister would like it rejoined lord lambeth with even exaggerated gravity but bessie alden could induce him to enter no formal protest against this repulsive custom which he seemed to think an extreme convenience  percy beaumont all this time had been a very much less frequent visitor at joness hotel than his noble kinsman he had in fact called but twice upon the two american ladies lord lambeth who often saw him reproached him with his neglect and declared that although mrs westgate had said nothing about it he was sure that she was secretly wounded by it she suffers too much to speak said lord lambeth  thats all gammon said percy beaumont theres a limit to what people can suffer and though sending no apologies to joness hotel he undertook in a manner to explain his absence you are always there he said and thats reason enough for my not going  i dont see why there is enough for both of us  i dont care to be a witness of youryour reckless passion said percy beaumont  lord lambeth looked at him with a cold eye and for a moment said nothing its not so obvious as you might suppose he rejoined dryly considering what a demonstrative beggar i am  i dont want to know anything about itnothing whatever said beaumont your mother asks me everytime she sees me whether i believe you are really lostand lady pimlico does the same i prefer to be able to answer that i know nothing about itthat i never go there i stay away for consistencys sake as i said the other day they must look after you themselves  you are devilish considerate said lord lambeth they never question me  they are afraid of you they are afraid of irritating you and making you worse so they go to work very cautiously and somewhere or other they get their information they know a great deal about you they know that you have been with those ladies to the dome of st pauls andwhere was the other placeto the thames tunnel  if all their knowledge is as accurate as that it must be very valuable said lord lambeth  well at any rate they know that you have been visiting the sights of the metropolis they thinkvery naturally as it seems to methat when you take to visiting the sights of the metropolis with a little american girl there is serious cause for alarm lord lambeth responded to this intimation by scornful laughter and his companion continued after a pause i said just now i didnt want to know anything about the affair but i will confess that i am curious to learn whether you propose to marry miss bessie alden  on this point lord lambeth gave his interlocutor no immediate satisfaction he was musing with a frown by jove he said they go rather too far they shall find me dangerousi promise them  percy beaumont began to laugh you dont redeem your promises you said the other day you would make your mother call  lord lambeth continued to meditate i asked her to call he said simply  and she declined  yes but she shall do it yet  upon my word said percy beaumont if she gets much more frightened i believe she will lord lambeth looked at him and he went on she will go to the girl herself  how do you mean she will go to her  she will beg her off or she will bribe her she will take strong measures  lord lambeth turned away in silence and his companion watched him take twenty steps and then slowly return i have invited mrs westgate and miss alden to branches he said and this evening i shall name a day  and shall you invite your mother and your sisters to meet them  explicitly  that will set the duchess off said percy beaumont i suspect she will come  she may do as she pleases  beaumont looked at lord lambeth you do really propose to marry the little sister then  i like the way you talk about it cried the young man she wont gobble me down dont be afraid  she wont leave you on your knees said percy beaumont what is the inducement  you talk about proposing wait till i have proposed lord lambeth went on  thats right my dear fellow think about it said percy beaumont  shes a charming girl pursued his lordship  of course shes a charming girl i dont know a girl more charming intrinsically but there are other charming girls nearer home  i like her spirit observed lord lambeth almost as if he were trying to torment his cousin  whats the peculiarity of her spirit  shes not afraid and she says things out and she thinks herself as good as anyone she is the only girl i have ever seen that was not dying to marry me  how do you know that if you havent asked her  i dont know how but i know it  i am sure she asked me questions enough about your property and your titles said beaumont  she has asked me questions too no end of them lord lambeth admitted but she asked for information dont you know  information aye ill warrant she wanted it depend upon it that she is dying to marry you just as much and just as little as all the rest of them  i shouldnt like her to refuse mei shouldnt like that  if the thing would be so disagreeable then both to you and to her in heavens name leave it alone said percy beaumont  mrs westgate on her side had plenty to say to her sister about the rarity of mr beaumonts visits and the nonappearance of the duchess of bayswater she professed however to derive more satisfaction from this latter circumstance than she could have done from the most lavish attentions on the part of this great lady it is most marked she saidmost marked it is a delicious proof that we have made them miserable the day we dined with lord lambeth i was really sorry for the poor fellow it will have been gathered that the entertainment offered by lord lambeth to his american friends had not been graced by the presence of his anxious mother he had invited several choice spirits to meet them but the ladies of his immediate family were to mrs westgates sensea sense possibly morbidly acuteconspicuous by their absence  i dont want to express myself in a manner that you dislike said bessie alden but i dont know why you should have so many theories about lord lambeths poor mother you know a great many young men in new york without knowing their mothers  mrs westgate looked at her sister and then turned away my dear bessie you are superb she said  one thing is certain the young girl continued if i believed i were a cause of annoyancehowever unwittingto lord lambeths family i should insist  insist upon my leaving england said mrs westgate  no not that i want to go to the national gallery again i want to see stratfordonavon and canterbury cathedral but i should insist upon his coming to see us no more  that would be very modest and very pretty of you but you wouldnt do it now  why do you say now asked bessie alden have i ceased to be modest  you care for him too much a month ago when you said you didnt i believe it was quite true but at present my dear child said mrs westgate you wouldnt find it quite so simple a matter never to see lord lambeth again i have seen it coming on  you are mistaken said bessie you dont understand  my dear child dont be perverse rejoined her sister  i know him better certainly if you mean that said bessie and i like him very much but i dont like him enough to make trouble for him with his family however i dont believe in that  i like the way you say however mrs westgate exclaimed come you would not marry him  oh no said the young girl  mrs westgate for a moment seemed vexed why not pray she demanded  because i dont care to said bessie alden  the morning after lord lambeth had had with percy beaumont that exchange of ideas which has just been narrated the ladies at joness hotel received from his lordship a written invitation to pay their projected visit to branches castle on the following tuesday i think i have made up a very pleasant party the young nobleman said several people whom you know and my mother and sisters who have so long been regrettably prevented from making your acquaintance bessie alden lost no time in calling her sisters attention to the injustice she had done the duchess of bayswater whose hostility was now proved to be a vain illusion  wait till you see if she comes said mrs westgate and if she is to meet us at her sons house the obligation was all the greater for her to call upon us  bessie had not to wait long and it appeared that lord lambeths mother now accepted mrs westgates view of her duties on the morrow early in the afternoon two cards were brought to the apartment of the american ladiesone of them bearing the name of the duchess of bayswater and the other that of the countess of pimlico mrs westgate glanced at the clock it is not yet four she said they have come early they wish to see us we will receive them and she gave orders that her visitors should be admitted a few moments later they were introduced and there was a solemn exchange of amenities the duchess was a large lady with a fine fresh color the countess of pimlico was very pretty and elegant  the duchess looked about her as she sat downlooked not especially at mrs westgate i daresay my son has told you that i have been wanting to come and see you she observed  you are very kind said mrs westgate vaguelyher conscience not allowing her to assent to this propositionand indeed not permitting her to enunciate her own with any appreciable emphasis  he says you were so kind to him in america said the duchess  we are very glad mrs westgate replied to have been able to make him a little morea little lessa little more comfortable  i think he stayed at your house remarked the duchess of bayswater looking at bessie alden  a very short time said mrs westgate  oh said the duchess and she continued to look at bessie who was engaged in conversation with her daughter  do you like london lady pimlico had asked of bessie after looking at her a good dealat her face and her hands her dress and her hair  very much indeed said bessie  do you like this hotel  it is very comfortable said bessie  do you like stopping at hotels inquired lady pimlico after a pause  i am very fond of traveling bessie answered and i suppose hotels are a necessary part of it but they are not the part i am fondest of  oh i hate traveling said the countess of pimlico and transferred her attention to mrs westgate  my son tells me you are going to branches the duchess presently resumed  lord lambeth has been so good as to ask us said mrs westgate who perceived that her visitor had now begun to look at her and who had her customary happy consciousness of a distinguished appearance the only mitigation of her felicity on this point was that having inspected her visitors own costume she said to herself she wont know how well i am dressed  he has asked me to go but i am not sure i shall be able murmured the duchess  he had offered us the pprospect of meeting you said mrs westgate  i hate the country at this season responded the duchess  mrs westgate gave a little shrug i think it is pleasanter than london  but the duchesss eyes were absent again she was looking very fixedly at bessie in a moment she slowly rose walked to a chair that stood empty at the young girls right hand and silently seated herself as she was a majestic voluminous woman this little transaction had inevitably an air of somewhat impressive intention it diffused a certain awkwardness which lady pimlico as a sympathetic daughter perhaps desired to rectify in turning to mrs westgate  i daresay you go out a great deal she observed  no very little we are strangers and we didnt come here for society  i see said lady pimlico its rather nice in town just now  its charming said mrs westgate but we only go to see a few peoplewhom we like  of course one cant like everyone said lady pimlico  it depends upon ones society mrs westgate rejoined  the duchess meanwhile had addressed herself to bessie my son tells me the young ladies in america are so clever  i am glad they made so good an impression on him said bessie smiling  the duchess was not smiling her large fresh face was very tranquil he is very susceptible she said he thinks everyone clever and sometimes they are  sometimes bessie assented smiling still  the duchess looked at her a little and then went on lambeth is very susceptible but he is very volatile too  volatile asked bessie  he is very inconstant it wont do to depend on him  ah said bessie i dont recognize that description we have depended on him greatlymy sister and iand he has never disappointed us  he will disappoint you yet said the duchess  bessie gave a little laugh as if she were amused at the duchesss persistency i suppose it will depend on what we expect of him  the less you expect the better lord lambeths mother declared  well said bessie we expect nothing unreasonable  the duchess for a moment was silent though she appeared to have more to say lambeth says he has seen so much of you she presently began  he has been to see us very often he has been very kind said bessie alden  i daresay you are used to that i am told there is a great deal of that in america  a great deal of kindness the young girl inquired smiling  is that what you call it i know you have different expressions  we certainly dont always understand each other said mrs westgate the termination of whose interview with lady pimlico allowed her to give her attention to their elder visitor  i am speaking of the young men calling so much upon the young ladies the duchess explained  but surely in england said mrs westgate the young ladies dont call upon the young men  some of them doalmost lady pimlico declared when the young men are a great parti  bessie you must make a note of that said mrs westgate my sister she added is a model traveler she writes down all the curious facts she hears in a little book she keeps for the purpose  the duchess was a little flushed she looked all about the room while her daughter turned to bessie my brother told us you were wonderfully clever said lady pimlico  he should have said my sister bessie answeredwhen she says such things as that  shall you be long at branches the duchess asked abruptly of the young girl  lord lambeth has asked us for three days said bessie  i shall go the duchess declared and my daughter too  that will be charming bessie rejoined  delightful murmured mrs westgate  i shall expect to see a great deal of you the duchess continued when i go to branches i monopolize my sons guests  they must be most happy said mrs westgate very graciously  i want immensely to see itto see the castle said bessie to the duchess i have never seen onein england at least and you know we have none in america  ah you are fond of castles inquired her grace  immensely replied the young girl it has been the dream of my life to live in one  the duchess looked at her a moment as if she hardly knew how to take this assurance which from her graces point of view was either very artless or very audacious well she said rising i will show you branches myself and upon this the two great ladies took their departure  what did they mean by it asked mrs westgate when they were gone  they meant to be polite said bessie because we are going to meet them  it is too late to be polite mrs westgate replied almost grimly they meant to overawe us by their fine manners and their grandeur and to make you lacher prise  lacher prise what strange things you say murmured bessie alden  they meant to snub us so that we shouldnt dare to go to branches mrs westgate continued  on the contrary said bessie the duchess offered to show me the place herself  yes you may depend upon it she wont let you out of her sight she will show you the place from morning till night  you have a theory for everything said bessie  and you apparently have none for anything  i saw no attempt to overawe us said the young girl their manners were not fine  they were not even good mrs westgate declared  bessie was silent a while but in a few moments she observed that she had a very good theory they came to look at me she said as if this had been a very ingenious hypothesis mrs westgate did it justice she greeted it with a smile and pronounced it most brilliant while in reality she felt that the young girls skepticism or her charity or as she had sometimes called it appropriately her idealism was proof against irony bessie however remained meditative all the rest of that day and well on into the morrow  on the morrow before lunch mrs westgate had occasion to go out for an hour and left her sister writing a letter when she came back she met lord lambeth at the door of the hotel coming away she thought he looked slightly embarrassed he was certainly very grave i am sorry to have missed you wont you come back she asked  no said the young man i cant i have seen your sister i can never come back then he looked at her a moment and took her hand goodbye mrs westgate he said you have been very kind to me and with what she thought a strange sad look in his handsome young face he turned away  she went in and she found bessie still writing her letter that is mrs westgate perceived she was sitting at the table with the pen in her hand and not writing lord lambeth has been here said the elder lady at last  then bessie got up and showed her a pale serious face she bent this face upon her sister for some time confessing silently and a little pleading i told him she said at last that we could not go to branches  mrs westgate displayed just a spark of irritation he might have waited she said with a smile till one had seen the castle later an hour afterward she said dear bessie i wish you might have accepted him  i couldnt said bessie gently  he is an excellent fellow said mrs westgate  i couldnt bessie repeated  if it is only her sister added because those women will think that they succeededthat they paralyzed us  bessie alden turned away but presently she added they were interesting i should have liked to see them again  so should i cried mrs westgate significantly  and i should have liked to see the castle said bessie but now we must leave england she added  her sister looked at her you will not wait to go to the national gallery  not now  nor to canterbury cathedral  bessie reflected a moment we can stop there on our way to paris she said  lord lambeth did not tell percy beaumont that the contingency he was not prepared at all to like had occurred but percy beaumont on hearing that the two ladies had left london wondered with some intensity what had happened wondered that is until the duchess of bayswater came a little to his assistance the two ladies went to paris and mrs westgate beguiled the journey to that city by repeating several timesthats what i regret they will think they petrified us but bessie alden seemed to regret nothing
