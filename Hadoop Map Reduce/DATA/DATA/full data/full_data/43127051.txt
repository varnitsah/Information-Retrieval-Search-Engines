43127051	jerry of the islands   foreword   it is a misfortune to some fictionwriters that fiction and unveracity in the average persons mind mean one and the same thing  several years ago i published a south sea novel  the action was placed in the solomon islands  the action was praised by the critics and reviewers as a highly creditable effort of the imagination  as regards realitythey said there wasnt any  of course as every one knew kinkyhaired cannibals no longer obtained on the earths surface much less ran around with nothing on chopping off one anothers heads and on occasion a white mans head as well  now listen  i am writing these lines in honolulu hawaii  yesterday on the beach at waikiki a stranger spoke to me  he mentioned a mutual friend captain kellar  when i was wrecked in the solomons on the blackbirder the minota it was captain kellar master of the blackbirder the eugenie who rescued me  the blacks had taken captain kellars head the stranger told me  he knew  he had represented captain kellars mother in settling up the estate  listen  i received a letter the other day from mr c m woodford resident commissioner of the british solomons  he was back at his post after a long furlough to england where he had entered his son into oxford  a search of the shelves of almost any public library will bring to light a book entitled a naturalist among the head hunters  mr c m woodford is the naturalist  he wrote the book  to return to his letter  in the course of the days work he casually and briefly mentioned a particular job he had just got off his hands  his absence in england had been the cause of delay  the job had been to make a punitive expedition to a neighbouring island and incidentally to recover the heads of some mutual friends of oursa whitetrader his white wife and children and his white clerk  the expedition was successful and mr woodford concluded his account of the episode with a statement to the effect what especially struck me was the absence of pain and terror in their faces which seemed to express rather serenity and reposethis mind you of men and women of his own race whom he knew well and who had sat at dinner with him in his own house  other friends with whom i have sat at dinner in the brave rollicking days in the solomons have since passed outby the same way  my goodness  i sailed in the teakbuilt ketch the minota on a blackbirding cruise to malaita and i took my wife along  the hatchet marks were still raw on the door of our tiny stateroom advertising an event of a few months before  the event was the taking of captain mackenzies head captain mackenzie at that time being master of the minota  as we sailed in to langalanga the british cruiser the cambrian steamed out from the shelling of a village  it is not expedient to burden this preliminary to my story with further details which i do make asseveration i possess aplenty  i hope i have given some assurance that the adventures of my dog hero in this novel are real adventures in a very real cannibal world  bless youwhen i took my wife along on the cruise of the minota we found on board a nigger chasing adorable irish terrier puppy who was smoothcoated like jerry and whose name was peggy  had it not been for peggy this book would never have been written  she was the chattel of the minotas splendid skipper  so much did mrs london and i come to love her that mrs london after the wreck of the minota deliberately and shamelessly stole her from the minotas skipper  i do further admit that i did deliberately and shamelessly compound my wifes felony  we loved peggy so  dear royal glorious little dog buried at sea off the east coast of australia  i must add that peggy like jerry was born at meringe lagoon on meringe plantation which is of the island of ysabel said ysabel island lying next north of florida island where is the seat of government and where dwells the resident commissioner mr c m woodford  still further and finally i knew peggys mother and father well and have often known the warm surge in the heart of me at the sight of that faithful couple running side by side along the beach  terrence was his real name  her name was biddy  jack london waikiki beach honolulu oahu th june 5 1915      chapter i   not until mister haggin abruptly picked him up under one arm and stepped into the sternsheets of the waiting whaleboat did jerry dream that anything untoward was to happen to him  mister haggin was jerrys beloved master and had been his beloved master for the six months of jerrys life  jerry did not know mister haggin as master for master had no place in jerrys vocabulary jerry being a smoothcoated goldensorrel irish terrier  but in jerrys vocabulary mister haggin possessed all the definiteness of sound and meaning that the word master possesses in the vocabularies of humans in relation to their dogs  mister haggin was the sound jerry had always heard uttered by bob the clerk and by derby the foreman on the plantation when they addressed his master  also jerry had always heard the rare visiting twolegged mancreatures such as came on the arangi address his master as mister haggin  but dogs being dogs in their dim inarticulate brilliant and heroic worshipping ways misappraising humans dogs think of their masters and love their masters more than the facts warrant  master means to them as mister haggin meant to jerry a deal more and a great deal more than it means to humans  the human considers himself as master to his dog but the dog considers his master god  now god was no word in jerrys vocabulary despite the fact that he already possessed a definite and fairly large vocabulary  mister haggin was the sound that meant god  in jerrys heart and head in the mysterious centre of all his activities that is called consciousness the sound mister haggin occupied the same place that god occupies in human consciousness  by word and sound to jerry mister haggin had the same connotation that god has to godworshipping humans  in short mister haggin was jerrys god  and so when mister haggin or god or call it what one will with the limitations of language picked jerry up with imperative abruptness tucked him under his arm and stepped into the whaleboat whose black crew immediately bent to the oars jerry was instantly and nervously aware that the unusual had begun to happen  never before had he gone out on board the arangi which he could see growing larger and closer to each liphissing stroke of the oars of the blacks  only an hour before jerry had come down from the plantation house to the beach to see the arangi depart  twice before in his halfyear of life had he had this delectable experience  delectable it truly was running up and down the white beach of sandpounded coral and under the wise guidance of biddy and terrence taking part in the excitement of the beach and even adding to it  there was the niggerchasing  jerry had been born to hate niggers  his first experiences in the world as a puling puppy had taught him that biddy his mother and his father terrence hated niggers  a nigger was something to be snarled at  a nigger unless he were a houseboy was something to be attacked and bitten and torn if he invaded the compound biddy did it  terrence did it  in doing it they served their godmister haggin  niggers were twolegged lesser creatures who toiled and slaved for their twolegged white lords who lived in the labour barracks afar off and who were so much lesser and lower that they must not dare come near the habitation of their lords  and niggerchasing was adventure  not long after he had learned to sprawl jerry had learned that  one took his chances  as long as mister haggin or derby or bob was about the niggers took their chasing  but there were times when the white lords were not about  then it was ware niggers  one must dare to chase only with due precaution because then beyond the white lords eyes the niggers had a way not merely of scowling and muttering but of attacking fourlegged dogs with stones and clubs  jerry had seen his mother so mishandled and ere he had learned discretion alone in the high grass had been himself club mauled by godarmy the black who wore a china doorknob suspended on his chest from his neck on a string of sennit braided from cocoanut fibre more  jerry remembered another highgrass adventure when he and his brother michael had fought owmi another black distinguishable for the cogged wheels of an alarm clock on his chest  michael had been so severely struck on his head that for ever after his left ear had remained sore and had withered into a peculiar wilted and twisted upward cock  still more  there had been his brother patsy and his sister kathleen who had disappeared two months before who had ceased and no longer were the great god mister haggin had raged up and down the plantation  the bush had been searched  half a dozen niggers had been whipped  and mister haggin had failed to solve the mystery of patsys and kathleens disappearance  but biddy and terrence knew  so did michael and jerry the fourmonths old patsy and kathleen had gone into the cookingpot at the barracks and their puppysoft skins had been destroyed in the fire jerry knew this as did his father and mother and brother for they had smelled the unmistakable burntmeat smell and terrence in his rage of knowledge had even attacked mogom the houseboy and been reprimanded and cuffed by mister haggin who had not smelled and did not understand and who had always to impress discipline on all creatures under his rooftree  but on the beach when the blacks whose terms of service were up came down with their tradeboxes on their heads to depart on the arangi was the time when niggerchasing was not dangerous  old scores could be settled and it was the last chance for the blacks who departed on the arangi never came back  as an instance this very morning biddy remembering a secret mauling at the hands of lerumie laid teeth into his naked calf and threw him sprawling into the water tradebox earthly possessions and all and then laughed at him sure in the protection of mister haggin who grinned at the episode  then too there was usually at least one bushdog on the arangi at which jerry and michael from the beach could bark their heads off once terrence who was nearly as large as an airedale and fully as lion heartedterrence the magnificent as tom haggin called himhad caught such a bushdog trespassing on the beach and given him a delightful thrashing in which jerry and michael and patsy and kathleen who were at the time alive had joined with many shrill yelps and sharp nips jerry had never forgotten the ecstasy of the hair unmistakably doggy in scent which had filled his mouth at his one successful nip  bushdogs were dogshe recognized them as his kind but they were somehow different from his own lordly breed different and lesser just as the blacks were compared with mister haggin derby and bob  but jerry did not continue to gaze at the nearing arangi  biddy wise with previous bitter bereavements had sat down on the edge of the sand her forefeet in the water and was mouthing her woe  that this concerned him jerry knew for her grief tore sharply albeit vaguely at his sensitive passionate heart  what it presaged he knew not save that it was disaster and catastrophe connected with him  as he looked back at her roughcoated and griefstricken he could see terrence hovering solicitously near her  he too was roughcoated as was michael and as patsy and kathleen had been jerry being the one smoothcoated member of the family  further although jerry did not know it and tom haggin did terrence was a royal lover and a devoted spouse  jerry from his earliest impressions could remember the way terrence had of running with biddy miles and miles along the beaches or through the avenues of cocoanuts side by side with her both with laughing mouths of sheer delight  as these were the only dogs besides his brothers and sisters and the several eruptions of strange bushdogs that jerry knew it did not enter his head otherwise than that this was the way of dogs male and female wedded and faithful  but tom haggin knew its unusualness  proper affinities he declared and repeatedly declared with warm voice and moist eyes of appreciation  a gentleman that terrence and a fourlegged proper man  a mandog if there ever was one foursquare as the legs on the four corners of him  and prepotent  my word  his bloodd breed true for a thousand generations and the cool head and the kindly brave heart of him  terrence did not voice his sorrow if sorrow he had but his hovering about biddy tokened his anxiety for her  michael however yielding to the contagion sat beside his mother and barked angrily out across the increasing stretch of water as he would have barked at any danger that crept and rustled in the jungle  this too sank to jerrys heart adding weight to his sure intuition that dire fate he knew not what was upon him  for his six months of life jerry knew a great deal and knew very little he knew without thinking about it without knowing that he knew why biddy the wise as well as the brave did not act upon all the message that her heart voiced to him and spring into the water and swim after him  she had protected him like a lioness when the big puarka which in jerrys vocabulary along with grunts and squeals was the combination of sound or word for pig had tried to devour him where he was cornered under the highpiled plantation house  like a lioness when the cookboy had struck him with a stick to drive him out of the kitchen had biddy sprung upon the black receiving without wince or whimper one straight blow from the stick and then downing him and mauling him among his pots and pans until dragged for the first time snarling away by the unchiding mister haggin who however administered sharp words to the cookboy for daring to lift hand against a fourlegged dog belonging to a god  jerry knew why his mother did not plunge into the water after him  the salt sea as well as the lagoons that led out of the salt sea were taboo  taboo as word or sound had no place in jerrys vocabulary but its definition or significance was there in the quickest part of his consciousness  he possessed a dim vague imperative knowingness that it was not merely not good but supremely disastrous leading to the mistily glimpsed sense of utter endingness for a dog for any dog to go into the water where slipped and slid and noiselessly paddled sometimes on top sometimes emerging from the depths great scaly monsters huge jawed and horriblytoothed that snapped down and engulfed a dog in an instant just as the fowls of mister haggin snapped and engulfed grains of corn  often he had heard his father and mother on the safety of the sand bark and rage their hatred of those terrible seadwellers when close to the beach they appeared on the surface like logs awash  crocodile was no word in jerrys vocabulary  it was an image an image of a log awash that was different from any log in that it was alive  jerry who heard registered and recognized many words that were as truly tools of thought to him as they were to humans but who by inarticulateness of birth and breed could not utter these many words nevertheless in his mental processes used images just as articulate men use words in their own mental processes  and after all articulate men in the act of thinking willy nilly use images that correspond to words and that amplify words  perhaps in jerrys brain the rising into the foreground of consciousness of an image of a log awash connoted more intimate and fuller comprehension of the thing being thought about than did the word crocodile and its accompanying image in the foreground of a humans consciousness  for jerry really did know more about crocodiles than the average human  he could smell a crocodile farther off and more differentiatingly than could any man than could even a saltwater black or a bushman smell one  he could tell when a crocodile hauled up from the lagoon lay without sound or movement and perhaps asleep a hundred feet away on the floor mat of jungle  he knew more of the language of crocodiles than did any man  he had better means and opportunities of knowing  he knew their many noises that were as grunts and slubbers  he knew their anger noises their fear noises their food noises their love noises  and these noises were as definitely words in his vocabulary as are words in a humans vocabulary and these crocodile noises were tools of thought  by them he weighed and judged and determined his own consequent courses of action just like any human or just like any human lazily resolved upon no course of action but merely noted and registered a clear comprehension of something that was going on about him that did not require a correspondence of action on his part  and yet what jerry did not know was very much  he did not know the size of the world  he did not know that this meringe lagoon backed by high forested mountains and fronted and sheltered by the offshore coral islets was anything else than the entire world  he did not know that it was a mere fractional part of the great island of ysabel that was again one island of a thousand many of them greater that composed the solomon islands that men marked on charts as a group of specks in the vastitude of the farwestern south pacific  it was true there was a somewhere else or a something beyond of which he was dimly aware  but whatever it was it was mystery  out of it things that had not been suddenly were  chickens and puarkas and cats that he had never seen before had a way of abruptly appearing on meringe plantation  once even had there been an eruption of strange fourlegged horned and hairy creatures the images of which registered in his brain would have been identifiable in the brains of humans with what humans worded goats  it was the same way with the blacks  out of the unknown from the somewhere and something else too unconditional for him to know any of the conditions instantly they appeared fullstatured walking about meringe plantation with loincloths about their middles and bone bodkins through their noses and being put to work by mister haggin derby and bob  that their appearance was coincidental with the arrival of the arangi was an association that occurred as a matter of course in jerrys brain  further he did not bother save that there was a companion association namely that their occasional disappearances into the beyond was likewise coincidental with the arangis departure  jerry did not query these appearances and disappearances  it never entered his goldensorrel head to be curious about the affair or to attempt to solve it  he accepted it in much the way he accepted the wetness of water and the heat of the sun  it was the way of life and of the world he knew  his hazy awareness was no more than an awareness of somethingwhich by the way corresponds very fairly with the hazy awareness of the average human of the mysteries of birth and death and of the beyondness about which they have no definiteness of comprehension  for all that any man may gainsay the ketch arangi trader and blackbirder in the solomon islands may have signified in jerrys mind as much the mysterious boat that traffics between the two worlds as at one time the boat that charon sculled across the styx signified to the human mind  out of the nothingness men came  into the nothingness they went and they came and went always on the arangi  and to the arangi this hotwhite tropic morning jerry went on the whaleboat under the arm of his mister haggin while on the beach biddy moaned her woe and michael not sophisticated barked the eternal challenge of youth to the unknown      chapter ii   from the whaleboat up the low side of the arangi and over her six inch rail of teak to her teak deck was but a step and tom haggin made it easily with jerry still under his arm  the deck was cluttered with an exciting crowd  exciting the crowd would have been to untravelled humans of civilization and exciting it was to jerry although to tom haggin and captain van horn it was a mere commonplace of everyday life  the deck was small because the arangi was small  originally a teak built gentlemans yacht brassfitted copperfastened angleironed sheathed in manofwar copper and with a finkeel of bronze she had been sold into the solomon islands trade for the purpose of blackbirding or niggerrunning  under the law however this traffic was dignified by being called recruiting  the arangi was a labourrecruit ship that carried the newcaught cannibal blacks from remote islands to labour on the new plantations where white men turned dank and pestilential swamp and jungle into rich and stately cocoanut groves  the arangis two masts were of oregon cedar so scraped and hotparaffined that they shone like tan opals in the glare of sun  her excessive sail plan enabled her to sail like a witch and on occasion gave captain van horn his white mate and his fifteen black boats crew as much as they could handle  she was sixty feet over all and the cross beams of her crown deck had not been weakened by deckhouses  the only breaksand no beams had been cut for themwere the main cabin skylight and companionway the booby hatch forard over the tiny forecastle and the small hatch aft that let down into the storeroom  and on this small deck in addition to the crew were the return niggers from three farflung plantations  by return was meant that their three years of contract labour was up and that according to contract they were being returned to their home villages on the wild island of malaita  twenty of themfamiliar all to jerrywere from meringe thirty of them came from the bay of a thousand ships in the russell isles and the remaining twelve were from pennduffryn on the east coast of guadalcanar  in addition to theseand they were all on deck chattering and piping in queer almost elfish falsetto voiceswere the two white men captain van horn and his danish mate borckman making a total of seventynine souls  thought your heart d failed you at the last moment was captain van horns greeting a quick pleasure light glowing into his eyes as they noted jerry  it was sure near to doin it tom haggin answered  its only for you id a done it annyways  jerrys the best of the litter barrin michael of course the two of them bein all thats left and no better than them that was lost  now that kathleen was a sweet dog the spit of biddy if shed livedhere take m  with a jerk of abruptness he deposited jerry in van horns arms and turned away along the deck  an if bad luck comes to him ill never forgive you skipper he flung roughly over his shoulder  theyll have to take my head first the skipper chuckled  an not unlikely my brave laddy buck haggin growled  meringe owes somo four heads three from the dysentery an another wan from a tree fallin on him the last fortnight  he was the son of a chief at that  yes and theres two heads more that the arangi owes somo van horn nodded  you recollect down to the southard last year a chap named hawkins was lost in his whaleboat running the arli passage  haggin returning along the deck nodded  two of his boats crew were somo boys  id recruited them for ugi plantation  with your boys that makes six heads the arangi owes  but what of it  theres one saltwater village acrost on the weather coast where the arangi owes eighteen  i recruited them for aolo and being saltwater men they put them on the sandfly that was lost on the way to the santa cruz  theyve got a jack pot over there on the weather coastmy word the boy that could get my head would be a second carnegie  a hundred and fifty pigs and shell money no end the villages collected for the chap that gets me and delivers  and they aintyet haggin snorted  no fear was the cheerful retort  you talk like arbuckle used to talk haggin censured  mannys the time ive heard him string it off  poor old arbuckle  the most sure and most precautious chap that ever handled niggers  he never went to sleep without spreadin a box of tacks on the floor and when it wasnt them it was crumpled newspapers  i remember me well bein under the same roof at the time on florida when a big tomcat chased a cockroach into the papers  and it was blim blam blim six times an twice over with his two big horsepistols an the house perforated like a cullender likewise there was a dead tomcat  he could shoot in the dark with never an aim pullin trigger with the second finger and pointing with the first finger laid straight along the barrel  no sir my laddy buck  he was the bully boy with the glass eye  the nigger didnt live thatd lift his head  but they got m  they got m he lasted fourteen years too  it was his cookboy  hatcheted m before breakfast  an its well i remember our second trip into the bush after what was left of m  i saw his head after youd turned it over to the commissioner at tulagi van horn supplemented  an the peaceful quiet everyday face of him on it with almost the same old smile id seen a thousand times  it dried on m that way over the smokin fire  but they got m if it did take fourteen years theres mannys the head that goes to malaita mannys the time untooken but like the old pitcher its tooken in the end  but ive got their goat the captain insisted  when troubles hatching i go straight to them and tell them what  they cant get the hang of it  think ive got some powerful devildevil medicine  tom haggin thrust out his hand in abrupt goodbye resolutely keeping his eyes from dropping to jerry in the others arms  keep your eye on my return boys he cautioned as he went over the side till you land the last mothers son of m  theyve got no cause to love jerry or his breed an id hate ill to happen m at a niggers hands  an in the dark of the night tis like as not he can do a fare youwell overside  dont take your eye off m till youre quit of the last of m  at sight of big mister haggin deserting him and being pulled away in the whaleboat jerry wriggled and voiced his anxiety in a low whimpering whine  captain van horn snuggled him closer in his arm with a caress of his free hand  dont forget the agreement tom haggin called back across the widening water  if aught happens you jerrys to come back to me  ill make a paper to that same and put it with the ships articles was van horns reply  among the many words possessed by jerry was his own name and in the talk of the two men he had recognised it repeatedly and he was aware vaguely that the talk was related to the vague and unguessably terrible thing that was happening to him  he wriggled more determinedly and van horn set him down on the deck  he sprang to the rail with more quickness than was to be expected of an awkward puppy of six months and not the quick attempt of van horn to cheek him would have succeeded  but jerry recoiled from the open water lapping the arangis side  the taboo was upon him  it was the image of the log awash that was not a log but that was alive luminous in his brain that checked him  it was not reason on his part but inhibition which had become habit  he plumped down on his bob tail lifted golden muzzle skyward and emitted a long puppywail of dismay and grief  its all right jerry old man brace up and be a mandog van horn soothed him  but jerry was not to be reconciled  while this indubitably was a white skinned god it was not his god  mister haggin was his god and a superior god at that  even he without thinking about it at all recognized that  his mister haggin wore pants and shoes  this god on the deck beside him was more like a black  not only did he not wear pants and was barefooted and barelegged but about his middle just like any black he wore a brilliantcoloured loincloth that like a kilt fell nearly to his sunburnt knees  captain van horn was a handsome man and a striking man although jerry did not know it  if ever a holland dutchman stepped out of a rembrandt frame captain van horn was that one despite the fact that he was new york born as had been his knickerbocker ancestors before him clear back to the time when new york was not new york but new amsterdam  to complete his costume a floppy felt hat distinctly rembrandtish in effect perched half on his head and mostly over one ear a sixpenny white cotton undershirt covered his torso and from a belt about his middle dangled a tobacco pouch a sheathknife filled clips of cartridges and a huge automatic pistol in a leather holster  on the beach biddy who had hushed her grief lifted it again when she heard jerrys wail  and jerry desisting a moment to listen heard michael beside her barking his challenge and saw without being conscious of it michaels withered ear with its persistent upward cock again while captain van horn and the mate borckman gave orders and while the arangis mainsail and spanker began to rise up the masts jerry loosed all his heart of woe in what bob told derby on the beach was the grandest vocal effort he had ever heard from any dog and that except for being a bit thin caruso didnt have anything on jerry  but the song was too much for haggin who as soon as he had landed whistled biddy to him and strode rapidly away from the beach  at sight of her disappearing jerry was guilty of even more carusolike effects which gave great joy to a pennduffryn return boy who stood beside him  he laughed and jeered at jerry with falsetto chucklings that were more like the junglenoises of treedwelling creatures halfbird and halfman than of a man all man and therefore a god  this served as an excellent counterirritant  indignation that a mere black should laugh at him mastered jerry and the next moment his puppy teeth sharp pointed as needles had scored the astonished blacks naked calf in long parallel scratches from each of which leaped the instant blood  the black sprang away in trepidation but the blood of terrence the magnificent was true in jerry and like his father before him he followed up slashing the blacks other calf into a ruddy pattern  at this moment anchor broken out and headsails running up captain van horn whose quick eye had missed no detail of the incident with an order to the black helmsman turned to applaud jerry  go to it jerry he encouraged  get him  shake him down  sick him get him  get him  the black in defence aimed a kick at jerry who leaping in instead of awayanother inheritance from terrenceavoided the bare foot and printed a further red series of parallel lines on the dark leg  this was too much and the black afraid more of van horn than of jerry turned and fled forard leaping to safety on top of the eight leeenfield rifles that lay on top of the cabin skylight and that were guarded by one member of the boats crew  about the skylight jerry stormed leaping up and falling back until captain van horn called him off  some niggerchaser that pup some niggerchaser van horn confided to borckman as he bent to pat jerry and give him due reward of praise  and jerry under this caressing hand of a god albeit it did not wear pants forgot for a moment longer the fate that was upon him  hes a liondogmore like an airedale than an irish terrier van horn went on to his mate still petting  look at the size of him already look at the bone of him  some chest that  hes got the endurance  and hell be some dog when he grows up to those feet of his  jerry had just remembered his grief and was starting a rush across the deck to the rail to gaze at meringe growing smaller every second in the distance when a gust of the southeast trade smote the sails and pressed the arangi down  and down the deck slanted for the moment to forty five degrees jerry slipped and slid vainly clawing at the smooth surface for a hold  he fetched up against the foot of the mizzenmast while captain van horn with the sailors eye for the coral patch under his bow gave the order hard alee  borckman and the black steersman echoed his words and as the wheel spun down the arangi with the swiftness of a witch rounded into the wind and attained a momentary even keel to the flapping of her headsails and a shifting of headsheets  jerry still intent on meringe took advantage of the level footing to recover himself and scramble toward the rail  but he was deflected by the crash of the mainsheet blocks on the stout decktraveller as the mainsail emptied of the wind and feeling the wind on the other side swung crazily across above him  he cleared the danger of the mainsheet with a wild leap although no less wild had been van horns leap to rescue him and found himself directly under the mainboom with the huge sail looming above him as if about to fall upon him and crush him  it was jerrys first experience with sails of any sort  he did not know the beasts much less the way of them but in his vivid recollection when he had been a tiny puppy burned the memory of the hawk in the middle of the compound that had dropped down upon him from out of the sky  under that colossal threatened impact he crouched down to the deck above him falling upon him like a bolt from the blue was a winged hawk unthinkably vaster than the one he had encountered  but in his crouch was no hint of cower  his crouch was a gathering together an assembling of all the parts of him under the rule of the spirit of him for the spring upward to meet in mid career this monstrous menacing thing  but the succeeding fraction of a moment so that jerry leaping missed even the shadow of it the mainsail with a second crash of blocks on traveller had swung across and filled on the other tack  van horn had missed nothing of it  before in his time he had seen young dogs frightened into genuine fits by their first encounters with heavenfilling skyobscuring downimpending sails  this was the first dog he had seen leap with bared teeth undismayed to grapple with the huge unknown  with spontaneity of admiration van horn swept jerry from the deck and gathered him into his arms      chapter iii   jerry quite forgot meringe for the time being  as he well remembered the hawk had been sharp of beak and claw  this airflapping thunder crashing monster needed watching  and jerry crouching for the spring and ever struggling to maintain his footing on the slippery heeling deck kept his eyes on the mainsail and uttered low growls at any display of movement on its part  the arangi was beating out between the coral patches of the narrow channel into the teeth of the brisk trade wind  this necessitated frequent tacks so that overhead the mainsail was ever swooping across from port tack to starboard tack and back again making airnoises like the swish of wings sharply rattattatting its reef points and loudly crashing its mainsheet gear along the traveller  half a dozen times as it swooped overhead jerry leaped for it mouth open to grip lips writhed clear of the clean puppy teeth that shone in the sun like gems of ivory  failing in every leap jerry achieved a judgment  in passing it must be noted that this judgment was only arrived at by a definite act of reasoning  out of a series of observations of the thing in which it had threatened always in the same way a series of attacks he had found that it had not hurt him nor come in contact with him at all thereforealthough he did not stop to think that he was thinkingit was not the dangerous destroying thing he had first deemed it  it might be well to be wary of it though already it had taken its place in his classification of things that appeared terrible but were not terrible thus he had learned not to fear the roar of the wind among the palms when he lay snug on the plantationhouse veranda nor the onslaught of the waves hissing and rumbling into harmless foam on the beach at his feet  many times in the course of the day alertly and nonchalantly almost with a quizzical knowingness jerry cocked his head at the mainsail when it made sudden swooping movements or slacked and tautened its crashing sheetgear  but he no longer crouched to spring for it  that had been the first lesson and quickly mastered  having settled the mainsail jerry returned in mind to meringe  but there was no meringe no biddy and terrence and michael on the beach no mister haggin and derby and bob no beach no land with the palmtrees near and the mountains afar off everlastingly lifting their green peaks into the sky  always to starboard or to port at the bow or over the stern when he stood up resting his forefeet on the sixinch rail and gazing he saw only the ocean brokenfaced and turbulent yet orderly marching its whitecrested seas before the drive of the trade  had he had the eyes of a man nearly two yards higher than his own from the deck and had they been the trained eyes of a man sailorman at that jerry could have seen the low blur of ysabel to the north and the blur of florida to the south ever taking on definiteness of detail as the arangi sagged closehauled with a good full porttacked to the southeast trade  and had he had the advantage of the marine glasses with which captain van horn elongated the range of his eyes he could have seen to the east the far peaks of malaita lifting lifeshadowed pink cloudpuffs above the searim  but the present was very immediate with jerry  he had early learned the iron law of the immediate and to accept what was when it was rather than to strain after far other things  the sea was  the land no longer was  the arangi certainly was along with the life that cluttered her deck  and he proceeded to get acquainted with what wasin short to know and to adjust himself to his new environment  his first discovery was delightfula wilddog puppy from the ysabel bush being taken back to malaita by one of the meringe return boys  in age they were the same but their breeding was different  the wilddog was what he was a wilddog cringing and sneaking his ears for ever down his tail for ever between his legs for ever apprehending fresh misfortune and illtreatment to fall on him for ever fearing and resentful fending off threatened hurt with lips curling malignantly from his puppy fangs cringing under a blow squalling his fear and his pain and ready always for a treacherous slash if luck and safety favoured  the wilddog was maturer than jerry largerbodied and wiser in wickedness but jerry was blueblooded rightselected and valiant  the wilddog had come out of a selection equally rigid but it was a different sort of selection  the bush ancestors from whom he had descended had survived by being fearselected  they had never voluntarily fought against odds  in the open they had never attacked save when the prey was weak or defenceless  in place of courage they had lived by creeping and slinking and hiding from danger  they had been selected blindly by nature in a cruel and ignoble environment where the prize of living was to be gained in the main by the cunning of cowardice and on occasion by desperateness of defence when in a corner  but jerry had been loveselected and courageselected  his ancestors had been deliberately and consciously chosen by men who somewhere in the forgotten past had taken the wilddog and made it into the thing they visioned and admired and desired it to be  it must never fight like a rat in a corner because it must never be ratlike and slink into a corner  retreat must be unthinkable  the dogs in the past who retreated had been rejected by men  they had not become jerrys ancestors  the dogs selected for jerrys ancestors had been the brave ones the upstanding and outdashing ones who flew into the face of danger and battled and died but who never gave ground  and since it is the way of kind to beget kind jerry was what terrence was before him and what terrences forefathers had been for a long way back  so it was that jerry when he chanced upon the wilddog stowed shrewdly away from the wind in the leecorner made by the mainmast and the cabin skylight did not stop to consider whether the creature was bigger or fiercer than he  all he knew was that it was the ancient enemythe wild dog that had not come in to the fires of man  with a wild paean of joy that attracted captain van horns allhearing ears and allseeing eyes jerry sprang to the attack  the wild puppy gained his feet in full retreat with incredible swiftness but was caught by the rush of jerrys body and rolled over and over on the sloping deck  and as he rolled and felt sharp teeth pricking him he snapped and snarled alternating snarls with whimperings and squallings of terror pain and abject humility  and jerry was a gentleman which is to say he was a gentle dog  he had been so selected  because the thing did not fight back because it was abject and whining because it was helpless under him he abandoned the attack disengaging himself from the top of the tangle into which he had slid in the lee scuppers  he did not think about it  he did it because he was so made  he stood up on the reeling deck feeling excellently satisfied with the delicious wilddoggy smell of hair in his mouth and consciousness and in his ears and consciousness the praising cry of captain van horn good boy jerry  youre the goods jerry  some dog eh  some dog  as he stalked away it must be admitted that jerry displayed pride in himself his gait being a trifle stifflegged the cocking of his head back over his shoulder at the whining wilddog having all the articulateness of well i guess i gave you enough this time  youll keep out of my way after this  jerry continued the exploration of his new and tiny world that was never at rest for ever lifting heeling and lunging on the rolling face of the sea  there were the meringe return boys  he made it a point to identify all of them receiving while he did so scowls and mutterings and reciprocating with cocky bullyings and threatenings  being so trained he walked on his four legs superior to them twolegged though they were for he had moved and lived always under the aegis of the great twolegged and betrousered god mister haggin  then there were the strange return boys from pennduffryn and the bay of a thousand ships  he insisted on knowing them all  he might need to know them in some future time  he did not think this  he merely equipped himself with knowledge of his environment without any awareness of provision or without bothering about the future  in his own way of acquiring knowledge he quickly discovered just as on the plantation houseboys were different from fieldboys that on the arangi there was a classification of boys different from the return boys  this was the boats crew  the fifteen blacks who composed it were closer than the others to captain van horn  they seemed more directly to belong to the arangi and to him  they laboured under him at word of command steering at the wheel pulling and hauling on ropes healing water upon the deck from overside and scrubbing with brooms  just as jerry had learned from mister haggin that he must be more tolerant of the houseboys than of the fieldboys if they trespassed on the compound so from captain van horn he learned that he must be more tolerant of the boats crew than of the return boys  he had less license with them more license with the others  as long as captain van horn did not want his boats crew chased it was jerrys duty not to chase  on the other hand he never forgot that he was a whitegods dog  while he might not chase these particular blacks he declined familiarity with them  he kept his eye on them  he had seen blacks as tolerated as these lined up and whipped by mister haggin  they occupied an intermediate place in the scheme of things and they were to be watched in case they did not keep their place  he accorded them room but he did not accord them equality  at the best he could be standoffishly considerate of them  he made thorough examination of the galley a rude affair open on the open deck exposed to wind and rain and storm a small stove that was not even a ships stove on which somehow aided by strings and wedges commingled with much smoke two blacks managed to cook the food for the fourscore persons on board  next he was interested by a strange proceeding on the part of the boats crew  upright pipes serving as stanchions were being screwed into the top of the arangis rail so that they served to support three strands of barbed wire that ran completely around the vessel being broken only at the gangway for a narrow space of fifteen inches  that this was a precaution against danger jerry sensed without a passing thought to it all his life from his first impressions of life had been passed in the heart of danger everimpending from the blacks  in the plantation house at meringe always the several white men had looked askance at the many blacks who toiled for them and belonged to them  in the livingroom where were the eatingtable the billiardtable and the phonograph stood stands of rifles and in each bedroom beside each bed ready to hand had been revolvers and rifles  as well mister haggin and derby and bob had always carried revolvers in their belts when they left the house to go among their blacks  jerry knew these noisemaking things for what they wereinstruments of destruction and death  he had seen live things destroyed by them such as puarkas goats birds and crocodiles  by means of such things the whitegods by their will crossed space without crossing it with their bodies and destroyed live things  now he in order to damage anything had to cross space with his body to get to it  he was different  he was limited  all impossible things were possible to the unlimited twolegged whitegods  in a way this ability of theirs to destroy across space was an elongation of claw and fang  without pondering it or being conscious of it he accepted it as he accepted the rest of the mysterious world about him  once even had jerry seen his mister haggin deal death at a distance in another noiseway  from the veranda he had seen him fling sticks of exploding dynamite into a screeching mass of blacks who had come raiding from the beyond in the long war canoes beaked and black carved and inlaid with motherofpearl which they had left hauled up on the beach at the door of meringe  many precautions by the whitegods had jerry been aware of and so sensing it almost in intangible ways as a matter of course he accepted this barbedwire fence on the floating world as a mark of the persistence of danger  disaster and death hovered close about waiting the chance to leap upon life and drag it down  life had to be very alive in order to live was the law jerry had learned from the little of life he knew  watching the rigging up of the barbed wire jerrys next adventure was an encounter with lerumie the return boy from meringe who only that morning on the beach embarking had been rolled by biddy along with his possessions into the surf  the encounter occurred on the starboard side of the skylight alongside of which lerumie was standing as he gazed into a cheap trademirror and combed his kinky hair with a handcarved comb of wood  jerry scarcely aware of lerumies presence was trotting past on his way aft to where borckman the mate was superintending the stringing of the barbed wire to the stanchions  and lerumie with a sidelong look to see if the deed meditated for his foot was screened from observation aimed a kick at the son of his fourlegged enemy  his bare foot caught jerry on the sensitive end of his recently bobbed tail and jerry outraged with the sense of sacrilege committed upon him went instantly wild  captain van horn standing aft on the port quarter gauging the slant of the wind on the sails and the inadequate steering of the black at the wheel had not seen jerry because of the intervening skylight  but his eyes had taken in the shoulder movement of lerumie that advertised the balancing on one foot while the other foot had kicked  and from what followed he divined what had already occurred  jerrys outcry as he sprawled whirled sprang and slashed was a veritable puppyscream of indignation  he slashed ankle and foot as he received the second kick in midair and although he slid clear down the slope of deck into the scuppers he left on the black skin the red tracery of his puppyneedle teeth  still screaming his indignation he clawed his way back up the steep wooden hill  lerumie with another sidelong look knew that he was observed and that he dare not go to extremes  he fled along the skylight to escape down the companionway but was caught by jerrys sharp teeth in his calf jerry attacking blindly got in the way of the blacks feet  a long stumbling fall accelerated by a sudden increase of wind in the sails ensued and lerumie vainly trying to catch his footing fetched up against the three strands of barbed wire on the lee rail  the deckfull of blacks shrieked their merriment and jerry his rage undiminished his immediate antagonist out of the battle mistaking himself as the object of the laughter of the blacks turned upon them charging and slashing the many legs that fled before him  they dropped down the cabin and forecastle companionways ran out the bowsprit and sprang into the rigging till they were perched everywhere in the air like monstrous birds  in the end the deck belonged to jerry save for the boats crew for he had already learned to differentiate  captain van horn was hilariously vocal of his praise calling jerry to him and giving him manthumps of joyful admiration  next the captain turned to his many passengers and orated in bechedemer english  hey  you fella boy  i make m big fella talk  this fella dog he belong along me  one fella boy hurt m that fella dogmy wordme cross too much along that fella boy  i knock m seven bells outa that fella boy  you take m care leg belong you  i take m care dog belong me  savve  and the passengers still perched in the air with gleaming black eyes and with querulerus chirpings one to another accepted the white mans law  even lerumie variously lacerated by the barbed wire did not scowl nor mutter threats  instead and bringing a roar of laughter from his fellows and a twinkle into the skippers eyes he rubbed questing fingers over his scratches and murmured my word  some big fella dog that fella  it was not that jerry was unkindly  like biddy and terrence he was fierce and unafraid which attributes were wrapped up in his heredity and like biddy and terrence he delighted in niggerchasing which in turn was a matter of training  from his earliest puppyhood he had been so trained  niggers were niggers but white men were gods and it was the whitegods who had trained him to chase niggers and keep them in their proper lesser place in the world  all the world was held in the hollow of the white mans hands  the niggerswell had not he seen them always compelled to remain in their lesser place  had he not seen them on occasion triced up to the palmtrees of the meringe compound and their backs lashed to ribbons by the whitegods  small wonder that a highborn irish terrier in the arms of love of the whitegod should look at niggers through whitegods eyes and act toward niggers in the way that earned the whitegods reward of praise  it was a busy day for jerry  everything about the arangi was new and strange and so crowded was she that exciting things were continually happening  he had another encounter with the wilddog who treacherously attacked him in flank from ambuscade  trade boxes belonging to the blacks had been irregularly piled so that a small space was left between two boxes in the lower tier  from this hole as jerry trotted past in response to a call from the skipper the wilddog sprang scratched his sharp puppyteeth into jerrys yellowvelvet hide and scuttled back into his lair  again jerrys feelings were outraged  he could understand flank attack often he and michael had played at that although it had only been playing  but to retreat without fighting from a fight once started was alien to jerrys ways and nature  with righteous wrath he charged into the hole after his enemy  but this was where the wilddog fought to best advantagein a corner  when jerry sprang up in the confined space he bumped his head on the box above and the next moment felt the snarling impact of the others teeth against his own teeth and jaw  there was no getting at the wilddog no chance to rush against him whole heartedly with generous full weight in the attack  all jerry could do was to crawl and squirm and belly forward and always he was met by a snarling mouthful of teeth  even so he would have got the wilddog in the end had not borckman in passing reached in and dragged jerry out by a hindleg  again came captain van horns call and jerry obedient trotted on aft  a meal was being served on deck in the shade of the spanker and jerry sitting between the two men received his share  already he had made the generalization that of the two the captain was the superior god giving many orders that the mate obeyed  the mate on the other hand gave orders to the blacks but never did he give orders to the captain furthermore jerry was developing a liking for the captain so he snuggled close to him  when he put his nose into the captains plate he was gently reprimanded  but once when he merely sniffed at the mates steaming teacup her received a snub on the nose from the mates grimy forefinger  also the mate did not offer him food  captain van horn gave him first of all a pannikin of oatmeal mush generously flooded with condensed cream and sweetened with a heaping spoonful of sugar  after that on occasion he gave him morsels of buttered bread and slivers of fried fish from which he first carefully picked the tiny bones  his beloved mister haggin had never fed him from the table at meal time and jerry was beside himself with the joy of this delightful experience  and being young he allowed his eagerness to take possession of him so that soon he was unduly urging the captain for more pieces of fish and of bread and butter  once he even barked his demand this put the idea into the captains head who began immediately to teach him to speak  at the end of five minutes he had learned to speak softly and to speak only oncea low mellow belllike bark of a single syllable  also in this first five minutes he had learned to sit down as distinctly different from lie down and that he must sit down whenever he spoke and that he must speak without jumping or moving from the sitting position and then must wait until the piece of food was passed to him  further he had added three words to his vocabulary  for ever after speak would mean to him speak and sit down would mean sit down and would not mean lie down  the third addition to his vocabulary was skipper  that was the name he had heard the mate repeatedly call captain van horn  and just as jerry knew that when a human called michael that the call referred to michael and not to biddy or terrence or himself so he knew that skipper was the name of the two legged white master of this new floating world  that isnt just a dog was van horns conclusion to the mate  theres a sure enough human brain there behind those brown eyes  hes six months old  any boy of six years would be an infant phenomenon to learn in five minutes all that hes just learned  why gottferdang a dogs brain has to be like a mans  if he does things like a man hes got to think like a man      chapter iv   the companionway into the main cabin was a steep ladder and down this after his meal jerry was carried by the captain  the cabin was a long room extending for the full width of the arangi from a lazarette aft to a tiny room forard  forard of this room separated by a tight bulkhead was the forecastle where lived the boats crew  the tiny room was shared between van horn and borckman while the main cabin was occupied by the threescore and odd return boys  they squatted about and lay everywhere on the floor and on the long low bunks that ran the full length of the cabin along either side  in the little stateroom the captain tossed a blanket on the floor in a corner and he did not find it difficult to get jerry to understand that that was his bed  nor did jerry with a full stomach and weary from so much excitement find it difficult to fall immediately asleep  an hour later he was awakened by the entrance of borckman  when he wagged his stub of a tail and smiled friendly with his eyes the mate scowled at him and muttered angrily in his throat  jerry made no further overtures but lay quietly watching  the mate had come to take a drink in truth he was stealing the drink from van horns supply  jerry did not know this  often on the plantation he had seen the white men take drinks  but there was something somehow different in the manner of borckmans taking a drink  jerry was aware vaguely that there was something surreptitious about it  what was wrong he did not know yet he sensed the wrongness and watched suspiciously  after the mate departed jerry would have slept again had not the carelessly latched door swung open with a bang  opening his eyes prepared for any hostile invasion from the unknown he fell to watching a large cockroach crawling down the wall  when he got to his feet and warily stalked toward it the cockroach scuttled away with a slight rustling noise and disappeared into a crack  jerry had been acquainted with cockroaches all his life but he was destined to learn new things about them from the particular breed that dwelt on the arangi  after a cursory examination of the stateroom he wandered out into the cabin  the blacks sprawled about everywhere but conceiving it to be his duty to his skipper jerry made it a point to identify each one they scowled and uttered low threatening noises when he sniffed close to them  one dared to menace him with a blow but jerry instead of slinking away showed his teeth and prepared to spring  the black hastily dropped the offending hand to his side and made soothing penitent noises while others chuckled and jerry passed on his way  it was nothing new  always a blow was to be expected from blacks when white men were not around  both the mate and the captain were on deck and jerry though unafraid continued his investigations cautiously  but at the doorless entrance to the lazarette aft he threw caution to the winds and darted in in pursuit of the new scent that came to his nostrils  a strange person was in the low dark space whom he had never smelled  clad in a single shift and lying on a coarse grassmat spread upon a pile of tobacco cases and fiftypound tins of flour was a young black girl  there was something furtive and lurking about her that jerry did not fail to sense and he had long since learned that something was wrong when any black lurked or skulked  she cried out with fear as he barked an alarm and pounced upon her  even though his teeth scratched her bare arm she did not strike at him  not did she cry out again  she cowered down and trembled and did not fight back  keeping his teeth locked in the hold he had got on her flimsy shift he shook and dragged at her all the while growling and scolding for her benefit and yelping a high clamour to bring skipper or the mate  in the course of the struggle the girl overbalanced on the boxes and tins and the entire heap collapsed  this caused jerry to yelp a more frenzied alarm while the blacks peering in from the cabin laughed with cruel enjoyment  when skipper arrived jerry wagged his stump tail and with ears laid back dragged and tugged harder than ever at the thin cotton of the girls garment  he expected praise for what he had done but when skipper merely told him to let go he obeyed with the realization that this lurking fearstruck creature was somehow different and must be treated differently from other lurking creatures  fearstruck she was as it is given to few humans to be and still live van horn called her his parcel of trouble and he was anxious to be rid of the parcel without however the utter annihilation of the parcel  it was this annihilation which he had saved her from when he bought her in even exchange for a fat pig  stupid worthless spiritless sick not more than a dozen years old no delight in the eyes of the young men of her village she had been consigned by her disappointed parents to the cookingpot  when captain van horn first encountered her had been when she was the central figure in a lugubrious procession on the banks of the balebuli river  anything but a beautyhad been his appraisal when he halted the procession for a powwow  lean from sickness her skin mangy with the dry scales of the disease called bukua she was tied hand and foot and like a pig slung from a stout pole that rested on the shoulders of the bearers who intended to dine off of her  too hopeless to expect mercy she made no appeal for help though the horrible fear that possessed her was eloquent in her wildstaring eyes  in the universal bechedemer english captain van horn had learned that she was not regarded with relish by her companions and that they were on their way to stake her out up to her neck in the running water of the balebuli  but first before they staked her their plan was to dislocate her joints and break the big bones of the arms and legs  this was no religious rite no placation of the brutish jungle gods  merely was it a matter of gastronomy  living meat so treated was made tender and tasty and as her companions pointed out she certainly needed to be put through such a process  two days in the water they told the captain ought to do the business  then they would kill her build the fire and invite in a few friends  after half an hour of bargaining during which captain van horn had insisted on the worthlessness of the parcel he had bought a fat pig worth five dollars and exchanged it for her  thus since he had paid for the pig in trade goods and since trade goods were rated at a hundred per cent profit the girl had actually cost him two dollars and fifty cents  and then captain van horns troubles had begun  he could not get rid of the girl  too well he knew the natives of malaita to turn her over to them anywhere on the island  chief ishikola of suu had offered five twenties of drinking coconuts for her and bau a bush chief had offered two chickens on the beach at malu  but this last offer had been accompanied by a sneer and had tokened the old rascals scorn of the girls scrawniness  failing to connect with the missionary brig the western cross on which she would not have been eaten captain van horn had been compelled to keep her in the cramped quarters of the arangi against a problematical future time when he would be able to turn her over to the missionaries  but toward him the girl had no heart of gratitude because she had no brain of understanding  she who had been sold for a fat pig considered her pitiful role in the world to be unchanged  eatee she had been  eatee she remained  her destination merely had been changed and this big fella white marster of the arangi would undoubtedly be her destination when she had sufficiently fattened  his designs on her had been transparent from the first when he had tried to feed her up  and she had outwitted him by resolutely eating no more than would barely keep her alive  as a result she who had lived in the bush all her days and never so much as set foot in a canoe rocked and rolled unendingly over the broad ocean in a perpetual nightmare of fear  in the bechedemer that was current among the blacks of a thousand islands and ten thousand dialects the arangis procession of passengers assured her of her fate  my word you fella mary one would say to her short time little bit that big fella white marster kaikai along you  or another big fella white marster kaikai along you my word belly belong him walk about too much  kaikai was the bechedemer for eat  even jerry knew that  eat did not obtain in his vocabulary but kaikai did and it meant all and more than eat for it served for both noun and verb  but the girl never replied to the jeering of the blacks  for that matter she never spoke at all not even to captain van horn who did not so much as know her name  it was late afternoon after discovering the girl in the lazarette when jerry again came on deck  scarcely had skipper who had carried him up the steep ladder dropped him on deck than jerry made a new discoveryland  he did not see it but he smelled it  his nose went up in the air and quested to windward along the wind that brought the message and he read the air with his nose as a man might read a newspaperthe salt smells of the seashore and of the dank muck of mangrove swamps at low tide the spicy fragrances of tropic vegetation and the faint most faint acrid tingle of smoke from smudgy fires  the trade which had laid the arangi well up under the lee of this outjutting point of malaita was now failing so that she began to roll in the easy swells with crashings of sheets and tackles and thunderous flappings of her sails  jerry no more than cocked a contemptuous quizzical eye at the mainsail anticking above him  he knew already the empty windiness of its threats but he was careful of the mainsheet blocks and walked around the traveller instead of over it  while captain van horn taking advantage of the calm to exercise the boats crew with the firearms and to limber up the weapons was passing out the leeenfields from their place on top the cabin skylight jerry suddenly crouched and began to stalk stifflegged  but the wilddog three feet from his lair under the tradeboxes was not unobservant  he watched and snarled threateningly  it was not a nice snarl  in fact it was as nasty and savage a snarl as all his life had been nasty and savage  most small creatures were afraid of that snarl but it had no deterrent effect on jerry who continued his steady stalking  when the wilddog sprang for the hole under the boxes jerry sprang after missing his enemy by inches  tossing overboard bits of wood bottles and empty tins captain van horn ordered the eight eager boats crew with rifles to turn loose  jerry was excited and delighted with the fusillade and added his puppy yelpings to the noise  as the empty brass cartridges were ejected the return boys scrambled on the deck for them esteeming them as very precious objects and thrusting them still warm into the empty holes in their ears  their ears were perforated with many of these holes the smallest capable of receiving a cartridge while the larger ones containedclay pipes sticks of tobacco and even boxes of matches some of the holes in the earlobes were so huge that they were plugged with carved wooden cylinders three inches in diameter  mate and captain carried automatics in their belts and with these they turned loose shooting away clip after clip to the breathless admiration of the blacks for such marvellous rapidity of fire  the boats crew were not even fair shots but van horn like every captain in the solomons knew that the bush natives and saltwater men were so much worse shots and knew that the shooting of his boats crew could be depended uponif the boats crew itself did not turn against the ship in a pinch  at first borckmans automatic jammed and he received a caution from van horn for his carelessness in not keeping it clean and thinoiled  also borckman was twittingly asked how many drinks he had taken and if that was what accounted for his shooting being under his average  borckman explained that he had a touch of fever and van horn deferred stating his doubts until a few minutes later squatting in the shade of the spanker with jerry in his arms he told jerry all about it  the trouble with him is the schnapps jerry he explained  gottfer dang it makes me keep all my watches and half of his  and he says its the fever  never believe it jerry  its the schnappsjust the plain s chnapps schnapps  an hes a good sailorman jerry when hes sober  but when hes schnappy hes sheer lunatic  then his noddle goes pinwheeling and hes a blighted fool and hed snore in a gale and suffer for sleep in a dead calmjerry youre just beginning to pad those four little soft feet of yours into the world so take the advice of one who knows and leave the schnapps alone  believe me jerry boylisten to your fatherschnapps will never buy you anything  whereupon leaving jerry on deck to stalk the wilddog captain van horn went below into the tiny stateroom and took a long drink from the very bottle from which borckman was stealing  the stalking of the wilddog became a game at least to jerry who was so made that his heart bore no malice and who hugely enjoyed it  also it gave him a delightful consciousness of his own mastery for the wilddog always fled from him  at least so far as dogs were concerned jerry was cock of the deck of the arangi  it did not enter his head to query how his conduct affected the wilddog though in truth he led that individual a wretched existence  never except when jerry was below did the wild one dare venture more than several feet from his retreat and he went about in fear and trembling of the fat rolypoly puppy who was unafraid of his snarl  in the late afternoon jerry trotted aft after having administered another lesson to the wilddog and found skipper seated on the deck back against the low rail knees drawn up and gazing absently off to leeward  jerry sniffed his bare calfnot that he needed to identify it but just because he liked to and in a sort of friendly greeting  but van horn took no notice continuing to stare out across the sea  nor was he aware of the puppys presence  jerry rested the length of his chin on skippers knee and gazed long and earnestly into skippers face  this time skipper knew and was pleasantly thrilled but still he gave no sign  jerry tried a new tack skippers hand drooped idly half open from where the forearm rested on the other knee  into the partopen hand jerry thrust his soft golden muzzle to the eyes and remained quite still  had he been situated to see he would have seen a twinkle in skippers eyes which had been withdrawn from the sea and were looking down upon him  but jerry could not see  he kept quiet a little longer and then gave a prodigious sniff  this was too much for skipper who laughed with such genial heartiness as to lay jerrys silky ears back and down in selfdeprecation of affection and pleadingness to bask in the sunshine of the gods smile  also skippers laughter set jerrys tail wildly bobbing  the halfopen hand closed in a firm grip that gathered in the slack of the skin of one side of jerrys head and jowl  then the hand began to shake him back and forth with such good will that he was compelled to balance back and forth on all his four feet  it was bliss to jerry  nay more it was ecstasy  for jerry knew there was neither anger nor danger in the roughness of the shake and that it was play of the sort that he and michael had indulged in  on occasion he had so played with biddy and lovingly mauled her about  and on very rare occasion mister haggin had lovingly mauled him about  it was speech to jerry full of unmistakable meaning  as the shake grew rougher jerry emitted his most ferocious growl which grew more ferocious with the increasing violence of the shaking  but that too was play a making believe to hurt the one he liked too well to hurt  he strained and tugged at the grip trying to twist his jowl in the slack of skin so as to reach a bite  when skipper with a quick thrust released him and shoved him clear he came back all teeth and growl to be again caught and shaken  the play continued with rising excitement to jerry  once too quick for skipper he caught his hand between teeth but he did not bring them together they pressed lovingly denting the skin but there was no bite in them  the play grew rougher and jerry lost himself in the play  still playing he grew so excited that all that had been feigned became actual this was battle a struggle against the hand that seized and shook him and thrust him away  the makebelieve of ferocity passed out of his growls the ferocity in them became real  also in the moments when he was shoved away and was springing back to the attack he yelped in highpitched puppy hysteria  and captain van horn realizing suddenly instead of clutching extended his hand wide open in the peace sign that is as ancient as the human hand  at the same time his voice rang out the single word jerry  in it was all the imperativeness of reproof and command and all the solicitous insistence of love  jerry knew and was checked back to himself  he was instantly contrite all soft humility ears laid back with pleadingness for forgiveness and protestation of a warm throbbing heart of love  instantly from an open mouthed fangbristling dog in full career of attack he melted into a bundle of softness and silkiness that trotted to the open hand and kissed it with a tongue that flashed out between white gleaming teeth like a rosered jewel  and the next moment he was in skippers arms jowl against cheek and the tongue was again flashing out in all the articulateness possible for a creature denied speech  it was a veritable lovefeast as dear to one as to the other  gottferdang captain van horn crooned  youre nothing but a bunch of highstrung sensitiveness with a golden heart in the middle and a golden coat wrapped all around  gottferdang jerry youre gold pure gold inside and out and no dog was ever minted like you in all the world  youre heart of gold you golden dog and be good to me and love me as i shall always be good to you and love you for ever and for ever  and captain van horn who ruled the arangi in bare legs a loin cloth and a sixpenny undershirt and ran cannibal blacks back and forth in the blackbird trade with an automatic strapped to his body waking and sleeping and with his head forfeit in scores of saltwater villages and bush strongholds and who was esteemed the toughest skipper in the solomons where only men who are tough may continue to live and esteem toughness blinked with sudden moisture in his eyes and could not see for the moment the puppy that quivered all its body of love in his arms and kissed away the salty softness of his eyes      chapter v   and swift tropic night smote the arangi as she alternately rolled in calms and heeled and plunged ahead in squalls under the lee of the cannibal island of malaita  it was a stoppage of the southeast trade wind that made for variable weather and that made cooking on the exposed deck galley a misery and sent the return boys who had nothing to wet but their skins scuttling below  the first watch from eight to twelve was the mates and captain van horn forced below by the driving wet of a heavy rain squall took jerry with him to sleep in the tiny stateroom  jerry was weary from the manifold excitements of the most exciting day in his life and he was asleep and kicking and growling in his sleep ere skipper with a last look at him and a grin as he turned the lamp low muttered aloud its that wilddog jerry  get him  shake him  shake him hard  so soundly did jerry sleep that when the rain having robbed the atmosphere of its last breath of wind ceased and left the stateroom a steaming suffocating furnace he did not know when skipper panting for air his loin cloth and undershirt soaked with sweat arose tucked blanket and pillow under his arm and went on deck  jerry only awakened when a huge threeinch cockroach nibbled at the sensitive and hairless skin between his toes  he awoke kicking the offended foot and gazed at the cockroach that did not scuttle but that walked dignifiedly away  he watched it join other cockroaches that paraded the floor  never had he seen so many gathered together at one time and never had he seen such large ones  they were all of a size and they were everywhere  long lines of them poured out of cracks in the walls and descended to join their fellows on the floor  the thing was indecentat least in jerrys mind it was not to be tolerated  mister haggin derby and bob had never tolerated cockroaches and their rules were his rules  the cockroach was the eternal tropic enemy  he sprang at the nearest pouncing to crush it to the floor under his paws  but the thing did what he had never known a cockroach to do  it arose in the air strongflighted as a bird  and as if at a signal all the multitude of cockroaches took wings of flight and filled the room with their flutterings and circlings  he attacked the winged host leaping into the air snapping at the flying vermin trying to knock them down with his paws  occasionally he succeeded and destroyed one nor did the combat cease until all the cockroaches as if at another signal disappeared into the many cracks leaving the room to him  quickly his next thought was where is skipper  he knew he was not in the room though he stood up on his hindlegs and investigated the low bunk his keen little nose quivering delightedly while he made little sniffs of delight as he smelled the recent presence of skipper  and what made his nose quiver and sniff likewise made his stump of a tail bob back and forth  but where was skipper  it was a thought in his brain that was as sharp and definite as a similar thought would be in a human brain  and it similarly preceded action  the door had been left hooked open and jerry trotted out into the cabin where half a hundred blacks made queer sleepmoanings and sighings and snorings  they were packed closely together covering the floor as well as the long sweep of bunks so that he was compelled to crawl over their naked legs  and there was no white god about to protect him  he knew it but was unafraid  having made sure that skipper was not in the cabin jerry prepared for the perilous ascent of the steep steps that were almost a ladder then recollected the lazarette  in he trotted and sniffed at the sleeping girl in the cotton shift who believed that van horn was going to eat her if he could succeed in fattening her  back at the laddersteps he looked up and waited in the hope that skipper might appear from above and carry him up  skipper had passed that way he knew and he knew for two reasons  it was the only way he could have passed and jerrys nose told him that he had passed  his first attempt to climb the steps began well  not until a third of the way up as the arangi rolled in a sea and recovered with a jerk did he slip and fall  two or three boys awoke and watched him while they prepared and chewed betel nut and lime wrapped in green leaves  twice barely started jerry slipped back and more boys awakened by their fellows sat up and enjoyed his plight  in the fourth attempt he managed to gain half way up before he fell coming down heavily on his side  this was hailed with low laughter and querulous chirpings that might well have come from the throats of huge birds  he regained his feet absurdly bristled the hair on his shoulders and absurdly growled his high disdain of these lesser twolegged things that came and went and obeyed the wills of great whiteskinned twolegged gods such as skipper and mister haggin  undeterred by his heavy fall jerry essayed the ladder again  a temporary easement of the arangis rolling gave him his opportunity so that his forefeet were over the high combing of the companion when the next big roll came  he held on by main strength of his bent forelegs then scrambled over and out on deck  amidships squatting on the deck near the skylight he investigated several of the boats crew and lerumie  he identified them circumspectly going suddenly stifflegged as lerumie made a low hissing menacing noise  aft at the wheel he found a black steering and near him the mate keeping the watch  just as the mate spoke to him and stooped to pat him jerry whiffed skipper somewhere near at hand with a conciliating apologetic bob of his tail he trotted on up wind and came upon skipper on his back rolled in a blanket so that only his head stuck out and sound asleep  first of all jerry needs must joyfully sniff him and joyfully wag his tail  but skipper did not awake and a fine spray of rain almost as thin as mist made jerry curl up and press closely into the angle formed by skippers head and shoulder  this did awake him for he uttered jerry in a low crooning voice and jerry responded with a touch of his cold damp nose to the others cheek  and then skipper went to sleep again but not jerry  he lifted the edge of the blanket with his nose and crawled across the shoulder until he was altogether inside  this roused skipper who halfasleep helped him to curl up  still jerry was not satisfied and he squirmed around until he lay in the hollow of skippers arm his head resting on skippers shoulder when with a profound sigh of content he fell asleep  several times the noises made by the boats crew in trimming the sheets to the shifting draught of air roused van horn and each time remembering the puppy he pressed him caressingly with his hollowed arm and each time in his sleep jerry stirred responsively and snuggled cosily to him  for all that he was a remarkable puppy jerry had his limitations and he could never know the effect produced on the hardbitten captain by the soft warm contact of his velvet body  but it made the captain remember back across the years to his own girl babe asleep on his arm  and so poignantly did he remember that he became wide awake and many pictures beginning with the girl babe burned their torment in his brain  no white man in the solomons knew what he carried about with him waking and often sleeping and it was because of these pictures that he had come to the solomons in a vain effort to erase them  first memoryprodded by the soft puppy in his arm he saw the girl and the mother in the little harlem flat  small it was true but tightpacked with the happiness of three that made it heaven  he saw the girls flaxenyellow hair darken to her mothers gold as it lengthened into curls and ringlets until finally it became two thick long braids  from striving not to see these many pictures he came even to dwelling upon them in the effort so to fill his consciousness as to keep out the one picture he did not want to see  he remembered his work the wrecking car and the wrecking crew that had toiled under him and he wondered what had become of clancey his right hand man  came the long day when routed from bed at three in the morning to dig a surface car out of the wrecked show windows of a drug store and get it back on the track they had laboured all day clearing up a halfdozen smashups and arrived at the car house at nine at night just as another call came in  glory be said clancey who lived in the next block from him  he could see him saying it and wiping the sweat from his grimy face  glory be tis a small matter at most an right in our neighbourhoodnot a dozen blocks away  soon as its done we can beat it for home an let the down town boys take the car back to the shop  weve only to jack her up for a moment he had answered  what is it billy jaffers another of the crew asked  somebody run overcant get them out he said as they swung on board the wreckingcar and started  he saw again all the incidents of the long run not omitting the delay caused by hosecarts and a hookandladder running to a crosstown fire during which time he and clancey had joked jaffers over the dates with various fictitious damsels out of which he had been cheated by the nights extra work  came the long line of stalled streetcars the crowd the police holding it back the two ambulances drawn up and waiting their freight and the young policeman whose beat it was white and shaken greeting him with its horrible man  its fair sickening  two of them  we cant get them out  i tried  one was still living i think  but he strong man and hearty used to such work weary with the hard day and with a pleasant picture of the bright little flat waiting him a dozen blocks away when the job was done spoke cheerfully confidently saying that hed have them out in a jiffy as he stooped and crawled under the car on hands and knees  again he saw himself as he pressed the switch of his electric torch and looked  again he saw the twin braids of heavy golden hair ere his thumb relaxed from the switch leaving him in darkness  is the one alive yet the shaken policeman asked  and the question was repeated while he struggled for will power sufficient to press on the light  he heard himself reply ill tell you in a minute  again he saw himself look  for a long minute he looked  both dead he answered quietly  clancey pass in a number three jack and get under yourself with another at the other end of the truck  he lay on his back staring straight up at one single star that rocked mistily through a thinning of cloudstuff overhead  the old ache was in his throat the old harsh dryness in mouth and eyes  and he knewwhat no other man knewwhy he was in the solomons skipper of the teakbuilt yacht arangi running niggers risking his head and drinking more scotch whiskey than was good for any man  not since that night had he looked with warm eyes on any woman  and he had been noted by other whites as notoriously cold toward pickanninnies white or black  but having visioned the ultimate horror of memory van horn was soon able to fall asleep again delightfully aware as he drowsed off of jerrys head on his shoulder  once when jerry dreaming of the beach at meringe and of mister haggin biddy terrence and michael set up a low whimpering van horn roused sufficiently to soothe him closer to him and to mutter ominously any nigger thatd hurt that pup     at midnight when the mate touched him on the shoulder in the moment of awakening and before he was awake van horn did two things automatically and swiftly  he darted his right hand down to the pistol at his hip and muttered any nigger thatd hurt that pup     thatll be kopo point abreast borckman explained as both men stared to windward at the high loom of the land  she hasnt made more than ten miles and no promise of anything steady  theres plenty of stuff making up there if itll ever come down van horn said as both men transferred their gaze to the clouds drifting with many breaks across the dim stars  scarcely had the mate fetched a blanket from below and turned in on deck than a brisk steady breeze sprang up from off the land sending the arangi through the smooth water at a nineknot clip  for a time jerry tried to stand the watch with skipper but he soon curled up and dozed off partly on the deck and partly on skippers bare feet  when skipper carried him to the blanket and rolled him in he was quickly asleep again and he was quickly awake out of the blanket and padding after along the deck as skipper paced up and down  here began another lesson and in five minutes jerry learned it was the will of skipper that he should remain in the blanket that everything was all right and that skipper would be up and down and near him all the time  at four the mate took charge of the deck  reeled off thirty miles van horn told him  but now it is baffling again  keep an eye for squalls under the land  better throw the halyards down on deck and make the watch stand by  of course theyll sleep but make them sleep on the halyards and sheets  jerry roused to skippers entrance under the blanket and quite as if it were a longestablished custom curled in between his arm and side and after one happy sniff and one kiss of his cool little tongue as skipper pressed his cheek against him caressingly dozed off to sleep  half an hour later to all intents and purposes so far as jerry could or could not comprehend the world might well have seemed suddenly coming to an end  what awoke him was the flying leap of skipper that sent the blanket one way and jerry the other  the deck of the arangi had become a wall down which jerry slipped through the roaring dark  every rope and shroud was thrumming and screeching in resistance to the fierce weight of the squall  stand by main halyardsjump he could hear skipper shouting loudly also he heard the high note of the mainsheet screaming across the sheaves as van horn bending braces in the dark was swiftly slacking the sheet through his scorching palms with a single turn on the cleat  while all this along with many other noises squealings of boatboys and shouts of borckman was impacting on jerrys eardrums he was still sliding down the steep deck of his new and unstable world  but he did not bring up against the rail where his fragile ribs might well have been broken  instead the warm ocean water pouring inboard across the buried rail in a flood of pale phosphorescent fire cushioned his fall  a raffle of trailing ropes entangled him as he struck out to swim  and he swam not to save his life not with the fear of death upon him there was but one idea in his mind  where was skipper  not that he had any thought of trying to save skipper nor that he might be of assistance to him  it was the heart of love that drives one always toward the beloved  as the mother in catastrophe tries to gain her babe as the greek who dying remembered sweet argos as soldiers on a stricken field pass with the names of their women upon their lips so jerry in this wreck of a world yearned toward skipper  the squall ceased as abruptly as it had struck  the arangi righted with a jerk to an even keel leaving jerry stranded in the starboard scuppers  he trotted across the level deck to skipper who standing erect on widespread legs the bight of the mainsheet still in his hand was exclaiming  gottferdang  wind he go  rain he no come  he felt jerrys cool nose against his bare calf heard his joyous sniff and bent and caressed him  in the darkness he could not see but his heart warmed with knowledge that jerrys tail was surely bobbing  many of the frightened return boys had crowded on deck and their plaintive querulous voices sounded like the sleepy noises of a roost of birds  borckman came and stood by van horns shoulder and both men strung to their tones in the tenseness of apprehension strove to penetrate the surrounding blackness with their eyes while they listened with all their ears for any message of the elements from sea and air  wheres the rain borckman demanded peevishly  always wind first the rain follows and kills the wind  there is no rain  van horn still stared and listened and made no answer  the anxiety of the two men was sensed by jerry who too was on his toes  he pressed his cool nose to skippers leg and the rosekiss of his tongue brought him the salt taste of seawater  skipper bent suddenly rolled jerry with quick toughness into the blanket and deposited him in the hollow between two sacks of yams lashed on deck aft of the mizzenmast  as an afterthought he fastened the blanket with a piece of rope yarn so that jerry was as if tied in a sack  scarcely was this finished when the spanker smashed across overhead the headsails thundered with a sudden filling and the great mainsail with all the scope in the boomtackle caused by van horns giving of the sheet came across and fetched up to tautness on the tackle with a crash that shook the vessel and heeled her violently to port  this second knockdown had come from the opposite direction and it was mightier than the first  jerry heard skippers voice ring out first to the mate stand by main halyards  throw off the turns  ill take care of the tackle and next to some of the boats crew batto you fella slack spanker tackle quick fella  ranga you fella let go spanker sheet  here van horn was swept off his legs by an avalanche of return boys who had cluttered the deck with the first squall  the squirming mass of which he was part slid down into the barbed wire of the port rail beneath the surface of the sea  jerry was so secure in his nook that he did not roll away  but when he heard skippers commands cease and seconds later heard his cursings in the barbed wire he set up a shrill yelping and clawed and scratched frantically at the blanket to get out  something had happened to skipper  he knew that  it was all that he knew for he had no thought of himself in the chaos of the ruining world  but he ceased his yelping to listen to a new noisea thunderous slatting of canvas accompanied by shouts and cries  he sensed and sensed wrongly that it boded ill for he did not know that it was the mainsail being lowered on the run after skipper had slashed the boomtackle across with his sheathknife  as the pandemonium grew he added his own yelping to it until he felt a fumbling hand without the blanket  he stilled and sniffed  no it was not skipper  he sniffed again and recognized the person  it was lerumie the black whom he had seen rolled on the beach by biddy only the previous morning who still were recently had kicked him on his stub of a tail and who not more than a week before he had seen throw a rock at terrence  the rope yarn had been parted and lerumies fingers were feeling inside the blanket for him  jerry snarled his wickedest  the thing was sacrilege  he as a white mans dog was taboo to all blacks  he had early learned the law that no nigger must ever touch a whitegods dog yet lerumie who was all of evil at this moment when the world crashed about their ears was daring to touch him  and when the fingers touched him his teeth closed upon them  next he was clouted by the blacks free hand with such force as to tear his clenched teeth down the fingers through skin and flesh until the fingers went clear  raging like a tiny fiend jerry found himself picked up by the neck half throttled and flung through the air  and while flying through the air he continued to squall his rage  he fell into the sea and went under gulping a mouthful of salt water into his lungs and came up strangling but swimming  swimming was one of the things he did not have to think about  he had never had to learn to swim any more than he had had to learn to breathe  in fact he had been compelled to learn to walk but he swam as a matter of course  the wind screamed about him  flying froth driven on the winds breath filled his mouth and nostrils and beat into his eyes stinging and blinding him  in the struggle to breathe he all unlearned in the ways of the sea lifted his muzzle high in the air to get out of the suffocating welter  as a result off the horizontal the churning of his legs no longer sustained him and he went down and under perpendicularly again he emerged strangling with more salt water in his windpipe  this time without reasoning it out merely moving along the line of least resistance which was to him the line of greatest comfort he straightened out in the sea and continued so to swim as to remain straightened out  through the darkness as the squall spent itself came the slatting of the halflowered mainsail the shrill voices of the boats crew a curse of borckmans and dominating all skippers voice shouting  grab the leech you fella boys  hang on  drag down strong fella  come in mainsheet two blocks  jump damn you jump      chapter vi   at recognition of skippers voice jerry floundering in the stiff and crisping sea that sprang up with the easement of the wind yelped eagerly and yearningly all his love for his newfound beloved eloquent in his throat  but quickly all sounds died away as the arangi drifted from him  and then in the loneliness of the dark on the heaving breast of the sea that he recognized as one more of the eternal enemies he began to whimper and cry plaintively like a lost child  further by the dim shadowy ways of intuition he knew his weakness in that merciless sea with no heart of warmth that threatened the unknowable thing vaguely but terribly guessed namely death  as regarded himself he did not comprehend death  he who had never known the time when he was not alive could not conceive of the time when he would cease to be alive  yet it was there shouting its message of warning through every tissue cell every nerve quickness and brain sensitivity of hima totality of sensation that foreboded the ultimate catastrophe of life about which he knew nothing at all but which nevertheless he felt to be the conclusive supreme disaster  although he did not comprehend it he apprehended it no less poignantly than do men who know and generalize far more deeply and widely than mere fourlegged dogs  as a man struggles in the throes of nightmare so jerry struggled in the vexed saltsuffocating sea  and so he whimpered and cried lost child lost puppydog that he was only half a year existent in the fair world sharp with joy and suffering  and he wanted skipper  skipper was a god        on board the arangi relieved by the lowering of her mainsail as the fierceness went out of the wind and the cloudburst of tropic rain began to fall van horn and borckman lurched toward each other in the blackness  a double squall said van horn  hit us to starboard and to port  must asplit in half just before she hit us the mate concurred  and kept all the rain in the second half  van horn broke off with an oath  hey  whats the matter along you fella boy he shouted to the man at the wheel  for the ketch under her spanker which had just then been flathauled had come into the wind emptying her aftersail and permitting her headsails to fill on the other tack  the arangi was beginning to work back approximately over the course she had just traversed  and this meant that she was going back toward jerry floundering in the sea  thus the balance on which his life titubated was inclined in his favour by the blunder of a black steersman  keeping the arangi on the new tack van horn set borckman clearing the mess of ropes on deck himself squatting in the rain undertaking to longsplice the tackle he had cut  as the rain thinned so that the crackle of it on deck became less noisy he was attracted by a sound from out over the water  he suspended the work of his hands to listen and when he recognized jerrys wailing sprang to his feet galvanized into action  the pups overboard he shouted to borckman  back your jib to windard  he sprang aft scattering a cluster of return boys right and left  hey  you fella boats crew  come in spanker sheet  flatten her down good fella  he darted a look into the binnacle and took a hurried compass bearing of the sounds jerry was making  hard down your wheel he ordered the helmsman then leaped to the wheel and put it down himself repeating over and over aloud noreast by east a quarter noreast by east a quarter  back and peering into the binnacle he listened vainly for another wail from jerry in the hope of verifying his first hasty bearing  but not long he waited  despite the fact that by his manoeuvre the arangi had been hove to he knew that windage and seadriftage would quickly send her away from the swimming puppy  he shouted borckman to come aft and haul in the whaleboat while he hurried below for his electric torch and a boat compass  the ketch was so small that she was compelled to tow her one whaleboat astern on long double painters and by the time the mate had it hauled in under the stern van horn was back  he was undeterred by the barbed wire lifting boy after boy of the boats crew over it and dropping them sprawling into the boat following himself as the last by swinging over on the spanker boom and calling his last instructions as the painters were cast off  get a riding light on deck borckman  keep her hove to  dont hoist the mainsail  clean up the decks and bend the watch tackle on the main boom  he took the steeringsweep and encouraged the rowers with washeewashee good fella washeewasheewhich is the bechedemer for row hard  as he steered he kept flashing the torch on the boat compass so that he could keep headed northeast by east a quarter east  then he remembered that the boat compass on such course deviated two whole points from the arangis compass and altered his own course accordingly  occasionally he bade the rowers cease while he listened and called for jerry  he had them row in circles and work back and forth up to windward and down to leeward over the area of dark sea that he reasoned must contain the puppy  now you fella boy listen ear belong you he said toward the first maybe one fella boy hear m pickaninny dog sing out i give m that fella boy five fathom calico two ten sticks tobacco  at the end of half an hour he was offering two ten fathoms calico and ten ten sticks tobacco to the boy who first heard pickaninny dog sing out        jerry was in bad shape  not accustomed to swimming strangled by the salt water that lapped into his open mouth he was getting loggy when first he chanced to see the flash of the captains torch  this however he did not connect with skipper and so took no more notice of it than he did of the first stars showing in the sky  it never entered his mind that it might be a star nor even that it might not be a star  he continued to wail and to strangle with more salt water  but when he at length heard skippers voice he went immediately wild  he attempted to stand up and to rest his forepaws on skippers voice coming out of the darkness as he would have rested his forepaws on skippers leg had he been near  the result was disastrous  out of the horizontal he sank down and under coming up with a new spasm of strangling  this lasted for a short time during which the strangling prevented him from answering skippers cry which continued to reach him  but when he could answer he burst forth in a joyous yelp  skipper was coming to take him out of the stinging biting sea that blinded his eyes and hurt him to breathe  skipper was truly a god his god with a gods power to save  soon he heard the rhythmic clack of the oars on the tholepins and the joy in his own yelp was duplicated by the joy in skippers voice which kept up a running encouragement broken by objurgations to the rowers  all right jerry old man  all right jerry  all rightwasheewashee you fella boycoming jerry coming  stick it out old man  stay with itwasheewashee like hellhere we are jerry  stay with it  hang on old boy well get youeasy    easy  vast washee  and then with amazing abruptness jerry saw the whaleboat dimly emerge from the gloom close upon him was blinded by the stab of the torch full in his eyes and even as he yelped his joy felt and recognized skippers hand clutching him by the slack of the neck and lifting him into the air  he landed wet and soppily against skippers rainwet chest his tail bobbing frantically against skippers containing arm his body wriggling his tongue dabbing madly all over skippers chin and mouth and cheeks and nose  and skipper did not know that he was himself wet and that he was in the first shock of recurrent malaria precipitated by the wet and the excitement  he knew only that the puppydog given him only the previous morning was safe back in his arms  while the boats crew bent to the oars he steered with the sweep between his arm and his side in order that he might hold jerry with the other arm  you little son of a gun he crooned and continued to croon over and over  you little son of a gun  and jerry responded with tonguekisses whimpering and crying as is the way of lost children immediately after they are found  also he shivered violently  but it was not from the cold  rather was it due to his over strung sensitive nerves  again on board van horn stated his reasoning to the mate  the pup didnt just calmly walk overboard  nor was he washed overboard i had him fast and triced in the blanket with a rope yarn  he walked over the centre of the boats crew and of the threescore return boys who were all on deck and flashed his torch on the blanket still lying on the yams  that proves it  the ropeyarns cut  the knots still in it  now what nigger is responsible  he looked about at the circle of dark faces flashing the light on them and such was the accusation and anger in his eyes that all eyes fell before his or looked away  if only the pup could speak he complained  hed tell who it was  he bent suddenly down to jerry who was standing as close against his legs as he could so close that his wet forepaws rested on skippers bare feet  you know m jerry you known the black fella boy he said his words quick and exciting his hand moving in questing circles toward the blacks  jerry was all alive on the instant jumping about barking with short yelps of eagerness  i do believe the dog could lead me to him van horn confided to the mate  come on jerry find m sick m shake m down  where is he jerry  find m  find m  all that jerry knew was that skipper wanted something  he must find something that skipper wanted and he was eager to serve  he pranced about aimlessly and willingly for a space while skippers urging cries increased his excitement  then he was struck by an idea and a most definite idea it was  the circle of boys broke to let him through as he raced forard along the starboard side to the tightlashed heap of trade boxes  he put his nose into the opening where the wilddog laired and sniffed  yes the wilddog was inside  not only did he smell him but he heard the menace of his snarl  he looked up to skipper questioningly  was it that skipper wanted him to go in after the wilddog  but skipper laughed and waved his hand to show that he wanted him to search in other places for something else  he leaped away sniffing in likely places where experience had taught him cockroaches and rats might be  yet it quickly dawned on him that it was not such things skipper was after  his heart was wild with desire to serve and without clear purpose he began sniffing legs of black boys  this brought livelier urgings and encouragements from skipper and made him almost frantic  that was it  he must identify the boats crew and the return boys by their legs  he hurried the task passing swiftly from boy to boy until he came to lerumie  and then he forgot that skipper wanted him to do something  all he knew was that it was lerumie who had broken the taboo of his sacred person by laying hands on him and that it was lerumie who had thrown him overboard  with a cry of rage a flash of white teeth and a bristle of short neck hair he sprang for the black  lerumie fled down the deck and jerry pursued amid the laughter of all the blacks  several times in making the circuit of the deck he managed to scratch the flying calves with his teeth  then lerumie took to the main rigging leaving jerry impotently to rage on the deck beneath him  about this point the blacks grouped in a semicircle at a respectful distance with van horn to the fore beside jerry  van horn centred his electric torch on the black in the rigging and saw the long parallel scratches on the fingers of the hand that had invaded jerrys blanket  he pointed them out significantly to borckman who stood outside the circle so that no black should be able to come at his back  skipper picked jerry up and soothed his anger with  good boy jerry  you marked and sealed him  some dog you some big mandog  he turned back to lerumie illuminating him as he clung in the rigging and his voice was harsh and cold as he addressed him  what name belong along you fella boy he demanded  me fella lerumie came the chirping quavering answer  you come along pennduffryn  me come along meringe  captain van horn debated the while he fondled the puppy in his arms after all it was a return boy  in a day in two days at most he would have him landed and be quit of him  my word he harangued me angry along you  me angry big fella too much along you  me angry along you any amount  what name you fella boy make m pickaninny dog belong along me walk about along water  lerumie was unable to answer  he rolled his eyes helplessly resigned to receive a whipping such as he had long since bitterly learned white masters were wont to administer  captain van horn repeated the question and the black repeated the helpless rolling of his eyes  for two sticks tobacco i knock m seven bells outa you the skipper bullied  now me give you strong fella talk too much  you look m eye belong you one time along this fella dog belong me i knock m seven bells and whole starboard watch outa you  savve  me savve lerumie plaintively replied and the episode was closed  the return boys went below to sleep in the cabin  borckman and the boats crew hoisted the mainsail and put the arangi on her course  and skipper under a dry blanket from below lay down to sleep with jerry head on his shoulder in the hollow of his arm     chapter vii   at seven in the morning when skipper rolled him out of the blanket and got up jerry celebrated the new day by chasing the wilddog back into his hole and by drawing a snicker from the blacks on deck when with a growl and a flash of teeth he made lerumie sidestep half a dozen feet and yield the deck to him  he shared breakfast with skipper who instead of eating washed down with a cup of coffee fifty grains of quinine wrapped in a cigarette paper and who complained to the mate that he would have to get under the blankets and sweat out the fever that was attacking him  despite his chill and despite his teeth that were already beginning to chatter while the burning sun extracted the moisture in curling mistwreaths from the deck planking van horn cuddled jerry in his arms and called him princeling and prince and a king and a son of kings  for van horn had often listened to the recitals of jerrys pedigree by tom haggin over scotchandsodas when it was too pestilentially hot to go to bed  and the pedigree was as royalblooded as was possible for an irish terrier to possess whose breed beginning with the ancient irish wolfhound had been moulded and established by man in less than two generations of men  there was terrence the magnificentdescended as van horn remembered from the americanbred milton droleen out of the queen of county antrim breda muddler which royal bitch as every one who is familiar with the stud book knows goes back as far as the almost mythical spuds with along the way no primrose dallyings with blackandtan killeney boys and welsh nondescripts  and did not biddy trace to erin mother and star of the breed through a long descendant out of breda mixer herself an ancestress of breda muddler  nor could be omitted from the purple record the later ancestress moya doolen  so jerry knew the ecstasy of loving and of being loved in the arms of his lovegod although little he knew of such phrases as kings son and son of kings save that they connoted love for him in the same way that lerumies hissing noises connoted hate  one thing jerry knew without knowing that he knew namely that in the few hours he had been with skipper he loved him more than he had loved derby and bob who with the exception of mister haggin were the only other whitegods he had ever known  he was not conscious of this  he merely loved merely acted on the prompting of his heart or head or whatever organic or anatomical part of him that developed the mysterious delicious and insatiable hunger called love  skipper went below  he went all unheeding of jerry who padded softly at his heels until the companionway was reached  skipper was unheeding of jerry because of the fever that wrenched his flesh and chilled his bones that made his head seem to swell monstrously that glazed the world to his swimming eyes and made him walk feebly and totteringly like a drunken man or a man very aged  and jerry sensed that something was wrong with skipper  skipper beginning the babblings of delirium which alternated with silent moments of control in order to get below and under blankets descended the ladderlike stairs and jerry allyearning controlled himself in silence and watched the slow descent with the hope that when skipper reached the bottom he would raise his arms and lift him down  but skipper was too far gone to remember that jerry existed  he staggered with widespread arms to keep from falling along the cabin floor forard to the bunk in the tiny stateroom  jerry was truly of a kingly line  he wanted to call out and beg to be taken down  but he did not  he controlled himself he knew not why save that he was possessed by a nebulous awareness that skipper must be considered as a god should be considered and that this was no time to obtrude himself on skipper  his heart was torn with desire although he made no sound and he continued only to yearn over the companion combing and to listen to the faint sounds of skippers progress forard  but even kings and their descendants have their limitations and at the end of a quarter of an hour jerry was ripe to cease from his silence with the going below of skipper evidently in great trouble the light had gone out of the day for jerry  he might have stalked the wilddog but no inducement lay there  lerumie passed by unnoticed although he knew he could bully him and make him give deck space  the myriad scents of the land entered his keen nostrils but he made no note of them  not even the flopping bellying mainsail overhead as the arangi rolled becalmed could draw a glance of quizzical regard from him  just as it was tremblingly imperative that jerry must suddenly squat down point his nose at the zenith and vocalize his heartrending woe an idea came to him  there is no explaining how this idea came  no more can it be explained than can a human explain why at luncheon today he selects green peas and rejects string beans when only yesterday he elected to choose string beans and to reject green peas  no more can it be explained than can a human judge sentencing a convicted criminal and imposing eight years imprisonment instead of the five or nine years that also at the same time floated upward in his brain explain why he categorically determined on eight years as the just adequate punishment since not even humans who are almost halfgods can fathom the mystery of the genesis of ideas and the dictates of choice appearing in their consciousness as ideas it is not to be expected of a more dog to know the why of the ideas that animate it to definite acts toward definite ends  and so jerry  just as he must immediately howl he was aware that the idea an entirely different idea was there in the innermost centre of the quickthinkingness of him with all its compulsion  he obeyed the idea as a marionette obeys the strings and started forthwith down the deck aft in quest of the mate  he had an appeal to make to borckman  borckman was also a twolegged whitegod  easily could borckman lift him down the precipitous ladder which was to him unaided a taboo the violation of which was pregnant with disaster  but borckman had in him little of the heart of love which is understanding  also borckman was busy  besides overseeing the continuous adjustment by trimming of sails and orders to the helmsman of the arangi to her way on the sea and overseeing the boats crew at its task of washing deck and polishing brasswork he was engaged in steadily nipping from a stolen bottle of his captains whiskey which he had stowed away in the hollow between the two sacks of yams lashed on deck aft the mizzenmast  borckman was on his way for another nip after having thickly threatened to knock seven bells and the ten commandments out of the black at the wheel for faulty steering when jerry appeared before him and blocked the way to his desire  but jerry did not block him as he would have blocked lerumie for instance  there was no showing of teeth no bristling of neck hair  instead jerry was all placation and appeal all softness of pleading in a body denied speech that nevertheless was articulate from wagging tail and wriggling sides to flatlaid ears and eyes that almost spoke to any human sensitive of understanding  but borckman saw in his way only a fourlegged creature of the brute world which in his arrogant brutalness he esteemed more brute than himself  all the pretty picture of the soft puppy instinct with communicativeness bursting with tenderness of petition was veiled to his vision  what he saw was merely a fourlegged animal to be thrust aside while he continued his lordly twolegged progress toward the bottle that could set maggots crawling in his brain and make him dream dreams that he was prince not peasant that he was a master of matter rather than a slave of matter  and thrust aside jerry was by a rough and naked foot as harsh and unfeeling in its impact as an inanimate breaking sea on a beachjut of insensate rock  he halfsprawled on the slippery deck regained his balance and stood still and looked at the whitegod who had treated him so cavalierly  the meanness and unfairness had brought from jerry no snarling threat of retaliation such as he would have offered lerumie or any other black  nor in his brain was any thought of retaliation  this was no lerumie  this was a superior god twolegged whiteskinned like skipper like mister haggin and the couple of other superior gods he had known  only did he know hurt such as any child knows under the blow of a thoughtless or unloving mother  in the hurt was mingled a resentment  he was keenly aware that there were two sorts of roughness  there was the kindly roughness of love such as when skipper gripped him by the jowl shook him till his teeth rattled and thrust him away with an unmistakable invitation to come back and be so shaken again  such roughness to jerry was heaven  in it was the intimacy of contact with a beloved god who in such manner elected to express a reciprocal love  but this roughness of borckman was different  it was the other kind of roughness in which resided no warm affection no hearttouch of love jerry did not quite understand but he sensed the difference and resented without expressing in action the wrongness and unfairness of it  so he stood after regaining balance and soberly regarded in a vain effort to understand the mate with a bottlebottom inverted skyward the mouth to his lips the while his throat made gulping contractions and noises  and soberly he continued to regard the mate when he went aft and threatened to knock the song of songs and the rest of the old testament out of the black helmsman whose smile of teeth was as humbly gentle and placating as jerrys had been when he made his appeal  leaving this god as a god unliked and not understood jerry sadly trotted back to the companionway and yearned his head over the combing in the direction in which he had seen skipper disappear  what bit at his consciousness and was a painful incitement in it was his desire to be with skipper who was not right and who was in trouble  he wanted skipper  he wanted to be with him first and sharply because he loved him and second and dimly because he might serve him  and wanting skipper in his helplessness and youngness in experience of the world he whimpered and cried his heart out across the companion combing and was too clean and direct in his sorrow to be deflected by an outburst of anger against the niggers on deck and below who chuckled at him and derided him  from the crest of the combing to the cabin floor was seven feet  he had only a few hours before climbed the precipitous stairway but it was impossible and he knew it to descend the stairway  and yet at the last he dared it  so compulsive was the prod of his heart to gain to skipper at any cost so clear was his comprehension that he could not climb down the ladder head first with no grippingness of legs and feet and muscles such as were possible in the ascent that he did not attempt it  he launched outward and down in one magnificent and loveheroic leap  he knew that he was violating a taboo of life just as he knew he was violating a taboo if he sprang into meringe lagoon where swam the dreadful crocodiles  great love is always capable of expressing itself in sacrifice and selfimmolation  and only for love and for no lesser reason could jerry have made the leap  he struck on his side and head  the one impact knocked the breath out of him the other stunned him  even in his unconsciousness lying on his side and quivering he made rapid spasmodic movements of his legs as if running forard to skipper  the boys looked on and laughed and when he no longer quivered and churned his legs they continued to laugh  born in savagery having lived in savagery all their lives and known naught else their sense of humour was correspondingly savage  to them the sight of a stunned and possibly dead puppy was a sidesplitting ludicrous event  not until the fourth minute ticked off did returning consciousness enable jerry to crawl to his feet and with widespread legs and swimming eyes adjust himself to the arangis roll  yet with the first glimmerings of consciousness persisted the one idea that he must gain to skipper blacks  in his anxiety and solicitude and love they did not count  he ignored the chuckling grinning girding black boys who but for the fact that he was under the terrible aegis of the big fella white marster would have delighted to kill and eat the puppy who in the process of training was proving a most capable niggerchaser  without a turn of head or roll of eye aristocratically positing their nonexistingness to their faces he trotted forard along the cabin floor and into the stateroom where skipper babbled maniacally in the bunk  jerry who had never had malaria did not understand  but in his heart he knew great trouble in that skipper was in trouble  skipper did not recognize him even when he sprang into the bunk walked across skippers heaving chest and licked the acrid sweat of fever from skippers face instead skippers wildlythrashing arms brushed him away and flung him violently against the side of the bunk  this was roughness that was not loveroughness  nor was it the roughness of borckman spurning him away with his foot  it was part of skippers trouble  jerry did not reason this conclusion  but and to the point he acted upon it as if he had reasoned it  in truth through inadequacy of one of the most adequate languages in the world it can only be said that jerry sensed the new difference of this roughness  he sat up just out of range of one restless beating arm yearned to come closer and lick again the face of the god who knew him not and who he knew loved him well and palpitatingly shared and suffered all skippers trouble  eh clancey skipper babbled  its a fine job this day and no better crew to clean up after the dubs of motormen    number three jack clancey  get under the forard end  and as the spectres of his nightmare metamorphosed hush darling talking to your dad like that telling him the combing of your sweet and golden hair  as if i couldnt that have combed it these seven yearsbetter than your mother darling better than your mother  im the one goldmedal prizewinner in the combing of his lovely daughters lovely hair    shes broken out give her the wheel aft there  jib and foretopsail halyards  full and by there  a good full    ah she takes it like the beauty fairy boat that she is upon the sea   ill just lift thatsure the limit blackey when you pay as much to see my cards as im going to pay to see yours youre going to see some cards believe me  and so the farrago of unrelated memories continued to rise vocal on skippers lips to the heave of his body and the beat of his arms while jerry crouched against the side of the bunk mourned and mourned his grief and inability to be of help  all that was occurring was beyond him  he knew no more of poker hands than did he know of getting ships under way of clearing up surface car wrecks in new york or of combing the long yellow hair of a loved daughter in a harlem flat  both dead skipper said in a change of delirium  he said it quietly as if announcing the time of day then wailed but oh the bonnie bonnie braids of all the golden hair of her  he lay motionlessly for a space and sobbed out a breaking heart  this was jerrys chance  he crept inside the arm that tossed snuggled against skippers side laid his head on skippers shoulder his cool nose barely touching skippers cheek and felt the arm curl about him and press him closer  the hand bent from the wrist and caressed him protectingly and the warm contact of his velvet body put a change in skippers sick dreams for he began to mutter in cold and bitter ominousness any nigger that as much as bats an eye at that puppy       chapter viii   when in half an hour van horns sweat culminated in profusion it marked the breaking of the malarial attack  great physical relief was his and the last mists of delirium ebbed from his brain  but he was left limply weak and after tossing off the blankets and recognizing jerry he fell into a refreshing natural sleep  not till two hours later did he awake and start to go on deck  halfway up the companion he deposited jerry on deck and went back to the stateroom for a forgotten bottle of quinine  but he did not immediately return to jerry  the long drawer under borckmans bunk caught his eye the wooden button that held it shut was gone and it was far out and hanging at an angle that jammed it and prevented it from falling to the floor  the matter was serious  there was little doubt in his mind had the drawer in the midst of the squall of the previous night fallen to the floor that no arangi and no soul of the eighty souls on board would have been left  for the drawer was filled with a heterogeneous mess of dynamite sticks boxes of fulminating caps coils of fuses lead sinkers iron tools and many boxes of rifle revolver and pistol cartridges  he sorted and arranged the varied contents and with a screwdriver and a longer screw reattached the button  in the meantime jerry was encountering new adventure not of the pleasantest  while waiting for skipper to return jerry chanced to see the wilddog brazenly lying on deck a dozen feet from his lair in the tradeboxes  instantly stiffly crouching jerry began to stalk  success seemed assured for the wilddog with closed eyes was apparently asleep  and at this moment the mate twolegging it along the deck from forard in the direction of the bottle stored between the yam sacks called jerry in a remarkably husky voice  jerry flattened his filbertshaped ears and wagged his tail in acknowledgment but advertised his intention of continuing to stalk his enemy  and at sound of the mates voice the wilddog flung quickopened eyes in jerrys direction and flashed into his burrow where he immediately turned around thrust his head out with a show of teeth and snarled triumphant defiance  baulked of his quarry by the inconsiderateness of the mate jerry trotted back to the head of the companion to wait for skipper  but borckman whose brain was well acrawl by virtue of the many nips clung to a petty idea after the fashion of drunken men  twice again imperatively he called jerry to him and twice again with flattened ears of gentleness and wagging tail jerry goodnaturedly expressed his disinclination next he yearned his head over the coming and into the cabin after skipper  borckman remembered his first idea and continued to the bottle which he generously inverted skyward  but the second idea petty as it was persisted and after swaying and mumbling to himself for a time after unseeingly making believe to study the crisp fresh breeze that filled the arangis sails and slanted her deck and after sillily attempting on the helmsman to portray eaglelike vigilance in his drinkswimming eyes he lurched amidships toward jerry  jerrys first intimation of borckmans arrival was a cruel and painful clutch on his flank and groin that made him cry out in pain and whirl around  next as the mate had seen skipper do in play jerry had his jowls seized in a toothclattering shake that was absolutely different from the skippers rough loveshake  his head and body were shaken his teeth clattered painfully and with the roughest of roughness he was flung part way down the slippery slope of deck  now jerry was a gentleman  all the soul of courtesy was in him for equals and superiors  after all even in an inferior like the wilddog he did not consciously press an advantage very farnever extremely far in his stalking and rushing of the wilddog he had been more sound and fury than an overbearing bully  but with a superior with a twolegged whitegod like borckman there was more a demand upon his control restraint and inhibition of primitive promptings  he did not want to play with the mate a game that he ecstatically played with skipper because he had experienced no similar liking for the mate twolegged whitegod that he was  and still jerry was all gentleness  he came back in a feeble imitation rush of the wholehearted rush that he had learned to make on skipper  he was in truth acting playacting attempting to do what he had no heart prompting to do  he made believe to play and uttered simulated growls that failed of the verity of simulation  he bobbed his tail goodnaturedly and friendly and growled ferociously and friendly but the keenness of the drunkenness of the mate discerned the difference and aroused in him vaguely the intuition of difference of playacting of cheating  jerry was cheatingout of his heart of consideration  borckman drunkenly recognized the cheating without crediting the heart of good behind it  on the instant he was antagonistic  forgetting that he was only a brute he posited that this was no more than a brute with which he strove to play in the genial comradely way that the skipper played  red war was inevitablenot first on jerrys part but on borckmans part  borckman felt the abysmal urgings of the beast as a beast to prove himself master of this fourlegged beast  jerry felt his jowl and jaw clutched still more harshly and hardly and with increase of harshness and hardness he was flung farther down the deck which on account of its growing slant due to heavier gusts of wind had become a steep and slippery hill  he came back clawing frantically up the slope that gave him little footing and he came back no longer with poorly attempted simulation of ferocity but impelled by the first flickerings of real ferocity  he did not know this  if he thought at all he was under the impression that he was playing the game as he had played it with skipper  in short he was taking an interest in the game although a radically different interest from what he had taken with skipper  this time his teeth flashed quicker and with deeper intent at the jowl clutching hand and missing he was seized and flung down the smooth incline harder and farther than before  he was growing angry as he clawed back though he was not conscious of it  but the mate being a man albeit a drunken one sensed the change in jerrys attack ere jerry dreamed there was any change in it  and not only did borckman sense it but it served as a spur to drive him back into primitive beastliness and to fight to master this puppy as a primitive man under dissimilar provocation might have fought with the members of the first litter stolen from a wolfden among the rocks  true jerry could trace as far back  his ancient ancestors had been irish wolfhounds and long before that the ancestors of the wolfhounds had been wolves  the note in jerrys growls changed  the unforgotten and ineffaceable past strummed the fibres of his throat  his teeth flashed with fierce intent in the desire of sinking as deep in the mans hand as passion could drive  for jerry by this time was all passion  he had leaped back into the dark stark rawness of the early world almost as swiftly as had borckman  and this time his teeth scored ripping the tender and sensitive and flesh of all the inside of the first and second joints of borckmans right hand  jerrys teeth were needles that stung and borckman gaining the grasp on jerrys jaw flung him away and down so that almost he hit the arangis tinyrail ere his clawing feet stopped him  and van horn having finished his rearrangement and repair of the explosivefilled drawer under the mates bunk climbed up the companion steps saw the battle paused and quietly looked on  but he looked across a million years at two mad creatures who had slipped the leach of the generations and who were back in the darkness of spawning life ere dawning intelligence had modified the chemistry of such life to softness of consideration  what stirred in the brain crypts of borckmans heredity stirred in the braincrypts of jerrys heredity time had gone backward for both  all the endeavour and achievement of the ten thousand generations was not and as wolfdog and wildman the combat was between jerry and the mate  neither saw van horn who was inside the companionway hatch his eyes level with the combing  to jerry borckman was now no more a god than was he himself a mere smoothcoated irish terrier  both had forgotten the million years stamped into their heredity more feebly less eraseably than what had been stamped in prior to the million years  jerry did not know drunkenness but he did know unfairness and it was with raging indignation that he knew it  borckman fumbled his next counter to jerrys attack missed and had both hands slashed in quick succession ere he managed to send the puppy sliding  and still jerry came back  as any screaming creature of the jungle he hysterically squalled his indignation  but he made no whimper  nor did he wince or cringe to the blows  he bored straight in striving without avoiding a blow to beat and meet the blow with his teeth  so hard was he flung down the last time that his side smashed painfully against the rail and van horn cried out  cut that out borckman  leave the puppy alone  the mate turned in the startle of surprise at being observed  the sharp authoritative words of van horn were a call across the million years borckmans angerconvulsed face ludicrously attempted a sheepish deprecating grin and he was just mumbling we was only playing when jerry arrived back leaped in the air and sank his teeth into the offending hand  borckman immediately and insanely went back across the million years  an attempted kick got his ankle scored for his pains  he gibbered his own rage and hurt and stooping dealt jerry a tremendous blow alongside the head and neck  being in midleap when he received the blow jerry was twistingly somersaulted sidewise before he struck the deck on his back as swiftly as he could scramble to footing and charge he returned to the attack but was checked by skippers  jerry  stop it  come here  he obeyed but only by prodigious effort his neck bristling and his lips writhing clear of his teeth as he passed the mate  for the first time there was a whimper in his throat but it was not the whimper of fear nor of pain but of outrage and of desire to continue the battle which he struggled to control at skippers behest  stepping out on deck skipper picked him up and patted and soothed him the while he expressed his mind to the mate  borckman you ought to be ashamed  you ought to be shot or have your block knocked off for this  a puppy a little puppy scarcely weaned  for two cents id give you whatfor myself  the idea of it  a little puppy a weanling little puppy  glad your hands are ripped  you deserved it hope you get bloodpoisoning in them  besides youre drunk  go below and turn in and dont you dare come on deck until youre sober  savve  and jerry farjourneyer across life and across the history of all life that goes to make the world strugglingly mastering the abysmal slime of the prehistoric with the love that had come into existence and had become warp and woof of him in far later time his wrath of ancientness still faintly reverberating in his throat like the rumblings of a passing thunderstorm knew in the wide warm ways of feeling the augustness and righteousness of skipper  skipper was in truth a god who did right who was fair who protected and who imperiously commanded this other and lesser god that slunk away before his anger     chapter ix   jerry and skipper shared the long afternoonwatch together the latter being guilty of recurrent chuckles and exclamations such as gottfer dang jerry believe me youre some fighter and all dog or youre a proper mans dog you are a lion dog  i bet the lion dont live that could get your goat  and jerry understanding none of the words with the exception of his own name nevertheless knew that the sounds made by skipper were broad of praise and warm of love  and when skipper stooped and rubbed his ears or received a rosekiss on extended fingers or caught him up in his arms jerrys heart was nigh to bursting  for what greater ecstasy can be the portion of any creature than that it be loved by a god  this was just precisely jerrys ecstasy  this was a god a tangible real three dimensioned god who went about and ruled his world in a loincloth and on two bare legs and who loved him with crooning noises in throat and mouth and with two widespread arms that folded him in  at four oclock measuring a glance at the afternoon sun and gauging the speed of the arangi through the water in relation to the closeness of suu van horn went below and roughly shook the mate awake  until both returned jerry held the deck alone  but for the fact that the white gods were there below and were certain to be back at any moment not many moments would jerry have held the deck for every lessened mile between the return boys and malaita contributed a rising of their spirits and under the imminence of their oldtime independence lerumie as an instance of many of them with strong gustatory sensations and a positive drooling at the mouth regarded jerry in terms of food and vengeance that were identical  flathauled on the crisp breeze the arangi closed in rapidly with the land  jerry peered through the barbed wire sniffing the air skipper beside him and giving orders to the mate and helmsman  the heap of trade boxes was now unlashed and the boys began opening and shutting them what gave them particular delight was the ringing of the bell with which each box was equipped and which rang whenever a lid was raised  their pleasure in the toylike contrivance was that of children and each went back again and again to unlock his own box and make the bell ring  fifteen of the boys were to be landed at suu and with wild gesticulations and cries they began to recognize and point out the infinitesimal details of the landfall of the only spot they had known on earth prior to the day three years before when they had been sold into slavery by their fathers uncles and chiefs  a narrow neck of water scarcely a hundred yards across gave entrance to a long and tiny bay  the shore was massed with mangroves and dense tropical vegetation  there was no sign of houses nor of human occupancy although van horn staring at the dense jungle so close at hand knew as a matter of course that scores and perhaps hundreds of pairs of human eyes were looking at him  smell m jerry smell m he encouraged  and jerrys hair bristled as he barked at the mangrove wall for truly his keen scent informed him of lurking niggers  if i could smell like him the captain said to the mate there wouldnt be any risk at all of my ever losing my head  but borckman made no reply and sullenly went about his work  there was little wind in the bay and the arangi slowly forged in and dropped anchor in thirty fathoms  so steep was the slope of the harbour bed from the beach that even in such excessive depth the arangis stern swung in within a hundred feet of the mangroves  van horn continued to cast anxious glances at the wooded shore  for suu had an evil name  since the schooner fair hathaway recruiting labour for the queensland plantations had been captured by the natives and all hands slain fifteen years before no vessel with the exception of the arangi had dared to venture into suu  and most white men condemned van horns recklessness for so venturing  far up the mountains that towered many thousands of feet into the trade wind clouds arose many signal smokes that advertised the coming of the vessel  far and near the arangis presence was known yet from the jungle so near at hand only shrieks of parrots and chatterings of cockatoos could be heard  the whaleboat manned with six of the boats crew was drawn alongside and the fifteen suu boys and their boxes were loaded in  under the canvas flaps along the thwarts ready to hand for the rowers were laid five of the leeenfields  on deck another of the boats crew rifle in hand guarded the remaining weapons  borckman had brought up his own rifle to be ready for instant use  van horns rifle lay handy in the stern sheets where he stood near tambi who steered with a long sweep jerry raised a low whine and yearned over the rail after skipper who yielded and lifted him down  the place of danger was in the boat for there was little likelihood at this particular time of a rising of the return boys on the arangi being of somo noola langalanga and far malu they were in wholesome fear did they lose the protection of their white masters of being eaten by the suu folk just as the suu boys would have feared being eaten by the somo and langalanga and noola folk  what increased the danger of the boat was the absence of a covering boat the invariable custom of the larger recruiting vessels was to send two boats on any shore errand  while one landed on the beach the other lay off a short distance to cover the retreat of the shore party if trouble broke out  too small to carry one boat on deck the arangi could not conveniently tow two astern so van horn who was the most daring of the recruiters lacked this essential safeguard  tambi under van horns lowuttered commands steered a parallel course along the shore  where the mangroves ceased and where high ground and a beaten runway came down to the waters edge van horn motioned the rowers to back water and lay on their oars  high palms and lofty widebranched trees rose above the jungle at this spot and the runway showed like the entrance of a tunnel into the dense green wall of tropical vegetation  van horn regarding the shore for some sign of life lighted a cigar and put one hand to the waistline of his loincloth to reassure himself of the presence of the stick of dynamite that was tucked between the loin cloth and his skin  the lighted cigar was for the purpose if emergency arose of igniting the fuse of the dynamite  and the fuse was so short with its end split to accommodate the inserted head of a safety match that between the time of touching it off with the live cigar to the time of the explosion not more than three seconds could elapse  this required quick cool work on van horns part in case need arose  in three seconds he would have to light the fuse and throw the sputtering stick with directed aim to its objective  however he did not expect to use it and had it ready merely as a precautionary measure  five minutes passed and the silence of the shore remained profound jerry sniffed skippers bare leg as if to assure him that he was beside him no matter what threatened from the hostile silence of the land then stood up with his forepaws on the gunwale and continued to sniff eagerly and audibly to prick his neck hair and to utter low growls  theyre there all right skipper confided to him and jerry with a sideward glance of smiling eyes with a bobbing of his tail and a quick loveflattening of his ears turned his nose shoreward again and resumed his reading of the jungle tale that was wafted to him on the light fans of the stifling and almost stagnant air  hey van horn suddenly shouted  hey you fella boy stick m head out belong you  as if in a transformation scene the apparently tenantless jungle spawned into life  on the instant a hundred stark savages appeared  they broke forth everywhere from the vegetation  all were armed some with snider rifles and ancient horse pistols others with bows and arrows with long throwing spears with warclubs and with longhandled tomahawks  in a flash one of them leaped into the sunlight in the open space where runway and water met  save for decorations he was naked as adam before the fall  a solitary white feather uprose from his kinky glossy black hair  a polished bodkin of white petrified shell with sharppointed ends thrust through a hole in the partition of his nostrils extended five inches across his face  about his neck from a cord of twisted coconut sennit hung an ivorywhite necklace of wildboars tusks  a garter of white cowrie shells encircled one leg just below the knee  a flaming scarlet flower was coquettishly stuck over one ear and through a hole in the other ear was threaded a pigs tail so recently severed that it still bled  as this dandy of melanesia leaped into the sunshine the snider rifle in his hands came into position aimed from his hip the generous muzzle bearing directly on van horn  no less quick was van horn  with equal speed he had snatched his rifle and brought it to bear from his hip  so they stood and faced each other death in their fingertips forty feet apart  the million years between barbarism and civilization also yawned between them across that narrow gulf of forty feet  the hardest thing for modern evolved man to do is to forget his ancient training  easiest of all things is it for him to forget his modernity and slip back across time to the howling ages  a lie in the teeth a blow in the face a love thrust of jealousy to the heart in a fraction of an instant can turn a twentiethcentury philosopher into an apelike arborean pounding his chest gnashing his teeth and seeing red  so van horn  but with a difference  he straddled time  he was at one and the same instant all modern all imminently primitive capable of fighting in redness of tooth and claw desirous of remaining modern for as long as he could with his will master the study of ebon black of skin and dazzling white of decoration that confronted him  a long ten seconds of silence endured  even jerry he knew not why stilled the growl in his throat  five score of headhunting cannibals on the fringe of the jungle fifteen suu return blacks in the boat seven black boats crew and a solitary white man with a cigar in his mouth a rifle at his hip and an irish terrier bristling against his bare calf kept the solemn pact of those ten seconds and no one of them knew or guessed what the outcome would be  one of the return boys in the bow of the whaleboat made the peace sign with his palm extended outward and weaponless and began to chirp in the unknown suu dialect  van horn held his aim and waited  the dandy lowered his snider and breath came more easily to the chests of all who composed the picture  me good fella boy the dandy piped half birdlike and half elf  you big fella fool too much van horn retorted harshly dropping his gun into the sternsheets motioning to rowers and steersman to turn the boat around and puffing his cigar as carelessly casual as if the moment before life and death had not been the debate  my word he went on with fine irritable assumption  what name you stick m gun along me  me no kaikai eat along you  me kaikai along you stomach belong me walk about  you kaikai along me stomach belong you walk about  you no like m kaikai suu boy belong along you  suu boy belong you all the same brother along you  long time before three monsoon before me speak m true speak  me say three monsoon boy come back  my word three monsoon finish boy stop along me come back  by this time the boat had swung around reversing bow and stern van horn pivoting so as to face the sniderarmed dandy  at another signal from van horn the rowers backed water and forced the boat stern in up to the solid ground of the runway  and each rower his oar in position in case of attack privily felt under the canvas flap to make sure of the exact location of his concealed leeenfield  all right boy belong you walk about van horn queried of the dandy who signified the affirmative in the solomon islands fashion by halfclosing his eyes and nodding his head upward in a queer perky way  no kaikai m suu fella boy suppose walk about along you  no fear the dandy answered  suppose m suu fella boy all right suppose m no fella suu boy my word big trouble  ishikola big fella black marster along this place him talk m me talk along you  him say any amount bad fella boy stop m along bush  him say big fella white marster no walk about  him say jolly good big fella white marster stop m along ship  van horn nodded in an offhand way as if the information were of little value although he knew that for this time suu would furnish him no fresh recruits  one at a time compelling the others to remain in their places he directed the return boys astern and ashore  it was solomon islands tactics  crowding was dangerous  never could the blacks be risked to confusion in numbers  and van horn smoking his cigar in lordly indifferent fashion kept his apparently uninterested eyes glued to each boy who made his way aft box on shoulder and stepped out on the land  one by one they disappeared into the runway tunnel and when the last was ashore he ordered the boat back to the ship  nothing doing here this trip he told the mate  well up hook and out in the morning  the quick tropic twilight swiftly blent day and darkness  overhead all stars were out  no faintest breath of air moved over the water and the humid heat beaded the faces and bodies of both men with profuse sweat they ate their deckspread supper languidly and ever and anon used their forearms to wipe the stinging sweat from their eyes  why a man should come to the solomonsbeastly hole the mate complained  or stay on the captain rejoined  im too rotten with fever the mate grumbled  id die if i left remember i tried it two years ago  it takes the cold weather to bring out the fever  i arrived in sydney on my back  they had to take me to hospital in an ambulance  i got worse and worse  the doctors told me the only thing to do was to head back where i got the fever  if i did i might live a long time  if i hung on in sydney it meant a quick finish they packed me on board in another ambulance  and thats all i saw of australia for my holiday  i dont want to stay in the solomons  its plain hell  but i got to or croak  he rolled at a rough estimate thirty grains of quinine in a cigarette paper regarded the result sourly for a moment then swallowed it at a gulp  this reminded van horn who reached for the bottle and took a similar dose  better put up a covering cloth he suggested  borckman directed several of the boats crew in the rigging up of a thin tarpaulin like a curtain along the shore side of the arangi  this was a precaution against any bushwhacking bullet from the mangroves only a hundred feet away  van horn sent tambi below to bring up the small phonograph and run off the dozen or so scratchy screechy records that had already been under the needle a thousand times  between records van horn recollected the girl and had her haled out of her dark hole in the lazarette to listen to the music  she obeyed in fear apprehensive that her time had come she looked dumbly at the big fella white master her eyes large with fright nor did the trembling of her body cease for a long time after he had made her lie down  the phonograph meant nothing to her  she knew only fearfear of this terrible white man that she was certain was destined to eat her  jerry left the caressing hand of skipper for a moment to go over and sniff her  this was an act of duty  he was identifying her once again no matter what happened no matter what months or years might elapse he would know her again and for ever know her again  he returned to the free hand of skipper that resumed its caressing  the other hand held the cigar which he was smoking  the wet sultry heat grew more oppressive  the air was nauseous with the dank mucky odour that cooked out of the mangrove swamp  rowelled by the squeaky music to recollection of oldworld ports and places borckman lay on his face on the hot planking beat a tattoo with his naked toes and gutturally muttered an unending monologue of curses  but van horn with jerry panting under his hand placidly and philosophically continued to smoke lighting a fresh cigar when the first gave out  he roused abruptly at the faint wash of paddles which he was the first on board to hear  in fact it was jerrys low growl and neckrippling of hair that had keyed van horn to hear  pulling the stick of dynamite out from the twist of his loin cloth and glancing at the cigar to be certain it was alight he rose to his feet with leisurely swiftness and with leisurely swiftness gained the rail  what name belong you was his challenge to the dark  me fella ishikola came the answer in the quavering falsetto of age  van horn before speaking again loosened his automatic pistol half out of its holster and slipped the holster around from his hip till it rested on his groin conveniently close to his hand  how many fella boy stop along you he demanded  one fella tenboy altogether he stop came the aged voice  come alongside then  without turning his head his right hand unconsciously dropping close to the butt of the automatic van horn commanded you fella tambi  fetch m lantern  no fetch m this place fetch m aft along mizzen rigging and look sharp eye belong you  tambi obeyed exposing the lantern twenty feet away from where his captain stood  this gave van horn the advantage over the approaching canoemen for the lantern suspended through the barbed wire across the rail and well down would clearly illuminate the occupants of the canoe while he was left in semidarkness and shadow  washeewashee he urged peremptorily while those in the invisible canoe still hesitated  came the sound of paddles and next emerging into the lanterns area of light the high black bow of a war canoe curved like a gondola inlaid with silveryglistening motherofpearl the long lean length of the canoe which was without outrigger the shining eyes and the blackshining bodies of the stark blacks who knelt in the bottom and paddled ishikola the old chief squatting amidships and not paddling an unlighted empty bowled shortstemmed clay pipe upsidedown between his toothless gums and in the stern as coxswain the dandy all nakedness of blackness all whiteness of decoration save for the pigs tail in one ear and the scarlet hibiscus that still flamed over the other ear  less than ten blacks had been known to rush a blackbirder officered by no more than two white men and van horns hand closed on the butt of his automatic although he did not pull it clear of the holster and although with his left hand he directed the cigar to his mouth and puffed it lively alight  hello ishikola you blooming old blighter was van horns greeting to the old chief as the dandy with a pry of his steeringpaddle against the side of the canoe and part under its bottom brought the dugout broadsideon to the arangi so that the sides of both crafts touched  ishikola smiled upward in the lantern light  he smiled with his right eye which was all he had the left having been destroyed by an arrow in a youthful jungleskirmish  my word he greeted back  long time you no stop eye belong me  van horn joked him in understandable terms about the latest wives he had added to his harem and what price he had paid for them in pigs  my word he concluded you rich fella too much together  me like m come on board gammon along you ishikola meekly suggested  my word night he stop the captain objected then added as a concession against the known rule that visitors were not permitted aboard after nightfall you come on board boy stop m along boat  van horn gallantly helped the old man to clamber to the rail straddle the barbed wire and gain the deck  ishikola was a dirty old savage  one of his tambos tambo being bechedemer and melanesian for taboo was that water unavoidable must never touch his skin  he who lived by the salt sea in a land of tropic downpour religiously shunned contact with water  he never went swimming or wading and always fled to shelter from a shower  not that this was true of the rest of his tribe  it was the peculiar tambo laid upon him by the devildevil doctors  other tribesmen the devildevil doctors tabooed against eating shark or handling turtle or contacting with crocodiles or the fossil remains of crocodiles or from ever being smirched by the profanity of a womans touch or of a womans shadow cast across the path  so ishikola whose tambo was water was crusted with the filth of years he was sealed like a leper and weazenfaced and ageshrunken he hobbled horribly from an ancient spearthrust to the thigh that twisted his torso droopingly out of the vertical  but his one eye gleamed brightly and wickedly and van horn knew that it observed as much as did both his own eyes  van horn shook hands with himan honour he accorded only chiefsand motioned him to squat down on deck on his hams close to the fearstruck girl who began trembling again at recollection of having once heard ishikola offer five twenties of drinking coconuts for the meat of her for a dinner  jerry needs must sniff for future identification purposes this graceless limping naked oneeyed old man  and when he had sniffed and registered the particular odour jerry must growl intimidatingly and win a quick eyeglance of approval from skipper  my word good fella kaikai dog said ishikola  me give m halffathom shell money that fella dog  for a mere puppy this offer was generous because half a fathom of shell money strung on a thread of twisted coconut fibres was equivalent in cash to half a sovereign in english currency to two dollars and a half in american or in livepig currency to half of a fairsized fat pig  one fathom shellmoney that fella dog van horn countered in his heart knowing that he would not sell jerry for a hundred fathoms or for any fabulous price from any black but in his head offering so small a price over par as not to arouse suspicion among the blacks as to how highly he really valued the goldencoated son of biddy and terrence  ishikola next averred that the girl had grown much thinner and that he as a practical judge of meat did not feel justified this time in bidding more than three twentystrings of drinking coconuts  after these amenities the white master and the black talked of many things the one bluffing with the whitemans superiority of intellect and knowledge the other feeling and guessing primitive statesman that he was in an effort to ascertain the balance of human and political forces that bore upon his suu territory ten miles square bounded by the sea and by landward lines of an intertribal warfare that was older than the oldest suu myth  eternally heads had been taken and bodies eaten now on one side now on the other by the temporarily victorious tribes  the boundaries had remained the same  ishikola in crude beche demer tried to learn the solomon islands general situation in relation to suu and van horn was not above playing the unfair diplomatic game as it is unfairly played in all the chancellories of the world powers  my word van horn concluded you bad fella too much along this place too many heads you fella take too much kaikai long pig along you long pig meaning barbecued human flesh  what name long time black fella belong suu take m heads kaikai along long pig ishikola countered  my word van horn came back too much along this place  bime by close up big fella warship stop m along suu knock seven balls outa suu  what name him big fella warship stop m along solomons ishikola demanded  big fella cambrian him fella name belong ship van horn lied too well aware that no british cruiser had been in the solomons for the past two years  the conversation was becoming rather a farcical dissertation upon the relations that should obtain between states irrespective of size when it was broken off by a cry from tambi who with another lantern hanging overside at the end of his arm had made a discovery  skipper gun he stop along canoe was his cry  van horn with a leap was at the rail and peering down over the barbed wire  ishikola despite his twisted body was only seconds behind him  what name that fella gun stop m along bottom van horn indignantly demanded  the dandy in the stern with a careless look upward tried with his foot to shove over the green leaves so as to cover the outjutting butts of several rifles but made the matter worse by exposing them more fully  he bent to rake the leaves over with his hand but sat swiftly upright when van horn roared at him  stand clear  keep m fella hand belong you long way big bit  van horn turned on ishikola and simulated wrath which he did not feel against the ancient and everrecurrent trick  what name you come alongside gun he stop along canoe belong you he demanded  the old saltwater chief rolled his one eye and blinked a fair simulation of stupidity and innocence  my word me cross along you too much van horn continued  ishikola you plenty bad fella boy  you get m to hell overside  the old fellow limped across the deck with more agility than he had displayed coming aboard straddled the barbed wire without assistance and without assistance dropped into the canoe cleverly receiving his weight on his uninjured leg  he blinked up for forgiveness and in reassertion of innocence  van horn turned his face aside to hide a grin and then grinned outright when the old rascal showing his empty pipe wheedled up  suppose m five stick tobacco you give m along me  while borckman went below for the tobacco van horn orated to ishikola on the sacred solemnity of truth and promises  next he leaned across the barbed wire and handed down the five sticks of tobacco  my word he threatened  somo day ishikola i finish along you altogether  you no good friend stop along saltwater  you big fool stop along bush  when ishikola attempted protest he shut him off with my word you gammon along me too much  still the canoe lingered  the dandys toe strayed privily to feel out the butts of the sniders under the green leaves and ishikola was loth to depart  washeewashee van horn cried with imperative suddenness  the paddlers without command from chief or dandy involuntarily obeyed and with deep strong strokes sent the canoe into the encircling darkness  just as quickly van horn changed his position on deck to the tune of a dozen yards so that no hazarded bullet might reach him  he crouched low and listened to the wash of paddles fade away in the distance  all right you fella tambi he ordered quietly  make m music he fella walk about  and while red wing screeched its cheap and pretty rhythm he reclined elbow on deck smoked his cigar and gathered jerry into caressing inclosure  as he smoked he watched the abrupt misting of the stars by a rainsquall that made to windward or to where windward might vaguely be configured while he gauged the minutes ere he must order tambi below with the phonograph and records he noted the bushgirl gazing at him in dumb fear  he nodded consent with halfclosed eyes and uptilting face clinching his consent with a wave of hand toward the companionway  she obeyed as a beaten dog spiritbroken might have obeyed dragging herself to her feet trembling afresh and with backward glances of her perpetual terror of the big white master that she was convinced would some day eat her  in such fashion stabbing van horn to the heart because of his inability to convey his kindness to her across the abyss of the ages that separated them she slunk away to the companionway and crawled down it feetfirst like some enormous largeheaded worm  after he had sent tambi to follow her with the precious phonograph van horn continued to smoke on while the sharp needlelike spray of the rain impacted soothingly on his heated body  only for five minutes did the rain descend  then as the stars drifted back in the sky the smell of steam seemed to stench forth from deck and mangrove swamp and the suffocating heat wrapped all about  van horn knew better but ill health save for fever had never concerned him so he did not bother for a blanket to shelter him  yours the first watch he told borckman  ill have her under way in the morning before i call you  he tucked his head on the biceps of his right arm with the hollow of the left snuggling jerry in against his chest and dozed off to sleep  and thus adventuring white men and indigenous black men from day to day lived life in the solomons bickering and trafficking the whites striving to maintain their heads on their shoulders the blacks striving no less singleheartedly to remove the whites heads from their shoulders and at the same time to keep their own anatomies intact  and jerry who knew only the world of meringe lagoon learning that these new worlds of the ship arangi and of the island of malaita were essentially the same regarded the perpetual game between the white and the black with some slight sort of understanding     chapter x   daylight saw the arangi under way her sails drooping heavily in the dead air while the boats crew toiled at the oars of the whaleboat to tow her out through the narrow entrance  once when the ketch swerved by some vagrant current came close to the break of the shoresurf the blacks on board drew toward one another in apprehension akin to that of startled sheep in a fold when a wild woods marauder howls outside  nor was there any need for van horns shout to the whaleboat washeewashee damn your hides  the boats crew lifted themselves clear of the thwarts as they threw all their weight into each stroke  they knew what dire fate was certain if ever the seawashed coral rock gripped the arangis keel  and they knew fear precisely of the same sort as that of the fear struck girl below in the lazarette  in the past more than one langalanga and somo boy had gone to make a suu feast day just as suu boys on occasion had similarly served feasts at langalanga and at somo  my word tambi at the wheel addressed van horn as the period of tension passed and the arangi went clear  brother belong my father long time before he come boats crew along this place  big fella schooner brother belong my father he come along  all finish this place suu  brother belong my father suu boys kaikai along him altogether  van horn recollected the fair hathaway of fifteen years before looted and burned by the people of suu after all hands had been killed truly the solomons at this beginning of the twentieth century were savage and truly of the solomons this great island of malaita was savagest of all  he cast his eyes speculatively up the slopes of the island to the seamans landmark mount kolorat greenforested to its cloudcapped summit four thousand feet in the air  even as he looked thin smokecolumns were rising along the slopes and lesser peaks and more were beginning to rise  my word tambi grinned  plenty boy stop m bush lookout along you eye belong him  van horn smiled understandingly  he knew by the ancient telegraphy of smokesignalling the message was being conveyed from village to village and tribe to tribe that a labourrecruiter was on the leeward coast  all morning under a brisk beam wind which had sprung up with the rising of the sun the arangi flew north her course continuously advertised by the increasing smoketalk that gossiped along the green summits  at high noon with van horn everattended by jerry standing forard and conning the arangi headed into the wind to thread the passage between two palmtufted islets  there was need for conning  coral patches uprose everywhere from the turquoise depths running the gamut of green from deepest jade to palest tourmaline over which the sea filtered changing shades creamed lazily or burst into white fountains of sun flashed spray  the smoke columns along the heights became garrulous and long before the arangi was through the passage the entire leeward coast from the salt water men of the shore to the remotest bush villagers knew that the labour recruiter was going in to langalanga  as the lagoon formed by the chain of islets lying off shore opened out jerry began to smell the reefvillages  canoes many canoes urged by paddles or sailed before the wind by the weight of the freshening south east trade on spread fronds of coconut palms moved across the smooth surface of the lagoon jerry barked intimidatingly at those that came closest bristling his neck and making a ferocious simulation of an efficient protector of the white god who stood beside him  and after each such warning he would softly dab his cool damp muzzle against the sunheated skin of skippers leg  once inside the lagoon the arangi filled away with the wind abeam  at the end of a swift halfmile she rounded to with headsails trimming down and with a great flapping of main and mizzen and dropped anchor in fifty feet of water so clear that every huge fluted clamshell was visible on the coral floor  the whaleboat was not necessary to put the langa langa return boys ashore  hundreds of canoes lay twenty deep along both sides of the arangi and each boy with his box and bell was clamoured for by scores of relatives and friends  in such height of excitement van horn permitted no one on board melanesians unlike cattle are as prone to stampede to attack as to retreat  two of the boats crew stood beside the leeenfields on the skylight  borckman with half the boats crew went about the ships work  van horn jerry at his heels careful that no one should get at his back superintended the departure of the langalanga returns and kept a vigilant eye on the remaining half of the boats crew that guarded the barbedwire rails  and each somo boy sat on his tradebox to prevent it from being tossed into the waiting canoes by some langalanga boy  in half an hour the riot departed ashore  only several canoes lingered and from one of these van horn beckoned aboard nauhau the biggest chief of the stronghold of langalanga  unlike most of the big chiefs nauhau was young and unlike most of the melanesians he was handsome even beautiful  hello king o babylon was van horns greeting for so he had named him because of fancied semitic resemblance blended with the crude power that marked his visage and informed his bearing  born and trained to nakedness nauhau trod the deck boldly and unashamed  his sole gear of clothing was a length of trunk strap buckled about his waist  between this and his bare skin was thrust the naked blade of a teninch ripping knife  his sole decoration was a white china soupplate perforated and strung on coconut sennit suspended from about his neck so that it rested flat on his chest and halfconcealed the generous swell of muscles  it was the greatest of treasures  no man of malaita he had ever heard of possessed an unbroken soupplate  nor was he any more ridiculous because of the soupplate than was he ludicrous because of his nakedness  he was royal  his father had been a king before him and he had proved himself greater than his father  life and death he bore in his hands and head  often he had exercised it chirping to his subjects in the tongue of langalanga slay here and slay there thou shalt die and thou shalt live  because his father a year abdicated had chosen foolishly to interfere with his sons government he had called two boys and had them twist a cord of coconut around his fathers neck so that thereafter he never breathed again  because his favourite wife mother of his eldest born had dared out of silliness of affection to violate one of his kingly tamboos he had had her killed and had himself selfishly and religiously eaten the last of her even to the marrow of her cracked joints sharing no morsel with his boonest of comrades  royal he was by nature by training by deed  he carried himself with consciousness of royalty  he looked royalas a magnificent stallion may look royal as a lion on a painted tawny desert may look royal  he was as splendid a brutean adumbration of the splendid human conquerors and rulers higher on the ladder of evolution who have appeared in other times and places  his pose of body of chest of shoulders of head was royal  royal was the heavylidded lazy insolent way he looked out of his eyes  royal in courage was he this moment on the arangi despite the fact that he knew he walked on dynamite  as he had long since bitterly learned any white man was as much dynamite as was the mysterious death dealing missile he sometimes employed  when a stripling he had made one of the canoe force that attacked the sandalwoodcutter that had been even smaller than the arangi  he had never forgotten that mystery  two of the three white men he had seen slain and their heads removed on deck the third still fighting had but the minute before fled below  then the cutter along with all her wealth of hoopiron tobacco knives and calico had gone up into the air and fallen back into the sea in scattered and fragmented nothingness  it had been dynamitethe mystery and he who had been hurled uninjured through the air by a miracle of fortune had divined that white men in themselves were truly dynamite compounded of the same mystery as the substance with which they shot the swiftdarting schools of mullet or blow up in extremity themselves and the ships on which they voyaged the sea from far places  and yet on this unstable and deathterrific substance of which he was well aware van horn was composed he trod heavily with his personality daring to the verge of detonation to impact it with his insolence  my word he began what name you make m boy belong me stop along you too much  which was a true and correct charge that the boys which van horn had just returned had been away three years and a half instead of three years  you talk that fella talk i get cross too much along you van horn bristled back and then added diplomatically dipping into a halfcase of tobacco sawed across and proffering a handful of stick tobacco much better you smoke m up and talk m good fella talk  but nauhau grandly waved aside the gift for which he hungered  plenty tobacco stop along me he lied  what name one fella boy go way no come back he demanded  van horn pulled the long slender account book out of the twist of his loincloth and while he skimmed its pages impressed nauhau with the dynamite of the white mans superior powers which enabled him to remember correctly inside the scrawled sheets of a book instead of inside his head  sati van horn read his finger marking the place his eyes alternating watchfully between the writing and the black chief before him while the black chief himself speculated and studied the chance of getting behind him and with the single knifethrust he knew so well of severing the others spinal cord at the base of the neck  sati van horn read  last monsoon begin about this time him fella sati get m sick belly belong him too much bime by him fella sati finish altogether he translated into bechedemer the written information died of dysentery july 4th 1901  plenty work him fella sati long time nauhau drove to the point what come along money belong him  van horn did mental arithmetic from the account  altogether him make m six tens pounds and two fella pounds gold money was his translation of sixtytwo pounds of wages  i pay advance father belong him one ten pounds and five fella pounds  him finish altogether four tens pounds and seven fella pounds  what name stop four tens pounds and seven fella pounds nauhau demanded his tongue but not his brain encompassing so prodigious a sum  van horn held up his hand  too much hurry you fella nauhau  him fella sati buy m slop chest along plantation two tens pounds and one fella pound  belong sati he finish altogether two tens pounds and six fella pounds  what name stop two tens pounds and six fella pounds nauhau continued inflexibly  stop m along me the captain answered curtly  give m me two tens pounds and six fella pounds  give m you hell van horn refused and in the blue of his eyes the black chief sensed the impression of the dynamite out of which white men seemed made and felt his brain quicken to the vision of the bloody day he first encountered an explosion of dynamite and was hurled through the air  what name that old fella boy stop m along canoe van horn asked pointing to an old man in a canoe alongside  him father belong sati  him father belong sati nauhau affirmed  van horn motioned the old man in and on board beckoned borckman to take charge of the deck and of nauhau and went below to get the money from his strongbox  when he returned cavalierly ignoring the chief he addressed himself to the old man  what name belong you  me fella nino was the quavering response  him fella sati belong along me  van horn glanced for verification to nauhau who nodded affirmation in the reverse solomon way whereupon van horn counted twentysix gold sovereigns into the hand of satis father  immediately thereafter nauhau extended his hand and received the sum twenty gold pieces the chief retained for himself returning to the old man the remaining six  it was no quarrel of van horns  he had fulfilled his duty and paid properly  the tyranny of a chief over a subject was none of his business  both masters white and black were fairly contented with themselves  van horn had paid the money where it was due nauhau by virtue of kingship had robbed satis father of satis labour before van horns eyes  but nauhau was not above strutting  he declined a proffered present of tobacco bought a case of stick tobacco from van horn paying him five pounds for it and insisted on having it sawed open so that he could fill his pipe  plenty good boy stop along langalanga van horn unperturbed politely queried in order to make conversation and advertise nonchalance  the king o babylon grinned but did not deign to reply  maybe i go ashore and walk about van horn challenged with tentative emphasis  maybe too much trouble along you nauhau challenged back  maybe plenty bad fella boy kaikai along you  although van horn did not know it at this challenge he experienced the hairpricking sensations in his scalp that jerry experienced when he bristled his back  hey borckman he called  man the whaleboat  when the whaleboat was alongside he descended into it first superiorly then invited nauhau to accompany him  my word king o babylon he muttered in the chiefs ears as the boats crew bent to the oars one fella boy make m trouble i shoot m hell outa you first thing  next thing i shoot m hell outa langalanga  all the time you me fella walk about you walk about along me  you no like walk about along me you finish close up altogether  and ashore a white man alone attended by an irish terrier puppy with a heart flooded with love and by a black king resentfully respectful of the dynamite of the white man van horn went swashbuckling barelegged through a stronghold of three thousand souls while his white mate addicted to schnapps held the deck of the tiny craft at anchor off shore and while his black boats crew oars in hands held the whaleboat sternon to the beach to receive the expected flying leap of the man they served but did not love and whose head they would eagerly take any time were it not for fear of him  van horn had had no intention of going ashore and that he went ashore at the black chiefs insolent challenge was merely a matter of business  for an hour he strolled about his right hand never far from the butt of the automatic that lay along his groin his eyes never too far from the unwilling nauhau beside him  for nauhau in sullen volcanic rage was ripe to erupt at the slightest opportunity  and so strolling van horn was given to see what few white men have seen for langalanga and her sister islets beautiful beads strung along the lee coast of malaita were as unique as they were unexplored  originally these islets had been mere sandbanks and coral reefs awash in the sea or shallowly covered by the sea  only a hunted wretched creature enduring incredible hardship could have eked out a miserable existence upon them  but such hunted wretched creatures survivors of village massacres escapes from the wrath of chiefs and from the longpig fate of the cookingpot did come and did endure  they who knew only the bush learned the salt water and developed the saltwaterman breed they learned the ways of the fish and the shellfish and they invented hooks and lines nets and fishtraps and all the diverse cunning ways by which swimming meat can be garnered from the shifting unstable sea  such refugees stole women from the mainland and increased and multiplied  with herculean labour under the burning sun they conquered the sea  they walled the confines of their coral reefs and sandbanks with coralrock stolen from the mainland on dark nights  fine masonry without mortar or cutting chisel they builded to withstand the ocean surge  likewise stolen from the mainland as mice steal from human habitations when humans sleep they stole canoeloads and millions of canoeloads of fat rich soil  generations and centuries passed and behold in place of naked sandbanks half awash were walled citadels perforated with launchingways for the long canoes protected against the mainland by the lagoons that were to them their narrow seas  coconut palms banana trees and lofty breadfruit trees gave food and sunshelter  their gardens prospered their long lean warcanoes ravaged the coasts and visited vengeance for their forefathers upon the descendants of them that had persecuted and desired to eat  like the refugees and renegades who slunk away in the salt marshes of the adriatic and builded the palaces of powerful venice on her deepsunk piles so these wretched hunted blacks builded power until they became masters of the mainland controlling traffic and traderoutes compelling the bushmen for ever after to remain in the bush and never to dare attempt the saltwater  and here amidst the fat success and insolence of the seapeople van horn swaggered his way taking his chance incapable of believing that he might swiftly die knowing that he was building good future business in the matter of recruiting labour for the plantations of other adventuring white men on far islands who dared only less greatly than he  and when at the end of an hour van horn passed jerry into the sternsheets of the whaleboat and followed he left on the beach a stunned and wondering royal black who more than ever before was respectful of the dynamitecompounded white men who brought to him stick tobacco calico knives and hatchets and inexorably extracted from such trade a profit     chapter xi   back on board van horn immediately hove short hoisted sail broke out the anchor and filled away for the tenmile beat up the lagoon to windward that would fetch somo  on the way he stopped at binu to greet chief johnny and land a few binu returns  then it was on to somo and to the end of voyaging for ever of the arangi and of many that were aboard of her  quite the opposite to his treatment at langalanga was that accorded van horn at somo  once the return boys were put ashore and this was accomplished no later than threethirty in the afternoon he invited chief bashti on board  and chief bashti came very nimble and active despite his great age and very goodnaturedso goodnatured in fact that he insisted on bringing three of his elderly wives on board with him  this was unprecedented  never had he permitted any of his wives to appear before a white man and van horn felt so honoured that he presented each of them with a gay clay pipe and a dozen sticks of tobacco  late as the afternoon was trade was brisk and bashti who had taken the lions share of the wages due to the fathers of two boys who had died bought liberally of the arangis stock  when bashti promised plenty of fresh recruits van horn used to the changeableness of the savage mind urged signing them up right away  bashti demurred and suggested next day  van horn insisted that there was no time like the present and so well did he insist that the old chief sent a canoe ashore to round up the boys who had been selected to go away to the plantations  now what do you think van horn asked of borckman whose eyes were remarkably fishy  i never saw the old rascal so friendly  has he got something up his sleeve  the mate stared at the many canoes alongside noted the numbers of women in them and shook his head  when theyre starting anything they always send the marys into the bush he said  you never can tell about these niggers the captain grumbled  they may be short on imagination but once in a while they do figure out something new  now bashtis the smartest old nigger ive ever seen whats to prevent his figuring out that very bet and playing it in reverse  just because theyve never had their women around when trouble was on the carpet is no reason that they will always keep that practice  not even bashtis got the savvee to pull a trick like that borckman objected  hes just feeling good and liberal  why hes bought forty pounds of goods from you already  thats why he wants to sign on a new batch of boys with us and ill bet hes hoping half of them die sos he can have the spending of their wages  all of which was most reasonable  nevertheless van horn shook his head  all the same keep your eyes sharp on everything he cautioned  and remember the two of us mustnt ever be below at the same time  and no more schnapps mind until were clear of the whole kit and caboodle  bashti was incredibly lean and prodigiously old  he did not know how old he was himself although he did know that no person in his tribe had been alive when he was a young boy in the village  he remembered the days when some of the old men still alive had been born and unlike him they were now decrepit shaken with palsy bleareyed toothless of mouth deaf of ear or paralysed  all his own faculties remained unimpaired  he even boasted a dozen worn fangs of teeth gumlevel on which he could still chew  although he no longer had the physical endurance of youth his thinking was as original and clear as it had always been  it was due to his thinking that he found his tribe stronger than when he had first come to rule it  in his small way he had been a melanesian napoleon  as a warrior the play of his mind had enabled him to beat back the bushmens boundaries  the scars on his withered body attested that he had fought to the fore  as a lawgiver he had encouraged and achieved strength and efficiency within his tribe  as a statesman he had always kept one thought ahead of the thoughts of the neighbouring chiefs in the making of treaties and the granting of concessions  and with his mind still keenly alive he had but just evolved a scheme whereby he might outwit van horn and get the better of the vast british empire about which he guessed little and know less  for somo had a history  it was that queer anomaly a saltwater tribe that lived on the lagoon mainland where only bushmen were supposed to live  far back into the darkness of time the folklore of somo cast a glimmering light  on a day so far back that there was no way of estimating its distance one somo son of loti who was the chief of the island fortress of umbo had quarrelled with his father and fled from his wrath along with a dozen canoeloads of young men  for two monsoons they had engaged in an odyssey  it was in the myth that they circumnavigated malaita twice and forayed as far as ugi and san cristobal across the wide seas  women they had inevitably stolen after successful combats and in the end being burdened with women and progeny somo had descended upon the mainland shore driven the bushmen back and established the saltwater fortress of somo  built it was on its seafront like any island fortress with walled coralrock to oppose the sea and chance marauders from the sea and with launching ways through the walls for the long canoes  to the rear where it encroached on the jungle it was like any scattered bush village  but somo the wideseeing father of the new tribe had established his boundaries far up in the bush on the shoulders of the lesser mountains and on each shoulder had planted a village  only the greatly daring that fled to him had somo permitted to join the new tribe  the weaklings and cowards they had promptly eaten and the unbelievable tale of their many heads adorning the canoehouses was part of the myth  and this tribe territory and stronghold at the latter end of time bashti had inherited and he had bettered his inheritance  nor was he above continuing to better it  for a long time he had reasoned closely and carefully in maturing the plan that itched in his brain for fulfilment  three years before the tribe of ano ano miles down the coast had captured a recruiter destroyed her and all hands and gained a fabulous store of tobacco calico beads and all manner of trade goods rifles and ammunition  little enough had happened in the way of price that was paid  half a year after a war vessel had poked her nose into the lagoon shelled ano ano and sent its inhabitants scurrying into the bush  the landingparty that followed had futilely pursued along the jungle runways  in the end it had contented itself with killing forty fat pigs and chopping down a hundred coconut trees  scarcely had the war vessel passed out to open sea when the people of ano ano were back from the bush to the village shell fire on flimsy grass houses is not especially destructive  a few hours labour of the women put that little matter right  as for the forty dead pigs the entire tribe fell upon the carcasses roasted them under the ground with hot stones and feasted  the tender tips of the fallen palms were likewise eaten while the thousands of coconuts were husked and split and sundried and smokecured into copra to be sold to the next passing trader  thus the penalty exacted had proved a picnic and a feastall of which appealed to the thrifty calculating brain of bashti  and what was good for ano ano in his judgment was surely good for somo  since such were white mens ways who sailed under the british flag and killed pigs and cut down coconuts in cancellation of blooddebts and headtakings bashti saw no valid reason why he should not profit as ano ano had profited  the price to be paid at some possible future time was absurdly disproportionate to the immediate wealth to be gained  besides it had been over two years since the last british war vessel had appeared in the solomons  and thus bashti with a fine fresh idea inside his head bowed his chiefs head in consent that his people could flock aboard and trade very few of them knew what his idea was or that he even had an idea  trade grew still brisker as more canoes came alongside and black men and women thronged the deck  then came the recruits newcaught young savage things timid as deer yet yielding to stern parental and tribal law and going down into the arangis cabin one by one their fathers and mothers and relatives accompanying them in family groups to confront the big fella white marster who wrote their names down in a mysterious book had them ratify the three years contract of their labour by a touch of the right hand to the pen with which he wrote and who paid the first years advance in trade goods to the heads of their respective families  old bashti sat near taking his customary heavy tithes out of each advance his three old wives squatting humbly at his feet and by their mere presence giving confidence to van horn who was elated by the stroke of business  at such rate his cruise on malaita would be a short one when he would sail away with a full ship  on deck where borckman kept a sharp eye out against danger jerry prowled about sniffing the many legs of the many blacks he had never encountered before  the wilddog had gone ashore with the return boys and of the return boys only one had come back  it was lerumie past whom jerry repeatedly and stiffleggedly bristled without gaining response of recognition  lerumie coolly ignored him went down below once and purchased a trade handmirror and with a look of the eyes assured old bashti that all was ready and ripe to break at the first favourable moment  on deck borckman gave this favourable moment  nor would he have so given it had he not been guilty of carelessness and of disobedience to his captains orders  he did not leave the schnapps alone  be did not sense what was impending all about him  aft where he stood the deck was almost deserted  amidships and forard gamming with the boats crew the deck was crowded with blacks of both sexes  he made his way to the yam sacks lashed abaft the mizzenmast and got his bottle  just before he drank with a shred of caution he cast a glance behind him near him stood a harmless mary middleaged fat squat asymmetrical unlovely a sucking child of two years astride her hip and taking nourishment  surely no harm was to be apprehended there  furthermore she was patently a weaponless mary for she wore no stitch of clothing that otherwise might have concealed a weapon  over against the rail ten feet to one side stood lerumie smirking into the trade mirror he had just bought  it was in the trade mirror that lerumie saw borckman bend to the yamsacks return to the erect throw his head back the mouth of the bottle glued to his lips the bottom elevated skyward  lerumie lifted his right hand in signal to a woman in a canoe alongside  she bent swiftly for something that she tossed to lerumie  it was a longhandled tomahawk the head of it an ordinary shinglers hatchet the haft of it nativemade a black and polished piece of hard wood inlaid in rude designs with motherofpearl and wrapped with coconut sennit to make a hand grip  the blade of the hatchet had been ground to razoredge  as the tomahawk flew noiselessly through the air to lerumies hand just as noiselessly the next instant it flew through the air from his hand into the hand of the fat mary with the nursing child who stood behind the mate  she clutched the handle with both hands while the child astride her hip held on to her with both small arms part way about her  still she waited the stroke for with borckmans head thrown back was no time to strive to sever the spinal cord at the neck  many eyes beheld the impending tragedy  jerry saw but did not understand  with all his hostility to niggers he had not divined the attack from the air  tambi who chanced to be near the skylight saw and seeing reached for a lee enfield  lerumie saw tambis action and hissed haste to the mary  borckman as unaware of this his last second of life as he had been of his first second of birth lowered the bottle and straightened forward his head  the keen edge sank home  what in that flash of instant when his brain was severed from the rest of his body borckman may have felt or thought if he felt or thought at all is a mystery unsolvable to living man  no man his spinal cord so severed has ever given one word or whisper of testimony as to what were his sensations and impressions no less swift than the hatchet stroke was the limp placidity into which borckmans body melted to the deck  he did not reel or pitch  he melted as a sack of wind suddenly emptied as a bladder of air suddenly punctured  the bottle fell from his dead hand upon the yams without breaking although the remnant of its contents gurgled gently out upon the deck  so quick was the occurrence of action that the first shot from tambis musket missed the mary ere borckman had quite melted to the deck  there was no time for a second shot for the mary dropping the tomahawk holding her child in both her hands and plunging to the rail was in the air and overboard her fall capsizing the canoe which chanced to be beneath her  scores of actions were simultaneous  from the canoes on both sides uprose a glittering glistening rain of motherofpearlhandled tomahawks that descended into the waiting hands of the somo men on deck while the marys on deck crouched down and scrambled out of the fray  at the same time that the mary who had killed borckman leapt the rail lerumie bent for the tomahawk she had dropped and jerry aware of red war slashed the hand that reached for the tomahawk  lerumie stood upright and loosed loudly in a howl all the pent rage and hatred of months which he had cherished against the puppy  also as he gained the perpendicular and as jerry flew at his legs he launched a kick with all his might that caught and lifted jerry squarely under the middle  and in the next second or fraction of second as jerry lifted and soared through the air over the barbed wire of the rail and overboard while sniders were being passed up overside from the canoes tambi fired his next hasty shot  and lerumie the foot with which he had kicked not yet returned to the deck as again he was in midaction of stooping to pick up the tomahawk received the bullet squarely in the heart and pitched down to melt with borckman into the softness of death  ere jerry struck the water the glory of tambis marvellously lucky shot was over for tambi for at the moment he pressed trigger to the successful shot a tomahawk bit across his skull at the base of the brain and darkened from his eyes for ever the bright vision of the seawashed sunblazoned tropic world  as swiftly all occurring almost simultaneously did the rest of the boats crew pass and the deck became a shambles  it was to the reports of the sniders and the noises of the death scuffle that jerrys head emerged from the water  a mans hand reached over a canoeside and dragged him in by the scruff of the neck and although he snarled and struggled to bite his rescuer he was not so much enraged as was he torn by the wildest solicitude for skipper  he knew without thinking about it that the arangi had been boarded by the hazily sensed supreme disaster of life that all life intuitively apprehends and that only man knows and calls by the name of death  borckman he had seen struck down  lerumie he had heard struck down  and now he was hearing the explosions of rifles and the yells and screeches of triumph and fear  so it was helpless suspended in the air by the nape of the neck that he bawled and squalled and choked and coughed till the black disgusted flung him down roughly in the canoes bottom  he scrambled to his feet and made two leaps one upon the gunwale of the canoe the next despairing and hopeless without consideration of self for the rail of the arangi  his forefeet missed the rail by a yard and he plunged down into the sea he came up swimming frantically swallowing and strangling salt water because he still yelped and wailed and barked his yearning to be on board with skipper  but a boy of twelve in another canoe having witnessed the first blacks adventure with jerry treated him without ceremony laying first the flat and next the edge of a paddle upon his head while he still swam and the darkness of unconsciousness welled over his bright little love suffering brain so that it was a limp and motionless puppy that the black boy dragged into his canoe  in the meantime down below in the arangis cabin ere ever jerry hit the water from lerumies kick even while he was in the air van horn in one great flashing profound fraction of an instant had known his death not for nothing had old bashti lived longest of any living man in his tribe and ruled wisest of all the long line of rulers since somos time had he been placed more generously in earth space and time he might well have proved an alexander a napoleon or a swarthy kahehameha  as it was he performed well and splendidly well in his limited little kingdom on the leeward coast of the dark cannibal island of malaita  and such a performance  in cool good nature in rigid maintenance of his chiefship rights he had smiled at van horn given royal permission to his young men to sign on for three years of plantation slavery and exacted his share of each years advance  aora who might be described as his prime minister and treasurer had received the tithes as fast as they were paid over and filled them into large finenetted bags of coconut sennit  at bashtis back squatting on the bunkboards a slim and smoothskinned maid of thirteen had flapped the flies away from his royal head with the royal flyflapper  at his feet had squatted his three old wives the oldest of them toothless and somewhat palsied ever presenting to his hand at his head nod a basket roughwoven of pandanus leaf  and bashti his keen old ears pitched for the first untoward sound from on deck had continually nodded his head and dipped his hand into the proffered basketnow for betelnut and limebox and the invariable green leaf with which to wrap the mouthful now for tobacco with which to fill his short clay pipe and again for matches with which to light the pipe which seemed not to draw well and which frequently went out  toward the last the basket had hovered constantly close to his hand and at the last he made one final dip  it was at the moment when the marys axe on deck had struck borckman down and when tambi loosed the first shot at her from his leeenfield  and bashtis withered ancient hand the back of it netted with a complex of large upstanding veins from which the flesh had shrunk away dipped out a huge pistol of such remote vintage that one of cromwells roundheads might well have carried it or that it might well have voyaged with quiros or la perouse  it was a flintlock as long as a mans forearm and it had been loaded that afternoon by no less a person than bashti himself  quick as bashti had been van horn was almost as quick but not quite quick enough  even as his hand leapt to the modern automatic lying out of its holster and loose on his knees the pistol of the centuries went off  loaded with two slugs and a round bullet its effect was that of a sawedoff shotgun  and van horn knew the blaze and the black of death even as gott fer dang died unuttered on his lips and as his fingers relaxed from the partlifted automatic dropping it to the floor  surcharged with black powder the ancient weapon had other effect  it burst in bashtis hand  while aora with a knife produced apparently from nowhere proceeded to hack off the white masters head bashti looked quizzically at his right forefinger dangling by a strip of skin he seized it with his left hand with a quick pull and twist wrenched it off and grinningly tossed it as a joke into the pandanus basket which still his wife with one hand held before him while with the other she clutched her forehead bleeding from a flying fragment of pistol  collaterally with this three of the young recruits joined by their fathers and uncles had downed and were finishing off the only one of the boats crew that was below  bashti who had lived so long that he was a philosopher who minded pain little and the loss of a finger less chuckled and chirped his satisfaction and pride of achievement in the outcome while his three old wives who lived only at the nod of his head fawned under him on the floor in the abjectness of servile congratulation and worship  long had they lived and they had lived long only by his kingly whim  they floundered and gibbered and mowed at his feet lord of life and death that he was infinitely wise as he had so often proved himself as he had this time proved himself again  and the lean fearstricken girl like a frightened rabbit in the mouth of its burrow on hands and knees peered forth upon the scene from the lazarette and knew that the cookingpot and the end of time had come for her     chapter xii   what happened aboard the arangi jerry never knew  he did know that it was a world destroyed for he saw it destroyed  the boy who had knocked him on the head with the paddle tied his legs securely and tossed him out on the beach ere he forgot him in the excitement of looting the arangi  with great shouting and song the pretty teakbuilt yacht was towed in by the long canoes and beached close to where jerry lay just beyond the confines of the coralstone walls  fires blazed on the beach lanterns were lighted on board and amid a great feasting the arangi was gutted and stripped  everything portable was taken ashore from her pigs of iron ballast to her running gear and sails  no one in somo slept that night  even the tiniest of children toddled about the feasting fires or sprawled surfeited on the sands  at two in the morning at bashtis command the shell of the boat was fired  and jerry thirsting for water having whimpered and wailed himself to exhaustion lying helpless legtied on his side saw the floating world he had known so short a time go up in flame and smoke  and by the light of her burning old bashti apportioned the loot  no one of the tribe was too mean to receive nothing  even the wretched bush slaves who had trembled through all the time of their captivity from fear of being eaten received each a clay pipe and several sticks of tobacco  the main bulk of the trade goods which was not distributed bashti had carried up to his own large grass house  all the wealth of gear was stored in the several canoe houses  while in the devil devil houses the devil devil doctors set to work curing the many heads over slow smudges for along with the boats crew there were a round dozen of noola return boys and several malu boys which van horn had not yet delivered  not all these had been slain however  bashti had issued stern injunctions against wholesale slaughter  but this was not because his heart was kind  rather was it because his head was shrewd  slain they would all be in the end  bashti had never seen ice did not know it existed and was unversed in the science of refrigeration  the only way he knew to keep meat was to keep it alive  and in the biggest canoe house the club house of the stags where no mary might come under penalty of death by torture the captives were stored  tied or trussed like fowls or pigs they were tumbled on the hardpacked earthen floor beneath which shallowly buried lay the remains of ancient chiefs while overhead in wrappings of grass mats swung all that was left of several of bashtis immediate predecessors his father latest among them and so swinging for two full generations  here too since she was to be eaten and since the taboo had no bearing upon one condemned to be cooked the thin little mary from the lazarette was tumbled trussed upon the floor among the many blacks who had teased and mocked her for being fattened by van horn for the eating  and to this canoe house jerry was also brought to join the others on the floor  agno chief of the devil devil doctors had stumbled across him on the beach and despite the protestations of the boy who claimed him as personal trove had ordered him to the canoe house  carried past the fires of the feasting his keen nostrils had told him of what the feast consisted  and new as the experience was he had bristled and snarled and struggled against his bonds to be free  likewise at first tossed down in the canoe house he had bristled and snarled at his fellow captives not realizing their plight and since always he had been trained to look upon niggers as the eternal enemy considering them responsible for the catastrophe to the arangi and to skipper  for jerry was only a little dog with a dogs limitations and very young in the world  but not for long did he throat his rage at them  in vague ways it was borne in upon him that they too were not happy  some had been cruelly wounded and kept up a moaning and groaning  without any clearness of concept nevertheless jerry had a realization that they were as painfully circumstanced as himself  and painful indeed was his own circumstance  he lay on his side the cords that bound his legs so tight as to bite into his tender flesh and shut off the circulation  also he was perishing for water and panted drytongued drymouthed in the stagnant heat  a dolorous place it was this canoe house filled with groans and sighs corpses beneath the floor and composing the floor creatures soon to be corpses upon the floor corpses swinging in aerial sepulchre overhead long black canoes highended like beaked predatory monsters dimly looming in the light of a slow fire where sat an ancient of the tribe of somo at his interminable task of smokecuring a bushmans head  he was withered and blind and senile gibbering and mowing like some huge ape as ever he turned and twisted and twisted back again the suspended head in the pungent smoke and handful by handful added rotten punk of wood to the smudge fire  sixty feet in the clear the dim fire occasionally lighted through shadowy crossbeams the ridgepole that was covered with sennit of coconut that was braided in barbaric designs of black and white and that was stained by the smoke of years almost to a monochrome of dirty brown from the lofty crossbeams on long sennit strings hung the heads of enemies taken aforetime in jungle raid and sea foray  the place breathed the very atmosphere of decay and death and the imbecile ancient curing in the smoke the token of death was himself palsiedly shaking into the disintegration of the grave  toward daylight with great shouting and heaving and pull and haul scores of somo men brought in another of the big war canoes  they made way with foot and hand kicking and thrusting dragging and shoving the bound captives to either side of the space which the canoe was to occupy they were anything but gentle to the meat with which they had been favoured by good fortune and the wisdom of bashti  for a time they sat about all pulling at clay pipes and chirruping and laughing in queer thin falsettos at the events of the night and the previous afternoon  now one and now another stretched out and slept without covering for so directly under the path of the sun had they slept nakedly from the time they were born  remained awake as dawn paled the dark only the grievously wounded or the tootightly bound and the decrepit ancient who was not so old as bashti  when the boy who had stunned jerry with his paddleblade and who claimed him as his own stole into the canoe house the ancient did not hear him  being blind he did not see him  he continued gibbering and chuckling dementedly to twist the bushmans head back and forth and to feed the smudge with punkwood  this was no nighttask for any man nor even for him who had forgotten how to do aught else  but the excitement of cutting out the arangi had been communicated to his addled brain and with vague reminiscent flashes of the strength of life triumphant he shared deliriously in this triumph of somo by applying himself to the curing of the head that was in itself the concrete expression of triumph  but the twelveyearold lad who stole in and cautiously stepped over the sleepers and threaded his way among the captives did so with his heart in his mouth  he knew what taboos he was violating  not old enough even to leave his fathers grass roof and sleep in the youths canoe house much less to sleep with the young bachelors in their canoe house he knew that he took his life with all of its dimly guessed mysteries and arrogances in his hand thus to trespass into the sacred precinct of the fullmade fullrealized fullstatured men of somo  but he wanted jerry and he got him  only the lean little mary trussed for the cooking staring through her wide eyes of fear saw the boy pick jerry up by his tied legs and carry him out and away from the booty of meat of which she was part  jerrys heroic little heart of courage would have made him snarl and resent such treatment of handling had he not been too exhausted and had not his mouth and throat been too dry for sound  as it was miserably and helplessly not half himself a puppet dreamer in a halfnightmare he knew as a restless sleeper awakening between vexing dreams that he was being transported headdownward out of the canoe house that stank of death through the village that was only less noisome and up a path under lofty widespreading trees that were beginning languidly to stir with the first breathings of the morning wind     chapter xiii   the boys name as jerry was to learn was lamai and to lamais house jerry was carried  it was not much of a house even as cannibal grass houses go  on an earthen floor hardpacked of the filth of years lived lamais father and mother and a spawn of four younger brothers and sisters  a thatched roof that leaked in every heavy shower leaned to a wabbly ridgepole over the floor  the walls were even more pervious to a driving rain  in fact the house of lamai who was the father of lumai was the most miserable house in all somo  lumai the housemaster and family head unlike most malaitans was fat and of his fatness it would seem had been begotten his good nature with its allied laziness  but as the fly in his ointment of jovial irresponsibility was his wife lenerengothe prize shrew of somo who was as lean about the middle and all the rest of her as her husband was rotund who was as remarkably sharpspoken as he was softspoken who was as ceaselessly energetic as he was unceasingly idle and who had been born with a taste for the world as sour in her mouth as it was sweet in his  the boy merely peered into the house as he passed around it to the rear and he saw his father and mother at opposite corners sleeping without covering and in the middle of the floor his four naked brothers and sisters curled together in a tangle like a litter of puppies  all about the house which in truth was scarcely more than an animal lair was an earthly paradise  the air was spicily and sweetly heavy with the scents of wild aromatic plants and gorgeous tropic blooms  overhead three breadfruit trees interlaced their noble branches  banana and plantain trees were burdened with great bunches of ripening fruit  and huge golden melons of the papaia ready for the eating globuled directly from the slendertrunked trees not onetenth the girth of the fruits they bore  and for jerry most delightful of all there was the gurgle and plash of a brooklet that pursued its invisible way over mossy stones under a garmenture of tender and delicate ferns  no conservatory of a king could compare with this wild wantonness of sungenerous vegetation  maddened by the sound of the water jerry had first to endure an embracing and hugging from the boy who squatted on his hams rocked back and forth and mumbled a strange little crooning song  and jerry lacking articulate speech had no way of telling him of the thirst of which he was perishing  next lamai tied him securely with a sennit cord about the neck and untied the cords that bit into his legs  so numb was jerry from lack of circulation and so weak from lack of water through part of a tropic day and all of a tropic night that he stood up tottered and fell and time and again essaying to stand floundered and fell  and lamai understood or tentatively guessed  he caught up a coconut calabash attached to the end of a stick of bamboo dipped into the greenery of ferns and presented to jerry the calabash brimming with the precious water  jerry lay on his side at first as he drank until with the moisture life flowed back into the parched channels of him so that soon still weak and shaky he was up and braced on all his four widespread legs and still eagerly lapping  the boy chuckled and chirped his delight in the spectacle and jerry found surcease and easement sufficient to enable him to speak with his tongue after the hearteloquent manner of dogs  he took his nose out of the calabash and with his roseribbon strip of tongue licked lamais hand  and lamai in ecstasy over this establishment of common speech urged the calabash back under jerrys nose and jerry drank again  he continued to drink  he drank until his sunshrunken sides stood out like the walls of a balloon although longer were the intervals from the drinking in which with his tongue of gratefulness he spoke against the black skin of lamais hand  and all went well and would have continued to go well had not lamais mother lenerengo just awakened stepped across her black litter of progeny and raised her voice in shrill protest against her eldest borns introducing of one more mouth and much more nuisance into the household  a squabble of human speech followed of which jerry knew no word but of which he sensed the significance  lamai was with him and for him lamais mother was against him  she shrilled and shrewed her firm conviction that her son was a fool and worse because he had neither the consideration nor the silly sense of a fools solicitude for a hardworked mother  she appealed to the sleeping lumai who awoke heavily and fatly who muttered and mumbled easy terms of somo dialect to the effect that it was a most decent world that all puppy dogs and eldestborn sons were right delightful things to possess that he had never yet starved to death and that peace and sleep were the finest things that ever befell the lot of mortal manand in token thereof back into the peace of sleep he snuggled his nose into the biceps of his arm for a pillow and proceeded to snore  but lamai eyes stubbornly sullen with mutinous footstampings and a perfect knowledge that all was clear behind him to leap and flee away if his mother rushed upon him persisted in retaining his puppy dog  in the end after an harangue upon the worthlessness of lamais father she went back to sleep  ideas beget ideas  lamai had learned how astonishingly thirsty jerry had been  this engendered the idea that he might be equally hungry  so he applied dry branches of wood to the smouldering coals he dug out of the ashes of the cookingfire and builded a large fire  into this as it gained strength he placed many stones from a convenient pile each fire blackened in token that it had been similarly used many times  next hidden under the water of the brook in a netted handbag he brought to light the carcass of a fat woodpigeon he had snared the previous day  he wrapped the pigeon in green leaves and surrounding it with the hot stones from the fire covered pigeon and stones with earth  when after a time he removed the pigeon and stripped from it the scorched wrappings of leaves it gave forth a scent so savoury as to prick up jerrys ears and set his nostrils to quivering  when the boy had torn the steaming carcass across and cooled it jerrys meal began nor did the meal cease till the last sliver of meat had been stripped and tongued from the bones and the bones crunched and crackled to fragments and swallowed  and throughout the meal lamai made love to jerry crooning over and over his little song and patting and caressing him  on the other hand refreshed by the water and the meat jerry did not reciprocate so heartily in the lovemaking  he was polite and received his petting with softshining eyes tailwaggings and the customary body wrigglings but he was restless and continually listened to distant sounds and yearned away to be gone  this was not lost upon the boy who before he curled himself down to sleep securely tied to a tree the end of the cord that was about jerrys neck  after straining against the cord for a time jerry surrendered and slept but not for long  skipper was too much with him  he knew and yet he did not know the irretrievable ultimate disaster to skipper  so it was after low whinings and whimperings that he applied his sharp firstteeth to the sennit cord and chewed upon it till it parted  free like a homing pigeon he headed blindly and directly for the beach and the salt sea over which had floated the arangi on her deck skipper in command  somo was largely deserted and those that were in it were sunk in sleep  so no one vexed him as he trotted through the winding pathways between the many houses and past the obscene kingposts of totemic heraldry where the forms of men carved from single tree trunks were seated in the gaping jaws of carved sharks  for somo tracing back to somo its founder worshipped the sharkgod and the saltwater deities as well as the deities of the bush and swamp and mountain  turning to the right until he was past the seawall jerry came on down to the beach  no arangi was to be seen on the placid surface of the lagoon  all about him was the debris of the feast and he scented the smouldering odours of dying fires and burnt meat  many of the feasters had not troubled to return to their houses but lay about on the sand in the midmorning sunshine men women and children and entire families wherever they had yielded to slumber  down by the waters edge so close that his forefeet rested in the water jerry sat down his heart bursting for skipper thrust his nose heavenward at the sun and wailed his woe as dogs have ever wailed since they came in from the wild woods to the fires of men  and here lamai found him hushed his grief against his breast with cuddling arms and carried him back to the grass house by the brook water he offered but jerry could drink no more  love he offered but jerry could not forget his torment of desire for skipper  in the end disgusted with so unreasonable a puppy lamai forgot his love in his boyish savageness clouted jerry over the head right side and left and tied him as few whites mens dogs have ever been tied  for in his way lamai was a genius  he had never seen the thing done with any dog yet he devised on the spur of the moment the invention of tying jerry with a stick  the stick was of bamboo four feet long  one end he tied shortly to jerrys neck the other end just as shortly to a tree  all that jerrys teeth could reach was the stick and dry and seasoned bamboo can defy the teeth of any dog     chapter xiv   for many days tied by the stick jerry remained lamais prisoner  it was not a happy time for the house of lumai was a house of perpetual bickering and quarrelling  lamai fought pitched battles with his brothers and sisters for teasing jerry and these battles invariably culminated in lenerengo taking a hand and impartially punishing all her progeny  after that as a matter of course and on general principles she would have it out with lumai whose soft voice always was for quiet and repose and who always at the end of a tonguelashing took himself off to the canoe house for a couple of days  here lenerengo was helpless  into the canoe house of the stags no mary might venture  lenerengo had never forgotten the fate of the last mary who had broken the taboo  it had occurred many years before when she was a girl and the recollection was ever vivid of the unfortunate woman hanging up in the sun by one arm for all of a day and for all of a second day by the other arm  after that she had been feasted upon by the stags of the canoe house and for long afterward all women had talked softly before their husbands  jerry did discover liking for lamai but it was not strong nor passionate  rather was it out of gratitude for only lamai saw to it that he received food and water  yet this boy was no skipper no mister haggin  nor was he even a derby or a bob  he was that inferior mancreature a nigger and jerry had been thoroughly trained all his brief days to the law that the white men were the superior twolegged gods  he did not fail to recognize however the intelligence and power that resided in the niggers  he did not reason it out  he accepted it  they had power of command over other objects could propel sticks and stones through the air could even tie him a prisoner to a stick that rendered him helpless  inferior as they might be to the whitegods still they were gods of a sort  it was the first time in his life that jerry had been tied up and he did not like it  vainly he hurt his teeth some of which were loosening under the pressure of the second teeth rising underneath  the stick was stronger than he  although he did not forget skipper the poignancy of his loss faded with the passage of time until uppermost in his mind was the desire to be free  but when the day came that he was freed he failed to take advantage of it and scuttle away for the beach  it chanced that lenerengo released him  she did it deliberately desiring to be quit of him  but when she untied jerry he stopped to thank her wagging his tail and smiling up at her with his hazelbrown eyes  she stamped her foot at him to be gone and uttered a harsh and intimidating cry  this jerry did not understand and so unused was he to fear that he could not be frightened into running away  he ceased wagging his tail and though he continued to look up at her his eyes no longer smiled  her action and noise he identified as unfriendly and he became alert and watchful prepared for whatever hostile act she might next commit  again she cried out and stamped her foot  the only effect on jerry was to make him transfer his watchfulness to the foot  this slowness in getting away now that she had released him was too much for her short temper  she launched the kick and jerry avoiding it slashed her ankle  war broke on the instant and that she might have killed jerry in her rage was highly probable had not lamai appeared on the scene  the stick untied from jerrys neck told the tale of her perfidy and incensed lamai who sprang between and deflected the blow with a stone poipounder that might have brained jerry  lamai was now the one in danger of grievous damage and his mother had just knocked him down with a clout alongside the head when poor lumai roused from sleep by the uproar ventured out to make peace  lenerengo as usual forgot everything else in the fiercer pleasure of berating her spouse  the conclusion of the affair was harmless enough  the children stopped their crying lamai retied jerry with the stick lenerengo harangued herself breathless and lumai departed with hurt feelings for the canoe house where stags could sleep in peace and marys pestered not  that night in the circle of his fellow stags lumai recited his sorrows and told the cause of themthe puppy dog which had come on the arangi it chanced that agno chief of the devil devil doctors or high priest heard the tale and recollected that he had sent jerry to the canoe house along with the rest of the captives  half an hour later he was having it out with lamai  beyond doubt the boy had broken the taboos and privily he told him so until lamai trembled and wept and squirmed abjectly at his feet for the penalty was death  it was too good an opportunity to get a hold over the boy for agno to misplay it  a dead boy was worth nothing to him but a living boy whose life he carried in his hand would serve him well  since no one else knew of the broken taboo he could afford to keep quiet  so he ordered lamai forthright down to live in the youths canoe house there to begin his novitiate in the long series of tasks tests and ceremonies that would graduate him into the bachelors canoe house and half way along toward being a recognized man        in the morning obeying the devil devil doctors commands lenerengo tied jerrys feet together not without a struggle in which his head was banged about and her hands were scratched  then she carried him down through the village on the way to deliver him at agnos house  on the way in the open centre of the village where stood the kingposts she left him lying on the ground in order to join in the hilarity of the population  not only was old bashti a stern lawgiver but he was a unique one  he had selected this day at the one time to administer punishment to two quarrelling women to give a lesson to all other women and to make all his subjects glad once again that they had him for ruler  tiha and wiwau the two women were squat and stout and young and had long been a scandal because of their incessant quarrelling  bashti had set them a race to run  but such a race  it was sidesplitting  men women and children beholding howled with delight  even elderly matrons and greybeards with a foot in the grave screeched and shrilled their joy in the spectacle  the halfmile course lay the length of the village through its heart from the beach where the arangi had been burned to the beach at the other end of the seawall  it had to be covered once in each direction by tiha and wiwau in each case one of them urging speed on the other and the other desiring speed that was unattainable  only the mind of bashti could have devised the show  first two round coral stones weighing fully forty pounds each were placed in tihas arms  she was compelled to clasp them tightly against her sides in order that they might not roll to the ground  behind her bashti placed wiwau who was armed with a bristle of bamboo splints mounted on a light long shaft of bamboo  the splints were sharp as needles being indeed the needles used in tattooing and on the end of the pole they were intended to be applied to tihas back in the same way that men apply oxgoads to oxen  no serious damage but much pain could be inflicted which was just what bashti had intended  wiwau prodded with the goad and tiha stumbled and wabbled in gymnastic efforts to make speed  since when the farther beach had been reached the positions would be reversed and wiwau would carry the stones back while tiha prodded and since wiwau knew that for what she gave tiha would then try to give more wiwau exerted herself to give the utmost while yet she could  the perspiration ran down both their faces  each had her partisans in the crowd who encouraged and heaped ridicule with every prod  ludicrous as it was behind it lay iron savage law  the two stones were to be carried the entire course  the woman who prodded must do so with conviction and dispatch  the woman who was prodded must not lose her temper and fight her tormentor  as they had been duly forewarned by bashti the penalty for infraction of the rules he had laid down was staking out on the reef at low tide to be eaten by the fishsharks  as the contestants came opposite where bashti and aora his prime minister stood they redoubled their efforts wiwau goading enthusiastically tiha jumping with every thrust to the imminent danger of dropping the stones at their heels trooped the children of the village and all the village dogs whooping and yelping with excitement  long time you fella tiha no sit m along canoe aora bawled to the victim and set bashti cackling again  at an unusually urgent prod tiha dropped a stone and was duly goaded while she sank to her knees and with one arm scooped it in against her side regained her feet and waddled on  once in stark mutiny at so much pain she deliberately stopped and addressed her tormentor  me cross along you too much she told wiwau  bime by close  but she never completed the threat  a warmly administered prod broke through her stoicism and started her tottering along  the shouting of the rabble ebbed away as the queer race ran on toward the beach  but in a few minutes it could be heard flooding back this time wiwau panting with the weight of coral stone and tiha asmart with what she had endured trying more than to even the score  opposite bashti wiwau lost one of the stones and in the effort to recover it lost the other which rolled a dozen feet away from the first  tiha became a whirlwind of avenging fury  and all somo went wild  bashti held his lean sides with merriment while tears of purest joy ran down his prodigiously wrinkled cheeks  and when all was over quoth bashti to his people thus shall all women fight when they desire over much to fight  only he did not say it in this way  nor did he say it in the somo tongue  what he did say was in bechedemer and his words were  any fella mary he like m fight all fella mary along somo fight m this fella way     chapter xv   for some time after the conclusion of the race bashti stood talking with his head men agno among them  lenerengo was similarly engaged with several old cronies  as jerry lay off to one side where she had forgotten him the wilddog he had bullied on the arangi came up and sniffed at him  at first he sniffed at a distance ready for instant flight  then he drew cautiously closer  jerry watched him with smouldering eyes  at the moment wilddogs nose touched him he uttered a warning growl  wilddog sprang back and whirled away in headlong flight for a score of yards before he learned that he was not pursued  again he came back cautiously as it was the instinct in him to stalk wild game crouching so close to the ground that almost his belly touched  he lifted and dropped his feet with the lithe softness of a cat and from time to time glanced to right and to left as if in apprehension of some flank attack  a noisy outburst of boys laughter in the distance caused him to crouch suddenly down his claws thrust into the ground for purchase his muscles tense springs for the leap he knew not in what direction from the danger he knew not what that might threaten him  then he identified the noise know that no harm impended and resumed his stealthy advance on the irish terrier  what might have happened there is no telling for at that moment bashtis eyes chanced to rest on the golden puppy for the first time since the capture of the arangi  in the rush of events bashti had forgotten the puppy  what name that fella dog he cried out sharply causing wilddog to crouch down again and attracting lenerengos attention  she cringed in fear to the ground before the terrible old chief and quavered a recital of the facts  her goodfornothing boy lamai had picked the dog from the water  it had been the cause of much trouble in her house  but now lamai had gone to live with the youths and she was carrying the dog to agnos house at agnos express command  what name that dog stop along you bashti demanded directly of agno  me kaikai along him came the answer  him fat fella dog  him good fella dog kaikai  into bashtis alert old brain flashed an idea that had been long maturing  him good fella dog too much he announced  better you eat m bush fella dog he advised pointing at wilddog  agno shook his head  bush fella dog no good kaikai  bush fella dog no good too much was bashtis judgment  bush fella dog too much fright  plenty fella bush dog too much fright  white marsters dog no fright  bush dog no fight  white marsters dog fight like hell  bush dog run like hell  you look m eye belong you you see  bashti stepped over to jerry and cut the cords that tied his legs  and jerry upon his feet in a surge was for once in too great haste to pause to give thanks  he hurled himself after wilddog caught him in midflight and rolled him over and over in a cloud of dust  ever wild dog strove to escape and ever jerry cornered him rolled him and bit him while bashti applauded and called on his head men to behold  by this time jerry had become a raging little demon  fired by all his wrongs from the bloody day on the arangi and the loss of skipper down to this latest tying of his legs he was avenging himself on wilddog for everything  the owner of wilddog a return boy made the mistake of trying to kick jerry away  jerry was upon him in a flash scratching his calves with his teeth in the suddenness of his onslaught getting between the blacks legs and tumbling him to the ground  what name bashti cried in a rage at the offender who lay fearstricken where he had fallen trembling for what next words might fall from his chiefs lips  but bashti was already doubling with laughter at sight of wilddog running for his life down the street with jerry a hundred feet behind and tearing up the dust  as they disappeared bashti expounded his idea  if men planted banana trees it ran what they would get would be bananas  if they planted yams yams would be produced not sweet potatoes or plantains but yams nothing but yams  the same with dogs  since all black mens dogs were cowards all the breeding of all black mens dogs would produce cowards white mens dogs were courageous fighters  when they were bred they produced courageous fighters  very well and to the conclusion namely here was a white mans dog in their possession  the height of foolishness would be to eat it and to destroy for all time the courage that resided in it  the wise thing to do was to regard it as a seed dog to keep it alive so that in the coming generations of somo dogs its courage would be repeated over and over and spread until all somo dogs would be strong and brave  further bashti commanded his chief devil devil doctor to take charge of jerry and guard him well  also he sent his word forth to all the tribe that jerry was taboo  no man woman or child was to throw spear or stone at him strike him with club or tomahawk or hurt him in any way        thenceforth and until jerry himself violated one of the greatest of taboos he had a happy time in agnos gloomy grass house  for bashti unlike most chiefs ruled his devil devil doctors with an iron hand other chiefs even nauhau of langalanga were ruled by their devil devil doctors  for that matter the population of somo believed that bashti was so ruled  but the somo folk did not know what went on behind the scenes when bashti a sheer infidel talked alone now with one doctor and now with another  in these private talks he demonstrated that he knew their game as well as they did and that he was no slave to the dark superstitions and gross impostures with which they kept the people in submission  also he exposited the theory as ancient as priests and rulers that priests and rulers must work together in the orderly governance of the people  he was content that the people should believe that the gods and the priests who were the mouthpieces of the gods had the last word but he would have the priests know that in private the last word was his  little as they believed in their trickery he told them he believed less  he knew taboo and the truth behind taboo  he explained his personal taboos and how they came to be  never must he eat clammeat he told agno  it was so selected by himself because he did not like clammeat it was old nino high priest before agno with an ear open to the voice of the sharkgod who had so laid the taboo  but he bashti had privily commanded nino to lay the taboo against clammeat upon him because he bashti did not like clammeat and had never liked clammeat  still further since he had lived longer than the oldest priest of them his had been the appointing of every one of them  he knew them had made them had placed them and they lived by his pleasure  and they would continue to take program from him as they had always taken it or else they would swiftly and suddenly pass  he had but to remind them of the passing of kori the devil devil doctor who had believed himself stronger than his chief and who for his mistake had screamed in pain for a week ere what composed him had ceased to scream and for ever ceased to scream        in agnos large grass house was little light and much mystery  there was no mystery there for jerry who merely knew things or did not know things and who never bothered about what he did not know  dried heads and other cured and mouldy portions of human carcasses impressed him no more than the dried alligators and dried fish that contributed to the festooning of agnos dark abode  jerry found himself well cared for  no children nor wives cluttered the devil devil doctors house  several old women a flyflapping girl of eleven and two young men who had graduated from the canoe house of the youths and who were studying priestcraft under the master composed the household and waited upon jerry  food of the choicest was his  after agno had eaten firstcut of pig jerry was served second  even the two acolytes and the flyflapping maid ate after him leaving the debris for the several old women  and unlike the mere bush dogs who stole shelter from the rain under overhanging eaves jerry was given a dry place under the roof where the heads of bushmen and of forgotten sandalwood traders hung down from above in the midst of a dusty confusion of dried viscera of sharks crocodile skulls and skeletons of solomons rats that measured twothirds of a yard in length from bonetip of nose to bonetip of tail  a number of times all freedom being his jerry stole away across the village to the house of lumai  but never did he find lamai who since skipper was the only human he had met that had placed a bid to his heart  jerry never appeared openly but from the thick fern of the brookside observed the house and scented out its occupants  no scent of lamai did he ever obtain and after a time he gave up his vain visits and accepted the devil devil doctors house as his home and the devil devil doctor as his master  but he bore no love for this master  agno who had ruled by fear so long in his house of mystery did not know love  nor was affection any part of him nor was geniality  he had no sense of humour and was as frostily cruel as an icicle  next to bashti he stood in power and all his days had been embittered in that he was not first in power  he had no softness for jerry  because he feared bashti he feared to harm jerry  the months passed and jerry got his firm massive second teeth and increased in weight and size  he came as near to being spoiled as is possible for a dog  himself taboo he quickly learned to lord it over the somo folk and to have his way and will in all matters  no one dared to dispute with him with stick or stone  agno hated himhe knew that but also he gleaned the knowledge that agno feared him and would not dare to hurt him  but agno was a chillblooded philosopher and bided his time being different from jerry in that he possessed human prevision and could adjust his actions to remote ends  from the edge of the lagoon into the waters of which remembering the crocodile taboo he had learned on meringe he never ventured jerry ranged to the outlying bush villages of bashtis domain  all made way for him  all fed him when he desired food  for the taboo was upon him and he might unchidden invade their sleepingmats or food calabashes  he might bully as he pleased and be arrogant beyond decency and there was no one to say him nay  even had bashtis word gone forth that if jerry were attacked by the fullgrown bush dogs it was the duty of the somo folk to take his part and kick and stone and beat the bush dogs  and thus his own fourlegged cousins came painfully to know that he was taboo  and jerry prospered  fat to stupidity he might well have become had it not been for his highstrung nerves and his insatiable eager curiosity with the freedom of all somo his he was ever afoot over it learning its metes and bounds and the ways of the wild creatures that inhabited its swamps and forests and that did not acknowledge his taboo  many were his adventures  he fought two battles with the woodrats that were almost of his size and that being mature and wild and cornered fought him as he had never been fought before  the first he had killed unaware that it was an old and feeble rat  the second in prime of vigour had so punished him that he crawled back weak and sick to the devil devil doctors house where for a week under the dried emblems of death he licked his wounds and slowly came back to life and health  he stole upon the dugong and joyed to stampede that silly timid creature by sudden ferocious onslaughts which he knew himself to be all sound and fury but which tickled him and made him laugh with the consciousness of playing a successful joke  he chased the unmigratory tropiducks from their shrewdhidden nests walked circumspectly among the crocodiles hauled out of water for slumber and crept under the jungleroof and spied upon the snowwhite saucy cockatoos the fierce ospreys the heavy flighted buzzards the lories and kingfishers and the absurdly garrulous little pygmy parrots  thrice beyond the boundaries of somo he encountered the little black bushmen who were more like ghosts than men so noiseless and unperceivable were they and who guarding the wildpig runways of the jungle missed spearing him on the three memorable occasions  as the woodrats had taught him discretion so did these twolegged lurkers in the jungle twilight  he had not fought with them although they tried to spear him  he quickly came to know that these were other folk than somo folk that his taboo did not extend to them and that even of a sort they were twolegged gods who carried flying death in their hands that reached farther than their hands and bridged distance  as he ran the jungle so jerry ran the village  no place was sacred to him  in the devil devil houses where before the face of mystery men and women crawled in fear and trembling he walked stifflegged and bristling for fresh heads were suspended thereheads his eyes and keen nostrils identified as those of once living blacks he had known on board the arangi  in the biggest devil devil house he encountered the head of borckman and snarled at it without receiving response in recollection of the fight he had fought with the schnappsaddled mate on the deck of the arangi  once however in bashtis house he chanced upon all that remained on earth of skipper  bashti had lived very long had lived most wisely and thought much and was thoroughly aware that having lived far beyond the span of man his own span was very short  and he was curious about it allthe meaning and purpose of life  he loved the world and life into which he had been fortunately born both as to constitution and to place which latter for him had been the high place over hie priests and people  he was not afraid to die but he wondered if he might live again  he discounted the silly views of the tricky priests and he was very much alone in the chaos of the confusing problem  for he had lived so long and so luckily that he had watched the waning to extinction of all the vigorous appetites and desires  he had known wives and children and the keenedge of youthful hunger  he had seen his children grow to manhood and womanhood and become fathers and grandfathers mothers and grandmothers  but having known woman and love and fatherhood and the bellydelights of eating he had passed on beyond  food  scarcely did he know its meaning so little did he eat hunger that bit him like a spur when he was young and lusty had long since ceased to stir and prod him  he ate out of a sense of necessity and duty and cared little for what he ate save for one thing the eggs of the megapodes that were in season laid in his private personal strictly tabooed megapode layingyard  here was left to him his last lingering flesh thrill  as for the rest he lived in his intellect ruling his people seeking out data from which to induce laws that would make his people stronger and rivet his peoples clinch upon life  but he realized clearly the difference between that abstract thing the tribe and that most concrete of things the individual  the tribe persisted  its members passed  the tribe was a memory of the history and habits of all previous members which the living members carried on until they passed and became history and memory in the intangible sum that was the tribe  he as a member soon or late and late was very near must pass  but pass to what  there was the rub  and so it was on occasion that he ordered all forth from his big grass house and alone with his problem lowered from the roofbeams the mattingwrapped parcels of heads of men he had once seen live and who had passed into the mysterious nothingness of death  not as a miser had he collected these heads and not as a miser counting his secret hoard did he ponder these heads unwrapped held in his two hands or lying on his knees  he wanted to know  he wanted to know what he guessed they might know now that they had long since gone into the darkness that rounds the end of life  various were the heads bashti thus interrogatedin his hands on his knees in his dimlighted grasshouse while the overhead sun blazed down and the fading southeast sighed through the palmfronds and breadfruit branches  there was the head of a japanesethe only one he had ever seen or heard of  before he was born it had been taken by his father illcured it was and battered and marred with ancientness and rough usage  yet he studied its features decided that it had once had two lips as live as his own and a mouth as vocal and hungry as his had often been in the past  two eyes and a nose it had a thatched crown of roof and a pair of ears like to his own  two legs and a body it must once have had and desires and lusts  heats of wrath and of love so he decided had also been its once on a time when it never thought to die  a head that amazed him much whose history went back before his fathers and grandfathers time was the head of a frenchman although bashti knew it not  nor did he know it was the head of la perouse the doughty old navigator who had left his bones the bones of his crews and the bones of his two frigates the astrolabe and the boussole on the shores of the cannibal solomons  another headfor bashti was a confirmed head collectorwent back two centuries before la perouse to alvaro de mendana the spaniard  it was the head of one of mendanas armourers lost in a beach scrimmage to one of bashtis remote ancestors  still another head the history of which was vague was a white womans head  what wife of what navigator there was no telling  but earrings of gold and emerald still clung to the withered ears and the hair twothirds of a fathom long a shimmering silk of golden floss flowed from the scalp that covered what had once been the wit and will of her that bashti reasoned had in her ancient time been quick with love in the arms of man  ordinary heads of bushmen and saltwater men and even of schnappsdrinking white men like borckman he relegated to the canoe houses and devil devil houses  for he was a connoisseur in the matter of heads  there was a strange head of a german that lured him much  red bearded it was and redhaired but even in dried death there was an ironness of feature and a massive brow that hinted to him of mastery of secrets beyond his ken  no more than did he know it once had been a german did he know it was a german professors head an astronomers head a head that in its time had carried within its content profound knowledge of the stars in the vasty heavens of the way of stardirected ships upon the sea and of the way of the earth on its starry course through space that was a myriad million times beyond the slight concept of space that he possessed  last of all sharpest of bite in his thought was the head of van horn and it was the head of van horn that lay on his knees under his contemplation when jerry who possessed the freedom of somo trotted into bashtis grass house scented and identified the mortal remnant of skipper wailed first in woe over it then bristled into rage  bashti did not notice at first for he was deep in interrogation of van horns head  only short months before this head had been alive he pondered quick with wit attached to a twolegged body that stood erect and that swaggered about a loincloth and a belted automatic around its middle more powerful therefrom than bashti but with less wit for had not he bashti with an ancient pistol put darkness inside that skull where wit resided and removed that skull from the soddenly relaxed framework of flesh and bone on which it had been supported to tread the earth and the deck of the arangi  what had become of that wit  had that wit been all of the arrogant upstanding van horn and had it gone out as the flickering flame of a splinter of wood goes out when it is quite burnt to a powderfluff of ash  had all that made van horn passed like the flame of the splinter had he passed into the darkness for ever into which the beast passed into which passed the speared crocodile the hooked bonita the netted mullet the slain pig that was fat to eat  was van horns darkness as the darkness of the bluebottle fly that his flyflapping maid smashed and disrupted in midflight of the airas the darkness into which passed the mosquito that knew the secret of flying and that despite its perfectness of flight with almost an unthought action he squashed with the flat of his hand against the back of his neck when it bit him  what was true of this white mans head so recently alive and erectly dominant bashti knew was true of himself  what had happened to this white man after going through the dark gate of death would happen to him  wherefore he questioned the head as if its dumb lips might speak to him from out of the mystery and tell him the meaning of life and the meaning of death that inevitably laid life by the heels  jerrys longdrawn howl of woe at sight and scent of all that was left of skipper roused bashti from his reverie  he looked at the sturdy golden brown puppy and immediately included it in his reverie  it was alive it was like man  it knew hunger and pain anger and love  it had blood in its veins like man that a thrust of a knife could make redly gush forth and denude it to death  like the race of man it loved its kind and birthed and breastnourished its young  and passed  ay it passed for many a dog as well as a human had he bashti devoured in his hey dey of appetite and youth when he knew only motion and strength and fed motion and strength out of the calabashes of feasting  but from woe jerry went on into anger  he stalked stifflegged with a snarl writhen on his lips and with recurrent waves of hairbristling along his back and up his shoulders and neck  and he stalked not the head of skipper where rested his love but bashti who held the head on his knees  as the wild wolf in the upland pasture stalks the mare mother with her newly delivered colt so jerry stalked bashti  and bashti who had never feared death all his long life and who had laughed a joke with his forefinger blown off by the bursting flintlock pistol smiled gleefully to himself for his glee was intellectual and in admiration of this halfgrown puppy whom he rapped on the nose with a short hardwood stick and compelled to keep distance  no matter how often and fiercely jerry rushed him he met the rush with the stick and chuckled aloud understanding the puppys courage marvelling at the stupidity of life that impelled him continually to thrust his nose to the hurt of the stick and that drove him by passion of remembrance of a dead man to dare the pain of the stick again and again  this too was life bashti meditated as he deftly rapped the screaming puppy away from him  fourlegged life it was young and silly and hot heartprompted that was like any young man making love to his woman in the twilight or like any young man fighting to the death with any other young man over a matter of passion hurt pride or thwarted desire  as much as in the dead head of van horn or of any man he realized that in this live puppy might reside the clue to existence the solution of the riddle  so he continued to rap jerry on the nose away from him and to marvel at the persistence of the vital something within him that impelled him to leap forward always to the stick that hurt him and made him recoil  the valour and motion the strength and the unreasoning of youth he knew it to be and he admired it sadly and envied it willing to exchange for it all his lean grey wisdom if only he could find the way  some dog that dog sure some dog he might have uttered in van horns fashion of speech  instead in bechedemer which was as habitual to him as his own somo speech he thought  my word that fella dog no fright along me  but age wearied sooner of the play and bashti put an end to it by rapping jerry heavily behind the ear and stretching him out stunned  the spectacle of the puppy so alive and raging the moment before and the moment after lying as if dead caught bashtis speculative fancy  the stick with a single sharp rap of it had effected the change  where had gone the anger and wit of the puppy  was that all it was the flame of the splinter that could be quenched by any chance gust of air  one instant jerry had raged and suffered snarled and leaped willed and directed his actions  the next instant he lay limp and crumpled in the little death of unconsciousness  in a brief space bashti knew consciousness sensation motion and direction would flow back into the wilted little carcass  but where in the meanwhile at the impact of the stick had gone all the consciousness and sensitiveness and will  bashti sighed wearily and wearily wrapped the heads in their grassmat coveringsall but van horns and hoisted them up in the air to hang from the roofbeamsto hang as he debated long after he was dead and out if it even as some of them had so hung from long before his fathers and his grandfathers time  the head of van horn he left lying on the floor while he stole out himself to peer in through a crack and see what next the puppy might do  jerry quivered at first and in the matter of a minute struggled feebly to his feet where he stood swaying and dizzy and thus bashti his eye to the crack saw the miracle of life flow back through the channels of the inert body and stiffen the legs to upstanding and saw consciousness the mystery of mysteries flood back inside the head of bone that was covered with hair smoulder and glow in the opening eyes and direct the lips to writhe away from the teeth and the throat to vibrate to the snarl that had been interrupted when the stick smashed him down into darkness  and more bashti saw  at first jerry looked about for his enemy growling and bristling his neck hair  next in lieu of his enemy he saw skippers head and crept to it and loved it kissing with his tongue the hard cheeks the closed lids of the eyes that his love could not open the immobile lips that would not utter one of the lovewords they had been used to utter to the little dog  next in profound desolation jerry set down before skippers head pointed his nose toward the lofty ridgepole and howled mournfully and long  finally sick and subdued he crept out of the house and away to the house of his devil devil master where for the round of twentyfour hours he waked and slept and dreamed centuries of nightmares  for ever after in somo jerry feared that grass house of bashti  he was not in fear of bashti  his fear was indescribable and unthinkable  in that house was the nothingness of what once was skipper  it was the token of the ultimate catastrophe to life that was wrapped and twisted into every fibre of his heredity  one step advanced beyond this jerrys uttermost the folk of somo from the contemplation of death had achieved concepts of the spirits of the dead still living in immaterial and supersensuous realms  and thereafter jerry hated bashti intensely as a lord of life who possessed and laid on his knees the nothingness of skipper  not that jerry reasoned it out  all dim and vague it was a sensation an emotion a feeling an instinct an intuition name it mistily as one will in the misty nomenclature of speech wherein words cheat with the impression of definiteness and lie to the brain an understanding which the brain does not possess     chapter xvi   three months more passed the northwest monsoon after its halfyear of breath had given way to the southeast trade and jerry still continued to live in the house of agno and to have the run of the village  he had put on weight increased in size and protected by the taboo had become selfconfident almost to lordliness  but he had found no master  agno had never won a heartthrob from him  for that matter agno had never tried to win him  nor in his coldblooded way had he ever betrayed his hatred of jerry  not even the several old women the two acolytes and the flyflapping maid in agnos house dreamed that the devil devil doctor hated jerry  nor did jerry dream it  to him agno was a neutral sort of person a person who did not count  those of the household jerry recognized as slaves or servants to agno and he knew when they fed him that the food he ate proceeded from agno and was agnos food  save himself taboo protected all of them feared agno and his house was truly a house of fear in which could bloom no love for a stray puppy dog  the elevenyears maid might have placed a bid for jerrys affection had she not been deterred at the start by agno who reprimanded her sternly for presuming to touch or fondle a dog of such high taboo  what delayed agnos plot against jerry for the halfyear of the monsoon was the fact that the season of egglaying for the megapodes in bashtis private layingyard did not begin until the period of the southeast trades  and agno having early conceived his plot with the patience that was characteristic of him was content to wait the time  now the megapode of the solomons is a distant cousin to the brush turkey of australia  no larger than a large pigeon it lays an egg the size of a domestic ducks  the megapode with no sense of fear is so silly that it would have been annihilated hundreds of centuries before had it not been preserved by the taboos of the chiefs and priests  as it was the chiefs were compelled to keep cleared patches of sand for it and to fence out the dogs  it buried its eggs two feet deep depending on the heat of the sun for the hatching  and it would dig and lay and continue to dig and lay while a black dug out its eggs within two or three feet of it  the layingyard was bashtis  during the season he lived almost entirely on megapode eggs  on rare occasion he even had megapodes that were near to finishing their laying killed for his kaikai  this was no more than a whim however prompted by pride in such exclusiveness of diet only possible to one in such high place  in truth he cared no more for megapode meat than for any other meat  all meat tasted alike to him for his taste for meat was one of the vanished pleasures in the limbo of memory  but the eggs  he liked to eat them  they were the only article of food he liked to eat they gave him reminiscent thrills of the ancient food desires of his youth  actually was he hungry when he had megapode eggs and the wellnigh dried founts of saliva and of internal digestive juices were stimulated to flow again at contemplation of a megapode egg prepared for the eating  wherefore he alone of all somo barred rigidly by taboo ate megapode eggs  and since the taboo was essentially religious to agno was deputed the ecclesiastical task of guarding and cherishing and caring for the royal layingyard  but agno was no longer young  the acid bite of belly desire had long since deserted him and he too ate from a sense of duty all meat tasting alike to him  megapode eggs only stung his taste alive and stimulated the flow of his juices  thus it was that he broke the taboos he imposed and privily before the eyes of no man woman or child ate the eggs he stole from bashtis private preserve  so it was as the laying season began and when both bashti and agno were acutely eggyearning after six months of abstinence that agno led jerry along the taboo path through the mangroves where they stepped from root to root above the muck that ever steamed and stank in the stagnant air where the wind never penetrated  the path which was not an ordinary path and which consisted for a man in wide strides from root to root and for a dog in fourlegged leaps and plunges was new to jerry  in all his ranging of somo because it was so unusual a path he had never discovered it  the unbending of agno thus to lead him was a surprise and a delight to jerry who without reasoning about it in a vague way felt the preliminary sensations that possibly agno in a small way might prove the master which his dogs soul continually sought  emerging from the swamp of mangroves abruptly they came upon a patch of sand still so salt and inhospitable from the seas deposit that no great trees rooted and interposed their branches between it and the suns heat a primitive gate gave entrance but agno did not take jerry through it instead with weird little chirrupings of encouragement and excitation he persuaded jerry to dig a tunnel beneath the rude palisade of fence  he helped with his own hands dragging out the sand in quantities but imposing on jerry the leaving of the indubitable marks of a dogs paws and claws  and when jerry was inside agno passing through the gate enticed and seduced him into digging out the eggs  but jerry had no taste of the eggs  eight of them agno sucked raw and two of them he tucked whole into his armpits to take back to his house of the devil devils  the shells of the eight he sucked he broke to fragments as a dog might break them and to build the picture he had long visioned of the eighth egg he reserved a tiny portion which he spread not on jerrys jowls where his tongue could have erased it but high up about his eyes and above them where it would remain and stand witness against him according to the plot he had planned  even worse in high priestly sacrilege he encouraged jerry to attack a megapode hen in the act of laying  and while jerry slew it knowing that the lust of killing once started would lead him to continue killing the silly birds agno left the layingyard to hotfoot it through the mangrove swamp and present to bashti an ecclesiastical quandary  the taboo of the dog as he expounded it had prevented him from interfering with the taboo dog when it ate the taboo egglayers  which taboo might be the greater was beyond him  and bashti who had not tasted a megapode egg in half a year and who was keen for the one recrudescent thrill of remote youth still left to him led the way back across the mangrove swamp at so prodigious a pace as quite to wind his high priest who was many years younger than he  and he arrived at the layingyard and caught jerry redpawed and red mouthed in the midst of his fourth kill of an egglayer the raw yellow yolk of the portion of one egg plastered by agno to represent many eggs still about his eyes and above his eyes to the bulge of his forehead  in vain bashti looked about for one egg the six months hunger stronger than ever upon him in the thick of the disaster  and jerry under the consent and encouragement of agno wagged his tail to bashti in a bid for recognition of prowess and laughed with his reddripping jowls and yellow plastered eyes  bashti did not rage as he would have done had he been alone  before the eyes of his chief priest he disdained to lower himself to such commonness of humanity  thus it is always with those in the high places ever temporising with their natural desires ever masking their ordinariness under a show of disinterest  so it was that bashti displayed no vexation at the disappointment to his appetite  agno was a shade less controlled for he could not quite chase away the eager light in his eyes  bashti glimpsed it and mistook it for simple curiosity of observation not guessing its real nature  which goes to show two things of those in the high place one that they may fool those beneath them the other that they may be fooled by those beneath them  bashti regarded jerry quizzically as if the matter were a joke and shot a careless side glance to note the disappointment in his priests eyes ah ha thought bashti i have fooled him  which is the high taboo agno queried in the somo tongue  as you should ask  of a surety the megapode  and the dog was agnos next query  must pay for breaking the taboo  it is a high taboo  it is my taboo it was so placed by somo the ancient father and first ruler of all of us and it has been ever since the taboo of the chiefs  the dog must die  he paused and considered the matter while jerry returned to digging the sand where the scent was auspicious  agno made to stop him but bashti interposed  let be he said  let the dog convict himself before my eyes  and jerry did uncovering two eggs breaking them and lapping that portion of their precious contents which was not spilled and wasted in the sand  bashtis eyes were quite lacklustre as he asked  the feast of dogs for the men is today  tomorrow at midday agno answered  already are the dogs coming in there will be at least fifty of them  fifty and one was bashtis verdict as he nodded at jerry  the priest made a quick movement of impulse to capture jerry  why now the chief demanded  you will but have to carry him through the swamp  let him trot back on his own legs and when he is before the canoe house tie his legs there  across the swamp and approaching the canoe house jerry trotting happily at the heels of the two men heard the wailing and sorrowing of many dogs that spelt unmistakable woe and pain  he developed instant suspicion that was however without direct apprehension for himself  and at that moment his ears cocked forward and his nose questing for further information in the matter bashti seized him by the nape of the neck and held him in the air while agno proceeded to tie his legs  no whimper nor sound nor sign of fear came from jerryonly choking growls of ferociousness intermingled with snarls of anger and a belligerent upclawing of hindlegs  but a dog clutched by the neck from the back can never be a match for two men gifted with the intelligence and deftness of men each of them twohanded with four fingers and an opposable thumb to each hand  his forelegs and hindlegs tied lengthwise and crosswise he was carried headdownward the short distance to the place of slaughter and cooking and flung to the earth in the midst of the score or more of dogs similarly tied and helpless  although it was midafternoon a number of them had so lain since early morning in the hot sun  they were all bush dogs or wilddogs and so small was their courage that their thirst and physical pain from cords drawn too tight across veins and arteries and their dim apprehension of the fate such treatment foreboded led them to whimper and wail and howl their despair and suffering  the next thirty hours were bad hours for jerry  the word had gone forth immediately that the taboo on him had been removed and of the men and boys none was so low as to do him reverence  about him till nightfall persisted a circle of teasers and tormenters  they harangued him for his fall sneered and jeered at him rooted him about contemptuously with their feet made a hollow in the sand out of which he could not roll and desposited him in it on his back his four tied legs sticking ignominiously in the air above him  and all he could do was growl and rage his helplessness  for unlike the other dogs he would not howl or whimper his pain  a year old now the last six months had gone far toward maturing him and it was the nature of his breed to be fearless and stoical  and much as he had been taught by his white masters to hate and despise niggers he learned in the course of these thirty hours an especially bitter and undying hatred  his torturers stopped at nothing  even they brought wilddog and set him upon jerry  but it was contrary to wilddogs nature to attack an enemy that could not move even if the enemy was jerry who had so often bullied him and rolled him on the deck  had jerry with a broken leg or so still retained power of movement then he would have mauled him perhaps to death  but this utter helplessness was different  so the expected show proved a failure  when jerry snarled and growled wilddog snarled and growled back and strutted and bullied around him him to persuasion of the blacks could induce but no sink his teeth into jerry  the killingground before the canoe house was a bedlam of horror  from time to time more bound dogs were brought in and flung down  there was a continuous howling especially contributed to by those which had lain in the sun since early morning and had no water  at times all joined in the control of the quietest breaking down before the wave of excitement and fear that swept spasmodically over all of them  this howling rising and falling but never ceasing continued throughout the night and by morning all were suffering from the intolerable thirst  the sun blazing down upon them in the white sand and almost parboiling them brought anything but relief  the circle of torturers formed about jerry again and again was wreaked upon him all abusive contempt for having lost his taboo  what drove jerry the maddest were not the blows and physical torment but the laughter  no dog enjoys being laughed at and jerry least of all could restrain his wrath when they jeered him and cackled close in his face  although he had not howled once his snarling and growling combined with his thirst had hoarsened his throat and dried the mucous membranes of his mouth so that he was incapable except under the sheerest provocation of further sound  his tongue hung out of his mouth and the eight oclock sun began slowly to burn it  it was at this time that one of the boys cruelly outraged him  he rolled jerry out of the hollow in which he had lain all night on his back turned him over on his side and presented to him a small calabash filled with water  jerry lapped it so fanatically that not for half a minute did he become aware that the boy had squeezed into it many hot seeds of ripe red peppers  the circle shrieked with glee and what jerrys thirst had been before was as nothing compared with this new thirst to which had been added the stinging agony of pepper  next in event and a most important event it was to prove came nalasu nalasu was an old man of threescore years and he was blind walking with a large staff with which he prodded his path  in his free hand he carried a small pig by its tied legs  they say the white masters dog is to be eaten he said in the somo speech  where is the white masters dog  show him to me  agno who had just arrived stood beside him as he bent over jerry and examined him with his fingers  nor did jerry offer to snarl or bite although the blind mans hands came within reach of his teeth more than once  for jerry sensed no enmity in the fingers that passed so softly over him  next nalasu felt over the pig and several times as if calculating alternated between jerry and the pig  nalasu stood up and voiced judgment  the pig is as small as the dog  they are of a size but the pig has more meat on it for the eating  take the pig and i shall take the dog  nay said agno  the white masters dog has broken the taboo  it must be eaten  take any other dog and leave the pig  take a big dog  i will have the white masters dog nalasu persisted  only the white masters dog and no other  the matter was at a deadlock when bashti chanced upon the scene and stood listening  take the dog nalasu he said finally  it is a good pig and i shall myself eat it  but he has broken the taboo your great taboo of the layingyard and must go to the eating agno interposed quickly  too quickly bashti thought while a vague suspicion arose in his mind of he knew not what  the taboo must be paid in blood and cooking agno continued  very well said bashti  i shall eat the small pig  let its throat be cut and its body know the fire  i but speak the law of the taboo  life must pay for the breaking  there is another law bashti grinned  long has it been since ever somo built these walls that life may buy life  but of life of man and life of woman agno qualified  i know the law bashti held steadily on  somo made the law  never has it been said that animal life may not buy animal life  it has never been practised was the devil devil doctors fling  and for reason enough the old chief retorted  never before has a man been fool enough to give a pig for a dog  it is a young pig and it is fat and tender  take the dog nalasu  take the dog now  but the devil devil doctor was not satisfied  as you said o bashti in your very great wisdom he is the seed dog of strength and courage  let him be slain  when he comes from the fire his body shall be divided into many small pieces so that every man may eat of him and thereby get his portion of strength and courage  better is it for somo that its men be strong and brave rather than its dogs  but bashti held no anger against jerry  he had lived too long and too philosophically to lay blame on a dog for breaking a taboo which it did not know  of course dogs often were slain for breaking the taboos  but he allowed this to be done because the dogs themselves in nowise interested him and because their deaths emphasized the sacredness of the taboo  further jerry had more than slightly interested him  often since jerry had attacked him because of van horns head he had pondered the incident  baffling as it was as all manifestations of life were baffling it had given him food for thought  then there was his admiration for jerrys courage and that inexplicable something in him that prevented him crying out from the pain of the stick  and without thinking of it as beauty the beauty of line and colour of jerry had insensibly penetrated him with a sense of pleasantness  it was good to look upon  there was another angle to bashtis conduct  he wondered why his devil devil doctor so earnestly desired a mere dogs death  there were many dogs  then why this particular dog  that the weight of something was on the others mind was patent although what it was bashti could not gauge guessunless it might be revenge incubated the day he had prevented agno from eating the dog  if such were the case it was a state of mind he could not tolerate in any of his tribespeople  but whatever was the motive guarding as he always did against the unknown he thought it well to discipline his priest and demonstrate once again whose word was the last word in somo  wherefore bashti replied  i have lived long and eaten many pigs  what man may dare say that the many pigs have entered into me and made me a pig  he paused and cast a challenging eye around the circle of his audience but no man spoke  instead some men grinned sheepishly and were restless on their feet while agnos expression advertised sturdy unbelief that there was anything piglike about his chief  i have eaten much fish bashti continued  never has one scale of a fish grown out on my skin  never has a gill appeared on my throat  as you all know by the looking never have i sprouted one fin out of my backbonenalasu take the dogaga carry the pig to my house  i shall eat it todayagno let the killing of the dogs begin so that the canoemen shall eat at due time  then as he turned to go he lapsed into bechedemer english and flung sternly over his shoulder my word you make m me cross along you     chapter xvii   as blind nalasu slowly plodded away with one hand tapping the path before him and with the other carrying jerry headdownward suspended by his tied legs jerry heard a sudden increase in the wild howling of the dogs as the killing began and they realized that death was upon them  but unlike the boy lamai who had known no better the old man did not carry jerry all the way to his house  at the first stream pouring down between the low hills of the rising land he paused and put jerry down to drink  and jerry knew only the delight of the wet coolness on his tongue all about his mouth and down his throat  nevertheless in his subconsciousness was being planted the impression that kinder than lamai than agno than bashti this was the kindest black he had encountered in somo  when he had drunk till for the moment he could drink no more he thanked nalasu with his tonguenot warmly nor ecstatically as had it been skippers hand but with due gratefulness for the lifegiving draught the old man chuckled in a pleased way rolled jerrys parched body into the water and keeping his head above the surface rubbed the water into his dry skin and let him lie there for long blissful minutes  from the stream to nalasus house a goodly distance nalasu still carried him with bound legs although not headdownward but clasped in one arm against his chest  his idea was to love the dog to him  for nalasu having sat in the lonely dark for many years had thought far more about the world around him and knew it far better than had he been able to see it  for his own special purpose he had need of a dog several bush dogs he had tried but they had shown little appreciation of his kindness and had invariably run away  the last had remained longest because he had treated it with the greatest kindness but run away it had before he had trained it to his purpose  but the white masters dog he had heard was different  it never ran away in fear while it was said to be more intelligent than the dogs of somo  the invention lamai had made of tying jerry with a stick had been noised abroad in the village and by a stick in nalasus house jerry found himself again tied  but with a difference  never once was the blind man impatient while he spent hours each day in squatting on his hams and petting jerry  yet had he not done this jerry who ate his food and who was growing accustomed to changing his masters would have accepted nalasu for master  further it was fairly definite in jerrys mind after the devil devil doctors tying him and flinging him amongst the other helpless dogs on the killingground that all mastership of agno had ceased  and jerry who had never been without a master since his first days in the world felt the imperative need of a master  so it was when the day came that the stick was untied from him that jerry remained voluntarily in nalasus house  when the old man was satisfied there would be no running away he began jerrys training  by slow degrees he advanced the training until hours a day were devoted to it  first of all jerry learned a new name for himself which was bao and he was taught to respond to it from an everincreasing distance no matter how softly it was uttered and nalasu continued to utter it more softly until it no longer was a spoken word but a whisper  jerrys ears were keen but nalasus from long use were almost as keen  further jerrys own hearing was trained to still greater acuteness hours at a time sitting by nalasu or standing apart from him he was taught to catch the slightest sounds or rustlings from the bush  still further he was taught to differentiate between the bush noises and between the ways he growled warnings to nalasu  if a rustle took place that jerry identified as a pig or a chicken he did not growl at all  if he did not identify the noise he growled fairly softly  but if the noise were made by a man or boy who moved softly and therefore suspiciously jerry learned to growl loudly if the noise were loud and careless then jerrys growl was soft  it never entered jerrys mind to question why he was taught all this  he merely did it because it was this latest masters desire that he should all this and much more at a cost of interminable time and patience nalasu taught him and much more he taught him increasing his vocabulary so that at a distance they could hold quick and sharply definite conversations  thus at fifty feet away jerry would whuff softly the information that there was a noise he did not know and nalasu with different sibilances would hiss to him to stand still to whuff more softly or to keep silent or to come to him noiselessly or to go into the bush and investigate the source of the strange noise or barking loudly to rush and attack it  perhaps if from the opposite direction nalasus sharp ears alone caught a strange sound he would ask jerry if he had heard it  and jerry alert to his toes to listen by an alteration in the quantity or quality of his whuff would tell nalasu that he did not hear next that he did hear and perhaps finally that it was a strange dog or a woodrat or a man or a boyall in the softest of sounds that were scarcely more than breathexhalations all monosyllables a veritable shorthand of speech  nalasu was a strange old man  he lived by himself in a small grass house on the edge of the village  the nearest house was quite a distance away while his own stood in a clearing in the thick jungle which approached no where nearer than sixty feet  also this cleared space he kept continually free from the fastgrowing vegetation  apparently he had no friends  at least no visitors ever came to his dwelling  years had passed since he discouraged the last  further he had no kindred  his wife was long since dead and his three sons not yet married in a foray behind the bounds of somo had lost their heads in the jungle runways of the higher hills and been devoured by their bushman slayers  for a blind man he was very busy  he asked favour of no one and was self supporting  in his houseclearing he grew yams sweet potatoes and taro  in another clearingbecause it was his policy to have no trees close to his househe had plantains bananas and half a dozen coconut palms  fruits and vegetables he exchanged down in the village for meat and fish and tobacco  he spent a good portion of his time on jerrys education and on occasion would make bows and arrows that were so esteemed by his tribespeople as to command a steady sale  scarcely a day passed in which he did not himself practise with bow and arrow  he shot only by direction of sound and whenever a noise or rustle was heard in the jungle and when jerry had informed him of its nature he would shoot an arrow at it  then it was jerrys duty cautiously to retrieve the arrow had it missed the mark  a curious thing about nalasu was that he slept no more than three hours in the twentyfour that he never slept at night and that his brief daylight sleep never took place in the house  hidden in the thickest part of the neighbouring jungle was a sort of nest to which led no path he never entered nor left by the same way so that the tropic growth on the rich soil being so rarely trod upon ever obliterated the slightest sign of his having passed that way  whenever he slept jerry was trained to remain on guard and never to go to sleep  reason enough there was and to spare for nalasus infinite precaution the oldest of his three sons had slain one ao in a quarrel  ao had been one of six brothers of the family of anno which dwelt in one of the upper villages  according to somo law the anno family was privileged to collect the blooddebt from the nalasu family but had been balked of it by the deaths of nalasus three sons in the bush  and since the somo code was a life for a life and since nalasu alone remained alive of his family it was well known throughout the tribe that the annos would never be content until they had taken the blind mans life  but nalasu had been famous as a great fighter as well as having been the progenitor of three such warlike sons  twice had the annos sought to collect the first time while nalasu still retained his eyesight  nalasu had discovered their trap circled about it and in the rear encountered and slain anno himself the father thus doubling the blooddebt  then had come his accident  while refilling manytimes used snider cartridges an explosion of black powder put out both his eyes immediately thereafter while he sat nursing his wounds the annos had descended upon himjust what he had expected  and for which he had made due preparation  that night two uncles and another brother stepped on poisoned thorns and died horribly  thus the sum of lives owing the annos had increased to five with only a blind man from whom to collect  thenceforth the annos had feared the thorns too greatly to dare again although ever their vindictiveness smouldered and they lived in hope of the day when nalasus head should adorn their ridgepole  in the meantime the state of affairs was not that of a truce but of a stalemate  the old man could not proceed against them and they were afraid to proceed against him  nor did the day come until after jerrys adoption when one of the annos made an invention the like of which had never been known in all malaita     chapter xviii   meanwhile the months slipped by the southeast trade blew itself out the monsoon had begun to breathe and jerry added to himself six months of time weight stature and thickness of bone  an easy time his half year with the blind man had been despite the fact that nalasu was a rigid disciplinarian who insisted on training jerry for longer hours day in and day out than falls to the lot of most dogs  never did jerry receive from him a blow never a harsh word  this man who had slain four of the annos three of them after he had gone blind who had slain still more men in his savage youth never raised his voice in anger to jerry and ruled him by nothing severer than the gentlest of chidings  mentally the persistent education jerry received in this period of late puppyhood fixed in him increased brain power for all his life  possibly no dog in all the world had ever been so vocal as he and for three reasons his own intelligence the genius for teaching that was nalasus and the long hours devoted to the teaching  his shorthand vocabulary for a dog was prodigious  almost might it be said that he and the man could talk by the hour although few and simple were the abstractions they could talk very little of the immediate concrete past and scarcely anything of the immediate concrete future entered into their conversations  jerry could no more tell him of meringe nor of the arangi than could he tell him of the great love he had borne skipper or of his reason for hating bashti  by the same token nalasu could not tell jerry of the bloodfeud with the annos nor of how he had lost his eyesight  practically all their conversation was confined to the instant present although they could compass a little of the very immediate past  nalasu would give jerry a series of instructions such as going on a scout by himself to go to the nest then circle about it widely to continue to the other clearing where were the fruit trees to cross the jungle to the main path to proceed down the main path toward the village till he came to the great banyan tree and then to return along the small path to nalasu and nalasus house  all of which jerry would carry out to the letter and arrived back would make report  as thus at the nest nothing unusual save that a buzzard was near it in the other clearing three coconuts had fallen to the groundfor jerry could count unerringly up to five between the other clearing and the main path were four pigs along the main path he had passed a dog more than five women and two children and on the small path home he had noted a cockatoo and two boys  but he could not tell nalasu his states of mind and heart that prevented him from being fully contented in his present situation  for nalasu was not a whitegod but only a mere nigger god  and jerry hated and despised all niggers save for the two exceptions of lamai and nalasu  he tolerated them and for nalasu had even developed a placid and sweet affection  love him he did not and could not  at the best they were only secondrate gods and he could not forget the great whitegods such as skipper and mister haggin and of the same breed derby and bob  they were something else something other something better than all this black savagery in which he lived  they were above and beyond in an unattainable paradise which he vividly remembered for which he yearned but to which he did not know the way and which dimly sensing the ending that comes to all things might have passed into the ultimate nothingness which had already overtaken skipper and the arangi  in vain did the old man play to gain jerrys heart of love  he could not bid against jerrys many reservations and memories although he did win absolute faithfulness and loyalty  not passionately as he would have fought to the death for skipper but devotedly would he have fought to the death for nalasu  and the old man never dreamed but what he had won all of jerrys heart        came the day of the annos when one of them made the invention which was thickplaited sandals to armour the soles of their feet against the poisoned thorns with which nalasu had taken three of their lives  the day in truth was the night a black night a night so black under a cloudpalled sky that a treetrunk could not be seen an eighth of an inch beyond ones nose  and the annos descended on nalasus clearing a dozen of them armed with sniders horse pistols tomahawks and war clubs walking gingerly despite their thick sandals because of fear of the thorns which nalasu no longer planted  jerry sitting between nalasus knees and nodding sleepily gave the first warning to nalasu who sat outside his door wideeyed earstrung as he had sat through all the nights of the many years  he listened still more tensely through long minutes in which he heard nothing at the same time whispering to jerry for information and commanding him to be softspoken and jerry with whuffs and whiffs and all the shorthand breathexhalations of speech he had been taught told him that men approached many men more men than five  nalasu reached the bow beside him strung an arrow and waited  at last his own ears caught the slightest of rustlings now here now there advancing upon him in the circle of the compass  still speaking for softness he demanded verification from jerry whose neck hair rose bristling under nalasus sensitive fingers and who by this time was reading the night air with his nose as well as his ears  and jerry as softly as nalasu informed him again that it was men many men more men than five  with the patience of age nalasu sat on without movement until close at hand on the very edge of the jungle sixty feet away he located a particular noise of a particular man  he stretched his bow loosed the arrow and was rewarded by a gasp and a groan strangely commingled  first he restrained jerry from retrieving the arrow which he knew had gone home and next he fitted a fresh arrow to the bow string  fifteen minutes of silence passed the blind man as if carven of stone the dog trembling with eagerness under the articulate touch of his fingers obeying the bidding to make no sound  for jerry as well as nalasu knew that death rustled and lurked in the encircling dark  again came a softness of movement nearer than before but the sped arrow missed  they heard its impact against a tree trunk beyond and a confusion of small sounds caused by the targets hasty retreat  next after a time of silence nalasu told jerry silently to retrieve the arrow  he had been well trained and long trained for with no sound even to nalasus ears keener than seeing mens ears he followed the direction of the arrows impact against the tree and brought the arrow back in his mouth  again nalasu waited until the rustlings of a fresh drawingin of the circle could be heard whereupon nalasu jerry accompanying him picked up all his arrows and moved soundlessly halfway around the circle  even as they moved a snider exploded that was aimed in the general direction of the spot just vacated  and the blind man and the dog from midnight to dawn successfully fought off twelve men equipped with the thunder of gunpowder and the widespreading deeppenetrating mushroom bullets of soft lead  and the blind man defended himself only with a bow and a hundred arrows  he discharged many hundreds of arrows which jerry retrieved for him and which he discharged over and over  but jerry aided valiantly and well adding to nalasus acute hearing his own acuter hearing circling noiselessly about the house and reporting where the attack pressed closest  much of their precious powder the annos wasted for the affair was like a game of invisible ghosts  never was anything seen save the flashes of the rifles  never did they see jerry although they became quickly aware of his movements close to them as he searched out the arrows  once as one of them felt for an arrow which had narrowly missed him he encountered jerrys back with his hand and acknowledged the sharp slash of jerrys teeth with a wild yell of terror  they tried firing at the twang of nalasus bowstring but every time nalasu fired he instantly changed position  several times warned of jerrys nearness they fired at him and once even was his nose slightly powder burned  when day broke in the quick tropic grey that marks the leap from dark to sun the annos retreated while nalasu withdrawn from the light into his house still possessed eighty arrows thanks to jerry  the net result to nalasu was one dead man and no telling how many arrowpricked wounded men who dragged themselves away  and half the day nalasu crouched over jerry fondling and caressing him for what he had done  then he went abroad jerry with him and told of the battle  bashti paid him a visit ere the day was done and talked with him earnestly  as an old man to an old man i talk was bashtis beginning  i am older than you o nalasu i have ever been unafraid  yet never have i been braver than you  i would that every man of the tribe were as brave as you  yet do you give me great sorrow  of what worth are your courage and cunning when you have no seed to make your courage and cunning live again  i am an old man nalasu began  not so old as i am bashti interrupted  not too old to marry so that your seed will add strength to the tribe  i was married and long married and i fathered three brave sons  but they are dead  i shall not live so long as you  i think of my young days as pleasant dreams remembered after sleep  more i think of death and the end  of marriage i think not at all  i am too old to marry  i am old enough to make ready to die and a great curiousness have i about what will happen to me when i am dead  will i be for ever dead  will i live again in a land of dreamsa shadow of a dream myself that will still remember the days when i lived in the warm world the quick juices of hunger in my mouth in the chest of the body of me the love of woman  bashti shrugged his shoulders  i too have thought much on the matter he said  yet do i arrive nowhere  i do not know  you do not know  we will not know until we are dead if it happens that we know anything when what we are we no longer are  but this we know you and i the tribe lives  the tribe never dies  wherefore if there be meaning at all to our living we must make the tribe strong  your work in the tribe is not done  you must marry so that your cunning and your courage live after you  i have a wife for younay two wives for your days are short and i shall surely live to see you hang with my fathers from the canoehouse ridgepole  i will not pay for a wife nalasu protested  i will not pay for any wife  i would not pay a stick of tobacco or a cracked coconut for the best woman in somo  worry not bashti went on placidly  i shall pay you for the price of the wife of the two wives  there is bubu  for half a case of tobacco shall i buy her for you  she is broad and square roundlegged broad hipped with generous breasts of richness  there is nena  her father sets a stiff price upon hera whole case of tobacco  i will buy her for you as well  your time is short  we must hurry  i will not marry the old blind man proclaimed hysterically  you will  i have spoken  no i say and say again no no no no  wives are nuisances  they are young things and their heads are filled with foolishness  their tongues are loose with idleness of speech  i am old i am quiet in my ways the fires of life have departed from me i prefer to sit alone in the dark and think  chattering young things about me with nothing but foam and spume in their heads on their tongues would drive me mad  of a surety they would drive me madso mad that i will spit into every clam shell make faces at the moon and bite my veins and howl  and if you do what of it  so long as your seed does not perish  i shall pay for the wives to their fathers and send them to you in three days  i will have nothing to do with them nalasu asserted wildly  you will bashti insisted calmly  because if you do not you will have to pay me  it will be a sore hard debt  i will have every joint of you unhinged so that you will be like a jellyfish like a fat pig with the bones removed and i will then stake you out in the midmost centre of the dogkilling ground to swell in pain under the sun  and what is left of you i shall fling to the dogs to eat  your seed shall not perish out of somo  i bashti so tell you  in three days i shall send to you your two wives      he paused and a long silence fell upon them  well bashti reiterated  it is wives or staking out unhinged in the sun  you choose but think well before you choose the unhinging  at my age with all the vexations of youngness so far behind me nalasu complained  choose  you will find there is vexation and liveliness and much of it in the centre of the dogkilling yard when the sun cooks your sore joints till the grease of the leanness of you bubbles like the tender fat of a cooked suckingpig  then send me the wives nalasu managed to utter after a long pause but send them in three days not in two nor tomorrow  it is well bashti nodded gravely  you have lived at all only because of those before you now long in the dark who worked so that the tribe might live and you might come to be  you are  they paid the price for you  it is your debt  you came into being with this debt upon you  you will pay the debt before you pass out of being  it is the law  it is very well     chapter xix   and had bashti hastened delivery of the wives by one day or by even two days nalasu would have entered the feared purgatory of matrimony  but bashti kept his word and on the third day was too busy with a more momentous problem to deliver bubu and nena to the blind old man who apprehensively waited their coming  for the morning of the third day all the summits of leeward malaita smoked into speech  a warship was on the coastso the tale ran a big warship that was heading in through the reef islands at langalanga  the tale grew  the warship was not stopping at langalanga  the warship was not stopping at binu  it was directing its course toward somo  nalasu blind could not see this smoke speech written in the air because of the isolation of his house no one came and told him  his first warning was when shrill voices of women cries of children and wailings of babes in nameless fear came to him from the main path that led from the village to the upland boundaries of somo  he read only fear and panic from the sounds deduced that the village was fleeing to its mountain fastnesses but did not know the cause of the flight  he called jerry to him and instructed him to scout to the great banyan tree where nalasus path and the main path joined and to observe and report  and jerry sat under the banyan tree and observed the flight of all somo  men women and children the young and the aged babes at breast and patriarchs leaning on sticks and staffs passed before his eyes betraying the greatest haste and alarm  the village dogs were as frightened whimpering and whining as they ran  and the contagion of terror was strong upon jerry  he knew the prod of impulse to join in this rush away from some unthinkably catastrophic event that impended and that stirred his intuitive apprehensions of death  but he mastered the impulse with his sense of loyalty to the blind man who had fed him and caressed him for a long six months  back with nalasu sitting between his knees he made his report  it was impossible for him to count more than five although he knew the fleeing population numbered many times more than five  so he signified five men and more five women and more five children and more five babies and more five dogs and moreeven of pigs did he announce five and more nalasus ears told him that it was many many times more and he asked for names  jerry know the names of bashti of agno and of lamai and lumai  he did not pronounce them with the slightest of resemblance to their customary soundings but pronounced them in the whiffwhuff of shorthand speech that nalasu had taught him  nalasu named over many other names that jerry knew by ear but could not himself evoke in sound and he answered yes to most of them by simultaneously nodding his head and advancing his right paw  to some names he remained without movement in token that he did not know them and to other names which he recognized but the owners of which he had not seen he answered no by advancing his left paw  and nalasu beyond knowing that something terrible was impendingsomething horribly more terrible than any foray of neighbouring saltwater tribes which somo behind her walls could easily fend off divined that it was the longexpected punitive manof war  despite his threescore years he had never experienced a village shelling  he had heard vague talk of what had happened in the matter of shellfire in other villages but he had no conception of it save that it must be bullets on a larger scale than snider bullets that could be fired correspondingly longer distances through the air  but it was given to him to know shellfire before he died  bashti who had long waited the cruiser that was to avenge the destruction of the arangi and the taking of the heads of the two white men and who had long calculated the damage to be wrought had given the command to his people to flee to the mountains  first in the vanguard borne by a dozen young men went his matwrapped parcels of heads  the last slow trailers in the rear of the exodus were just passing and nalasu his bow and his eighty arrows clutched to him jerry at his heels made his first step to follow when the air above him was rent by a prodigiousness of sound  nalasu sat down abruptly  it was his first shell and it was a thousand times more terrible than he had imagined  it was a ripsnorting sky splitting sound as of a cosmic fabric being torn asunder between the hands of some powerful god  for all the world it was like the roughest tearing across of sheets that were thick as blankets that were broad as the earth and wide as the sky  not only did he sit down just outside his door but he crouched his head to his knees and shielded it with the arch of his arms  and jerry who had never heard shellfire much less imagined what it was like was impressed with the awfulness of it  it was to him a natural catastrophe such as had happened to the arangi when she was flung down reeling on her side by the shouting wind  but true to his nature he did not crouch down under the shriek of that first shell  on the contrary he bristled his hair and snarled up with menacing teeth at whatever the thing was which was so enormously present and yet invisible to his eyes  nalasu crouched closer when the shell burst beyond and jerry snarled and rippled his hair afresh  each repeated his actions with each fresh shell for while they screamed no more loudly they burst in the jungle more closely  and nalasu who had lived a long life most bravely in the midst of perils he had known was destined to die a coward out of his fear of the thing unknown the chemically propelled missile of the white masters  as the dropping shells burst nearer and nearer what final self control he possessed left him  such was his utter panic that he might well have bitten his veins and howled  with a lunatic scream he sprang to his feet and rushed inside the house as if forsooth its grass thatch could protect his head from such huge projectiles  he collided with the doorjamb and ere jerry could follow him whirled around in a part circle into the centre of the floor just in time to receive the next shell squarely upon his head  jerry had just gained the doorway when the shell exploded  the house went into flying fragments and nalasu flew into fragments with it jerry in the doorway caught in the outdraught of the explosion was flung a score of feet away  all in the same fraction of an instant earthquake tidal wave volcanic eruption the thunder of the heavens and the fireflashing of an electric bolt from the sky smote him and smote consciousness out of him  he had no conception of how long he lay  five minutes passed before his legs made their first spasmodic movements and as he stumbled to his feet and rocked giddily he had no thought of the passage of time  he had no thought about time at all  as a matter of course his own idea on which he proceeded to act without being aware of it was that a part of a second before he had been struck a terrific blow magnified incalculable times beyond the blow of a stick at a niggers hands  his throat and lungs filled with the pungent stifling smoke of powder his nostrils with earth and dust he frantically wheezed and sneezed leaping about falling drunkenly leaping into the air again staggering on his hindlegs dabbing with his forepaws at his nose headdownward between his forelegs and even rubbing his nose into the ground  he had no thought for anything save to remove the biting pain from his nose and mouth the suffocation from his lungs  by a miracle he had escaped being struck by the flying splinters of iron and thanks to his strong heart had escaped being killed by the shock of the explosion  not until the end of five minutes of mad struggling in which he behaved for all the world like a beheaded chicken did he find life tolerable again  the maximum of stifling and of agony passed and although he was still weak and giddy he tottered in the direction of the house and of nalasu  and there was no house and no nalasuonly a debris intermingled of both  while the shells continued to shriek and explode now near now far jerry investigated the happening  as surely as the house was gone just as surely was nalasu gone  upon both had descended the ultimate nothingness  all the immediate world seemed doomed to nothingness  life promised only somewhere else in the high hills and remote bush whither the tribe had already fled  loyal he was to his salt to the master whom he had obeyed so long nigger that he was who so long had fed him and for whom he had entertained a true affection  but this master no longer was  retreat jerry did but he was not hasty in retreat  for a time he snarled at every shellscream in the air and every shellburst in the bush  but after a time while the awareness of them continued uncomfortably with him the hair on his neck remained laid down and he neither uttered a snarl nor bared his teeth  and when he parted from what had been and which had ceased to be not like the bush dogs did he whimper and run  instead he trotted along the path at a regular and dignified pace  when he emerged upon the main path he found it deserted  the last refugee had passed  the path always travelled from daylight to dark and which he had so recently seen glutted with humans now in its emptiness affected him profoundly with the impression of the endingness of all things in a perishing world  so it was that he did not sit down under the banyan tree but trotted along at the far rear of the tribe  with his nose he read the narrative of the flight  only once did he encounter what advertised its terror  it was an entire group annihilated by a shell  there were an old man of fifty with a crutch because of the leg which had been slashed off by a shark when he was a young boy a dead mary with a dead babe at her breast and a dead child of three clutching her hand and two dead pigs huge and fat which the woman had been herding to safety  and jerrys nose told him of how the stream of the fugitives had split and flooded past on each side and flowed together again beyond  incidents of the flight he did encounter a partchewed joint of sugarcane some child had dropped a clay pipe the stem short from successive breakages a single feather from some young mans hair and a calabash full of cooked yams and sweet potatoes deposited carefully beside the trail by some mary for whom its weight had proved too great  the shellfire ceased as jerry trotted along next he heard the rifle fire from the landingparty as it shot down the domestic pigs on somos streets  he did not hear however the chopping down of the coconut trees any more than did he ever return to behold what damage the axes had wrought  for right here occurred with jerry a wonderful thing that thinkers of the world have not explained  he manifested in his dogs brain the free agency of life by which all the generations of metaphysicians have postulated god and by which all the deterministic philosophers have been led by the nose despite their clear denouncement of it as sheer illusion what jerry did he did  he did not know how or why he did it any more than does the philosopher know how or why he decides on mush and cream for breakfast instead of two softboiled eggs  what jerry did was to yield in action to a brain impulse to do not what seemed the easier and more usual thing but to do what seemed the harder and more unusual thing  since it is easier to endure the known than to fly to the unknown since both misery and fear love company the apparent easiest thing for jerry to have done would have been to follow the tribe of somo into its fastnesses  yet what jerry did was to diverge from the line of retreat and to start northward across the bounds of somo and continue northward into a strange land of the unknown  had nalasu not been struck down by the ultimate nothingness jerry would have remained  this is true and this perhaps to the one who considers his action might have been the way he reasoned  but he did not reason it did not reason at all he acted on impulse  he could count five objects and pronounce them by name and number but he was incapable of reasoning that he would remain in somo if nalasu lived depart from somo if nalasu died  he merely departed from somo because nalasu was dead and the terrible shellfire passed quickly into the past of his consciousness while the present became vivid after the way of the present  almost on his toes did he tread the wild bushmens trails tense with apprehension of the lurking death he know infested such paths his ears cocked alertly for jungle sounds his eyes following his ears to discern what made the sounds  no more doughty nor daring was columbus venturing all that he was to the unknown than was jerry in venturing this jungledarkness of black malaita  and this wonderful thing this seeming great deed of free will he performed in much the same way that the itching of feet and tickle of fancy have led the feet of men over all the earth  though jerry never laid eyes on somo again bashti returned with his tribe the same day grinning and chuckling as he appraised the damage only a few grass houses had been damaged by the shells  only a few coconuts had been chopped down  and as for the slain pigs lest they spoil he made of their carcasses a great feast  one shell had knocked a hole through his seawall  he enlarged it for a launchingways faced the sides of it with dryfitted coral rock and gave orders for the building of an additional canoehouse  the only vexation he suffered was the death of nalasu and the disappearance of jerryhis two experiments in primitive eugenics     chapter xx   a week jerry spent in the bush deterred always from penetrating to the mountains by the bushmen who ever guarded the runways  and it would have gone hard with him in the matter of food had he not on the second day encountered a lone small pig evidently lost from its litter  it was his first hunting adventure for a living and it prevented him from travelling farther for true to his instinct he remained by his kill until it was nearly devoured  true he ranged widely about the neighbourhood finding no other food he could capture  but always until it was gone he returned to the slain pig  yet he was not happy in his freedom  he was too domesticated too civilized  too many thousands of years had elapsed since his ancestors had run freely wild  he was lonely  he could not get along without man too long had he and the generations before him lived in intimate relationship with the twolegged gods  too long had his kind loved man served him for love endured for love died for love and in return been partly appreciated less understood and roughly loved  so great was jerrys loneliness that even a twolegged blackgod was desirable since whitegods had long since faded into the limbo of the past  for all he might have known had he been capable of conjecturing the only whitegods in existence had perished  acting on the assumption that a blackgod was better than no god when he had quite finished the little pig he deflected his course to the left downhill toward the sea  he did this again without reasoning merely because in the subtle processes of his brain experience worked  his experience had been to live always close by the sea humans he had always encountered close by the sea and downhill had invariably led to the sea  he came out upon the shore of the reefsheltered lagoon where ruined grass houses told him men had lived  the jungle ran riot through the place  sixinch trees throated with rotten remnants of thatched roofs through which they had aspired toward the sun rose about him quickgrowing trees had shadowed the kingposts so that the idols and totems seated in carved shark jaws grinned greenly and monstrously at the futility of man through a rime of moss and mottled fungus  a poor little seawall never much at its best sprawled in ruin from the coconut roots to the placid sea  bananas plantains and breadfruit lay rotting on the ground  bones lay about human bones and jerry nosed them out knowing them for what they were emblems of the nothingness of life  skulls he did not encounter for the skulls that belonged to the scattered bones ornamented the devil devil houses in the upland bush villages  the salt tang of the sea gladdened his nostrils and he snorted with the pleasure of the stench of the mangrove swamp  but another crusoe chancing upon the footprint of another man friday his nose not his eyes shocked him electrically alert as he smelled the fresh contact of a living mans foot with the ground  it was a niggers foot but it was alive it was immediate and as he traced it a score of yards he came upon another footscent indubitably a white mans  had there been an onlooker he would have thought jerry had gone suddenly mad  he rushed frantically about turning and twisting his course now his nose to the ground now up in the air whining as frantically as he rushed leaping abruptly at right angles as new scents reached him scurrying here and there and everywhere as if in a game of tag with some invisible playfellow  but he was reading the full report which many men had written on the ground  a white man had been there he learned and a number of blacks here a black had climbed a coconut tree and cast down the nuts  there a banana tree had been despoiled of its clustered fruit and beyond it was evident that a similar event had happened to a breadfruit tree  one thing however puzzled hima scent new to him that was neither black mans nor white mans  had he had the necessary knowledge and the wit of eyeobservance he would have noted that the footprint was smaller than a mans and that the toeprints were different from a marys in that they were close together and did not press deeply into the earth  what bothered him in his smelling was his ignorance of talcum powder  pungent it was in his nostrils but never since first he had smelled out the footprints of man had he encountered such a scent  and with this were combined other and fainter scents that were equally strange to him  not long did he interest himself in such mystery  a white mans footprints he had smelled and through the maze of all the other prints he followed the one print down through a breach of seawall to the sea pounded coral sand lapped by the sea  here the latest freshness of many feet drew together where the nose of a boat had rested on the beach and where men had disembarked and embarked again  he smelled up all the story and his forelegs in the water till it touched his shoulders he gazed out across the lagoon where the disappearing trail was lost to his nose  had he been half an hour sooner he would have seen a boat without oars gasolinepropelled shooting across the quiet water  what he did see was an arangi  true it was far larger than the arangi he had known but it was white it was long it had masts and it floated on the surface of the sea  it had three masts skylofty and all of a size but his observation was not trained to note the difference between them and the one long and the one short mast of the arangi  the one floating world he had known was the whitepainted arangi  and since without a quiver of doubt this was the arangi then on board would be his beloved skipper  if arangis could resurrect then could skippers resurrect and in utter faith that the head of nothingness he had last seen on bashtis knees he would find again rejoined to its body and its two legs on the deck of the whitepainted floating world he waded out to his depth and swimming dared the sea  he greatly dared for in venturing the water he broke one of the greatest and earliest taboos he had learned  in his vocabulary was no word for crocodile yet in his thought as potent as any utterable word was an image of dreadful importan image of a log awash that was not a log and that was alive that could swim upon the surface under the surface and haul out across the dry land that was hugetoothed mightymawed and certain death to a swimming dog  but he continued the breaking of the taboo without fear  unlike a man who can be simultaneously conscious of two states of mind and who swimming would have known both the fear and the high courage with which he overrode the fear jerry as he swam knew only one state of mind which was that he was swimming to the arangi and to skipper  at the moment preceding the first stroke of his paws in the water out of his depth he had known all the terribleness of the taboo he deliberately broke  but launched out the decision made the line of least resistance taken he knew singlethoughted singlehearted only that he was going to skipper  little practised as he was in swimming he swam with all his strength whimpering in a sort of chant his eager love for skipper who indubitably must be aboard the white yacht half a mile away  his little song of love fraught with keenness of anxiety came to the ears of a man and woman lounging in deckchairs under the awning and it was the quickeyed woman who first saw the golden head of jerry and cried out what she saw  lower a boat husbandman she commanded  its a little dog  he mustnt drown  dogs dont drown that easily was husbandmans reply  hell make it all right  but what under the sun a dogs doing out here      he lifted his marine glasses to his eyes and stared a moment  and a white mans dog at that  jerry beat the water with his paws and moved steadily along straining his eyes at the growing yacht until suddenly warned by a sensing of immediate danger  the taboo smote him  this that moved toward him was the log awash that was not a log but a live thing of peril  part of it he saw above the surface moving sluggishly and ere that projecting part sank he had an awareness that somehow it was different from a log awash  next something brushed past him and he encountered it with a snarl and a splashing of his forepaws  he was halfwhirled about in the vortex of the things passage caused by the alarmed flirt of its tail  shark it was and not crocodile and not so timidly would it have sheered clear but for the fact that it was fairly full with a recent feed of a huge sea turtle too feeble with age to escape  although he could not see it jerry sensed that the thing the instrument of nothingness lurked about him  nor did he see the dorsal fin break surface and approach him from the rear  from the yacht he heard rifle shots in quick succession  from the rear a panic splash came to his ears  that was all  the peril passed and was forgotten  nor did he connect the rifleshots with the passing of the peril  he did not know and he was never to know that one known to men as harley kennan but known as husbandman by the woman he called wifewoman who owned the threetopmast schooner yacht ariel had saved his life by sending a thirtythirty marlin bullet through the base of a sharks fin  but jerry was to know harley kennan and quickly for it was harley kennan a bowline around his body under his armpits lowered by a couple of seamen down the generous freeboard of the ariel who gathered in by the nape of the neck the smoothcoated irish terrier that treading water perpendicularly had no eyes for him so eagerly did he gaze at the line of faces along the rail in quest of the one face  no pause for thanks did he make when he was dropped down upon the deck instead shaking himself instinctively as he ran he scurried along the deck for skipper  the man and his wife laughed at the spectacle  he acts as if he were demented with delight at being rescued mrs kennan observed  and mr kennan its not that  he must have a screw loose somewhere perhaps hes one of those creatures whove slipped the ratchet off the motion cog  maybe he cant stop running till he runs down  in the meantime jerry continued to run up port side and down starboard side from stern to bow and back again wagging his stump tail and laughing friendliness to the many twolegged gods he encountered  had he been able to think to such abstraction he would have been astounded at the number of whitegods  thirty there were at least of them not counting other gods that were neither black nor white but that still twolegged upright and garmented were beyond all peradventure gods likewise had he been capable of such generalization he would have decided that the whitegods had not yet all of them passed into the nothingness  as it was he realized all this without being aware that he realized it  but there was no skipper  he sniffed down the forecastle hatch sniffed into the galley where two chinese cooks jabbered unintelligibly to him sniffed down the cabin companionway sniffed down the engineroom skylight and for the first time knew gasoline and engine oil but sniff as he would wherever he ran no scent did he catch of skipper  aft at the wheel he would have sat down and howled his heartbreak of disappointment had not a whitegod evidently of command in golddecorated white duck cap and uniform spoken to him  instantly always a gentleman jerry smiled with flattened ears of courtesy wagged his tail and approached  the hand of this high god had almost caressed his head when the womans voice came down the deck in speech that jerry did not understand  the words and terms of it were beyond him  but he sensed power of command in it which was verified by the quick withdrawal of the hand of the god in white and gold who had almost caressed him this god stiffened electrically and pointed jerry along the deck and with mouth encouragements and urgings the import of which jerry could only guess directed him toward the one who so commanded by saying  send him please along to me captain winters  jerry wriggled his body in delight of obeying and would loyally have presented his head to her outreaching caress of hand had not the strangeness and difference of her deterred him  he broke off in midapproach and with a show of teeth snarled himself back and away from the windblown skirt of her  the only human females he had known were naked marys  this skirt flapping in the wind like a sail reminded him of the menacing mainsail of the arangi when it had jarred and crashed and swooped above his head  the noises her mouth made were gentle and ingratiating but the fearsome skirt still flapped in the breeze  you ridiculous dog she laughed  im not going to bite you  but her husband thrust out a rough sure hand and drew jerry in to him and jerry wriggled in ecstasy under the gods caress kissing the hand with a red flicker of tongue  next harley kennan directed him toward the woman sitting up in the deckchair and bending forward with hovering hands of greeting  jerry obeyed  he advanced with flattened ears and laughing mouth but just ere she could touch him the wind fluttered the skirt again and he backed away with a snarl  its not you that hes afraid of villa he said  but of your skirt perhaps hes never seen a skirt before  you mean villa kennan challenged that these headhunting cannibals ashore here keep records of pedigrees and maintain kennels for surely this absurd adventurer of a dog is as proper an irish terrier as the ariel is an oregonpineplanked schooner  harley kennan laughed in acknowledgment  villa kennan laughed too and jerry knew that these were a pair of happy gods and himself laughed with them  of his own initiative he approached the lady god again attracted by the talcum powder and other minor fragrances he had already identified as the strange scents encountered on the beach  but the unfortunate trade wind again fluttered her skirt and again he backed awaynot so far this time with much less of a bristle of his neck and shoulder hair and with no more of a snarl than a mere halfbaring of his fangs  hes afraid of your skirt harley insisted  look at him  he wants to come to you but the skirt keeps him away  tuck it under you so that it wont flutter and see what happens  villa kennan carried out the suggestion and jerry came circumspectly bent his head to her hand and writhed his back under it the while he sniffed her feet stockingclad and shoecovered and knew them as the feet which had trod uncovered the ruined ways of the village ashore  no doubt of it harley agreed  hes whiteman selected whiteman bred and born  he has a history  he knows adventure from the ground roots up  if he could tell his story wed sit listening entranced for days  depend on it hes not known blacks all his life  lets try him on johnny  johnny whom kennan beckoned up to him was a loan from the resident commissioner of the british solomons at tulagi who had come along as pilot and guide to kennan rather than as philosopher and friend  johnny approached grinning and jerrys demeanour immediately changed  his body stiffened under villa kennans hand as he drew away from her and stalked stifflegged to the black  jerrys ears did not flatten nor did he laugh fellowship with his mouth as he inspected johnny and smelt his calves for future reference  cavalier he was to the extreme and after the briefest of inspection he turned back to villa kennan  what did i say her husband exulted  he knows the colour line  hes a white mans dog that has been trained to it  my word spoke up johnny  me know m that fella dog  me know m papa and mamma belong along him  big fella white marster mister haggin stop along meringe mamma and papa stop along him that fella place  harley kennan uttered a sharp exclamation  of course he cried  the commissioner told me all about it  the arangi that the somo people captured sailed last from meringe plantation  johnny recognizes the dog as the same breed as the pair haggin of meringe must possess  but that was a long time ago  he must have been a little puppy  of course hes a white mans dog  and yet youve overlooked the crowning proof of it villa kennan teased  the dog carries the evidence around with him  harley looked jerry over carefully  indisputable evidence she insisted  after another prolonged scrutiny kennan shook his head  blamed if i can see anything so indisputable as to leave conjecture out  the tail his wife gurgled  surely the natives do not bob the tails of their dogsdo they johnny  do black man stop along malaita chop m off tail along dog  no chop m off johnny agreed  mister haggin along meringe he chop m off  my word he chop m that fella tail you bet  then hes the sole survivor of the arangi villa kennan concluded dont you agree mr sherlock holmes kennan  i salute you mrs s holmes her husband acknowledged gallantly  and all that remains is for you to lead me directly to the head of la perouse himself  the sailing directions record that he left it somewhere in these islands  little did they guess that jerry had lived on intimate terms with one bashti not many miles away along the shore who in somo at that very moment sat in his grass house pondering over a head on his withered knees that had once been the head of the great navigator the history of which had been forgotten by the sons of the chief who had taken it     chapter xxi   the fine threetopmast schooner ariel on a cruise around the world had already been out a year from san francisco when jerry boarded her  as a world and as a whitegod world she was to him beyond compare  she was not small like the arangi nor was she cluttered fore and aft on deck and below with a spawn of niggers  the only black jerry found on her was johnny while her spaciousness was filled principally with two legged whitegods  he met them everywhere at the wheel on lookout washing decks polishing brasswork running aloft or tailing on to sheets and tackles half a dozen at a time  but there was a difference  there were gods and gods and jerry was not long in learning that in the hierarchy of the heaven of these whitegods on the ariel the sailorizing shipworking ones were far beneath the captain and his two whiteandgoldclad officers  these in turn were less than harley kennan and villa kennan for them it came quickly to him harley kennan commanded  nevertheless there was one thing he did not learn and was destined never to learn namely the supreme god over all on the ariel  although he never tried to know being unable to think to such a distance he never came to know whether it was harley kennan who commanded villa or villa kennan who commanded harley  in a way without vexing himself with the problem he accepted their overlordship of the world as dual  neither outranked the other  they seemed to rule coequal while all others bowed before them  it is not true that to feed a dog is to win a dogs heart  never did harley or villa feed jerry yet it was to them he elected to belong them he elected to love and serve rather than to the japanese steward who regularly fed him  for that matter jerry like any dog was able to differentiate between the mere direct foodgiver and the food source that is subconsciously he was aware that not alone his own food but the food of all on board found its source in the man and woman  they it was who fed all and ruled all  captain winters might give orders to the sailors but captain winters took orders from harley kennan  jerry knew this as indubitably as he acted upon it although all the while it never entered his head as an item of conscious knowledge  and as he had been accustomed all his life as with mister haggin skipper and even with bashti and the chief devil devil doctor of somo he attached himself to the high gods themselves and from the gods under them received deference accordingly  as skipper on the arangi and bashti in somo had promulgated taboos so the man and the woman on the ariel protected jerry with taboos  from sano the japanese steward and from him alone did jerry receive food  not from any sailor in whaleboat or launch could he accept or would he be offered a bit of biscuit or an invitation to go ashore for a run  nor did they offer it nor were they permitted to become intimate to the extent of romping and playing with him nor even of whistling to him along the deck  by nature a oneman dog all this was very acceptable to jerry differences of degree there were of course but no one more delicately and definitely knew those differences than did jerry himself  thus it was permissible for the two officers to greet him with a hello or a good morning and even to touch a hand in a brief and friendly pat to his head  with captain winters however greater familiarity obtained captain winters could rub his ears shake hands with his scratch his back and even roughly catch him by the jowls  but captain winters invariably surrendered him up when the one man and the one woman appeared on deck  when it came to liberties delicious wanton liberties jerry alone of all on board could take them with the man and woman and on the other hand they were the only two to whom he permitted liberties  any indignity that villa kennan chose to inflict upon him he was throbbingly glad to receive such as doubling his ears inside out till they stuck at the same time making him sit upright with helpless forefeet paddling the air for equilibrium while she blew roguishly in his face and nostrils as bad was harley kennans trick of catching him gloriously asleep on an edge of villas skirt and of tickling the hair between his toes and making him kick involuntarily in his sleep until he kicked himself awake to hearing of gurgles and snickers of laughter at his expense  in turn at night on deck wriggling her toes at him under a rug to simulate some strange and crawling creature of an invader he would dare to simulate his own befoolment and quite disrupt villas bed with his frantic ferocious attack on the thing that he knew was only her toes  in gales of laughter intermingled with halfgenuine cries of alarm as almost his teeth caught her toes she always concluded by gathering him into her arms and laughing the last of her laughter away into his flattened ears of joy and love  who else of all on board the ariel would have dared such devilishness with the ladygods bed  this question it never entered his mind to ask himself yet he was fully aware of how exclusively favoured he was  another of his deliberate tricks was one discovered by accident thrusting his muzzle to meet her in love he chanced to encounter her face with his softhard little nose with such force as to make her recoil and cry out  when another time in all innocence this happened again he became conscious of it and of its effect upon her and thereafter when she grew too wildly wild too wantonly facetious in her teasing playful love of him he would thrust his muzzle at her face and make her throw her head back to escape him  after a time learning that if he persisted she would settle the situation by gathering him into her arms and gurgling into his ears he made it a point to act his part until such delectable surrender and joyful culmination were achieved  never by accident in this deliberate game did he hurt her chin or cheek so severely as he hurt his own tender nose but in the hurt itself he found more of delight than pain  all of fun it was all through and in addition it was love fun  such hurt was more than fun  such pain was heartpleasure  all dogs are godworshippers  more fortunate than most dogs jerry won to a pair of gods that no matter how much they commanded loved more although his nose might threaten grievously to hurt the cheek of his adored god rather than have it really hurt he would have spilled out all the lovetide of his heart that constituted the life of him  he did not live for food for shelter for a comfortable place between the darknesses that rounded existence  he lived for love  and as surely as he gladly lived for love would he have died gladly for love  not quickly in somo had jerrys memory of skipper and mister haggin faded  life in the cannibal village had been too unsatisfying  there had been too little love  only love can erase the memory of love or rather the hurt of lost love  and on board the ariel such erasement occurred quickly  jerry did not forget skipper and mister haggin  but at the moments he remembered them the yearning that accompanied the memory grew less pronounced and painful  the intervals between the moments widened nor did skipper and mister haggin take form and reality so frequently in his dreams for after the manner of dogs he dreamed much and vividly     chapter xxii   northward along the leeward coast of malaita the ariel worked her leisurely way threading the colourriotous lagoon that lay between the shorereefs and outerreefs daring passages so narrow and coralpatched that captain winters averred each day added a thousand grey hairs to his head and dropping anchor off every walled inlet of the outer reef and every mangrove swamp of the mainland that looked promising of cannibal life  for harley and villa kennan were in no hurry  so long as the way was interesting they dared not how long it proved from anywhere to anywhere  during this time jerry learned a new name for himselfor rather an entire series of names for himself  this was because of an aversion on harley kennans part against renaming a named thing  a name he must have had he argued to villa  haggin must have named him before he sailed on the arangi  therefore nameless he must be until we get back to tulagi and find out his real name  whats in a name villa had begun to tease  everything her husband retorted  think of yourself shipwrecked called by your rescuers mrs riggs or mademoiselle de maupin or just plain topsy  and think of me being called benedict arnold or  judas or    or    haman  no keep him nameless until we find out his original name  must call him something she objected  cant think of him without thinking something  then call him many names but never the same name twice  call him dog today and mister dog tomorrow and the next day something else  so it was more by tone and emphasis and context of situation than by anything else that jerry came hazily to identify himself with names such as dog mister dog adventurer strong useful one sing song silly noname and quivering loveheart  these were a few of the many names lavished on him by villa  harley in turn addressed him as mandog incorruptible one brass tacks then some sin of gold south sea satrap nimrod young nick and lionslayer  in brief the man and woman competed with each other to name him most without naming him ever the same  and jerry less by sound and syllable than by what of their hearts vibrated in their throats soon learned to know himself by any name they chose to address to him  he no longer thought of himself as jerry but instead as any sound that sounded nice or was lovesounded  his great disappointment if disappointment may be considered to describe an unconsciousness of failure to realize the expected was in the matter of language  no one on board not even harley and villa talked nalasus talk  all jerrys large vocabulary all his proficiency in the use of it which would have set him apart as a marvel beyond all other dogs in the mastery of speech was wasted on those of the ariel they did not speak much less guess the existence of the whiffwhuff shorthand language which nalasu had taught him and which nalasu dead jerry alone knew of all living creatures in the world  in vain jerry tried it on the ladygod  sitting squatted on his haunches his head bowed forward and held between her hands he would talk and talk and elicit never a responsive word from her  with tiny whines and thin whimperings with whiffs and whuffs and growly sorts of noises down in his throat he would try to tell her somewhat of his tale she was all meltingness of sympathy she would hold her ear so near to the articulate mouth of him as almost to drown him in the flowing fragrance of her hair and yet her brain told her nothing of what he uttered although her heart surely sensed his intent  bless me husbandman she would cry out  the dog is talking  i know he is talking  he is telling me all about himself  the story of his life is mine could i but understand  its right here pouring into my miserable inadequate ears only i cant catch it  harley was sceptical but her womans intuition guessed aright  i know it she would assure her husband  i tell you he could tell the tale of all his adventures if only we had understanding  no other dog has ever talked this way to me  theres a tale there  i feel its touches  sometimes almost do i know he is telling of joy of love of high elation and combat  again it is indignation hurt of outrage despair and sadness  naturally harley agreed quietly  a white mans dog adrift among the anthropophagi of malaita would experience all such sensations and just as naturally a white mans woman a wifewoman a dear delightful villa kennan woman can of herself imagine such a dogs experiences and deem his silly noises a recital of them failing to recognize them as projections of her own delicious sensitive sympathetic self  the song of the sea from the lips of the shellpshaw  the song oneself makes of the sea and puts into the shell  just the same  always the same he gallantly cut her off  always right especially when most wrong  not in navigation of course nor in affairs such as the multiplication table where the brass tacks of reality stud the way of ones ship among the rocks and shoals of the sea but right truth beyond truth to truth higher than truth namely intuitional truth  now you are laughing at me with your superior manwisdom she retorted but i know she paused for the strength of words she needed and words forsook her so that her quick sweeping gesture of handtouch to heart named authority that overrode all speech  we agreei salute he laughed gaily  it was just precisely what i was saying  our hearts can talk our heads down almost any time and best all our hearts are always right despite the statistic that they are mostly wrong  harley kennan did not believe and never did believe his wifes report of the tales jerry told  and through all his days to the last one of them he considered the whole matter a pleasant fancy all poesy of sentiment on villas part  but jerry fourlegged smoothcoated irish terrier that he was had the gift of tongues  if he could not teach languages at least he could learn languages  without effort and quickly practically with no teaching he began picking up the language of the ariel  unfortunately it was not a whiffwhuff dogpossible language such as nalasu had invented  while jerry came to understand much that was spoken on the ariel he could speak none of it  three names at least he had for the ladygod villa wifewoman missis kennan for so he heard her variously called  but he could not so call her  this was godlanguage entire which only gods could talk  it was unlike the language of nalasus devising which had been a compromise between godtalk and dog talk so that a god and a dog could talk in the common medium  in the same way he learned many names for the oneman god mister kennan harley captain kennan and skipper  only in the intimacy of the three of them alone did jerry hear him called husbandman my man patient one dear man lover and this womans delight  but in no way could jerry utter these names in address of the oneman nor the many names in address of the onewoman  yet on a quiet night with no wind among the trees often and often had he whispered to nalasu by whiffwhuff of name from a hundred feet away  one day bending over him her hair drying from a saltwater swim flying about him the onewoman her two hands holding his head and jowls so that his ribbon of kissing tongue just missed her nose in the empty air sang to him dont know what to call him but hes mighty lak a rose  on another day she repeated this at the same time singing most of the song to him softly in his ear  in the midst of it jerry surprised her equally true might be the statement that he surprised himself  never had he consciously done such a thing before  and he did it without volition  he never intended to do it  for that matter the very thing he did was what mastered him into doing it  no more than could he refrain from shaking the water from his back after a swim or from kicking in his sleep when his feet were tickled could he have avoided doing this imperative thing  as her voice in the song made soft vibrations in his ears it seemed to him that she grew dim and vague before him and that somehow under the soft searching prod of her song he was otherwhere  so much was he otherwhere that he did the surprising thing  he sat down abruptly almost cataleptically drew his head away from the clutch of her hands and out of the entanglement of her hair and his nose thrust upward at an angle of fortyfive degrees he began to quiver and to breathe audibly in rhythm to the rhythm of her singing  with a quick jerk cataleptically his nose pointed to the zenith his mouth opened and a flood of sound poured forth running swiftly upward in crescendo and slowly falling as it died away  this howl was the beginning and it led to the calling him sing song silly  for villa kennan was quick to seize upon the howling her singing induced and to develop it  never did he hang back when she sat down extended her welcoming hands to him and invited come on sing song silly  he would come to her sit down with the loved fragrance of her hair in his nostrils lay the side of his head against hers point his nose past her ear and almost immediately follow her when she began her low singing  minor strains were especially provocative in getting him started and once started he would sing with her as long as she wished  singing it truly was  apt in all ways of speech he quickly learned to soften and subdue his howl till it was mellow and golden  even could he manage it to die away almost to a whisper and to rise and fall accelerate and retard in obedience to her own voice and in accord with it  jerry enjoyed the singing much in the same way the opium eater enjoys his dreams  for dream he did vaguely and indistinctly eyes wide open and awake the ladygods hair in a faintscented cloud about him her voice mourning with his his consciousness drowning in the dreams of otherwhereness that came to him of the singing and that was the singing memories of pain were his but of pain so long forgotten that it was no longer pain  rather did it permeate him with a delicious sadness and lift him away and out of the ariel lying at anchor in some coral lagoon to that unreal place of otherwhere  for visions were his at such times  in the cold bleakness of night it would seem he sat on a bare hill and raised his howl to the stars while out of the dark from far away would drift to him an answering howl  and other howls near and far would drift along until the night was vocal with his kind  his kind it was  without knowing it he knew it this camaraderie of the land of otherwhere  nalasu in teaching him the whiffwhuff language deliberately had gone into the intelligence of him but villa unwitting of what she was doing went into the heart of him and into the heart of his heredity touching the profoundest chords of ancient memories and making them respond  as instance dim shapes and shadowy forms would sometimes appear to him out of the night and as they flitted spectrally past he would hear as in a dream the hunting cries of the pack and as his pulse quickened his own hunting instinct would rouse until his controlled softhowling in the song broke into eager whinings  his head would lower out of the entanglement of the womans hair his feet would begin making restless spasmodic movements as if running and presto in a flash he would be out and away across the face of time out of reality and into the dream himself running in the midst of those shadowy forms in the hunting fellowship of the pack  and as men have ever desired the dust of the poppy and the juice of the hemp so jerry desired the joys that were his when villa kennan opened her arms to him embraced him with her hair and sang him across time and space into the dream of his ancient kind  not always however were such experiences his when they sang together usually unaccompanied by visions he knew no more than vaguenesses of sensations sadly sweet ghosts of memories that they were  at other times incited by such sadness images of skipper and mister haggin would throng his mind images too of terrence and biddy and michael and the rest of the longvanished life at meringe plantation  my dear harley said to villa at the conclusion of one such singing its fortunate for him that you are not an animal trainer or rather i suppose it would be better called trained animal showwoman for youd be topping the bill in all the musichalls and vaudeville houses of the world  if i did she replied i know hed just love to do it with me  which would make it a very unusual turn harley caught her up  you mean     that in about one turn in a hundred does the animal love its work or is the animal loved by its trainer  i thought all the cruelty had been done away with long ago she contended  so the audience thinks and the audience is ninetynine times wrong  villa heaved a great sigh of renunciation as she said then i suppose i must abandon such promising and lucrative career right now in the very moment you have discovered it for me  just the same the billboards would look splendid with my name in the hugest letters  villa kennan the thrushthroated songstress and sing song silly the irishterrier tenor her husband pictured the headlines for her  and with dancing eyes and lolling tongue jerry joined in the laughter not because he knew what it was about but because it tokened they were happy and his love prompted him to be happy with them  for jerry had found and in the uttermost what his nature cravedthe love of a god  recognizing the duality of their lordship over the ariel he loved the pair of them yet somehow perhaps because she had penetrated deepest into his heart with her magic voice that transported him to the land of otherwhere he loved the ladygod beyond all love he had ever known not even excluding his love for skipper     chapter xxiii   one thing jerry learned early on the ariel namely that niggerchasing was not permitted  eager to please and serve his new gods he took advantage of the first opportunity to worry a canoeload of blacks who came visiting on board  the quick chiding of villa and the command of harley made him pause in amazement  fully believing he had been mistaken he resumed his ragging of the particular black he had picked upon  this time harleys voice was peremptory and jerry came to him his wagging tail and wriggling body all eagerness of apology as was his rosestrip of tongue that kissed the hand of forgiveness with which harley patted him  next villa called him to her  holding him close to her with her hands on his jowls eye to eye and nose to nose she talked to him earnestly about the sin of niggerchasing  she told him that he was no common bush dog but a blooded irish gentleman and that no dog that was a gentleman ever did such things as chase unoffending black men  to all of which he listened with unblinking serious eyes understanding little of what she said yet comprehending all  naughty was a word in the ariel language he had already learned and she used it several times naughty to him meant must not and was by way of expressing a taboo  since it was their way and their will who was he he might well have asked himself to disobey their rule or question it  if niggers were not to be chased then chase them he would not despite the fact that skipper had encouraged him to chase them  not in such set terms did jerry consider the matter but in his own way he accepted the conclusions  love of a god with him implied service  it pleased him to please with service  and the foundationstone of service in his case was obedience  yet it strained him sore for a time to refrain from snarl and snap when the legs of strange and presumptuous blacks passed near him along the ariels white deck  but there were times and times as he was to learn and the time came when villa kennan wanted a bath a real bath in fresh raindescended running water and when johnny the black pilot from tulagi made a mistake  the chart showed a mile of the suli river where it emptied into the sea  why it showed only a mile was because no white man had ever explored it farther  when villa proposed the bath her husband advised with johnny  johnny shook his head  no fella boy stop m along that place he said  no make m trouble along you  bush fella boy stop m long way too much  so it was that the launch went ashore and while its crew lolled in the shade of the beach coconuts villa harley and jerry followed the river inland a quarter of a mile to the first likely pool  one can never be too sure harley said taking his automatic pistol from its holster and placing it on top his heap of clothes  a stray bunch of blacks might just happen to surprise us  villa stepped into the water to her knees looked up at the dark jungle roof high overhead through which only occasional shafts of sunlight penetrated and shuddered  an appropriate setting for a dark deed she smiled then scooped a handful of chill water against her husband who plunged in in pursuit  for a time jerry sat by their clothes and watched the frolic  then the drifting shadow of a huge butterfly attracted his attention and soon he was nosing through the jungle on the trail of a woodrat  it was not a very fresh trail  he knew that well enough but in the deeps of him were all his instincts of ancient traininginstincts to hunt to prowl to pursue living things in short to play the game of getting his own meat though for ages man had got the meat for him and his kind  so it was exercising faculties that were no longer necessary but that were still alive in him and clamorous for exercise he followed the long since passed woodrat with all the softfooted crouching craft of the meatpursuer and with utmost fineness of reading the scent  the trail crossed a fresh trail a trail very fresh very immediately fresh  as if a rope had been attached to it his head was jerked abruptly to right angles with his body  the unmistakable smell of a black was in his nostrils  further it was a strange black for he did not identify it with the many he possessed filed away in the pigeonholes of his brain  forgotten was the stale woodrat as he followed the new trail  curiosity and play impelled him  he had no thought of apprehension for villa and harleynot even when he reached the spot where the black evidently startled by bearing their voices had stood and debated and so left a very strong scent  from this point the trail swerved off toward the pool  nervously alert strung to extreme tension but without alarm still playing at the game of tracking jerry followed  from the pool came occasional cries and laughter and each time they reached his ears jerry experienced glad little thrills  had he been asked and had he been able to express the sensations of emotion in terms of thought he would have said that the sweetest sound in the world was any sound of villa kennans voice and that next sweetest was any sound of harley kennans voice  their voices thrilled him always reminding him of his love for them and that he was beloved of them  with the first sight of the strange black which occurred close to the pool jerrys suspicions were aroused  he was not conducting himself as an ordinary black not on evil intent should conduct himself  instead he betrayed all the actions of one who lurked in the perpetration of harm  he crouched on the jungle floor peering around a great root of a board tree  jerry bristled and himself crouched as he watched  once the black raised his rifle halfway to his shoulder but with an outburst of splashing and laughter his unconscious victims evidently removed themselves from his field of vision  his rifle was no oldfashioned snider but a modern repeating winchester and he showed habituation to firing it from his shoulder rather than from the hip after the manner of most malaitans  not satisfied with his position by the board tree he lowered his gun to his side and crept closer to the pool  jerry crouched low and followed so low did he crouch that his head extended horizontally forward was much lower than his shoulders which were humped up queerly and composed the highest part of him  when the black paused jerry paused as if instantly frozen  when the black moved he moved but more swiftly cutting down the distance between them  and all the while the hair of his neck and shoulders bristled in recurrent waves of ferocity and wrath no golden dog this ears flattened and tongue laughing in the arms of the ladygod no sing song silly chanting ancient memories in the cloudentanglement of her hair but a fourlegged creature of battle a fanged killer ripe to rend and destroy  jerry intended to attack as soon as he had crept sufficiently near  he was unaware of the ariel taboo against niggerchasing  at that moment it had no place in his consciousness  all he knew was that harm threatened the man and woman and that this nigger intended this harm  so much had jerry gained on his quarry that when again the black squatted for his shot jerry deemed he was near enough to rush  the rifle was coming to shoulder when he sprang forward  swiftly as he sprang he made no sound and his victims first warning was when jerrys body launched like a projectile smote the black squarely between the shoulders  at the same moment his teeth entered the back of the neck but too near the base in the lumpy shoulder muscles to permit the fangs to penetrate to the spinal cord  in the first fright of surprise the blacks finger pulled the trigger and his throat loosed an unearthly yell  knocked forward on his face he rolled over and grappled with jerry who slashed cheekbone and cheek and ribboned an ear for it is the way of an irish terrier to bite repeatedly and quickly rather than to hold a bulldog grip  when harley kennan automatic in hand and naked as adam reached the spot he found dog and man locked together and tearing up the forest mould in their struggle  the black his face streaming blood was throttling jerry with both hands around his neck and jerry snorting choking snarling was scratching for dear life with the claws of his hind feet  no puppy claws were they but the stout claws of a mature dog that were stiffened by a backing of hard muscles  and they ripped naked chest and abdomen full length again and again until the whole front of the man was streaming red  harley kennan did not dare chance a shot so closely were the combatants locked  instead stepping in close he smashed down the butt of his automatic upon the side of the mans head released by the relaxing of the stunned blacks hands jerry flung himself in a flash upon the exposed throat and only harleys hand on his neck and harleys sharp command made him cease and stand clear  he trembled with rage and continued to snarl ferociously although he would desist long enough to glance up with his eyes flatten his ears and wag his tail each time harley uttered good boy  good boy he knew for praise and he knew beyond any doubt by harleys repetition of it that he had served him and served him well  do you know the beggar intended to bushwhack us harley told villa who halfdressed and still dressing had joined him  it wasnt fifty feet and he couldnt have missed  look at the winchester  no old smooth bore  and a fellow with a gun like that would know how to use it  but why didnt he she queried  her husband pointed to jerry  villas eyes brightened with quick comprehension  you mean     she began  he nodded  just that  sing song silly beat him to it  he bent rolled the man over and discovered the lacerated back of the neck thats where he landed on him first and he must have had his finger on the trigger drawing down on you and me most likely me first when sing song silly broke up his calculations  villa was only half hearing for she had jerry in her arms and was calling him blessed dog the while she stilled his snarling and soothed down the last bristling hair  but jerry snarled again and was for leaping upon the black when he stirred restlessly and dizzily sat up  harley removed a knife from between the bare skin and a belt  what name belong you he demanded  but the black had eyes only for jerry staring at him in wondering amaze until he pieced the situation together in his growing clarity of brain and realized that such a small chunky animal had spoiled his game  my word he grinned to harley that fella dog put m crimp along me any amount  he felt out the wounds of his neck and face while his eyes embraced the fact that the white master was in possession of his rifle  you give m musket belong me he said impudently  i give m you bang alongside head was harleys answer  he doesnt seem to me to be a regular malaitan he told villa  in the first place where would he get a rifle like that  then think of his nerve  he must have seen us drop anchor and he must have known our launch was on the beach  yet he played to take our heads and get away with them back into the bush  what name belong you he again demanded  but not until johnny and the launch crew arrived breathless from their run did he learn  johnnys eyes gloated when he beheld the prisoner and he addressed kennan in evident excitement  you give m me that fella boy he begged  eh  you give m me that fella boy  what name you want m  not for some time would johnny answer this question and then only when kennan told him that there was no harm done and that he intended to let the black go  at this johnny protested vehemently  maybe you fetch m that fella boy along government house tulagi government house give m you twenty pounds  him plenty bad fella boy too much  makawao he name stop along him  bad fella boy too much  him queensland boy  what name queensland kennan interrupted  he belong that fella place  johnny shook his head  him belong along malaita first time  long time before too much he recruit m along schooner go work along queensland  hes a return queenslander harley interpreted to villa  you know when australia went all white the queensland plantations had to send all the black birds back  this makawao is evidently one of them and a hard case as well if theres anything in johnnys gammon about twenty pounds reward for him  thats a big price for a black  johnny continued his explanation which reduced to flat and sober english was to the effect that makawao had always borne a bad character in queensland he had served a total of four years in jail for thefts robberies and attempted murder  returned to the solomons by the australian government he had recruited on buli plantation for the purposeas was afterwards provedof getting arms and ammunition  for an attempt to kill the manager he had received fifty lashes at tulagi and served a year  returned to buli plantation to finish his labour service he had contrived to kill the owner in the managers absence and to escape in a whaleboat  in the whaleboat with him he had taken all the weapons and ammunition of the plantation the owners head ten malaita recruits and two recruits from san cristobalthe two last because they were saltwater men and could handle the whaleboat  himself and the ten malaitans being bushmen were too ignorant of the sea to dare the long passage from guadalcanar  on the way he had raided the little islet of ugi sacked the store and taken the head of the solitary trader a gentlesouled halfcaste from norfolk island who traced back directly to a pitcairn ancestry straight from the loins of mccoy of the bounty  arrived safely at malaita he and his fellows no longer having any use for the two san cristobal boys had taken their heads and eaten their bodies  my word him bad fella boy any amount johnny finished his tale government house tulagi damn glad give m twenty pounds along that fella  you blessed sing song silly villa murmured in jerrys ears  if it hadnt been for you  your head and mine would even now be galumping through the bush as makawao hit the high places for home harley concluded for her  my word some fella dog that any amount he added lightly  and i gave him merry ned just the other day for niggerchasing and he knew his business better than i did all the time  if anybody tries to claim him villa threatened  harley confirmed her muttered sentiment with a nod  any way he said with a smile there would have been one consolation if your head had gone up into the bush  consolation she cried throaty with indignation  why yes because in that case my head would have gone along  you dear and blessed husbandman she murmured a quick cloudiness of moisture in her eyes as with her eyes she embraced him her arms still around jerry who sensing the ecstasy of the moment kissed her fragrant cheek with his ribbontongue of love     chapter xxiv   when the ariel cleared from malu on the northwest coast of malaita malaita sank down beneath the searim astern and so far as jerrys life was concerned remained sunk for everanother vanished world that in his consciousness partook of the ultimate nothingness that had befallen skipper  for all jerry might have known though he pondered it not malaita was a universe beheaded and resting on the knees of some brooding lesser god himself vastly mightier than bashti whose knees bore the brooding weight of skippers sundried smokecured head this lesser god vexed and questing feeling and guessing at the dual twinmysteries of time and space and of motion and matter above beneath around and beyond him  only in jerrys case there was no pondering of the problem no awareness of the existence of such mysteries  he merely accepted malaita as another world that had ceased to be  he remembered it as he remembered dreams  himself a live thing solid and substantial possessed of weight and dimension a reality incontrovertible he moved through the space and place of being concrete hard quick convincing an absoluteness of something surrounded by the shades and shadows of the fluxing phantasmagoria of nothing  he took his worlds one by one  one by one his worlds evaporated rose beyond his vision as vapours in the hot alembic of the sun sank for ever beneath sealevels themselves unreal and passing as the phantoms of a dream  the totality of the minute simple world of the humans microscopic and negligible as it was in the siderial universe was as far beyond his guessing as is the siderial universe beyond the starriest guesses and most abysmal imaginings of man  jerry was never to see the dark island of savagery again although often in his sleeping dreams it was to return to him in vivid illusion as he relived his days upon it from the destruction of the arangi and the maneating orgy on the beach to his flight from the shellscattered house and flesh of nalasu  these dream episodes constituted for him another land of otherwhere mysterious unreal and evanescent as clouds drifting across the sky or bubbles taking iridescent form and bursting on the surface of the sea  froth and foam it was quickvanishing as he awoke nonexistent as skipper skippers head on the withered knees of bashti in the lofty grass house  malaita the real malaita the concrete and ponderable vanished and vanished for ever as meringe had vanished as skipper had vanished into the nothingness  from malaita the ariel steered west of north to ongtong java and to tasmangreat atolls that sweltered under the line not quite awash in the vast waste of the west south pacific  after tasman was another wide sea stretch to the high island of bougainville  thence bearing generally southeast and making slow progress in the dead beat to windward the ariel dropped anchor in nearly every harbour of the solomons from choiseul and ronongo islands to the islands of kulambangra vangunu pavuvu and new georgia  even did she ride to anchor desolately lonely in the bay of a thousand ships  last of all so far as concerned the solomons her anchor rumbled down and bit into the coralsanded bottom of the harbour of tulagi where ashore on florida island lived and ruled the resident commissioner  to the commissioner harley kennan duly turned over makawao who was committed to a grasshouse jail well guarded to sit in legirons against the time of trial for his many crimes  and johnny the pilot ere he returned to the service of the commissioner received a fair portion of the twenty pounds of head money that kennan divided among the members of the launch crew who had raced through the jungle to the rescue the day jerry had taken makawao by the back of the neck and startled him into pulling the trigger of his unaimed rifle  ill tell you his name the commissioner said as they sat on the wide veranda of his bungalow  its one of haggins terriershaggin of meringe lagoon  the dogs father is terrence the mother is biddy  the dogs own name is jerry for i was present at the christening before ever his eyes were open  better yet ill show you his brother  his brothers name is michael  hes niggerchaser on the eugenie the two topmast schooner that rides abreast of you  captain kellar is the skipper  ill have him bring michael ashore  beyond all doubt this jerry is the sole survivor of the arangi  when i get the time and a sufficient margin of funds i shall pay a visit to chief bashtioh no british cruiser program  ill charter a couple of trading ketches take my own black police force and as many white men as i cannot prevent from volunteering  there wont be any shelling of grass houses  ill land my shore party down the coast and cut in and come down upon somo from the rear timing my vessels to arrive on somos seafront at the same time  you will answer slaughter with slaughter villa kennan objected  i will answer slaughter with law the commissioner replied  i will teach somo law  i hope that no accidents will occur  i hope that no life will be lost on either side  i know however that i shall recover captain van horns head and his mate borckmans and bring them back to tulagi for christian burial  i know that i shall get old bashti by the scruff of the neck and sit him down while i pump law and squaredealing into him  of course      the commissioner asceticlooking an oxford graduate narrowshouldered and elderly tiredeyed and bespectacled like the scholar he was like the scientist he was shrugged his shoulders  of course if they are not amenable to reason there may be trouble and some of them and some of us will get hurt  but one way or the other the conclusion will be the same  old bashti will learn that it is expedient to maintain white mens heads on their shoulders  but how will he learn villa kennan asked  if he is shrewd enough not to fight you and merely sits and listens to your english law it will be no more than a huge joke to him  he will no more than pay the price of listening to a lecture for any atrocity he commits  on the contrary my dear mrs kennan  if he listens peaceably to the lecture i shall fine him only a hundred thousand coconuts five tons of ivory nut one hundred fathoms of shell money and twenty fat pigs  if he refuses to listen to the lecture and goes on the war path then unpleasantly for me i assure you i shall be compelled to thrash him and his village first and next i shall triple the fine he must pay and lecture the law into him a trifle more compendiously  suppose he doesnt fight stops his ears to the lecture and declines to pay villa kennan persisted  then he shall be my guest here in tulagi until he changes his mind and heart and does pay and listens to an entire course of lectures        so it was that jerry came to hear his oldtime name on the lips of villa and harley and saw once again his fullbrother michael  say nothing harley muttered to villa as they made out peering over the bow of the shorecoming whaleboat the rough coat redwheaten in colour of michael  we wont know anything about anything and we wont even let on were watching what they do  jerry feigning interest in digging a hole in the sand as if he were on a fresh scent was unaware of michaels nearness  in fact so well had jerry feigned that he had forgotten it was all a game and his interest was very real as he sniffed and snorted joyously in the bottom of the hole he had dug  so deep was it that all he showed of himself was his hindlegs his rump and an intelligent and stiffly erect stump of a tail  little wonder that he and michael failed to see each other  and michael spilling over with unused vitality from the cramped space of the eugenies deck scampered down the beach in a hurlyburly of joy scenting a thousand intimate landscents as he ran and describing a jerky and eccentric course as he made short dashes and goodnatured snaps at the coconut crabs that scuttled across his path to the safety of the water or reared up and menaced him with formidable claws and a spluttering and foaming of the shelllids of their mouths  the beach was only so long  the end of it reached where rose the rugged wall of a headland and while the commissioner introduced captain kellar to mr and mrs kennan michael came tearing back across the wethard sand  so interested was he in everything that he failed to notice the small rearend portion of jerry that was visible above the level surface of the beach  jerrys ears had given him warning and the precise instant that he backed hurriedly up and out of the hole michael collided with him  as jerry was rolled and as michael fell clear over him both erupted into ferocious snarls and growls  they regained their legs bristled and showed teeth at each other and stalked stiffleggedly in a stately and dignified sort of way as they drew intimidating semicircles about each other  but they were fooling all the while and were more than a trifle embarrassed  for in each of their brains were bright identification pictures of the plantation house and compound and beach of meringe  they knew but they were reticent of recognition  no longer puppies vaguely proud of the sedateness of maturity they strove to be proud and sedate while all their impulse was to rush together in a frantic ecstasy  michael it was less travelled in the world than jerry by nature not so selfcontrolled who threw the playacting of dignity to the wind and with shrill whinings of emotion with bodywrigglings of delight flashed out his tongue of love and shouldered his brother roughly in eagerness to get near to him  jerry responded as eagerly with kiss of tongue and contact of shoulder then both springing apart looked at each other alert and querying almost in half challenge jerrys ears pricked into living interrogations michaels one good ear similarly questioning his withered ear retaining its permanent queer and crinkly cock in the tip of it  as one they sprang away in a wild scurry down the beach side by side laughing to each other and occasionally striking their shoulders together as they ran  no doubt of it said the commissioner  the very way their father and mother run  i have watched them often        but after ten days of comradeship came the parting  it was michaels first visit on the ariel and he and jerry had spent a frolicking half hour on her white deck amid the sound and commotion of hoisting in boats making sail and heaving out anchor  as the ariel began to move through the water and heeled to the filling of her canvas by the brisk tradewind the commissioner and captain kellar shook last farewells and scrambled down the gangplank to their waiting whaleboats  at the last moment captain kellar had caught michael up tucked him under an arm and with him dropped into the sternsheets of his whaleboat  painters were cast off and in the sternsheets of each boat solitary white men were standing up heads bared in graciousness of conduct to the furnacestab of the tropic sun as they waved additional and final farewells  and michael swept by the contagion of excitement barked and barked again as if it were a festival of the gods being celebrated  say goodbye to your brother jerry villa kennan prompted in jerrys ear as she held him his quivering flanks between her two palms on the rail where she had lifted him  and jerry not understanding her speech torn about with conflicting desires acknowledged her speech with wriggling body a quick backtoss of head and a red flash of kissing tongue and the next moment his head over the rail and lowered to see the swiftly diminishing michael was mouthing grief and woe very much akin to the grief and woe his mother biddy had mouthed in the long ago on the beach of meringe when he had sailed away with skipper  for jerry had learned partings and beyond all peradventure this was a parting though little he dreamed that he would again meet michael across the years and across the world in a fabled valley of far california where they would live out their days in the hearts and arms of the beloved gods  michael his forefeet on the gunwale barked to him in a puzzled questioning sort of way and jerry whimpered back incommunicable understanding  the ladygod pressed his two flanks together reassuringly and he turned to her his cool nose touched questioningly to her cheek  she gathered his body close against her breast in one encircling arm her free hand resting on the rail halfclosed a pink andwhite heart of flower fragrant and seducing  jerrys nose quested the way of it  the aperture invited  with snuggling budging and nudgingmovements he spread the fingers slightly wider as his nose penetrated into the sheer delight and loveliness of her hand  he came to rest his golden muzzle softenfolded to the eyes and was very still all forgetful of the ariel showing her copper to the sun under the press of the wind all forgetful of michael growing small in the distance as the whaleboat grew small astern  no less still was villa  both were playing the game although to her it was new  as long as he could possibly contain himself jerry maintained his stiffness  and then his love bursting beyond the control of him he gave a sniffas prodigious a one as he had sniffed into the tunnel of skippers hand in the long ago on the deck of the arangi  and as skipper had relaxed into the laughter of love so did the ladygod now she gurgled gleefully  her fingers tightened in a caress that almost hurt on jerrys muzzle  her other hand and arm crushed him against her till he gasped  yet all the while his stump of tail valiantly bobbed back and forth and when released from such blissful contact his silky ears flattened back and down as with first a scarlet slash of tongue to cheek he seized her hand between his teeth and dented the soft skin with a love bite that did not hurt  and so for jerry vanished tulagi its commissioners bungalow on top of the hill its vessels riding to anchor in the harbour and michael his full bloodbrother  he had grown accustomed to such vanishments  in such way had vanished as in the mirage of a dream meringe somo and the arangi  in such way had vanished all the worlds and harbours and roadsteads and atoll lagoons where the ariel had lifted her laid anchor and gone on across and over the erasing searim
