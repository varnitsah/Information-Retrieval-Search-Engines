39039320	marco pauls voyages  travels vermont  by  jacob abbott  1852        preface   the design of the series of volumes entitled marco pauls adventures in the pursuit of knowledge is not merely to entertain the reader with a narrative of juvenile adventures but also to communicate in connection with them as extensive and varied information as possible in respect to the geography the scenery the customs and the institutions of this country as they present themselves to the observation of the little traveler who makes his excursions under the guidance of an intelligent and wellinformed companion qualified to assist him in the acquisition of knowledge and in the formation of character the author has endeavored to enliven his narrative and to infuse into it elements of a salutary moral influence by means of personal incidents befalling the actors in the story these incidents are of course imaginarybut the reader may rely upon the strict and exact truth and fidelity of all the descriptions of places institutions and scenes which are brought before his mind in the progress of the narrative thus though the author hopes that the readers who may honor these volumes with their perusal will be amused and interested by them his design throughout will be to instruct rather than to entertain     contents     i  journeying   ii  accidents  iii  the grass country   iv  the

york   marco his son a boy about twelve years old   john forester marcos cousin about nineteen years old  marco is traveling and studying under foresters care     marco paul in vermont     chapter i  journeying    when mr baron marcos father put marco under his cousin foresters care it was his intention that he should spend a considerable part of his time in traveling and in outofdoor exercises such as might tend to reestablish his health and strengthen his constitution he did not however intend to have him give up the study of books altogether accordingly at one time for nearly three months marco remained at foresters home among the green mountains of vermont where he studied several hours every day  it was in the early part of the autumn that he and forester went to vermont they traveled in the stagecoach vermont lies upon one side of the connecticut river and new hampshire upon the other side the green mountains extend up and down through the middle of vermont from north to south and beyond these mountains on the western side of the state is lake champlain which extends from north to south also and forms the western boundary thus the green mountains divide the state into two great portions one descending to the eastward toward connecticut river and the other to the westward toward lake champlain there are therefore two great ways of access to vermont from the states south of it one up the connecticut river on the eastern side and the other along the shores of lake george and lake champlain on the western side there are roads across the green mountains also leading from the eastern portion of the state to the western all this can be seen by looking upon any map of vermont  marco and forester went up by the connecticut river the road lay along upon the bank of the river and the scenery was very pleasant they traveled in the stagecoach for there were very few railroads in those days  the country was cultivated and fertile and the prospect from the windows of the coach was very fine sometimes wide meadows and intervales extended along the riverand at other places high hills covered with trees advanced close to the stream they could see too the farms and villages and green hills across the river on the new hampshire side  on the second day of their journey they turned off from the river by a road which led into the interior of the country for the village where foresters father resided was back among the mountains they had new companions in the coach too on this second day as well as a new route for the company which had been in the coach the day before were to separate in the morning to go off in different directions several stagecoaches drove up to the door of the tavern in the morning just after breakfast with the names of the places where they were going to upon their sides one was marked haverhill and lancaster another middlebury and a third concord and boston and there was one oddlooking vehicle a sort of carryall open in front and drawn by two horses which had no name upon it and so marco could not tell where it was going as these several coaches and carriages drove up to the door the hostlers and drivers put on the baggage and bound it down with great straps and then handed in the passengersand thus the coaches one after another drove away the whole movement formed a very busy scene and marco standing upon the piazza in front of the tavern enjoyed it very much  there was a very large elmtree before the door with steps to climb up and seats among the branches marco went up there and sat some time looking down upon the coaches as they wheeled round the tree in coming up to the door then he went down to the piazza again  illustration the great elm  there was a neatlydressed young woman with a little flowerpot in her hand standing near him waiting for her turn there was a small orangetree in her flowerpot it was about six inches high the sight of this orangetree interested marco very much for it reminded him of home he had often seen orangetrees growing in the parlors and greenhouses in new york  what a pretty little orangetree said marco where did you get it  how did you know it was an orangetree said the girl  o i know an orangetree well enough replied marco i have seen them many a time  where asked the girl  in new york said marco did your orangetree come from new york  no said the girl i planted an orangeseed and it grew from that ive got a lemontree too she added but it is a great deal larger the lemontree grows faster than the orange my lemontree is so large that i couldnt bring it home very well so i left it in the mill  in the mill said marco are you a miller  the girl laughed she was a very goodhumored girl and did not appear to be displeased though it certainly was not quite proper for marco to speak in that manner to a stranger she did not however reply to his question but said after a pause  do you know where the montpelier stage is  the proper english meaning of the word stage is a portion of the road traveled between one restingplace and another but in the united states it is used to mean the carriagebeing a sort of contraction for stagecoach  no said marco we are going in that stage  i wish it would come along said the girl for im tired of watching my trunk  where is your trunk said marco  so the girl pointed out her trunk it was upon the platform of the piazza near those belonging to forester and marco the girl showed marco her name which was mary williams written on a card upon the end of it  ill watch your trunk said marco and you can go in and sit down until the stage comes  mary thanked him and went in she was not however quite sure that her baggage was safe intrusted thus to the charge of a strange boy and so she took a seat near the window where she could keep an eye upon it there was a blue chest near these trunks which looked like a sailors chest and marco being tired of standing sat down upon this chest he had however scarcely taken his seat when he saw a coach with four horses coming round a corner it was driven by a small boy not larger than marco it wheeled up toward the door and came to a stand some men then put on the sailors chest and the trunks mary williams came out and got into the coach she sat on the back seat forester and marco got in and took their places on the middle seat a young man dressed like a sailor took the front seat at one corner of the coach these were all the passengers that were to get in here when every thing was ready they drove away  the stage stopped however in a few minutes at the door of a handsome house in the town and took a gentleman and lady in these new passengers took places on the back seat with mary williams  this company rode in perfect silence for some time forester took out a book and began to read the gentleman on the back seat went to sleep mary williams and marco looked out at the windows watching the changing scenery the sailor rode in silence moving his lips now and then as if he were talking to himself but taking no notice of any of the company the coach stopped at the villages which they passed through to exchange the mail and sometimes to take in new passengers in the course of these changes marco got his place shifted to the forward seat by the side of the sailor and he gradually got into conversation with him marco introduced the conversation by asking the sailor if he knew how far it was to montpelier  no said the sailor i dont keep any reckoning but i wish we were there  why asked marco  o i expect the old cart will capsize somewhere among these mountains and break our necks for us  marco had observed all the morning that when the coach canted to one side or the other on account of the unevenness of the road the sailor always started and looked anxious as if afraid it was going to be upset he wondered that a man who had been apparently accustomed to the terrible dangers of the seas should be alarmed at the gentle oscillations of a stagecoach  are you afraid that we shall upset asked marco  yes said the sailor over some of these precipices and mountains and then therell be an end of us  the sailor said this in an easy and careless manner as if after all he was not much concerned about the danger still marco was surprised that he should fear it at all he was not aware how much the fears which people feel are occasioned by the mere novelty of the danger which they incur a stagedriver who is calm and composed on his box in a dark night and upon dangerous roads will be alarmed by the careening of a ship under a gentle breeze at seawhile the sailor who laughs at a gale of wind on the ocean is afraid to ride in a carriage on land  ant you a sailor asked marco  yes replied his companion  i shouldnt think that a man that had been used to the sea would be afraid of upsetting in a coach  im not a man said the sailor  what are you said marco  im a boy im only nineteen years old though im going to be rated seaman next voyage  have you just got back from a voyage asked marco  yes said the sailor ive been round the horn in a whaler from old nantuck and now im going home to see my mother  how long since youve seen her asked marco  o its four years since i ran away  here the sailor began to speak in rather a lower tone than he had done before so that marco only could hear this was not difficult as the other passengers were at this time engaged in conversation  i ran away continued the sailor and went to sea about four years ago  what made you run away asked marco  o i didnt want to stay at home and be abused my father used to abuse me but my mother took my part and now i want to go and see her  and to see your father too said marco  no said the sailor i dont care for him i hope hes gone off somewhere but i want to see my mother i have got a shawl for her in my chest  marco was shocked to hear a young man speak in such a manner of his father still there was something in the frankness and openness of the sailors manner which pleased him very much he liked to hear his odd and sailorlike language too and he accordingly entered into a long conversation with him the sailor gave him an account of his adventures on the voyage how he was drawn off from the ship one day several miles by a whale which they had harpoonedhow they caught a shark and hauled him in on deck by means of a pulley at the end of the yardarmand how on the voyage home the ship was driven before an awful gale of wind for five days under bare poles with terrific seas roaring after them all the way these descriptions took a strong hold of marcos imagination his eye brightened up and he became restless on his seat and thought that he would give the world for a chance to stand up in the bow of a boat and put a harpoon into the neck of a whale  in the mean time the day wore away and the road led into a more and more mountainous country the hills were longer and steeper and the tracts of forest more frequent and solitary the number of passengers increased too until the coach was pretty heavily loaded and sometimes all but the female passengers would get out and walk up the hills on these occasions forester and marco would generally walk together talking about the incidents of their journey or the occupations and amusements which they expected to engage in when they arrived at foresters home about the middle of the afternoon the coach stopped at the foot of a long winding ascent steep and stony and several of the passengers got out forester however remained in as he was tired of walking and so marco and the sailor walked together the sailor finding how much marco was interested in his stories liked his company and at length he asked marco where he was going marco told him  ah if you were only going on a voyage with me said the sailor that would make a man of you i wouldnt go and be shut up with that old prig poring over books forever  marco was displeased to hear the sailor call his cousin an old prig and he felt some compunctions of conscience about forming and continuing an intimacy with such a person still he was so much interested in hearing him talk that he continued to walk with him up the hill finally the sailor fairly proposed to him to run away and go to sea with him  o no said marco i wouldnt do such a thing for the world besides said he they would be after us and carry me back  no said the sailor we would cut across the country traveling in the night and laying to by day till we got to another stage route and then make a straight wake till we got to new bedford and there we could get a good voyage come said he lets go tonight ill turn right about i dont care a great deal about seeing my mother  though marco was a very bold and adventurous sort of a boy still he was not quite prepared for such a proposal as this in the course of the conversation the sailor used improper and violent language too which marco did not like to hear and in fact marco began to be a little afraid of his new acquaintance he determined as soon as he got back to the coach to keep near forester all the time so as not to be left alone again with the sailor he tried to hasten on so as to overtake the coach but the sailor told him not to walk so fast and being unwilling to offend him he was obliged to go slowly and keep with him and thus protracted the conversation  illustration the hill  about halfway up the hill there was a small tavern and the sailor wanted marco to go in with him and get a drink marco thought that he meant a drink of water but it was really a drink of spirits which was intended marco however refused to go saying that he was not thirsty and so they went on up the hill at the top of the hill the stagecoach stopped for the pedestrians to come up there was also another passenger there to get ina woman who came out from a farmhouse near by the driver asked the sailor if he was not willing to ride outside in order to make room for the new passenger but he would not he was afraid he said he would not ride five miles outside for a months wages marco laughed at the sailors fears and he immediately asked forester to let him ride outside forester hesitated but on looking up and seeing that there was a secure seat with a good place to hold on he consented so marco clambered up and took his seat with the driver while the other passengers reestablished themselves in the stage     chapter ii  accidents    marco liked his seat upon the outside of the stagecoach very much he could see the whole country about him to great advantage he was very much interested in the scenery not having been accustomed to travel among forests and mountains the driver was a rough young manfor the boy who drove the coach up to the door was not the regular driver he was not disposed to talk much and his tone and manner in what he did say did not indicate a very gentle disposition marco however at last got a little acquainted with him and finally proposed to the driver to let him drive  nonsense said he in reply you are not big enough to drive such a team as this  why there was a boy no bigger than i that drove the horses up to the door when we started this morning replied marco  o yesjerrysaid the driverbut hell break his neck one of these days  i didnt see but that he drove very well said marco  the driver was silent  come persisted marco let me drive a little way and ill do as much for you some day  you little fool said the driver you never can do any thing for me you are not big enough to be of any use at all  marco thought of the fable of the mouse and the lion but since his new companion was in such illhumor he thought he would say no more to him a resentful reply to the epithet little fool did in fact rise to his lips but he suppressed it and said nothing  it was fortunate for marco that he did so for whenever any person has said any thing harsh unjust or cruel the most effectual reply is generally silence it leaves the offender to think of what he has said and conscience will often reprove him in silence far more effectually than words could do it this was the case in this instance as they rode along in silence the echo of the words little fool and the tone in which he had uttered them lingered upon the drivers ear he could not help thinking that he had been rather harsh with his little passenger presently he said  i dont care thoughwe are coming to a level piece of ground on ahead here a little way and then ill see what you can make of teaming  marco was quite pleased at this unexpected result and after ten or fifteen minutes they came to the level piece of road and the driver put the reins into marcos hand marco had sometimes driven two horses when riding out with his father in a barouche up the bloomingdale road in new york he was therefore not entirely unaccustomed to the handling of reins and he took them from the drivers hand and imitated the manner of holding them which he had observed the driver himself to adopt quite dexterously  the horses in fact needed very little guidance they went along the road very quietly of their own accord marco kept wishing that a wagon or something else would come along that he might have the satisfaction of turning out but nothing of the kind appeared and he was obliged to content himself with turning a little to one side to avoid a stone at the end of the level piece of road there was a tavern where they were going to stop to change the horses and marco asked the driver to let him turn the horses up to the door the driver consented keeping a close watch all the time ready to seize the reins again at a moments notice if there had been any appearance of difficulty but there was none marco guided the horses right and drawing in the reins with all his strength he brought them up properly at the door or rather he seemed to do itfor in reality the horses probably acted as much of their own accord being accustomed to stop at this place as from any control which marco exercised over them through the reins  there was however an advantage in this evolution for marco became accustomed to the feeling of the reins in his hand and acquired a sort of confidence in his power over the horsesgreater to be sure than there was any just ground for but which was turned to a very important account a few hours afterward as will be seen in the sequel  the sailor went several times into the taverns on the way in the course of the afternoon to drink until at length he became partially intoxicated he felt however so much restrained in the presence of the passengers within the coach that he did not become talkative and noisy as is frequently the case in such circumstances but was rather stupid and sleepy in fact no one observed that any change was taking place in his condition until at last as he was coming out from the door of a tavern where he had been in to get another drink the driver said  come jack you must get up with me now there is another passenger to get in here  marco who was still in his seat holding the reins of the horses looked down expecting that the sailor would make objections to this proposalbut he found on the contrary that jack as they called him acquiesced without making any difficulty and allowed the driver to help him up the new passenger got inside forester felt somewhat uneasy at having marco ride any longer on the top especially now that the sailor was going up too but the coach was full he himself was wedged into his seat so that he could not get out easily he knew too that two or three of the passengers were going to get out at the next stage and so he concluded to let marco remain outside until that time and then to take him in again  marcos admiration for the sailor was very much diminished when he saw how helpless he had rendered himself by his excesses and how unceremoniously the driver pulled and hauled him about in getting him into his seat  there hold on there said the driver to him in a stern voicehold on well or youll be down head foremost under the horses heels at the first pitch we come to  the poor sailor said nothing but grasped an iron bar which passed from the top of the coach down by the side of the seat and held on as well as he could  they rode on in this manner for some miles the head of the sailor swinging back and forth helplessly as if he was nearly asleep whenever marco or the driver spoke to him he either answered in a thick and sleepy tone of voice or he did not reply at all marco watched him for a time being continually afraid that he would fall off he could do nothing however to help him for he himself was sitting at one end of the seat while the sailor was upon the other the driver being between them in the mean time the sun gradually went down and the twilight came on and as the shadows extended themselves slowly over the landscape marco began to find riding outside less pleasant than it had been before and he thought that on the whole he should be very glad when the time arrived for him to get into the coach again with his cousin  at length they came to a bridge covered with planks which led across a small stream it was in rather a solitary place with woods on each side of the road beyond the bridge there was a level piece of road for a short distance and then a gentle ascent with a farmhouse near the top of it on the right hand side of the road at the end of the bridge between the planks and the ground beyond them there was a jolt caused by the rotting away of a log which had been imbedded in the ground at the beginning of the planking as it was rather dark on account of the shade of the trees the driver did not observe this jolt and he was just beginning to put his horses to the trot as they were leaving the bridge when the forward wheels struck down heavily into the hollow giving the front of the coach a sudden pitch forward and downward marco grasped the iron bar at his end of the seat and saved himself and the driver who was habitually on his guard had his feet so braced against the fender before him that he would not have fallen but the poor sailor entirely unprepared for the shock and perhaps unable to resist it if he had been prepared pitched forward lost his hold went over the fender and was tumbling down as the driver had predicted head foremost under the horses heels the driver seized hold of him with one hand but finding this insufficient dropped his reins and tried to grasp him with both in doing it however he lost his own balance and went over too he of course let go of the sailor when he found that he was going himself the sailor fell heavily and helplessly between the pole and the side of one of the horses to the ground the driver followed he seized the pole with one hand but was too late to save himself entirely and thinking there was danger of being dragged and finding that the horses were springing forward in a fright he let himself drop through to the ground also the coach passed over them in a moment as the horses cantered on  all this passed in an instant and marco before he had a moments time for reflection found himself alone on his seatthe driver run over and perhaps killed and the horses cantering away with the reins dangling about their heels the first impulse in such a case would be to scream aloud in terrorwhich would have only made the horses run the faster but marco was not very easily frightened at least he was not easily made crazy by fright so he did not scream and not knowing what else to do he sat still and did nothing  illustration the accident  in the mean time the passengers inside knew nothing of all this many of them had been asleep when they came over the bridge the jolt had aroused them a little but there was nothing to indicate to them the accident which had occurred forward so they quietly adjusted themselves in their seats and endeavored to compose themselves to sleep again  the horses were well trained and gentle they cantered on as far as the level ground extended and then they slackened their pace as they began to rise the ascent the idea then occurred to marco that perhaps he might clamber down over the fender to the pole and then walk along upon that a little way till he could gather up the reins then he thought that if he could get back again with them to the drivers seat perhaps he could stop the horses marco was an expert climber he had learned this art in his gymnasium at new york so that he had no fears in respect to his being able to get down and back again the only danger was lest he might frighten the horses again and set them to running anew  after a moments reflection he concluded that at any rate he would try it so he cautiously stepped over the fender and clambered down when his feet reached the pole he rested them a moment upon it and clung with his hands to the fender and other parts of the front of the coach he found his position here more unstable than he had expected for the coach being upon springs the forward part rose and fell with many jerks and surges as the horses traveled swiftly along while the pole was held in its position straight and firm thus the different parts of his body were connected with different systems of motion which made his position very uncomfortable  he found however after a moments pause that he could stand and probably walk upon the pole so he advanced cautiously putting his hands on the backs of the horses and walking along on the pole between them the horses were somewhat disturbed by the strange sensations which they experienced and began to canter again but marco who felt more and more confidence every moment pushed boldly on gathered up the reins and got all the ends together then taking the ends of the reins in one hand he crept back supporting himself by taking hold of the harness of one of the horses with the other hand by this means he regained the coach and then though with some difficulty he clambered up to his seat again  he then endeavored to stop the horses by gathering the reins together and pulling upon them with all his strength but it was in vain the horses had by this time reached a part of the road where it was more level and they began to press forward at a more rapid pace marco thought of calling to forester to get out of the window and climb along the side of the coach to the box in order to help him but just at that moment he saw that they were coming up opposite to the farm house which had been in sight at a distance when they were crossing the bridge so he thought that though he could not stop the horses he might perhaps have strength enough to turn them off from the road into the farmers yard and that then they could be more easily stopped in this he succeeded by pulling the off rein of the leaders with all his strength he was able to turn them out of the road the pole horses followed as a matter of coursethe coach came up with a graceful sweep to the farmers door and then the horses were easily stopped the farmer came at once to the door to see what strange company had come to visit him in the stagehis wife following while several children crowded to the windows  whats here said a voice from the window of the coacha postoffice they thought the stage had been driven up to the door of some postoffice  marco did not answer in fact he was bewildered and confounded at the strangeness of his situation he looked back over the top of the coach down the road to see what had become of the driver to his great joy he saw him running up behind the coachhis hat crushed out of shape and his clothes dusty the passengers looked out at the windows of the stage exclaiming  why driver whats the matter  the driver made no reply he began to brush his clothesand taking off his hat he attempted to round it out into shape again  what is the matter driver said the passengers  nothing replied he only that drunkard of a sailor tumbled off the stage  where when exclaimed half a dozen voices is he killed  killed no replied the driver i dont believe he is even sobered  forester and another gentleman then urgently asked where he was and the driver told them that he was back there a piece as he expressed it  what lying in the road said forester open the door and let us go and see to him  no said the driver he has got off to the side of the road safe i dont believe hes hurt any let him take care of himself and well drive on  but forester remonstrated strongly against leaving the poor sailor in such a condition and in such a place and finally it was agreed that the farmer should go down the road and see to him so as to allow the stagecoach with the passengers to go on  forester was not willing however to have marco ride outside any longer and so they contrived to make room for him within as marco descended from his high seat the driver said to him as he passed him in a low voice  how did you get the reins i thought they all came down with me under the horses heels  yes said marco they did and i climbed down upon the pole and got them  well said the driver youre a smart boy but dont tell them inside that i tumbled off tell them i gave you the reins and jumped down to see the sailor  after receiving this charge marco would have been under a strong temptation to tell a falsehood if the company in the coach had asked him any questions about it but they did not they were so much occupied in expressing their astonishment that the sailor did not break his neck that they asked very few questions and after riding a short time they relapsed into silence again the fact that both the driver and the sailor escaped being seriously hurt was not so wonderful as it might seem horses have generally an instinctive caution about not stepping upon any thing under their feet if a little child were lying asleep in the middle of a road and a horse were to come galloping along without any rider the mother who should see the sight from the window of the house would doubtless be exceedingly terrified but in all probability the horse would pass the child without doing it any injury he would leap over it or go around it as he would if it were a stone this is one reason why in so many cases persons are run over without being hurt the driver and the sailor however fell rather behind the horses heels and escaped them in that way and they came down so exactly into the middle of the road that they were out of the way of the track of the wheels and thus they escaped serious injury  the misfortunes of the evening however did not end here the road was rather rough and there were many ruts and joltings and one or two of the passengers seemed to feel some fear lest the stage should upset one who sat near the door put his arm out at the window over the door so as to get his hand upon the handle of the catch in order as he said to be ready to open the door and spring out at a moments warning the gentleman on the back seat advised him not to do it  if you have your arm out said he the coach may fall over upon it and break it thats the way people get hurt by the upsetting of coaches by thrusting out their legs and arms in all directions when they find they are going over and thus get them broken you ought to fold your arms and draw in your feet and when you find that we are going over go in an easy attitude with all the muscles relaxed as if your body was a bag of corn  the passenger laughed and took his arm in and all the other passengers seeing that the advice of the gentleman was reasonable concluded to follow it if they should have occasion and they did have occasion sooner than they had expected for just after dark as they were going down a long hill at a pretty rapid rate with a wagon a short distance before them one of the horses of the wagon stumbled and fell which brought the wagon to a sudden stand just before the coach the driver perceived in an instant that there was not time to stop his horses and that the only chance was to turn out of the road and drive by the ground at the roadside was so much inclined that he was almost afraid to venture this expedient but he had no time for thought he wheeled his horses outjust escaped the hind wheel of the wagonran along by the roadside a short distance with the wheels on one side down very near the gutterand then just as he was coming back safely into the road again the forward wheel nearest the middle of the road struck a small stone and threw the coach over the top rested upon the bank and the horses were suddenly stopped sometimes on such occasions the transom bolt as it is called that is the bolt by which the forward wheels are fastened to the carriage comes out and the horses run off with the wheels it did not come out in this case however the man who had put his arm out of the window immediately called out in great alarm hold the horses hold the horses dont let the horses run and drag us but this vociferation was needless a coach full of passengers and baggage is a full load for four horses when it is mounted on wheels it would require an exertion far beyond their strength to drag it when on its side the horses remained quiet therefore while the wagoner and the driver who was not hurt opened the door in the upper side of the coach the passengers then climbed out one by one without injury mary williams came out last with her orangetree safe in her hand     chapter iii  the grass country    the scene of confusion produced by the double accident described in the last chapter was great but not long continued the wagoner got his fallen horse up and then the passengers with the driver and wagoner all taking hold together soon righted the stage none of the passengers were hurt but the coach itself was so much injured that the driver thought it was not safe to load it heavily again the female passengers got in but the men walked along by the side of it intending to travel in that way about four miles to the next tavern forester however was not inclined to take so long a walk fortunately at a small distance before them was a farmhouse which looked as if it belonged to a large and thrifty farmer the great barns and sheds the neat yards the wellbuilt walls and fences and the large stock of cattle in the barnyard indicated wealth and prosperity forester concluded to apply here for a lodging for the night for himself and marco the farmer was very willing to receive them so the driver took off their trunks and then the stagecoach with the rest of the passengers went on  how long shall we have to stay here asked marco  only till tomorrow said forester another stage will come along tomorrow we can stop just as well as not as we are in no haste to get home besides i should like to have you see something of the operations of a great grass farm  marco and forester went into the house and were ushered into a large room which seemed to be both sittingroom and kitchen a large round table was set in the middle of the floor for supper a monstrous dog was lying under it with his chin resting upon his paws there was a great settle in one corner by the side of the fire there were chairs also with straight backs and seats of basketwork a spinningwheel an open cupboard and various other similar objects which being so different from the articles of furniture which marco had been accustomed to see in the new york parlors attracted his attention very strongly marco went and took his seat upon the settle and the dog rose and came to him the dog gazed into his face with an earnest look of inquiry which plainly said who are you while marco patted him on the head thereby answering as plainly a friend the dog perfectly understanding the answer seemed satisfied and turning away went back to his place again under the table  illustration who are you  one of the farmers young men carried the trunks into a little bedroom which opened from the great room and then the farmer sat down and began to enter into conversation with forester and marco about their accident forester told him also about the sailor who had tumbled off the coach a mile or two back and been left behind forester said that he should like to know whether he was hurt much then the farmer said that he would let him take a horse and wagon the next morning and ride back and inquire this plan was therefore agreed upon marco and forester ate a good supper with the farmers family and then spent the evening in talking and telling stories about horses and sagacious dogs and about catching wild animals in the woods with traps about nine oclock the family all assembled for evening prayers after prayers marco and forester went to bed in their little bedroom where they slept soundly till morning  in the morning they were both awakened by the crowing of the cocks at an early hour they also heard movements in the house and in the yard before sunrise so they arose and dressed themselves and after attending to their morning devotions together in their room a duty which forester never omitted they went out marco was very much interested in the morning occupations of the farm there was the milking of the cows and the feeding of the various animals and the pitching off a load of corn which had been got in the evening before and allowed to stand on the cart on the barnfloor over night the cows were then to be driven to pasture and the boy who went with them took a bridle to catch a horse for forester and marco to have for their ride forester and marco went with him it was only a short walk to the pasture bars but they had to ramble about a little while before they found the horses at last they found them feeding together at the edge of a grove of trees there were two or three horses and several longtailed colts the boy caught one of the horses which he called nero nero was a white horse marco mounted him and rode down with the other horses and the colts following him they put the horse in the stable until after breakfast and then harnessed him into the wagon when all was ready the farmer told them to bring the sailor along with them to his house if they found that he was hurt so that he could not travel  when they were seated in the wagon and had fairly commenced their ride marco asked forester what he meant last evening by a grass farm you told me said he that you wanted me to see a great grass farm  yes replied forester the farms in this part of the united states may be called grass farms this is the grass country  isnt it all grass country asked marco grass grows everywhere  grass is not cultivated everywhere so much as it is among the mountains in the northern states replied forester the great articles of cultivation in the united states are grass grain and cotton the grass is cultivated in the northern states the grain in the middle states and the cotton in the southern states the grass is food for beasts the grain is food for man and the cotton is for clothing these different kinds of cultivation are not indeed exclusive in the different districts some grass is raised in the middle and southern states and some grain is raised in the northern states but in general the great agricultural production of the northern states is grass and these farms among the mountains in vermont are grass farms  there is one striking difference continued forester between the grass farms of the north and the grain farms of the middle states or the cotton plantations of the south the grass cultivation brings with it a vast variety of occupations and processes on the farm making the farm a little world by itself whereas the grain and the cotton cultivation are far more simple and require much less judgment and skill this is rather remarkable for one would think that raising food for beasts would require less skill than raising food or clothes for man  i should have thought so said marco  the reason for the difference is replied forester that in raising food for animals it is necessary to keep the animals to eat it on the spot for it will not bear transportation  why not said marco  because it is so cheap replied forester  i dont think that is any reason replied marco  a load of grasssaid forester  a load of grass repeated marco laughing  yes dried grass that is hay hay you know is grass dried to preserve it  very well said marco go on  a load of grass then is so cheap that the cost of hauling it fifty miles would be more than it is worth but cotton is worth a great deal more in proportion to its bulk it can therefore be transported to distant places to be sold and manufactured thus the enormous quantity of cotton which grows every summer in the southern states is packed in bags very tight and is hauled to the rivers and creeks and there it is put into steamboats and sent to the great seaports and at the seaports it is put into ships which carry it to england or to the northern states to be manufactured and it is so valuable that it will bring a price sufficient to pay all the persons that have been employed in raising it or in transporting it but the grass that grows in the northern countries can not be transported the mills for manufacturing cotton may be in one country and the cotton be raised in another and then after the cotton is gathered it may be packed and sent thousands of miles to be manufactured but the sheep and oxen which are to eat the hay can not be kept in one country while the grass which they feed upon grows in another the animals must live in general on the very farm which the grass grows upon thus while the cotton cultivator has nothing to do but to raise his cotton and send it to market the grass cultivator must not only raise his grass but he must provide for and take care of all the animals which are to eat it this makes the agriculture of the northern states a far more complicated business because the care of animals runs into great detail and requires great skill and sound judgment and the exercise of constant discretion  you observe continued forester that it is by the intervention of animals that the farmer gets the product of his land into such a shape that it will bear transportation for instance he feeds out his hay to his sheep attending them with care and skill all the winter in the spring he shears off their fleeces and now he has got something which he can send to market he has turned his grass into wool and thus got its value into a much more compact form the wool will bear transportation perhaps he gave a whole load of hay to his sheep to produce a single bag of wool so the bag of wool is worth as much as the load of hay and is very much more easily carried to market he can put it upon his lumberbox and drive off fifty miles with it to market without any difficulty  his lumberbox asked marco what is that  didnt you ever see a lumberbox asked forester it is a square box on runners like those of a sleigh the farmers have them to haul their produce to market  why do they call it a lumberbox asked marco  illustration the lumberbox  why when the country was first settled they used to carry lumber to market principally that is bundles of shingles and clapboards which they made from timber cut in the woods it requires some time for a new farm made in the forests to get into a condition to produce much grass for cattle i suppose that it was in this way that these vehicles got the name of lumberboxes you will see a great many of them in the winter season coming down from every part of the country toward the large towns on the rivers filled with produce  what else do the farmers turn their grass into besides wool asked marco  into beef said forester they raise cows and oxen they let them eat the grass as it grows all summer and in the winter they feed them with what they have cut and dried and stored in the barn for them the farmers are all ambitious to cut as much hay as they can and to keep a large stock of cattle thus they turn the grass into beef and the beef can be easily transported in fact it almost transports itself  how do you mean asked marco  why the oxen and cows when they are fat and ready for market walk off in droves to boston to be killed they dont kill them where they are raised for then they would have to haul away the beef in wagons or sleighs but make the animals walk to market themselves and kill them there but the farmers dont generally take their own cattle to market men go about the country and call upon the farmers and buy their cattle and thus collect great droves these men are called drovers in traveling in this part of the country late in the fall you would see great droves of cattle and sheep passing along the road all going to boston or rather brighton  where is brighton asked marco  it is a town very near boston where the great cattle market is held the boston dealers come out to brighton and buy the cattle and have them slaughtered and the beef packed and sent away all over the world thus the farmers turn the grass into beef and in that shape it can be transported and sold  and what else asked marco  why they raise a great many horses in vermont replied forester these horses live upon grass eating it as it grows in the pastures and on the mountains in the summer and being fed upon hay in the barn in the winter these horses when they are four or five years old are sent away to market to be sold they can be transported very easily a man will ride one and lead four or five by his side they will be worth perhaps seventyfive dollars apiece so that one man will easily take along with him three or four hundred dollars worth of the produce of the farm in the shape of horses whereas the hay which had been consumed on the farm to make these horses it would have taken forty yoke of oxen to move  forty yoke repeated marco  i dont mean to be exact said forester i mean it would take a great many so that by feeding his hay out to horses the farmer gets his produce into a better state to be transported to market the vermont horses go all over the land thus you see that the farmers in the grass country have to turn the vegetable products which they raise into animal products before they can get them to market and as the rearing of animals is a work which requires a great deal of attention care patience and skill the cultivators must be men of a higher class than those which are employed in raising cotton or even than those who raise grain the animals must be watched and guarded while they are young there are a great many different diseases and accidents and injuries which they are exposed to and it requires constant watchfulness and considerable intelligence to guard against them this makes a great difference in the character which is required in the laborers in the different cases a cotton plantation in the south can be cultivated by slaves a grain farm in the middle states can be worked by hired laborers but a northern grass farm with all its oxen cows sheep poultry and horses can only be successfully managed by the work of the owner  is that the reason why they have slaves at the south asked marco  it is a reason why slaves can be profitable at the south in cultivating cotton or sugar a vast proportion of all the work done in the year is the same almost the whole consists of a few simple processes such as planting hoeing picking cotton c and this is to be performed on smooth even land where set tasks can be easily assigned but the work on a grass farm is endlessly varied it would not be possible to divide it into set tasks and then it is of such a nature that it could not possibly be performed successfully by the mere labor of the hands the mind must be employed upon it for instance even in getting in hay in the summer season the farmer has to exercise all his judgment and discretion to avoid getting it wet by the summer showers and yet to secure it in good time and with proper dispatch a cotton planter may hire an overseer to see to the getting in of his cotton and he can easily tell by the result whether he has been faithful or not but hay can not be got in well without the activity and energy and good judgment which can come only from the presence and immediate supervision of an owner this produces vast differences in the nature of the business and in the whole state of society in the two regions  what are the differences asked marco  why in the first place said forester the fact that cotton and sugar can be cultivated by hired overseers with slaves to do the work enables rich men to carry on great plantations without laboring themselves but a great grass farm could not be managed so a man may have one thousand acres for his plantation at the south and with a good overseer and good hands it will all go on very well so far as his profit is concerned they will produce a great amount of cotton which may be sent to market and sold and the planter realize the money so as to make a large profit after paying all his expenses but if a man were to buy a thousand acres of grass land and employ an overseer and slaves to cultivate it every thing would go to ruin the hay would get wet and spoiledthe carts wagons and complicated tools necessary would get broken to piecesthe lambs would be neglected and die and the property would soon go to destruction even when a rich man attempts to carry on a moderate farm by hired laborers taking the best that he can find he seldom succeeds  does he ever succeed said marco  yes replied forester sometimes there is mr warner who lives near my fathers he was brought up on a farm and is practically acquainted with all the work he has been very successful and has a very large farm he works now very little himself but he watches every thing with the greatest care and he succeeds very well he has a great stock he cuts fifty tons of hay  i should like to see his farm said marco  well go some day replied forester  so you see continued forester that the work of a cotton or sugar plantation is comparatively simple and plain requiring little judgment or mental exertion and a great deal of plain straightforward bodily labor while on a northern stock farm the labors are endlessly varied every month every week and almost every day brings some change new emergencies are constantly arising which call for deliberation and judgment it is necessary to have a great variety of animals in order to consume all the different productions of the farm to advantage i can explain it all to you better when you come to see mr warners farm  as nero traveled very fast they began by this time to draw near to the place where they had left the sailor when they came up to the house they fastened the horse to a post and went in the man who lived there had gone away but the woman said that the sailor was somewhat hurt and asked them to come in and see him they found him in the kitchen with his foot up in a chair he seemed to be in some pain there was a great bruise on his ankle made by the cork of one of the horses shoes these corks as they are called are projections made of steel at the heel of a horseshoe to give the horse a firm footing they are made quite sharp in the winter season when there is ice and snow upon the ground but they are generally more blunt in the summer this prevented the ankles being cut as badly as it would have been if the corks had been sharper forester looked at the ankle and found that nothing had been done for it it was inflamed and painful he got the woman to give him a basin of warm water and then he bathed it very carefully which relieved the sense of tension and pain then he made an ointment of equal parts of tallow and oil which he put upon the end of a bandage and thus bound it up this treatment relieved the poor sailor very much then forester proposed to the sailor to get into the wagon and go with him to the next house and the sailor consented forester was then going to pay the woman for his nights lodging but the sailor said at onceno squire not at all im much obliged to you for doing up my foot but you need not pay any thing for me ive got plenty of shot in the locker  so saying he put his hand in his pocket and drew out a handful of gold and silver pieces but the woman who began now to feel a little ashamed that she had not done something for the wounded foot said he was welcome to his lodging and so they all got into the wagon and nero carried them rapidly back to his masters     chapter iv  the village    in due time and without any farther adventure forester and marco arrived at the end of their journey the village where foresters father lived was situated in a gorge of the mountains or rather at the entrance of a valley which terminated at last in a gorge there was a river flowing through this valley and the village was upon its banks at the upper end of the village a branch stream came in from the north and there was a dam upon it with some mills the river itself was a rapid stream flowing over a sandy and gravelly bottom and there were broad intervals on each side of it extending for some distance toward the higher land beyond these intervals the land rose gradually and in an undulating manner to the foot of the mountains which extended along the sides of the valley and from the summits of which one might look down upon the whole scene with the village in the center of it as upon a map  marco was very much pleased with the situation and with the appearance of the village the street was broad and it was shaded with rows of large maples and elms on each side the houses were generally white with green blinds most of them had pleasant yards before them and at their sides these yards were planted with trees and shrubbery there were also gardens behind the mountains which surrounded the scene gave a very secluded and sheltered appearance to the valley  the house in which forester lived was the largest in the village it was a square house of two stories it stood back a little from the road in the middle of a large yard ornamented with rows of trees along the sides and groups of shrubbery in the corners and near the house there were gravel walks leading in different directions through this yard and on one side of the house was a carriageway which led from a great gate in front to a door in one end of the house and thence to the stable in the rear on the other side of the house near the street was the officefor foresters father was a lawyer the office was a small square building with the lawyers name over the door there was a back door to the office and a footpath winding among trees and shrubbery which led from the office to the house  the morning after they arrived forester took marco out to see the village he intended not only to show him the various objects of interest which were to be seen but also to explain to him why it was that such villages would spring up in a farming country and what were the occupations of the inhabitants  the first thing which causes the commencement of a village in new england said forester is a waterfall  why is that asked marco  there are certain things replied forester which the farmers can not very well do for themselves by their own strength particularly grinding their corn and sawing logs into boards for their houses when they first begin to settle in a new country they make the houses of logs and they have to take the corn and grain a great many miles on horseback through paths in the woods or in the winter on handsleds to get it ground but as soon as any of them are able to do it they build a dam on some stream in the neighborhood where there is a fall in the water and thus get a water power this water power they employ to turn a sawmill and a gristmill then all the farmers when they want to build houses or barns haul logs to the mill to get them sawed into boards and they carry their grain to the gristmill and get it ground they pay the owner of the mills for doing this work for them and thus if there are a great many farms in the country around and no other mills very near so that the mills are kept all the time at work the owner gets a great deal of pay and gradually acquires property  now as soon as the mills are built perhaps a blacksmith sets up a shop near them if a blacksmith is going to open a shop anywhere in that town it will be better for him to have it near the mills because as the farmers all have to come to the mills at any rate they can avail themselves of the opportunity to get their horses shod or to get new tires to their wheels when they are broken  tires repeated marco what are tires  they are the iron rims around wheels every wheel must have an iron band about it very tight to strengthen it and to hold it firmly together without a tire a wheel would very soon come to pieces in rattling over a stony road  besides continued forester there is a great deal of other iron work which the farmers must have done farmers can generally do most of the wood work which they want themselves they can make their rakes and drags and cartbodies and sleds and tool handles but when they want iron work they must go to the blacksmiths they can make a harrowframe but the blacksmith must make the teeth  now i should think said marco that it would be easier to make the teeth than the frame  perhaps it is as easy if one has the forge and tools replied forester but the tools and fixtures necessary for blacksmiths work are much more expensive than those required for ordinary wood work there must be a forge built on purpose and an anvil supported on a solid foundation and various tools all these are necessary for shoeing a single horse and when they are all procured they will answer for all the horses of the neighborhood thus it happens that though farmers do a great deal of their wood work themselves at their own farms in cold and stormy weather they generally have their iron work done at a blacksmiths at some central place where it is easy and convenient for all of them to go  the above conversation took place between marco and forester as they were walking along together through the village toward the part of the town where the mills were situated just at this moment marco happened to cast his eyes across the street a short distance before them and he saw a fire on the ground in a little yard he asked forester what that fire could be as soon as forester saw the fire he exclaimed  ah they are putting a tire upon a wheel thats quite fortunate well go across and see them  so they left the path under the trees where they had been walking and went obliquely across the street toward the fire marco saw that there was a large blacksmiths shop there it was a very neatlooking building painted red there was a large door in the front and a very low window with a shutter hanging over it by the side of the door in an open yard by the side of the shop was the fire the fire was in the form of a ring there were several men standing about it one of them whom marco supposed was the blacksmith by his leather apron was putting on small sticks of wood and chips here and there around the ring marco saw that there was a large iron hoop as he called it on the fire it was not really a hoop it was a tire it was made of a much larger and thicker bar of iron than those which are used for hoops it was a tire belonging to a wheel the wheel was lying upon the ground near ready to receive the tire it was the hind wheel of a wagon the wagon itself was standing in front of the shop with one end of the hind axletree supported by a block  what do they heat the tire for asked marco  to swell it replied forester it is necessary to have the tire go on very tight so as to hold the wheel together with all the force of the iron now when iron is heated it swells and then shrinks again when it cools so they heat the tire hot and put it upon the wheel in that state then when it cools it shrinks and binds the whole wheel together with a very strong grip  but if they put it on hot it will burn the wood said marco  yes replied forester it will burn the wood a little they can not help that entirely but they stand ready with water to pour on as soon as the tire is in its place and so cool it immediately so that it does not burn the fellies enough to injure them  what are the fellies asked marco  they are the parts of the wooden rim of the wheel the rim is made of several pieces of wood which are called fellies  so forester took marco to the wheel and showed him the parts of which the rim was composed while marco was looking at the wheel the blacksmith began to push away the burning brands a little from the tire as it began to be hot enough presently he went into his shop and brought out several pairs of tongs with these the men lifted the tire out of the fire but the blacksmith said it was a little too hot and he must let it cool a minute or two  why if its very hot said marco it will grip the wheel all the harder  it will grip it too hard said forester sometimes a tire shrinks so much as to spring the spokes out of shape didnt you ever see a wheel with the spokes bent out of shape  i dont know said marco i never noticed wheels much  they do get bent sometimes said forester it requires great care to put on a tire in such a manner as to give it just the right degree of force to bind the wheel strongly together without straining it  illustration the tire  as soon as the tire became of the right temperature the men took it up again with the pairs of tongstaking hold with them at different sides of itand then they put it down carefully over the wheel the wheel immediately began to smoke on all sides in one or two places it burst into a flame the blacksmith however paid no attention to this but with a hammer which he held in his hand he knocked it down into its place all around the rim then he took up a brown pitcher full of water which was standing near and began to pour the water on walking round and round the wheel as he did it so as to extinguish the flames in every part and cool the iron when this process was completed forester and marco walked on  let me see said forester where did i leave off marco in my account of the growth of a village i was telling you about the blacksmiths shop i believe  yes said marco  the next thing to the blacksmiths shop in the history of a new england village said forester is generally a store you see the farmers can not raise every thing they want there are a great many things which come from foreign countries which they have to buy  such as sugar and tea said marco  yes replied forester only they make a great deal of sugar in vermont out of the sap of the mapletree we will go and see mr warners sugar bush next spring but there are a great many things which the farmers must buy one of the most important articles is iron now when a man concludes to open a store the best place that he can have for his business is near the mills and the blacksmiths shop because the people have to come there on other business and so that is the most convenient place for them to visit his store and so by and by when a carpenter and a mason come into the country the little village which has thus begun to form itself is the best place for them to settle in for that is the place where people can most conveniently call and see them after a while a physician comes and settles there to heal them when they are sick and a lawyer to prevent disputes  to prevent disputes said marco marco had not much idea of the nature of a lawyers business but he had a sort of undefined and vague notion that lawyers made disputes among men and lived by them  why i know said forester laughing that lawyers have not the credit generally of preventing many disputes but i believe they do perhaps it is because i am going to be a lawyer myself but i really believe that lawyers prevent ten disputes where they occasion one  how do they do it asked marco  why they make contracts and draw up writings and teach men to be clear and distinct in their engagements and bargains then besides when men will not pay their debts they compel them to do it by legal process and there are a vast many debts which are paid for fear of this legal process which would not have been paid without it thus knowing that the lawyers are always ready to apply the laws men are much more careful not to break them than they otherwise would be so that it is no doubt vastly for the benefit of a community not only to have efficient laws but efficient lawyers to aid in the execution of them  by this time forester and marco had reached the part of the village where the mills were situated forester showed marco the dam it was supported by ledges of rocks on each bank and there was a flume which conducted the water to the wheels of the mills there were two mills and a machineshop they went into the machineshop there was a lathe here carried by water a man was at work at it turning hoe handles forester asked him what other articles were turned there and he said posts for bedsteads and rounds for chairs and such other things as were used in quantities in that part of the country forester asked him whether the lathe would turn brass and iron as well as wood but he said it would not it was not fitted for that work  i suppose you might have a lathe here to work in the metals said forester  yes replied the man but it would not be worth while there is very little of that kind of work wanted in this part of the country  after looking at the mills forester and marco walked along up the stream a little way to look at the millpond whenever a dam is made it causes a pond to be formed above it more or less extensive according to the nature of the ground in this case there was quite a large pond formed by the accumulation of the water above the dam the pond was not very wide but it extended more than a mile up the stream the banks were picturesque and beautiful being overhung with trees in some places and in others presenting verdant slopes down to the waters edge  thats a good pond to go afishing in said marco  yes said forester and it makes fine skating ground in the winter  marco and forester followed the banks of the millpond until they came to the end of the still water beyond that they saw a rapid running stream coming down from the mountains marco wished to follow this stream up farther to see what they would come to and forester consented the ground ascended more and more the farther they proceeded and the view began to be shut in by forests precipices and mountains marco liked clambering over the rocks and he found a great deal to interest him at every step of the way he saw several squirrels and one rabbit he wanted forester to get him a gun and let him come out into those woods agunning  no said forester  why not asked marco  that is dangerous amusement  why do you think i should get killed with my sun asked marco  no replied forester i dont think you would but you might get killed the risk would be too great for the benefit  why you told me the other day that it was a great thing to learn to take risks coolly if i had a gun i could practice and learn  yes said forester it is well to take risks coolly when the advantage is sufficient to justify it for instance when you crept down upon the pole the other day to get the reins you took a great risk but perhaps you saved the lives of the passengers by it that was rightbut to hazard your life for the sake of the pleasure of shooting a squirrel is not wise marco had before this time told him about his getting the reins  i shouldnt think there was much danger said marco  no said forester theres very little danger in using a gun you put yourself in a very little danger of a very great calamity theres very little probability that your gun would burst or that you would ever shoot accidentally any other personvery little indeed but if the gun were to burst and blow off one of your arms or put out your eyes or if you were to shoot another boy the calamity would be a very terrible one so we call it a great risk  it seems to be a small risk of a great calamity said marco  yes replied forester but we call it a great risk we call the risk great when either the evil which we are in danger of is great or when the chance of its befalling us is great for example if you and i were to walk over that log which lies across the stream we should run a great risk but that would be not a small chance of a great evil but a great chance of a small evil there would be a great chance that we should fall off into the stream but that would not be much of an evil as we should only get ourselves wet  illustration the risk  let us go and try it said marco not i said forester you may however if you please i am willing to have you take such a risk as that for your amusement  marco went to the log and walked back and forth across it as composedly as if it were a broad plank lying upon the ground finally he hopped across it on one foot to show forester his dexterity forester was surprised he did not know how much skill in such feats marco had acquired by his gymnastics in new york  after this forester and marco clambered up some rocks on an elevated summit where they had a fine view of the village below them they could trace the river winding through the valley with the green intervals on both sides of it they could see the village and the streets with the spire of the meetinghouse in the center the millpond was in full view also and marcos attention was attracted by a boat which he saw gliding over the surface of the water  o there is a boat said marco  yes said forester i have paddled over the water many a time in her  how many oars does she pull asked marco  oars said forester no oars they use paddles  i wish they had some oars said marco and then i would get a crew of boys and teach them to manage a boat manowar fashion  how do you know any thing about it asked forester  o i learned at new york in the boats at the battery  well said forester well have some oars made and get a crew i should like to learn myself  let us go down and see the boat said marco now  no replied forester it is time to go to dinner now but well come and see the boat the next time we go to take a walk  so marco and forester came down the hill and thence went across the fields home to dinner they dined at halfpast twelve oclock which seemed a very strange hour to marco     chapter v  studying    the little building where foresters father had his office had a small back room in it which opened from the office proper and which was used as a library and private study it had a small fire place in it and there was a table in the middle of the room with a large portable writingdesk upon it this desk was made of rosewood the sides of the room were lined with bookshelves there was one large window which looked upon the yard and garden behind the books in this room were principally lawbooks though there were some books of history and travels and great dictionaries of various kinds forester conducted marco into this room a day or two after their arrival in the village saying  here marco this is to be our study how do you like it  very well said marco it is a very pleasant room am i to study all these books  not more than one at a time at any rate said forester  this is my place i suppose said marco and so saying he sat down in a great armchair before the portable writingdesk which was open on the table  illustration the study  no said forester that is my place i am going to arrange your establishment near the window james has gone to bring your desk now  while he was speaking the door opened and james the young man who lived at foresters fathers came in bringing a desk it was painted blue and had four legs these legs were of such a length as to make the desk just high enough for marco james put it down at foresters direction near the window it was placed with the left side toward the window so that the light from the window would strike across the desk from left to right this is the most convenient direction for receiving light when one is writing forester then placed a chair before the desk and marco went into the house and brought out all the books and papers which he had and arranged them neatly in his desk while he was gone forester took an inkstand and a sandbox out of a closet by the side of the fire and filled them both and put them on the desk he also placed in the desk a supply of paper in quarter sheets after marco had come back and had put in his books and papers forester gave him a ruler and a lead pencil also a slate and half a dozen slate pencils also a piece of sponge and a piece of indiarubber he gave him besides a little square phial and sent him to fill it with water so that he might have water always at hand to wet his sponge with  now is that all you will want asked forester  why yes i should think so said marco if i should want any thing else i can ask you you know you are going to stay here and study too  yes said forester but your asking me is just what i wish to avoid i wish to arrange it so that we shall both have our time to ourselves without interruption  but i shall have to ask you questions when i get into difficulty said marco  no said forester i hope not i mean to contrive it so that you can get out of difficulty yourself let me see you will want some pens i will get a bunch of quills and make them up into pens for you  what a whole bunch said marco  yes replied forester i dont wish to have you come to me when i am in the midst of a law argument to get me to make a pen  steel pens were very little used in those days  while forester was making the pens he said  there are twentyfive quills in a bunch i shall tie them up when they are ready into two bunches of about a dozen in each these you will put in your desk when you want a pen you will draw one out of the bunches and use it you must not stop to look them over to choose a good one but you must take any one that comes first to hand because if any one should not be good the sooner you get it out and try it and ascertain that it is not good the sooner you will get it out of the way  well said marco and what shall i do with the bad ones  wipe them cleanby the way you must have a good penwiperand then put them together in a particular place in your desk when you have thus used one bunch tie them up and lay the bunch on my desk to be mended and then you can go on using the other bunch this will give me opportunity to choose a convenient time to mend the first bunch again when i have mended them i will tie them up and lay them on your desk again thus you will always have a supply of pens and i shall never be interrupted to mend one this will be a great deal more convenient both for you and for me  only it will use up a great many more pens replied marco  no said forester not at all we shall have more in use at one time it is true but the whole bunch may last as long as if we had only one cut at a time  we shall begin to study continued forester at nine oclock and leave off at twelve that will give you half an hour to run about and play before dinner  and a recess said marcoi ought to have a recess  why theres a difficulty about a recess said forester i shall have it on my mind every day to tell you when it is time for the recess and when it is time to come in  o no replied marco i can find out when it is time for the recess let it be always at ten oclock and i can look at the watch  marco referred to a watch belonging to foresters father which was kept hung up over the mantelpiece in their little study  i think it probable you would find out when it was time for the recess to begin said forester but you would not be so careful about the end of it you would get engaged in play and would forget how the time was passing and i should have to go out and call you in  couldnt you have a little bell said marco  but i dont wish to have any thing of that kind to do said forester i am going to instruct you half an hour every morning beginning at nine oclock and i want to have it all so arranged that after that i shall be left entirely to myself so that i can go on with my studies as well as you with yours if we can do this successfully then when noon comes i shall feel that i have done my mornings work well and you and i can go off in the afternoon on all sorts of expeditions but if i have to spend the whole morning in attending to you then i must stay at home and attend to my own studies in the afternoon  well said marco i think i can find out when to come in  well try it one or two mornings but i have no idea that you will succeed however we can give up the plan if we find that you stay out too long you may have five minutes recess every day at eleven oclock on the whole it shall be ten minutes and this shall be the plan of your studies for the morning at nine oclock i shall give you instruction for half an hour then you may study arithmetic for one hour then write half an hour then have a recess for ten minutes then read for the rest of the last hour that will bring it to twelve oclock  but i cant study arithmetic alone said marco  yes said forester i shall show you how in the first halfhour when i am giving you my instructions now are you willing really to try to carry this system into effect pleasantly and prosperously  yes said marco ill try  we shall find some inconveniences and troubles at first i have no doubt said forester but if we are patient and persevering we shall soon make the system go smoothly  forester then said that as marco might forget what he had to do each hour he would make a sort of map of the hours with the name of the study which he was to pursue marked in each this he called a schedule the schedule when it was completed was as follows  ix                    x                    xi             xii   instruction  arithmetic  writing  recess  reading   this schedule was drawn neatly on a piece of paper and fastened with wafers to the under side of the lid of marcos desk so that he could look at it at any time by opening his desk  it was in the afternoon that this conversation was held and these preparations made the next morning at nine oclock marco and forester went into the little study and forester gave him his instructions he took his arithmetic and explained to him how to perform some examples under one of the rules forester performed one or two of them himself explaining very particularly all the steps he then rubbed out his work and directed marco to perform them by himself in the same manner if you succeed in doing these right said he you may set yourself some others of the same kind with different numbers and perform those too if you get into any difficulty you must not ask me but you may set yourself sums in addition and spend the rest of the hour in doing them that you can certainly do without help  yes said marco i can do that  the next halfhour is for writing said forester i will set you some copies  so forester took a writingbook which he had prepared and wrote marco some copies one on the top of each page marco looked over him while he wrote it is very important that a child should see his teacher write his copies for thus he will see how the letters should be formed forester wrote four or five copies for marco and while he was writing them he gave him particular instructions about the manner of holding his pen and shaping the letters  now said forester you can not possibly have occasion to come to me about your writing for here are pages enough for you to write upon for several days and you have plenty of pens  but i should think you would want to see whether i write it well said marco  i shall examine it carefully tomorrow morning said forester  very well said marco after the writing will come the recess  yes said forester and then the reading  what shall i read asked marco  forester then rose and went to one of the bookshelves where there was a set of books entitled the american encyclopedia there were thirteen octavo volumes in the set it was rather too high for marco to reach it and so forester took all the volumes down and placed them on a lower shelf not far from the window in a place where marco could get easy access to them  there said forester there is your library the american encyclopedia is a sort of a dictionary when your reading hour comes you may take down any volume of this encyclopedia and turn to any article you please or you may think of any subject that you would like to read about as for instance boat cannon camel eagle trout horse or any other subject and take down the proper volume and find the article you can find it by the letters which are printed on the backs of the volumes  let us look now said marco and see what it says about trouts  no not now replied forester when your reading hour comes you may read what you choose only you must have a piece of paper at hand and write upon it the title of every article which you read and show it to me the next morning because i shall wish to know what you have been reading and perhaps to question you about it now you understand your work do you not  yes said marco and what are you going to do  o im going to study my lawbooks  shall you stay here and study  yes replied forester i shall be here most of the time sometimes i shall be called into the other room perhaps on business with my lather but that need not make any difference with you  only then there will be nobody to watch me said marco  o i shall not watch you any even when i am here i shall pay no attention to you at all i can judge tomorrow morning when i come to look at your work and give you new instructions whether you have been industrious or not  even if i accidentally see you doing any thing wrong i shall not probably say any thing about it i shall remember it and speak to you about it tomorrow morning in my halfhour i shall do everything in my halfhour  marco felt somewhat relieved to think that he was not going to be under a very rigid observation in his studies  i do not expect said forester that you will do very well for the first few days it will take some time to get this system under full operation i presume that you will come to me as many as ten times the first day  o no said marco i dont mean to come to you once  you willi have no doubt what shall i say to you if you do will it be a good plan for me to answer your question  why no said marco i suppose not  and yet if i refuse to answer it will not be very pleasant to you it will put you out of humor  no said marco  i will have one invariable answer to give you said forester it shall be thisact according to your own judgment that will be a little more civil than to take no notice of your question at all and yet it will preserve our principlethat i am to give you no assistance except in my halfhour then besides i will keep an account of the number of questions you ask me and see if they do not amount to ten  by this time foresters halfhour was out and marco went to his desk  theres one thing said marco before i beginmay i have the window open  act according to your own judgment said forester and there is one question asked so forester made one mark upon a paper which he had upon the table  but cousin forester it is not right to count that for i had not begun  forester made no reply but began arranging his notebooks as if he was about commencing his own studies marco looked at him a moment and then he rose and gently opened the window and began his work  illustration marcos desk  marco was but little accustomed to solitary study and after performing one of the examples which forester had given him he thought he was tired and he began to look out the window and to play with his pencil he would lay his pencil upon the upper side of his slate and let it roll down as the pencil was not round but polygonal in its form it made a curious clicking sound in rolling down which amused marco though it disturbed and troubled forester whatever may have been the nice peculiarities in the delicate mechanism of foresters ear and of the nerves connected with it compared with that of marcos by which the same sound produced a sensation of pleasure in one ear while it gave only pain in the other it would require a very profound philosopher to explain but the effect was certain forester however did not speak but let marco roll his pencil down the slate as long as he pleased  this was not long however marco soon grew tired of it and then began to look out the window there was a little staple in the window sill placed there as a means of fastening the blind marco pushed the point of his pencil into this staple in order to see if it would go through it did go through in an instant and slipping through his fingers it fell out of the window  dear me there goes my pencil my pencil has dropped out of the window cousin forester shall i go out and get it  act according to your own judgment said forester at the same time he was saying this he made another mark upon his paper  why you ought not to count that cousin forester said marco for i dont know whether youd wish me to go and get that pencil or take another out of my desk  act according to your own judgment replied forester  marco looked perplexed and troubled in fact he was a little displeased to find that forester would not answer him he thought that it was an unforeseen emergency which forester ought to have considered an exception to his rule but he was obliged to decide the question for himself and he concluded to go out for his pencil it took him some time to find it in the grass and after he had found it he stopped for some time longer to watch some ants which were passing in and out at the entrance to their nest each one bringing up a grain of sand in his forceps when marco came in he found that his hour for arithmetic was so nearly expired that he should not have time to finish another sum if he should begin it so he put his arithmetical apparatus away and took out his writingbook  marco went through the whole forenoon pretty much in the same way he spent a large part of his time in looking out of the window and about the room he went out at the time for the recess but he stayed out twenty minutes instead of ten he was astonished when he came in to see how rapidly the time had passed he then took down a volume of the encyclopedia and read until twelve oclock and then leaving the volume of the encyclopedia and his writingbook on his desk he told forester that the study hours were over and went away  the next morning at nine forester asked him how he had got along the day before marco had the frankness to admit that he did not get along very well  still said forester i am well satisfied on the whole you did very well for a first experiment in the first place you did really make some effort to carry out my plan you kept the reckoning of the hours and changed your studies at the appointed time you did not speak to me more than three or four times and then you acquiesced pretty goodnaturedly in my refusing to help you today you will do better i have no doubt and tomorrow better still and thus in the course of a week i have great confidence that you will learn to study for three hours by yourself to good advantage  two hours and a half it is said marco  yes said forester  it resulted as forester predicted marco finding that forester was disposed to be pleased with and to commend his efforts made greater efforts every day and in the course of a week he began to be a very respectable student in the afternoon he used to ramble about sometimes with forester and sometimes alone he was very fond of fishing and forester used to allow him to go to certain parts of the river where the water was not deep alone trusting to his word that he would confine himself strictly to the prescribed bounds     chapter vi  the log canoe    every thing went on very prosperously for a week or two in the little study marco became more and more attentive to his studies and more and more interested in them he was often getting into little difficulties it is true and giving trouble to his uncle and aunt but then he generally seemed sorry afterward for the trouble which he had thus occasioned and he bore reproof and such punishments as his cousin thought it necessary to inflict with so much goodhumor that they all readily forgave him for his faults and misdemeanors  one day however about a fortnight after he had commenced his studies he got led away through the influence of a peculiar temptation into a rather serious act of transgression which might have been followed by very grave consequences the circumstances were these he had commenced his studies as usual after having received his halfhours instruction from forester and was in the midst of the process of reducing the fraction 504756 to its lowest terms when he happened to look out of the window and to see two boys climbing over a garden fence belonging to one of the neighbors houses at a little distance in the rear of his uncles house it was a very pleasant morning and marco had the window open so he could see the boys very plainly they stopped on the farther side of the fence which they had got over and though they were partially concealed by the fence yet marco could plainly perceive that they were busily employed in doing something there though he could not imagine what he wished very much to go and see but he knew that it would be in vain to make request for permission and so he contented himself with watching them  just at this moment his uncle opened the door which led into the little study and asked forester if he would step into the office forester did so and then after a few minutes he returned put up his books and said that he had got to go away and that perhaps he should not be back till noon marco had often been left alone at his studies for a time but never for a whole morning before he knew that he was to go on with his work just as if forester had remained so forester bade him good morning and then went away  marco watched the boys wondering more and more what they could be doing they kept stooping down to the ground and moving about a little as if they were planting seeds but as it was entirely the wrong season for any such work marco concluded that they must be hiding something in the ground perhaps said he to himself they have been stealing some money and are burying it i wish i could go and see  if there had been a door leading directly from the study into the yard marco would have left his studies and have gone out at once but as it was he could not get out without going through the office where his uncle was sitting at last the thought struck him that he might jump out the window he felt some hesitation at taking this step but finally he concluded that he would do it and just go near enough to see what the boys were hiding and exactly where they were putting it so that he could go afterward and find it without fail he determined to return then immediately  i shall not be out longer than five minutes said he to himself and i will let it go for my recess  so he took his cap from the nail where he was accustomed to hang it while he was at his studies and then climbing out the window feet foremost he let himself down gently to the ground he then crept slyly along through the yards and gardens until he got pretty near the place where the boys were at work the mystery however was rather increased than diminished by the near view he could make nothing of the operations which they were engaged in and while he was hesitating whether to go nearer one of the boys happened to look up and spied him marco had intended to keep himself concealed by a tree behind which he had taken his station but the boy having looked up suddenly at a moment when he happened to be off his guard saw him before he had time to draw back under the cover he had chosen  holloa marco said the boy come here  marco was astonished at this frank and open invitation he had expected that the boys when they saw him would have dropped at once behind the fence to conceal themselves or that they would have caught up what he supposed they were burying and have run away their accosting him in this fearless manner deranged his ideas about their probable object and increased his curiosity to know what they were doing so he came forth from his concealment and went toward them when he reached the spot the mystery was suddenly dispelled by his finding out that they were digging worms for bait to go afishing  marcos curiosity was now changed to eager desire the boys told him that they were going down to the river to fish for eels and marcos soul was all on fire to accompany them he had never fished for eels he knew the boys very well and they offered to lend him a hook and line but marco thought that on the whole it would not do he tried to persuade them to wait until the afternoon but they would not consent to such a postponement of their pleasure so marco wished them good luck and began to mount the fence again with the intention of returning to his studies  on looking toward the office he saw his uncle coming out of the door in the rear of it and walking toward the house marco immediately reflected that it would not answer for him to meet his uncle and he descended from the fence again on the same side with the boys until his uncle should go back the boys thought he came back because he was undecided whether to go with them or not and they renewed their invitations with redoubled urgency marco did not reply but looked steadily toward the house he saw a man standing in the yard with a small ladder in his hand a moment afterward marcos uncle came out of the house and to marcos great consternation he perceived that he had a saw and a hatchet in his hand and then he recollected that his uncle had been intending to prune some trees that forenoon the trees were situated in various positions about the yard so that marco could neither go in at the front door of the office nor climb in at the window without being discovered he did not know what to do  in the mean time the boys urged him to go with them they did not know any thing about his studies and supposed that his hesitation was only owing to his want of interest in the object of the expedition finally marco concluded to go he supposed that he should not be able to get back into his study till noon as he recollected that his uncle expected to be employed all the forenoon about his pruning he thought therefore that his chance of detection would not be increased by staying out an hour or two longer and so he told the boys that he would go  when they had procured sufficient bait they went toward the river their way led them not very far from the house and they were several times in situations where they were exposed to view in case marcos uncle had looked toward them marco however contrived to walk by these places in such a manner as to cover himself as much as possible from view by the other boys and besides he hoped that his uncle was too much occupied with his pruning to notice what boys were prowling about the village they passed across the street in this manner and then went down over the intervales toward the river marco felt quite relieved at seeing that his uncle kept steadily at his work holding the ladder for the other man to mount by or sawing off low branches himself without appearing to notice the boys at all  the river was circuitous in its course and its banks were in some places steep and in others low and sandy the water was generally shallow but in some places it was deepespecially under the high banks in many places there were willows and elms overhanging the water it was in one of these places that the boys were going to fish for eels it was a point where the river took a sudden turn forming a sort of angle in the stream where the water was very dark and deep the bank was high at that place and it was covered with trees and bushes some of these trees had been undermined and their roots and branches were floating in the water the boys scrambled down to the brink and made ready for fishing they cut slender poles in the bushes for fishingpoles there was a trunk of a tree lying along the shore extending obliquely out a little way over the water which furnished them a convenient footing they stood or sat upon it baited their hooks and threw them over into the water they followed the bait with their eyes as it sunk slowly down into the dark depths among the logs and roots and trunks of trees which were lying submerged in the water  the boys remained here an hour but they caught no eels either there were none there or for some reason or other they chose not to bite they had some talk about going to another place but before they decided upon that plan marcos attention was arrested by the sight of what appeared to be a large log floating down the river he pointed it out to the other boys and on closer examination they saw that it was an old canoe of the kind that are formed by hollowing out a log it was not of very large size and it appeared to be rather old and decayed still the boys wanted to get it very much they gathered in their lines and ran along the bank keeping pace with the boat as it floated down  illustration boat adrift  they very soon came to a reach of the riverthat is to a length of it between one bend and another where the water was swift and shallow so the two boys who had been fishing with marco threw off their shoes and pulled up their trowsers and ran down the bank and into the river the boat was far out in the stream and they had to wade some distance before they came to it besides as the boat was floating down all the time while they were wading across it got some distance down the stream before they could reach it they however succeeded in getting it at last and with much floundering in the water and many shouts of laughter they brought it over to marco  marco was much pleased with the prize it was in better condition than they had expected to find it there was indeed a piece knocked out at one end near the upper edge but they found that it would support all three of the boys if they sat in it carefully and with their weight principally at the other end for want of oars or paddles they cut poles on the banks thinking that they could push the boat along by planting the poles against the bottom as the water was not deep they drew the boat up to the shore and poured out some water which had got into her and then they all carefully embarked intending to make a little voyage  it happened that just below the place to which the boat had drifted before they overtook it the water became somewhat deeper and of course more smooth and still so that it afforded a favorable place for navigating such a boat in fact the character of the stream throughout its whole course for several miles was to present a constant succession of changes from deep and almost still water to shallow and rapid currents rippling over beds of sand and gravel one of these rapids or rips as they were called the boys had just passed it being in one of them though one more broad and less rapid than many of the others that they had pursued and overtaken the boat in the smooth and still water below therefore they had a very favorable opportunity to try their boat for the water though not so shallow as it was above was still not so deep as to prevent their propelling their boat by pushing their poles against the bottom it required some care to preserve their equilibrium but then the water was not deep and they knew therefore that there was no danger of being drowned if they should upset  things went on very prosperously until after a few minutes the boys suddenly found themselves drifting into deeper water their poles would scarcely touch the bottom marco who was not much accustomed to this kind of navigation was at first somewhat alarmed but the other boys told him to keep quiet and they would soon drift into shallow water again they accordingly drew in their poles and began to look over the edge of the boat into the water to see if they could see any eels they saw no eels but the water soon began to grow shallow again and so the boys feeling that they were in no danger remained quietly in their places looking idly into the water talking about the various objects which they saw upon the bottom  after some minutes spent in this manner one of the boys looked down the stream and saw that the boat was gradually approaching another of the rapids  come boys said he we must go to work or we shall be down over the rips  so the boys all took their poles and began to push the boat up the stream but they found it harder than they had expected in fact the boat had drifted down nearer to the rapids than they ought to have allowed it to go the water was running quite swiftly where they were and they soon found that all their efforts were not sufficient to stem the current the boat was carried round and round in every direction excepting up the stream in fact the current was rapidly acquiring the entire mastery over them and hurrying them down to a point where the water poured on in a furious torrent through a long narrow passage between beds of stone and gravel  pull boys pull said marco we shall go down over the rips in spite of every thing  the boys did pull but they could effect nothing the water was sweeping them along with great rapidity notwithstanding all their struggles finally when they found that they could not make head against it so as to go up the stream they concluded to pull for the shore they were not in any great fear for the river was very narrow and not more than knee deep in the rapids so that there was no real danger of any calamity greater than getting well wet they seemed to be also in a fair way to escape this for they found that they could make some progress in getting their boat toward the shore but just as they began to think their object was about to be accomplished they were arrested by a sudden mishap it happened that there was a little snag in the river nearly in the direction in which they were going it was the end of a small log which rose almost to the surface of the water the greater part of the log was firmly imbedded in the sand but there was a small portion of it which projected so far as barely to be submerged the boys did not notice this and in their eagerness to run the boat ashore it happened that they were running it across the current just above this snag but as the current was sweeping them down the stream at the same time that they were pushing themselves across it it carried the boat with great force against this snag the bottom of the boat was confined by it while the force of the current still pressing upon the side overset it in a moment and threw all the boys out into the water  the boys scrambled out without much difficulty and stood upon the gravelly beach they saw at the same moment a man on the bank of the river above who looked as if he was about to run to their aid but when he saw that they were safe he turned around immediately and disappeared an instant afterward marco finding that his cap was not upon his head looked around for it and to his dismay he saw it floating swiftly away down the rapids he ran into the water and seized the boat which was then beginning also to go away he called upon the boys to help him pull it up and pour the water out he then lanched it again with all speed seized one of the poles clambered into it and pushed off into the swiftest part of the current and away he went after his cap  illustration cap gone  he resorted to this desperate measure because he was greatly alarmed at the idea of going home without his cap it would have certainly insured his detection and as he supposed a double punishment he now was as eager to go down the rapids as he had before been to escape them his only care was to keep his boat head down so that if he should encounter any snag or rock he might not be thrown broadside on he kept a good lookout too ahead the boat shot through the water like an arrow and was soon clear of the rapids in the comparatively still water below  marco contrived to paddle with his pole so as to overtake the cap and recover it then he went to the shore and landed he drew up the boat as high as he could and went back to seek the other boys he concluded that it was time to go home his conscience now began to reproach him with the wrong which he had been doing his promised pleasure had failed his clothes were wet and uncomfortable his mind was anxious and unhappy with a heavy heart he began to retrace his steps sure of detection when he reached home and of punishment he did not however dread the punishment so much as the just displeasure which his cousin would manifest and the evidence of the pain which he knew his cousin would suffer when he came to learn how his pupil had betrayed the confidence which had been reposed in him before he set out for home however he took off such of his clothes as were most wet and wrung out the water as well as he could and then put them on again  when he drew near to the house he expected to see his uncle still at work but he was not there marco reconnoitered the place carefully and then went into the office his uncle was not in the office he passed through into the study he was afraid that forester would be there but to his surprise and joy he was not and there was no sign that he had been there since the morning marco looked at the watch and found that it was only about halfpast eleven so he took down a volume of the encyclopedia and began to read he read the article canoe and he found some information about the bark canoes made by indians but nothing about log canoes in about fifteen minutes he heard the office door open and his cousin forester came in forester walked into the study but said nothing to marco marco kept at his work without speaking to his cousin he began to hope that he might yet escape his only fear now was lest his wet clothes should be observed he put his hand down many times to his knees to ascertain how fast they were drying the clothes that he wore were of woolen and of a dark color so that they did not show the wet very distinctly and besides the sun and the air were warm that day and the clothes had dried fast in a word when twelve oclock arrived and marco put his books away nobody would have observed that his clothes had been wet he ran about in the open air until dinnertime and though when he went in to dinner he felt oppressed with a sense of guilt and of selfcondemnation he was satisfied that no one suspected him marco thought that he had had a very lucky escape     chapter vii  a dilemma    though marcos first feeling was that of relief to find that he had got back from his truancy without detection he felt after all ill at ease he kept out of sight till the dinnerbell rang and then he was almost afraid to go in for fear that by some accident or other his uncle might have noticed his absence and might ask him something about it he was usually much interested at dinnertime in talking with forester about plans for the afternoon but now he felt guilty and afraid and he was disinclined to look his uncle or his cousin in the face or to speak a word  and yet it was not punishment that marco was afraid of there were very few boys who could bear punishment of any kind with more fortitude than he or to whom the idea of punishment gave less concern it was the detection itself rather than what was to come after it that he feared there is something in the very act of being detected and exposed in guilt which the heart instinctively shrinks from and many a boy would willingly bear in secret twice the pain which the punishment of an offense would bring rather than have his commission of the offense discovered and made known  there was however no indication at the dinner table that marcos cousin or uncle suspected him of any wrong they talked of various subjects in their usual manner forester had arranged it with marco to go that afternoon down to the millpond to examine the boat in order to see whether they could have it fitted with oars and to make arrangements to that effect marco now hoped that forester had forgotten this plan and would not go though he had been very much interested in the plan the day before he now felt disinclined to go he wished to be alone or at least out of sight of forester he felt as if he had a terrible secret on his mind and that there was great danger that something or other would occur to discover it so he hoped that forester would have forgotten the appointment and that it would be thus postponed to some future time  but forester had not forgotten it and after dinner he asked marco how soon he should be ready to go marco said that he should be ready at any time and in about half an hour they set out they walked together to the millpond forester said that the boat belonged to a man who worked in the mills but he lived a little distance above them his house was near the water in a little valley the water of the pond extended up into this valley forming a sort of bay  illustration the millmans house  a road led to the house but did not go beyond it the house was small but it had pleasant little yards and gardens about it and various pens and coops for different sorts of animals the man who lived there was famous for keeping a great many animals he had pigs and cows and malta cats and two dogsone of them a water dogand ducks and geeseamong the latter two wild geeseand hens and rabbits and there were two gray squirrels hanging up in a cage by the side of the front door forester told marco about these animals as they walked along  marco was very fond of animals and he began to anticipate great pleasure in seeing these when they came near the house he ran forward to look at the wild geese the water dog ran to meet forester he knew forester having often seen him there before forester and marco rambled about the yards looking at the animals for some time and then went to the waters edge which was very near the house the ducks and geese were swimming in the water forester called the dog there and marco amused himself for some time in throwing sticks into the water and ordering the dog whose name was nelson to plunge in and go and bring them back the boat was there too fastened by a rope to a post in the bank at length after marco had satisfied himself with these amusements he said  well cousin forester here is the boat  yes said forester but the man dont seem to be at home i presume hes at the mill  and what shall we do in that case asked marco  why i will go into the house first and ascertain the fact and get a paddle  so forester went into the house and soon afterward returned bringing with him a paddle he said that the man was at the mill but that his wife said that they might have the boat to go and find him i thought said forester that you would rather go in the boat than walk  yes said marco i should  besides continued forester i can teach you to paddle  marco took the paddle from foresters hand he had never seen one before he said that they always used oars not paddles in new york harbor a paddle is shaped very differently from an oar it is much shorter and lighterthough the blade is broader a paddle is worked too differently from an oar an oar acts as a lever against the side of the boatthe middle of it resting in a small notch called a rowlock or between two wooden pins but a paddle is held in the hands entirely  what do they have paddles for in this country said marco oars are better  you are not competent to decide that question replied forester  why not said marco i have rowed boats many a time  yes but you have never paddled much you have used oars but not paddles and so you can not compare them  well said marco i mean to try this paddle now and then i can tell  marco had seen the boys who were with him in the boat that morning using their poles as paddles and he had used one of the poles in that manner himself and he was just upon the point of saying something upon the subject when suddenly he recollected that it would betray him in fact marco found that having such a secret as this upon his mind was a source of great embarrassment and constraint as he more than once came very near making some allusion inadvertently which would have resulted in his exposure while speaking of boats and oars and paddles and such subjects he had to be continually upon his guard and to watch all his words  illustration paddling  they got into the boat and pushed out upon the water forester taught marco how to use the paddle he gave him his seat in the stern of the boat and directed him to grasp the lower end of the handle with the other hand then by dipping the blade in the water and pushing the water back the boat was propelled forward he also explained to him how by turning the blade of the paddle one way or the other he could give the bow of the boat an impulse toward the right or toward the left  thus you see said forester with a paddle you can steer but with an oar you can not  with two oars i can said marco  yes replied forester you must have two oars to guide a boat but you can do it with one paddle therefore if you can have but one a paddle is better than an oar there is another advantage in a paddle that is in using it your face looks the way that you are going  yes rejoined marco that is a great advantage  in rowing you must sit with your back to the bow of the boat and look over your shoulder to see where you are going  yes said marco unless you have a steersman  true replied forester when you have several men to row and one to steer you get along very well with oars but in case of only one man there is an advantage in a paddle there is still another point to be considereda paddle is better for a narrow boat and oars for wide ones  why so asked marco  because said forester a certain width is required in a boat in order to work oars well the oarsman must sit upon the seat and extend the oar off upon one side of the boat and there must be a certain distance between the part which he takes hold of and the rowlock in order to work to advantage but it is no matter how narrow the boat is if he has a paddle for he holds it perpendicularly over the side  so paddles are better said marco for one kind of boat and oars for another  yes replied forester and paddles are better for one kind of navigation and oars for another oars require greater breadth of water to work in in a narrow crooked stream flowing among logs and rocks oars would not answer at all but with a paddle a man can worm a boat through anywhere  that is if it is only wide enough for the boat to go said marco  of course replied forester the paddle itself requires no additional space but oars extend so far laterally  laterally asked marco  yes rejoined forester that is on each side oars extend so far on each side that they require a great breadth of water if you attempt to go through a narrow place the oars would strike  why no said marco you can give orders to trail oars  i dont know any thing about that said forester  thats a beautiful manoeuver said marco only it is hard to do you see you order them to give way hearty so as to get a good headway till just as you get to the narrow place and then trail is the word then the oarsmen all whip their oars out of the rowlocks in an instant and let em trail alongside under the boats counters and she shoots through the narrow place like a bird  marco became very enthusiastic in describing this manoeuver but forester did not get a very clear idea of it after all  youll teach it to us said forester when we get our oars and a good boats crew of boys at any rate a boat can be paddled continuously through a narrow space better than it can be rowed therefore paddles are generally used on rivers where there are many narrow places to pass through indians and savages almost always use paddles for they navigate many intricate and narrow passages of water  by this time they began to draw near the mill they landed near some great logs which were floating in the water ready to be drawn up into the mill and sawed they went up the bank and thence into the mill the man who owned the boat was tending the mill when he wanted a log he would take the end of a long chain down a sloping plane of planks which led to the water and fasten it to a log the other end of the chain was fastened round an axle in the mill and when all was ready the man would set the axle in motion by the machinery and that would draw the log up when the log was in the mill the man would roll it over into its place on a long platform of timber where it was to be sawed then he would set the saw machinery in motion and the platform would begin to move forward and the saw at the same time to go up and down sawing the log as it advanced thus it would saw it through from end to end and then by reversing the motion of the machinery the log was carried back again the man would then move it a little to one side just far enough for the thickness of the board which he wished to make and then begin to saw again he moved the log by means of an iron bar with a sharp point which he struck into the end of the log and thus pried it over one end at a time when the log was placed in its new position the machinery was set in motion again and the log was sawed through in another place from end to end parallel to the first sawing leaving the width of a board between this process was continued until the log was sawed entirely into boards except a piece in the middle which it was necessary to leave of double thickness and this answered for a plank  marco was much interested in watching this process and when the sawing of this log was completed and another log drawn up into its place forester introduced the subject of the boat he told the man what he wished to do namely to have some rowlocks or tholepins made along the sides of the boat and some oars to row it with it would also be necessary to have seats or thwarts as they are called placed in such a manner that there should be one just before each rowlock these seats were for the oarsmen to sit upon in rowing the man told forester that he might do any thing he pleased with the boat he was sure that forester would do it no injury forester asked him who would be a good man to do the work and the man recommended to him a wagonmaker who had a shop very near the mill  they went to the wagonmaker and explained to him what they wanted the wagonmaker readily undertook the work they all went down to the boat together to plan the seats and the places for the tholepins they concluded to have three pairs on each side this would require six oars these oars the wagonmaker promised to make and to have all the work done by the beginning of the next week they also concluded to have the boat taken out of the water and thoroughly calked again and her bottom payed over with pitch as she was not perfectly tight this being all arranged forester and marco began to walk toward home  it seems to me strange to get a wagonmaker to work on a boat said marco  in new york i suppose you would go to a boatbuilder said forester  yes replied marco to be sure  there are no boatbuilders here rejoined forester in fact there are very few trades represented here and workmen are willing to do any kind of jobs that they can  as only a small part of the afternoon was yet passed away marco asked forester if he might go down to the river afishing i can keep within my bounds you know said he  yes said forester you can keep within your bounds  and i will said marco dont you suppose i will  why you can tell better than i can about that said forester you have been here now some weeks and i have treated you with considerable trust and confidencehave i not  why yes said marco  i have given you leave to go afishing trusting to your fidelity in keeping within your bounds i have left you alone in your study several times in the forenoons i have let you go up on the mountains with other boys and lent you my watch so that you might know when it was time to come back now you can tell better than i whether you have been faithful to all of these trusts  marco did not answer he did not know what to say he walked along in silence  i will leave it with you to decide said forester here we are just home now you may go into the study and reflect a few moments upon the subject call to mind all the cases in which i have treated you with trust and confidence and consider whether you have always been faithful to the trust if on reflection you think that you have you may take your fishingline and go afishing if you feel conscious that you have at any time betrayed my confidence you must not go this afternoon you may go out to play wherever you please about the house and garden but you must not go afishing if you are in doubt whether you have betrayed my confidence or not and wish to ask my opinion about some particular case which comes up to your mind you may remain in the study till i come in and ask me and i will tell you i shall be in in a few minutes  there was a pause here marco looked very serious and walked along in silence such a turn to the conversation was entirely unexpected to him and he did not know what to say  it is possible continued forester that you may be conscious that you have clearly been guilty of betraying the confidence which i have placed in you in some instance which i know nothing of or which you suppose i know nothing of and you may wish to confess it to me if you have been guilty of any such act the best thing that you can do is to confess it to me at once and if you wish to do it you may wait till i come for that purpose so you may wait till i come either to ask me a question or to confess a fault if you do not wish to do either you may go out without waiting for me but you must not go afishing unless you can truly say that you have been faithful and honest whenever i have trusted you before  so saying forester parted from marco and went into the house marco slowly walked into the office and through it into the little study he was greatly perplexed to know what to make of this address can it be thought he that he knows that i went away this morning how could he have found it out or did he say that only to find out now whether i have been honest or not heretofore  on mature reflection marco concluded that forester did not probably know any thing about his having gone away he thought that what he had just said was only a part of foresters general plan of managing his case and that it did not imply that forester entertained any particular suspicions marco thought that he might therefore safely go afishing that afternoon if he was disposed but we must do him the justice to say that he did not entertain the idea of doing it a moment he determined that he would not go but as he was not prepared to confess his fault and as he had no question to ask he determined to go and play about the garden he thought a little of waiting till his cousin came in and then honestly making a confession but he could not quite conclude upon this and so he determined to go and think more of it besides he concluded that if he were going to make a confession at all he should rather do it that evening when he went to bed for forester always came up to his room after he went to bed to have a little friendly and serious conversation with him and to bid him good night  he accordingly went out before forester came in he spent the afternoon in a miserable state of mind he could not divest himself of the feeling of anxiety that in some way or other forester had found out his transgression he rather wondered that if it were true that forester had found it out he had not said something to him directly about itbut then he knew it was foresters way not always to make known at once all that he knew in such cases but then he thought again that forester could not know any thing about it there was no way for him to have known it he was away all the morning and did not come home until after marco got back so he concluded that forester did not know but he began to wish that he did he could not bear to think of telling him but he wished that he knew the burden of such a secret became intolerable to him he strolled about the yards and garden not knowing what to do with himself and growing all the time more and more anxious and unhappy he was in a very serious dilemma  marco cast his eyes occasionally toward the office expecting to see forester come out he thought forester would want to know whether he went afishing or not but he did not come marco spent some time in the garden with james who was at work there raking over the ground and gathering in such things as might be hurt by any sudden frost marco worked with him for some time and endeavored to converse with him but he did not find him very communicative and at last he went into the house and sat on the sofa in the parlor reading until supper time  marco fully expected that forester would ask him at supper time whether he had been afishing or not but he said nothing about it forester told his father and mother about their plan for a boat and gave them a full account of their visit to the mill his mother seemed quite interested in the account and told marco that after he got his crew well trained she should hope that he would invite her on an excursion in the boat  yes said marco we will we must have a seat cousin forester for passengers and visitors in the stern sheets  the stern sheets said forester what do you mean by the stern sheets  why it is aft said marco between the coxswains place and the strokeoarsman  youll have to show us said his aunt when we come to see the boat  this kind of conversation somewhat relieved marcos mindbut still he was ill at ease and he determined to tell forester the whole story at bedtime if he could only summon up courage to begin     chapter viii  a confession    in the room where marco slept there was a large stuffed armchair which was commonly called the easy chair it was one that was seldom used by the family except in sickness it stood in a corner of the room not far from the head of marcos bed forester used to sit in this chair while he remained conversing with marco when he came up to take his light  when forester had taken his seat in the great chair this evening according to his usual custom he began his conversation by saying  well marco have you been helping james in the garden this afternoon  why no said marco i did not help him muchi dont like james very well  why not asked forester  why i dont think he is very accommodating replied marco  what has he done today which is unaccommodating asked forester  he would not lend me his knife i wanted to borrow his knife to cut me a cane from some appletree trimmings and he would not let me have it  havent you got a knife of your own asked forester  yes said marco but mine wont open  wont open repeated forester whats the cause of that  why i suppose because the joint is rusty replied marco  how came it rusty asked forester  why you see i laid it down one day on a stone where i was at work with it and left it there and there happened to come a rain in the night and rusted it i did not know where it was and so i didnt find it for a good many days  then i presume said forester that james supposed that you would leave his knife out in the same way and spoil it  no replied marco that was not the reason  you are sure that you asked him for it distinctly and he refused  yes said marco  here there was a moments pause marco thought that his cousin forester was considering what should be done to james for being so unaccommodating he did not know but that he would report him to his father and have him turned away though marco did not really wish to have him turned away  but forester said after reflecting a moment that makes me think of a story i have got here listen and hear it  illustration marcos room  so forester took out his pocketbook and opened it and then appeared to be turning over the leaves for a moment to find a place then he began to read or to appear to read as follows  once there was a little girl named anne she came to her mother one day as she was sitting in the parlor and began to complain bitterly of her sister mary her sister mary was older than she was and had a doll anne complained that mary would not lend her her doll  are you sure that she refused to lend you her doll asked her mother  yes mother i am sure she did replied anne  perhaps she is playing with it herself said her mother  no replied anne she is ironing in the kitchen  i think you must be mistaken said her mother go and ask her again dont tell her i sent you but ask her yourself whether she really meant that she was not willing to lend you her doll  so anne ran off to put the question to mary again presently she returned with the same answer mary she said would not lend it to her  i am very sorry to hear it said her mother for now i suppose i shall have to punish you  to punish her you mean said anne  no said her mother to punish you i dont suppose she is to blame  why motherhow can i be to blame for her not being willing to lend me her doll  you are ive no doubt said her mother mary is a goodnatured accommodating girlalways ready to do kindnesses and if she has any unwillingness to lend any thing to you it must be that you have created it yourself by some misconduct so that it will prove no doubt that you are the one to be punished  here anne began to hang her head and look a little ashamed her mothers supposition proved to be correct for on inquiring it appeared that mary had lent her doll to anne a few days before and that when she wanted it again anne was unwilling to give it to her and when mary insisted on her bringing it to her she became angry and threw the doll out the window  i never heard that story before cousin forester said marco and i did not know that you had stories in your pocketbook  forester laughed and put up his pocketbook  i dont believe there is any story there said marco you made it up for me i verily believe  yes said forester i did dont it fit your case pretty well  why i dont know said marco i dont see why he could not let me have his knife  suppose i had asked him for his knife dont you suppose he would have lent it to me  yes said marco ive no doubt he would he would do any thing for you of course because you pay himor uncle pays him which is the same thing  i dont think that that is the reason altogether replied forester there was the man at the mill today who said that i might take his boat and do any thing i chose to do with it  yes said marco i noticed that  and perhaps you thought it was very much to his credit that he did so  yes said marco  but the fact is rejoined forester as i think it was more to my credit than his because i have had his boat a great many times heretofore and his having so much confidence in me now shows how i have acted with his property before i have always taken a great deal of pains to use it carefully to bring it back to its place safely to get the water out if there was any in it and leave every thing in order i have done this not only because it is just and right that i should not make him suffer inconvenience on account of his doing me a favor but as a matter of policy  what do you mean by a matter of policy asked marco  why regard to my own interest if i did not do so i should soon make people unwilling to lend me their things and i think there must be some good reason why james is not willing to lend you his knife  why he says answered marco that i dont bring back his things  ah rejoined forester thats it i thought there must be some such reason as that you have lost your character with james and i advise you to acquire a new one as soon as you can besides you have done him injustice this evening you represented him as refusing you his knife because he was unaccommodating and selfish whereas it was only proper regard to the safety of his property what you said was calculated to make an unfavorable impression on my mind against him and one which would have been unjust  marco perceived that it was so and was silent  i am sorry that your knife is rusty resumed forester perhaps i can get it open for you  how asked marco  why i believe the best way is to soak the joint in oil the oil will insinuate itself into the joint and then we can get hold of the blade with a pair of nippers or something of the kind and open it and then by working it to and fro a few times the rust will work out and the knife be as good as it was before if it is very rusty indeed this plan will not answer  what must be done in that case asked marco  the only way then is to carry it to some kind of smith and get him to punch out the rivet then we can take the blade out entirely by this means we can clean it of its rust and then put it in again with a new rivet if you will give me your knife tomorrow i will try to put it in order for you again in one or the other of these ways  and now continued forester after a short pause it is time for me to go down unless you have something which you wish to say  although it was not unusual for forester to close his evening conversation in this manner marcos attention was particularly arrested by the excellent opportunity which this remark afforded him to make his confession he really wished to make itbut he did not know how to begin he wished that his cousin would ask him something about it or introduce the subject in some way or other but forester was silent presently he rose came to marcos bedside and asked him if he was warm enoughfor the nights at this season of the year were beginning to be cool  yes said marco im very comfortable  well then good night so forester took the lamp and walked slowly toward the door  cousin forester said marco  what said forester  dont go just yet  forester turned back and advanced to the foot of the bed there was a high footboard at the foot of the bed and forester leaned upon it with the lamp in his hand  is there any thing that you want to say to me  marco was silent he looked distressed and embarrassed and moved his head restlessly on his pillow  theres something wrong isnt there marco said forester that you are thinking whether to confess to me or not if there is do just as you choose about it i like to have you confess what you have done that is wrong but then if you do it at all it must be done of your own accord  well said marco i want to tell you about my going away to play this forenoon  how long were you gone asked forester  pretty much all the forenoon replied marco  well said forester i am very glad you concluded to confess it of your own accord but i know all about it  marco started up in his bed and looked his cousin in the face and said  why cousin forester how did you know  to prove to you that i really did know i will tell you what you did you got out of the window soon after i went away and went over into mr eldons garden where george eldon and samuel warner were digging worms for bait then you went with them down to the river you hid behind them when you passed in sight of the house for fear that father would see you as he was out in the yard pruning trees then you went down to the river and sat on a log under some bushes fishing after a while you spied an old log canoe drifting down the river and the other boys waded out and got it then you all got into it and paddled about a while and afterward got carried over the rips and upset in the water your cap drifted down the stream and you went after it in the canoe and got it after that you took off your stockings and wrung out the water from them and then came home you got into the study only about a quarter of an hour before i came  marco listened to this minute account of his adventures with eager interest wondering how his cousin could have obtained so early and such complete information after forester had concluded he paused a moment and breathed a long sigh then he laid his head down upon his pillow again saying  well i dont see how you found it out and i am sorry that you did for i meant to have told you all about it myself  marco seemed really disappointed at having lost the opportunity to make his full confession but forester told him that he considered that he had made full confession you made up your mind to do it said he and you did begin and it was the beginning which required all the effort i only refrained from asking you about the details from a wish to show you that i really knew all about it  i dont see how you found it out said marco i suppose it must have been that the boys told you  no replied forester i have not seen either of the boys or heard any thing from them directly or indirectly  then you must have watched me yourself said marco instead of going away  do you think said forester that i would pretend that i was going away and then just go out a little way and lie in wait to watch you  why nosaid marcoi dont really suppose that you would  no said forester i really went away nut of town i went to visit a sick man and help him make his will and i did not return until just before you saw me  then i dont see how you knew said marco  it is of very little consequence to you to know that said forester but i want to ask you a little more about the affair are you willing to answer any question that i may ask  marco said that he was and forester asked him about the circumstances which led him to go away marco explained to him how he saw the boys and what he thought that they were doing and what induced him to go and see them and how he was prevented from coming back as he had intended there was an air of openness and honesty in the manner in which marco related these facts which convinced forester that he was telling the truth  forester was glad to find that it was not a deliberate and preconcerted plan between marco and the other boys to go off on this expedition for bad as it was for marco to allow himself to be drawn away by such temptations it would have been worse or rather it would have indicated a worse state of character if he had deliberately planned such a truancy  well said forester as he was about to close the conversation i am very glad that you concluded to confess your fault i am very glad too that you did not go afishing this afternoon under the sort of permission which i gave you i infer from these two things that you wish to be cured of these faults and to become a boy of firm moral principle now it is a rule with me generally not to punish a boy for what he confesses of his own accord still i think it probable it would be better for you to have some punishment for this it would help to make a strong impression upon your mind and make it much more easy for you to resist such temptations in time to come but you may decide this question yourself if you choose to submit to a punishment and will tell me so tomorrow morning i will think of some suitable one for you if you do not say any thing to me about it i shall not punish you so saying forester bade marco good night  the next morning marco met forester on the stairs as he was coming down to breakfast and told him that he thought he should feel better to be punished so forester reflected upon the subject and at nine oclock when marco went in to commence his studies forester told him that he had concluded upon his punishment  what is it to be said marco  it is for me not to allow you to study replied forester all this forenoon but to require you to sit still at your desk with nothing to do you see it will be a sort of solitary imprisonment only your prison will in itself be a pleasant place  marco thought that this would not be a very severe punishment but he found in enduring it that it was in fact much more severe than he had imagined he got very tired indeed long before the forenoon was out he concluded that solitary imprisonment for years in a gloomy dungeon must be a terrible punishment indeed  a year or two after this time when marco had been entirely cured of all such faults he one day asked forester to explain to him how he knew where he went on this memorable forenoon and forester willingly explained it to him it seems that foresters father though a very gentle and kindhearted man was a very shrewd one and having been accustomed to the discovery in the course of his practice of all sorts of pranks and roguery was less disposed to place confidence in others till he knew the confidence was deserved than forester himself was who had less experience and when he knew that forester had gone away leaving marco alone he doubted a little whether he would remain industriously at his work while he was thinking of this he heard a slight noise which marco made with his feet against the clapboards of the house in getting out the window he therefore came into the study a moment afterward and found that marco had gone he looked out the window and saw him going off toward the other boys just at that moment the man came to help him prune his trees but before he began this work he went into the house to james called him to a window and pointed out marco to him and said  i want you james to follow him and keep in sight of him until he returns but if possible dont let him see you say nothing to me about it but give my son forester an account of all that you observe  james did as he was directed and when forester came back he told him the whole story just before forester went into the study so that forester knew all about it before marco saw him james managed the affair very adroitly for he kept himself entirely out of sight except in one instance and that was when the boys fell into the water he then rushed toward them for fear that they might be drowned but he stopped on the bank when he saw that there was no danger and disappeared again before marco had time to recognize him     chapter ix  boating    the alterations and improvements which forester had ordered in the boat were completed at the time promised marco said that it would require a crew of eight to man the boat properly six oarsmen a bowman and a coxswain marco pronounced this word as if it was spelt coxen this is the proper way to pronounce it it means the one who sits in the stern to steer the boat and direct the rowers in fact the coxswain is the commander of the boats crew  i will be bowman said marco and you can be coxswain and then we shall want six boys for oarsmen  you will have to explain to me then what my duties will be said forester for i dont even know what a coxswain is  why hes the commander said marco he gives all the orders  then you must be coxswain at first said forester for i dont know any thing about it you have got to teach us all after i have learned to manage a boat with six oars manofwar fashion i should like to be coxswain sometimes very much and it seems to me added forester that you and i had better go down first alone until you get me taught and then we can get the boys to come afterward  o no said marco youll all learn easily enough together i can tell you all exactly what to do  forester acceded to this proposal and they made out a list of six boys and forester authorized marco to invite them to come be sure said forester to tell their parents that we are going out in a boat and tell them that i am going too marco did this the boys all gladly accepted the invitation they came first to the house and then proceeded by a path from the foot of the garden which led to the millpond it was about halfpast one when they reached the boat  here there was a great scene of confusion as the boys all commenced talking and asking questions together they found the boat in fine order being perfectly tight and dry and the new seats being all in their places the oars however were not there forester recommended to marco to send a detachment of his men to go to the wagonmakers shop and get them so marco sent off three of the boys calculating very correctly that they could bring two oars apiece before many minutes they returned each of the boys having two oars one on each shoulder  the other boys immediately began to take the oars and they all advanced together toward the boat to get in  stop exclaimed marco stop boys you must not go aboard without an order im coxswain you must wait till i tell you before one of you goes aboard john come out  john who had stepped into the boat came back again on hearing this peremptory order and the boys waited on the bank marco then told them to put the oars in the boys began to pitch them in in confusion some falling upon the thwarts and some into the bottom of the boat  nostop said marco that isnt the way put em in in order  yes put em in order said john lets put em in order  lay em along the thwarts said marco the blades forward  marco explained to the boys how to place the oars they were laid along the middle of the thwarts so as to leave room to sit by the side of them they were placed in such a manner that the handle of one came upon each seat  aboard said marco in a military tone  the boys did not understand that order and of course did not obey it  aboard i say repeated marco when i say aboard you must all get into the boat  with this explanation of the word of command the boys understood what they were to do and got aboard the boat as fast as they could there was much confusion among them in getting their seats several of them began to take up their oars until they were forbidden to do so by marco in a loud voice  you must not touch the oars said he until i say toss then you must take them and toss them right up in the air  how said one of the boys named joseph how marco  this question was scarcely heard amid the confusion  be silent boys dont talk and dont stop to ask how but do just as i tell you  marco was so much accustomed to the idea which sailors attach to the word toss and to the manner in which they perform the evolution that he forgot how many different ways there might be of tossing up an oar the proper way is when the command is given for each oarsman to raise the blade of his oar quick but gently into the air letting the end of the handle rest upon the thwart it is then in a position to be let down into the water conveniently when the next order which is let fall is given  the raising of the oars and then letting them fall all exactly together by the crew of a manofwars boat makes a very pretty spectacle  the boys however knew nothing about this for marco as it was all very plain and familiar to him did not realize the necessity of making very minute explanations to such new recruits as those that were under his command accordingly when the order came to toss some of the boys sat still looking at marco and not knowing what to do others raised their oars into the air some one way and some another and joseph who was a little discomposed by the rebuff he had met with concluded that he would obey as literally as possible let what would come of it and he gave his oar a high toss into the air it fell at a short distance from him into the water went down for a moment out of sight and then shooting out for half its length it fell over upon its side and began to float away  illustration toss  hereupon ensued just such a scene of laughter shouts and confusion as might have been expected all began to shout out exclamations and orders and to give directions how to proceed to recover the lost oar the boys whose oars were still left thrust them confusedly into the water and began pushing poking and paddling with them in order to get the boat out to where josephs oar was floating all this time forester remained on the bank laughing at this specimen of nautical command and subordination  after a time the oar was recovered and marco after much scolding and vociferation got his crew in order again forester said that he would remain where he was on the bank until marco had tried his oarsmen a little so marco went on giving his orders he succeeded finally in getting the boys all in their seats again with their oars in their hands  now boys mind said he and ill tell you exactly what to do attention when i say attention you must all stop talking attention now you mustnt speak a word you must hold your oars out over the water and have them all ready the handles in your hands and when i say give way then you must all begin to row all together exactly so as to keep the stroke you must keep the stroke with the strokeoarsman  but the boys did not know who the strokeoarsman was and they began clamorously to inquire notwithstanding the injunction to silence which they had received marco explained to them that the strokeoarsman was the one who sat nearest to him that is the one farthest aft as the oarsmen were all sitting with their backs toward the bow of the boat their faces were toward the stern and therefore the one who sat farthest aft could be seen by the rest this is the reason why the thwart which is farthest aft is made the seat of the best oarsman and the others are required to make their motions keep time with his for the oars in a boat that is fully manned are so close together that unless they keep time exactly with each other the blades would cross and hit one another in utter confusion but if they keep the stroke as they call it exactly together all goes right for this reason the oarsman who sits aft by whose oar the movements of all the other oars are to be regulated is called the strokeoarsman  the boys however knew nothing of all this marco contented himself with giving one general direction to them to keep the stroke with the strokeoarsman and to begin when he gave the order give way accordingly after all were silent again the oars being extended over the water and forester standing on the bank watching the operation marco called out in the tone of command give way  the boys immediately began to row all looking at the strokeoarsman but failing entirely to keep time with him the oars thumped against each other crossed each other and made all manner of confusion some could not get into the water and others could not get out and josephs oar which somehow or other came out too suddenly while he was pulling hard upon it caused him to pitch backward off his seat and tumble over into the bottom of the boat  illustration bad rowing  oars said marco oars  what marco meant by oars they did not know so they paid no attention to the command but some stopped rowing in despair while others kept on banging the blades of the oars against one another and plashing the water but produced no effect whatever in respect to propelling the boat in the mean time the air was filled with shouts of laughter and loud vociferations  oars exclaimed marco again with the voice of a colonel at the head of his regiment oars why dont you stop when i say oars  the boys began to stop shouting to one another stop stop in a few minutes all was still again the boys began to take their oars in and one of them rose and said  poh this is all nonsense you cant do any thing with oars id rather have one good paddle than all the oars in new york  in fact marco himself began to despair he uttered some impatient exclamations and tried to paddle the boat toward the shore but he found he was almost as awkward in managing a paddle as the other boys were in working oars he succeeded however at last in getting the boat to the shore and then he told the boys that they might as well get out for they could not do any thing at all about rowing  you dont seem to get along very well marco said forester what is the matter  why i havnt got any crew they dont know any thing about it  it seems to me the fault is in the commander said forester  in me said marco why i ordered them right but they wouldnt obey  yes your orders would have been right if you had had a trained crew but you dont manage in the right way to teach raw recruits  i wish you would try then cousin forester said marco  well said forester i have no objection to try boys are you willing to have me for commander  yes sir yes sir said all the boys  i shall be a great deal more strict than marco said forester so i dont expect that you will like me but i will try i dont want quite so many oarsmen to begin with i should rather teach a few at a time are there any of you that would like to come ashore and let the rest practice first  none of the boys moved they all wished to practice first this was just as forester expected  very well said forester i know how i can thin out my crew as fast as i find that you dont obey my orders i shall put you ashore  but suppose we dont understand said one of the boys  i shall explain fully beforehand what you are to do and marco you must observe how i manage and then you will know another time when you have got any thing to teach the art consists in dividing the lesson into a great many very short steps and letting your pupils take one at a time  forester knew nothing about managing a boats crew until that day but he had observed very attentively all the orders which marco had given and noticed their meaning and thus he was prepared to manoeuver the boat as far as marco had gone in giving his orders he accordingly stepped into the boat and took marcos place while marco himself walked forward and took his place at the bow of the boat saying that he was going to be bowman  marco said forester you say that when the order is attention the crew must be silent what is the order when i want to give them liberty to talk again  crew at ease said marco  very well now boys when i say attention you must be still look at me hear all i say and obey the orders as exactly as you can but ask no questions and give me no advice nor speak to one another till i say crew at ease then you can talk again perhaps two or three of you will disobey and i have no objection to that as i should like some excuse for putting some of you ashore  forester smiled as he said this and every boy determined that he would not be the one to be sent ashore  attention said forester  forester then put his paddle into the water and paddled the boat out into the pond a little way while he was doing this there was a dead silence on board the boat not a boy spoke a word and when at last forester stopped paddling the boat floated on a little way gently through the water and not a sound was to be heard except the distant barking of a dog on the opposite shore  crew at ease said forester the boys laughed changed their positions and began to talk  i didnt get any of you ashore then said forester but i shall succeed the next time for i shall watch my opportunity when you are all busy talking and say attention suddenly then you will not all stop in an instant but some will go on just to finish their sentence and this will be disobeying the order and so i shall get you ashore  the boys laughed they thought that it was not very good policy for forester to give them this warning of his intention as it put them all upon their guard presently the word of command came very suddenlyattention every voice was hushed in an instant the boys assumed immediately an erect position and looked directly toward forester  joseph said forester when i give order toss you are to take up your oar and raise the blade into the air and hold it perpendicularly with the end of the handle resting on the thwart by your side on the side of the boat opposite to the one on which you are going to rowtoss  so joseph raised his oar in the manner directed the other boys looking on  let it down again said forester joseph obeyed  crew at ease said forester  forester acted very wisely in not keeping the attention of the crew very long at a time by relieving them very frequently he made the distinction between being under orders and at ease a very marked and striking one so that the boys easily kept it in mind in a few moments he commanded attention again with the same success as before he then ordered another boy to toss his oar then another and so on until he had taught the movement to each one separately he gave to each one such explanations as he needed and when necessary he made them perform the evolution twice so as to be sure that each one understood exactly what was to be done then forester gave the command for them all to toss together and they did so quite successfully the oars rose and stood perpendicularly like so many masts while forester paddled the boat slowly through the water then he directed the boys to let the oars down again gently to their places along the thwarts and put the crew at ease  the boys perceived now that they were making progress they were gaining slowly it is true but surely and marco saw where the cause of his failure was he had not realized how entirely ignorant all these boys were of the whole mystery of managing an oar and of acting in concert and besides he had not had experience enough as a teacher to know how short the steps must be made in teaching any science or art which is entirely new  in the same slow and cautious manner forester taught the boys to let the blades of their oars fall gently into the water at the command let fall he taught one at a time as before each boy dropping the blades into the water and letting the middle of the oar come into the rowlock while he held the handle in his hands ready to row then without letting them row any he ordered them to toss again that is to raise the oars out of the water and hold them in the air with the end of the handle resting upon the thwart he drilled them in this exercise for some time until they could go through it with ease regularity and dispatch he then gave the order crew at ease and let the boys rest themselves and enjoy conversation  while they were resting forester paddled them about the boys asked him when he was going to let them row and forester told them that perhaps they had had drilling enough for one day and if they chose he would not require any thing more of them but would paddle them about and let them amuse themselves but they were all eager to learn to row so forester consented  he taught them the use of the oar in the same slow and cautious manner by which his preceding instructions had been characterized he made one learn at a time explaining to him minutely every motion as each one in turn practiced these instructions the rest looked on observing every thing very attentively so as to be ready when their turn should come at length when they had rowed separately he tried first two and then four and then six together and finally got them so trained that they could keep the stroke very well while they were pulling in this manner the boat would shoot ahead very rapidly when he wanted them to stop he would call out oars this was the order for them to stop rowing after they had finished the stroke which they had commenced and to hold the oars in a horizontal position with the blades just above the water ready to begin again whenever he should give the command  at first the boys were inclined to stop immediately even if they were in the middle of a stroke if they heard the command oars but marco said that this was wrong they must finish the stroke he said if they had commenced it and then all take the oars out of the water regularly together forester was careful too to give the order always between the middle and the end of a stroke so that the obeying of the order came immediately after the issuing of it  by this means forester could stop them in a moment when any thing went wrong he would order give way and then the boys would all begin to pull their oars as soon as any of them lost the stroke or whenever any oars began to interfere or any other difficulty or accident occurred he would immediately give the order oars this would instantly arrest the rowing before the difficulty became serious then after a moments pause he would say give way again when they would once more begin rowing all together all this time he sat in the stern and steered the boat wherever they wanted to go  illustration good rowing  marco wished to have forester teach the boys how to back water and to trail oars and to put the oars apeak and to perform various other evolutions but forester was very slow in going on to new manoeuvers before the old ones were made perfectly familiar he accordingly spent nearly an hour in rowing about the pond up and down to make the boys familiar with the stroke he found as is in fact universally the case with beginners in the art of rowing that they were very prone to row faster and faster that is to accelerate their strokes instead of rowing regularly keeping continually the same time they gradually improved however in respect to this fault and by the middle of the afternoon marco began to think that they were quite a good crew they practiced several new evolutions during the latter part of the afternoon and just before tea time they all went home much pleased with the afternoons enjoyment and with the new knowledge and skill which they had acquired they also planned another excursion the following week     chapter x  an expedition    forester and marco got their boats crew well trained in the course of a week or two and one pleasant day in september they planned a long expedition in their boat the boys collected at the house of the owner of the boat at one oclock two of them carried a large basket which forester had provided it was quite heavy and they did not know what was in it but they supposed that it was a store of some sort of provisions for a supper in case they should be gone so long as to need a supper forester carried a hatchet also  at the proper word of command the boys got into the boat and took their several stations marco took his place forward to act as bowman it is the duty of the bowman to keep a lookout forward that the boat does not run into any danger and also when the boat comes to land to step out first and hold it by the painter that is the rope which is fastened to the bow while the others get out marco had a pole with an iron spike and also an iron hook in the end of it which he used to fend off with as they called it when the boat was in danger of running against any obstacle this was called a boathook  attention said forester when the boys were all seated  toss  hereupon the boys raised the oars into the air ready to let them down into the water  let fall said forester the oars all fell gently and together into their places  give way said forester  the boat began immediately to glide rapidly over the water under the impulse which the boys gave it in rowing crew at ease said forester  so the boys went on rowing but understood that they had liberty to talk one of them wished to know where forester was going with them but forester said it was entirely contrary to the discipline aboard a manofwar for the crew to ask the captain where they were going besides said forester though i could easily tell you i think you will enjoy the expedition more to know nothing about it beforehand but to take every thing as it comes  forester steered in such a manner as to put the head of the boat toward a bank at some distance from where they started on which there was a thick forest of firs and other evergreens growing near the water when they got pretty near the land he gave the order for attention that they might observe silence in going through whatever manoeuvers were required here the next order was oars at this the oarsmen stopped rowing and held their oars horizontally over the water the boat in the mean time was gliding on toward the shore  aboard said forester  the crew then gently raised their oars into the air and passed them over their heads into the boat laying them upon the thwarts in their proper position along the middle of the boat by this order the crew supposed that forester was going to land  bear a hand mr bowman said forester and fend off from the shore  forester by means of his paddle had steered the boat up to a log which lay in the edge of the water and marco at first fending off from the log to keep the boat from striking hard and then holding on to it with his hook got it into a good position for landing and held it securely  crew ashore said forester  the crew who had learned all these orders in the course of the repeated instructions which forester and marco had given them began to rise and to walk toward the bow of the boat and to go ashore marco landed first and held the boat with his boathook while the rest got out forester then ordered marco to make the boat fast until they were ready to embark again  forester then went up in the woods a little way with his hatchet in his hand and began to look about among the trees finally he selected a small tree with a round straight stem and began to cut it down the boys gathered around him wondering what it could be for forester smiled and worked on in silence declining to answer any of their questions marco said it was for a mast he knew but when they asked him where the sail was he seemed perplexed and could not answer  as soon however as the tree was cut down it was evident that it was not intended to be used as a mast for forester began at once to cut it up into lengths of about two feet long what could be his design the boys were utterly unable to imagine he said nothing but ordered the boys to take these lengths one by one and put them into the boat there were five in all then he ordered the crew on board again marco got in last when all were seated the order was given to shove off the oars were tossedthen let fall into the water he ordered them to back water first by which manoeuver the boat was backed off from the land into deep water then he commanded them to give way and at the same time bringing the stern of the boat round by his paddle the boat was made to shoot swiftly down the stream  the boat went rapidly forward along the shores of the pond and presently on coming round a wooded point the mills appeared in sight as they approached the mills they kept pretty near the shore and at length landed just above the dam  forester ordered the crew ashore at a place where there was a road leading down to the waters edge this road was made by the teams which came down to get logs and lumber from the water at foresters direction the boys drew the bow of the boat up a little way upon the land then he ordered the boys to take out the pieces of the stem of the little tree and he placed one of them under the bow as a roller the boys then took hold of the sides of the boat three on each side each boy opposite to his own rowlock while marco stood ready to put under another roller the ascent was very gradual so that the boat moved up easily and the boys were very much surprised and delighted to see their boat thus running up upon the land  it seemed to them an exercise of great power to be able to take so large a boat so easily and rapidly up such an ascent upon the land they were aided to do it by two principles one was the combination of their strength in one united effort and the other was the influence of the rollers in preventing the friction of the bottom of the boat upon the ground  presently the whole length of the boat was out of water and resting on four rollers which marco had put under it one by one as it had advanced forester would then call out ahead with her when the boys would move about two steps then forester would give the command hold on and they would stop by this time one of the rollers would come out behind and marco would take it up and carry it round forward and place it under the bow and forester would then say ahead with her again and the boat would immediately advance again up the acclivity  illustration the portage  in a very few minutes the boat was thus rolled up into a sort of a road where the way was level here it went very easily presently it began to descend and soon the boys saw that forester was taking a sort of path which led by a gentle slope down to the water immediately below the mill they were very much pleased at this for as they had had a great many excursions already on the millpond they had become familiar with it in all its parts and they were much animated at the idea of exploring new regions in going down to the water on the lower side of the mill they had of course no exertion to make to draw the boat as its own weight was more than sufficient to carry it down upon the rollers they only had to hold it back to prevent its running down too fast and to keep it properly guided  it goes down pretty easy said marco but i dont see how you are ever going to get it back again  it was in fact a long and rather steep descent the boys thought that it would require far more strength than they could exercise to bring the boat up such an inclination forester told them not to fear he said that a good commander never put too much upon his men or voluntarily got them into any difficulty without planning beforehand a way to get out  they soon got down to the waters edge again here instead of the broad and smooth pond which they had above the dam they found a stream eddying and foaming and flowing rapidly down between rocks and logs there was a bridge across the stream too a short distance below the boys were a little inclined to be afraid to embark in what appeared to be a rather dangerous navigation but they had confidence in forester and so they readily obeyed when forester ordered the crew aboard  now mr bowman said forester keep a sharp lookout ahead for rocks and snags and fend off well when there is any danger  so marco kneeled upon a small seat at the bow of the boat and looked into the water before him while forester propelled and guided the boat with his paddle they advanced slowly and by a very tortuous course so as to avoid the rocks and shallows and at length just above the bridge they came to a wider and smoother passage of water and here forester ordered the oars out there was only room for them to take four or five strokes before they came to the bridge and under the bridge there was only a very narrow passage where they could go through this passage was between one of the piers and a gravel bed as they advanced toward it forester called out give way strong and all the boys pulled their oars with all their strength without however accelerating the strokes this gave the boat a rapid headway and then forester gave the order to trail when the boys simultaneously lifted the oars out of the rowlocks and let them drift in the water alongside of the boat as the boat was advancing very swiftly the oars were immediately swept in close to her sides and thus were out of the way and the boat glided safely and swiftly through the passage and emerged into a broader sheet of smooth water beyond  recover said forester the boys then by a peculiar manoeuver which they had learned by much practice brought back their oars into the rowlocks and raised the blades out of the water so as to get them into a position for rowing give way said forester and immediately they were all in motion the boat gliding swiftly down the stream  after they had gone on in this way a few minutes forester ordered the oars apeak and put the crew at ease when the oars are apeak they are drawn in a little way so that the handle of each oar may be passed under a sort of cleat or ledge which runs along on the inside of the boat near the upper edge of it this keeps the oar firm in its place without the necessity of holding it the handle being under this cleat while the middle of the oar rests in the rowlock thus the oarsmen are relieved from the necessity of holding their oars and yet the oars are all ready to be seized again in a moment whenever it becomes desirable to commence rowing  meantime the boat slowly drifted down the stream the water was here deep and comparatively still and the boys amused themselves with looking over the sides into the depths of the water they glided noiselessly along over various objectsnow a great flat rock now a sunken tree and now a bed of yellow sand every now and then forester would order the oars out and make the oarsmen give way for a few strokes so as to give the boat what they called steerage way that is way through the water so that holding the paddle in one position or the other would steer it in this way forester guided the boat in the right direction keeping it pretty near the middle of the stream  this millstream as has already been stated emptied into the river and the boat was now rapidly approaching the place of junction in a few minutes more the river came into view the boys could see it at some distance before them running with great rapidity by a rocky point of land which formed one side of the mouth of the brook  now boys said forester is it safe for us to go out into that current  yes said marco by all meanslet us go  perhaps we shall upset in the rips said some of the boys  no matter if we do said marco it is not deep in the rips and of course there is no danger  that is in our favor certainly said forester whenever the current sets strong there it is sure to be shallow so that if we upset we should not be drowned and where it is deep so as to make it dangerous for us to get in it is always still and thus there is no danger of upsetting  what is the reason of that said one of the boys  the reason is given in this way said forester in the college mathematics the velocity of a stream is inversely as the area of the section  the boys did not understand such mathematical phraseology as this and so forester clothed his explanation in different language he said that where the stream was shallow or narrow the current must be more rapid in order to get all the water through in so small a space but where it is deep it may move slowly  forester landed his crew upon the rocky point where they had a very pleasant view up and down the river he proposed to them to have their luncheon there and to this they agreed so they went back to the edge of the rocks where there was a little grove of trees and they sat down upon a log which had been worn smooth by the action of the water in floods and bleached by the sun  there were plenty of dry sticks and slabs lying about upon the shore which forester ordered the crew to collect in order to build a fire it was not cold and they had no need of a fire for any purposes of cooking but a fire would look cheerful and pleasant and they accordingly made one forester had some matches in his pocket two of the crew brought the basket from the boat and when they had opened it they found an abundant store of provisions there was a dozen or more of round cakes and a large applepie which as there were just eight of them gave fortyfive degrees to each one there was also a jug of milk and a silver mug which foresters mother had lent them for the excursion to drink out of  the boys whose appetites had been sharpened by their exertions in the portage of the boat round the falls and in rowing did not cease to eat until the provisions were entirely exhausted and then they carried the empty basket back to the boat soon after this forester summoned what he called a council of war to consider the question whether they had better go down the river he said he wanted their true and deliberate judgment in the case he did not wish them to say what they would like merely but what they thought on the whole was best he told them that he should not be governed by their advice but after hearing all that they had to say he should act according to his own judgment  then whats the use of asking us at all said marco  why what you will say may modify my judgment i did not say that i shall decide according to my judgment as it is now but as it will be after i have heard what you will have to say i shall be influenced perhaps by your reasons but i shall decide myself that is the theory of a council of war the commander may be influenced by the arguments of his subalterns but he is not governed by their votes  forester then called upon each of the boys in succession to give his opinion on the point marco was in favor of going down the river but all the rest though they said that they should like to go very much thought it would not answer as it would be almost impossible to get the boat up again over the rips after the consultation was concluded forester said well boys you have all given wise opinions except marco and his is not wise now well go aboard the boat  crew aboard said forester the other orders followed in rapid succession attention toss let fall backwater oars give way the boys considered it settled on hearing what forester had said of the wisdom of their several opinions that they were now going back toward the mill but how they were going to get the boat back above the dam they did not know though they did not doubt that forester had some good plan which he had not explained to them instead however of turning the head of the boat up the stream forester pointed it toward the river they supposed that he was going out to the edge of the river and that then he would turn and come back but to their utter amazement he pushed boldly on directly into the current and then putting his helm hard up and calling out to the crew to give way strong the boat swept round into the very center of the stream and shot down the river over the rips like an arrow  illustration the expedition  give way boys hearty said forester give way strong  the boys pulled with all their strength and the boat went swifter and swifter forester kept it in the middle of the current where the water was deepest though even here it was very shallow marco in the mean time who was stationed at the bows kept a sharp lookout forward and gave forester notice of any impending danger they soon got through the rips and came to the deep and still water below where the current was gentle and the surface smooth here forester ordered the oars apeak and the crew at ease  we never shall get back in the world said one of the boys forty men couldnt row the boat up those rips  let us try said forester so he ordered the oars out again and put the boat under way he brought her head round so as to point up stream and calling upon the crew to give way strong he forced her back into the rapid water they went on a few rods but long before they reached the most rapid part they found that with all their exertions they could make no progress the boat seemed stationary oars said forester the boys stopped rowing holding their oars in the air just above the water forester then by means of his paddle turned the boat round again saying well if we cant go up we can go down stream he then ordered the crew to give way again and they began to glide along swiftly down the river  the boys wondered how forester was going to get back but he told them to give themselves no concern on that score that responsibility rests on me said he  but how came you to come down here said marco when you said my advice wasnt good  i said your opinion was not wise the boys who advised me not to come were wiser than you they gave better advice so far as they and you understood the case but i know something which you do not as is usual with commandersand therefore i came down in view of all that you know it would have been wisest to have gone back but in view of all that i know it is wisest to come down  the curiosity of the boys was very much excited to know what it could be that forester knew which rendered coming down the river wise but forester would make no explanations he said that commanders were not generally very communicative to their crews in the mean time the boat went on sometimes shooting swiftly through the rapids and sometimes floating in a more calm and quiet manner on the surface of the stiller water in this way they went on more than a mile enjoying the voyage very highly and admiring the varied scenery which was presented to their view at every turn of the stream  at one place the boys landed upon a small sandy beach under some overhanging rocks they amused themselves in climbing about the rocks for a time and then they were ordered aboard again and sailed on  now it happened that the river in the part of its course over which this voyage had been performed took a great circuit and though they had followed its course for more than a mile they were now drawing near to a place which was not very far from foresters fathers housebeing about as much below it as the place where the boat belonged in the millpond was above it as they approached the point where the river turned again marco who was looking out before saw a sort of landing where there was a man standing together with a yoke of oxen it was just sunset when they approached this spot when they arrived at it the whole mystery was explained for they found that the man was james who lived at foresters fathers and the oxen were his fathers oxen james had come down under an appointment which forester had secretly made with him with the oxen and a drag and by means of them he hauled the boat across to the millpond again by a back road which led directly across the pastures and lanched it safely again into the water close to the dwelling of its owner so the boys had as it were the pleasure of sliding down hill without the labor of drawing their sleds up again  illustration the drag  marco was very much pleased with this expedition forester told him when they got home that the indians often carried their canoes around falls or from one river to another and that such carryingplaces were called portages     chapter xi  lost in the woods    while marco paul was in vermont he and forester had a remarkable adventure in the woods they got lost in fact and for a time it seemed quite doubtful how they were ever to find their way home it happened thus  one morning in the fall of the year marco walking along toward the barn with james asked james what he was going to do that day  i expect that i am going to gather apples said james  well said marco are you going in the cart  yes said james  and may i go with you asked marco  yes said james  and help gather the apples said marco  yes said james  and drive the oxen a little way asked marco  yes said james  well said marco i will run and get my goadstick  marco went toward the house intending to go in and get his goadstick on his way he met his uncle his uncle asked him whether james was out in the barn marco said that he was and his uncle then asked him to go and request james to come to him marco did so and he and james then came along toward the house together  marcos uncle stood upon the step of the door  james said he i was thinking that we ought to send for the horsesand the apples ought to be gathered too which is it best to do  i hardly know sir said james it is high time that the apples were gathered and yet we promised to send for the horses today  i can go and get the horses said marcojust as well as not where is it  oh no said his uncle it is ten or fifteen miles from here isnt it james  yes said james by the road i suppose it is about four miles through the woods i was intending to walk there through the woods and then to come home round by the road it is rather a rough road for horses through the woods  let cousin forester and me go said marco i will go and ask him  so marco went and found forester when forester heard of the plan he was quite inclined to accede to it he had been much engaged in studying for some time and had had very little exercise and recreation so that he was easily persuaded to undertake an expedition the plan was all soon agreed upon the horses had been put out to pasture at a farmers up the river about twelve miles in going that twelve miles the river took a great turn so that in fact the farm where the horses were pastured was not in a straight line more than four miles from mr foresters house but the intermediate country was a desolate and almost impassable region of forests and mountains there was indeed a sort of footpath by which it was possible for men to get through but this path was dangerous and in fact almost impracticable for horses so james had formed the plan of walking through the woods by the path and then of coming home by the road riding one of the horses and leading the other  forester and marco concluded to adopt the same plan except that in coming home there would be just a horse apiece for them to ride they put up some provisions to eat on the way packing them in marcos knapsack the knapsack when it was ready was strapped upon marcos back for he insisted on carrying it forester consented to this arrangement secretly intending however not to allow marco to carry the load very far  forester asked james if there would be any difficulty about the way james said that there would not be the path though it was not an easy one to travel was very easy to find  you go on said he along the back road about three quarters of a mile and then you will come to a small schoolhouse on the left hand side of the road on a sort of hill it is in the jones district  what sort of a schoolhouse is it asked forester  it is a small schoolhouse with a little cupola upon the top of it said james for a bell it stands upon a knoll by the side of the road just beyond it the main road turns to the right and there is a narrower road leading off to the left through a gate you must go through that gate and then follow the path into the woods  we can find it i think said forester  yes said marco i know the place very well  forester said he thought that they should find the way without any difficulty and so bidding his uncle and aunt goodbye he and marco set out  they went through the garden and from the garden they passed out through a small gate into the orchard marco wished to go this way in order to get some apples he chose two from off his favorite tree and put them into the knapsack and took another in his hand to eat by the way forester did the same only he put the two that he carried with him into his pockets  from the orchard the travelers walked across a field and down into the glen and after crossing a brook upon some steppingstones they ascended upon the other side and presently climbing over a fence they came out into what james had called the back road they walked along upon this road for about three quarters of a mile until at last they came in sight of the schoolhouse marco spied it first  there said marco that is the schoolhouse  how do you know that that is the one asked forester  oh i know the jones district very well said marco  in new england the tract of country included within the jurisdiction of a town is divided into districts for the establishment and support of schools these districts are called schooldistricts and each one is generally named from some of the principal families that happen to live in it it happened that there were several families of the name of jones that lived in this part of the town and so their district was called the jones district  how do you happen to know it said forester  oh i came out here two or three times with thomas jones to set my squirrel trap said marco there goes thomas jones now  where asked forester  there said marco pointing along the road a little way  forester looked forward and saw in the road before them a boy walking toward the schoolhouse with his slate under his arm beyond the boy upon the knoll on the left side of the road was the schoolhouse itself  illustration the schoolhouse  the schoolhouse was not far from the road and there was a little grove of trees behind it beyond the schoolhouse and almost directly before them marco and forester saw the road turning a little to the left toward the gate  there is the gate said marco that we are to go through  yes said forester that must be the one  forester and marco walked on until they came to the schoolhouse thomas got to the schoolhouse before them and went in forester and marco passed on and went through the gate they then went on beyond the gate a little way till they came to a pair of bars marco took down all but the topmost bar and forester stooping down passed under marco attempted to do the same but forgetting that he had a knapsack upon his back he did not stoop low enough and gave his knapsack such a knock as almost threw him down fortunately there was nothing frangible inside and so no damage was done one of his apples was mellowed a little that was all  the path led the travelers first across a rough and rocky pasture and then it suddenly entered a wood where every thing wore an expression of wild and solemn grandeur the trees were very lofty and consisted of tall stems rising to a vast height and surmounted above with a tuft of branches which together formed a broad canopy over the heads of the travelers and produced a sort of somber twilight below birds sang in plaintive notes on the tops of distant trees and now and then a squirrel was seen running along the ground or climbing up the trunk of some vast hemlock or pine  i hope that we shall not lose our way in these woods said forester  oh there is no danger of that rejoined marco the path is very plain  it seems plain here said forester and i presume that there can not be any danger or james would have recommended to us to go the other way  we shall come home the other way said marco i wonder if there are any saddles twelve miles would be too far to ride bareback  yes said forester there are saddles i asked james about that  the path which forester and marco were pursuing soon began to ascend it ascended at first gradually and afterward more and more precipitously and at length began to wind about among rocks and precipices in such a manner that marco said he did not wonder at all that james said it would be a rough road for horses  i think it is a very rough road for boys said forester  boys repeated marco do you call yourself boys  for men then said forester  but i am not a man said marco  then i dont see how i can express my idea said forester  marcos attention was here diverted from the rhetorical difficulty in which forester had become involved by a very deep chasm upon one side of the path he went to the brink of it and could hear the roaring of a torrent far below  i mean to throw a stone down said marco he accordingly after looking around for a moment found a stone about as large as his head this stone he contrived to bring to the edge of the precipice and then to throw it over it went thundering down among the rocks and trees below while marco stood upon the brink and listened to the sound of the echoes and reverberations he then got another stone larger than the first and threw that down after which he and forester resumed their journey  the path though it was a very rough and tortuous one was pretty plain and it is probable that the travelers would have found no difficulty in following it to the end of their route had it not been for an occurrence which they had not at all anticipated but which was one nevertheless that has often taken place to confuse the steps of mountain travelers and make them lose their way this occurrence was a fall of snow  it was not late enough in the year for snow upon the lowlands but snow falls very early in the autumn upon the summits of mountains marco and forester had not anticipated stormy weather of any kind when they left home for the wind was west and the sky was clear when however they had accomplished about one half of their journey large masses of fleecy clouds began to drive over the mountains and presently all at once it began to snow marco was extremely delighted to see the snow falling forester was not so much pleased on the other hand he looked somewhat concerned he did not at first think how the snow could do them any serious injury but he seemed to have an undefined sense of danger from it and appeared uneasy they both however walked on  the region through which the path led at the time when the snow came on was a tract of flat land on the summit of the mountainous range with small and scattered trees here and there upon it the best thing probably for the travelers to have done in the emergency would have been to have turned round the moment it began to snow and go back as fast as possible by the way that they came as long as they were sure of the path and then to wait until the fallen snow had melted if they found then that the snow did not melt so that they could see the path again it would be better to return altogether as their chance of being able to follow the path back toward their home would be much greater than that of pursuing it forward for they might expect to find some guidance in going back by their recognition of the place which they had passed in ascending  forester however did not happen to think of this and so when it began to snow his only immediate desire was to go forward as fast as possible so as to get into the woods again where he and marco would be in some measure under shelter  marco finding that forester appeared somewhat anxious began to feel some sentiment of fear himself  who would have thought said he that we should have got caught out in this snowstorm  oh it is not a snowstorm replied forester it is only a little snow flurry it will be over in a few minutes  how do you know that it is not going to be a snowstorm asked marco  because storms never come out of the west replied forester  it snowed however faster and faster and the ground soon began to be entirely whitened forester pressed on but he soon found himself at a loss for his way the air was so filled with the descending flakes that he could see only a very short distance before him the view of the forests and mountains was cut off on every side and nothing presented itself to the eye but the dim forms of the rocks and trees which were near these too were indistinct and shapeless the ground was soon entirely covered and all hope of finding the path entirely disappeared forester went back then a short distance endeavoring to retrace his steps he followed the footprints a little way but all traces of them were soon obliterated when he found that the steps could no longer be seen he went toward a tree which he saw rising dimly at a little distance before him the tree proved to be a large hemlock with widespreading branches there was a place under this tree where the ground was bare having been sheltered from the snow by the branches of the tree there were some rocks too lying under this tree forester walked up to them and sat down marco followed his example  well marco said forester we are really lost  and what are we going to do asked marco with a countenance of great concern  the first thing is said forester to open the knapsack and see what there is inside that is good to eat  so forester took the knapsack off from his shouldersfor he had taken it from marco some time before and laying it upon a large flat stone by his side he began to open it and to take out the provisions  forester was afraid that he and marco had got themselves into somewhat serious difficulty but he wished to teach marco that in emergencies of such a nature it would do no good to give way to a panic or to unnecessary anxiety so he assumed an unconcerned and contented air and made arrangements for the luncheon just as if they had stopped there to eat it of their own accord and without being in any difficulty whatever about the prosecution of the journey  marco however seemed to be quite uneasy  what are we going to do said he if we get lost in this snowstorm we shall have to stay in the woods perhaps all night  yes said forester that we can do we have done that before  forester here alluded to an occasion on which he and marco had spent the night in a hut in the woods when traveling in maine  but we had an axe then said marco to make a camp  yes replied forester that is true i dont think however that we shall have to stay in the woods all night now we have three chances for avoiding it  what are the three said marco  why in the first place replied forester we can stay where we are until it stops snowingin fact it has almost stopped now then i presume that the sun will come out and in half an hour melt away all the snow then we can find our path again and go on  but i dont think it is certain that we can find our path again said marco  nor do i said forester but theres a chance of it i did not say that we had three certainties but three chances  well said marco go on what are the other two  if we can not find the path said forester either because the snow does not melt or for any other reason then we can remain where we are until night and the people finding that we do not come home will send up for us  and how can they find us asked marco  why they will come up the path of course and we can not be very far from the path for we only lost it a few minutes before we came here of course they will come up very near to this placeand they will come shouting out every few minutes as loud as they can and so we shall hear them  yes said marco i see that is a pretty good chance  the third chance for us said forester is to go down into the first glen or valley that we can find and then we shall probably come to a stream then we can follow the stream down to the river  how do you know that it goes to the river asked marco  all mountain streams do of course said forester they go down wherever they can find a valley or a hollowjoining together and taking in branches as they proceeduntil they get down into the level country and then they flow to the nearest river and so to the sea now i know that the river takes a bend around this mountainous tract and almost surrounds it and all the streams from it must flow into the river without going very far we could follow one down though we should probably find the way very rough and difficult  let us try it said marco  this plan was decided upon and so when the snow squall was entirely over and the sun had come out marco and forester taking their departure from the great tree and guiding their course by the sun the travelers set out proceeding as nearly in a straight line as possible intending to go on in that manner until they should come to some stream and then to follow the stream down to the river the plan succeeded perfectly well they soon descended into a valley where they found a little brook flowing over a bed of mosscovered stones they followed this brook down for about a mile when they came to a junction between the brook that they were following and another one after this junction of course the stream was larger and in many places they found it difficult to get along the way was encumbered with bushes rocks and fallen trees and in one place the stream flowed in a foaming torrent through the bottom of a deep chasm with sides rising directly out of the water here the travelers were obliged to find a way at a distance from the brookguiding themselves however by the sound of its roaring after passing the chasm they got back to the stream again  they came out into the open country about one oclock and found to their great joy that they were very near the place where the horses were pastured the horses were all ready for them and forester and marco mounted them immediately and set out on their return home  it was very pleasant riding along at their ease on horseback after all the dangers and fatigues that they had encountered a part of the way the road which they took lay along the shore of the river marco enjoyed this part of the ride very much indeed  they reached home about sunset with an excellent appetite for supper marco was very enthusiastic in his manner of giving his aunt forester an account of his adventures and he said in conclusion that he would just as lief get lost in the woods as not it was good fun
