26766507	ships company  by ww jacobs    the old man of the sea   what i want you to do said mr george wright as he leaned towards the old sailor is to be an uncle to me  aye aye said the mystified mr kemp pausing with a mug of beer midway to his lips  a rich uncle continued the young man lowering his voice to prevent any keen ears in the next bar from acquiring useless knowledge  an uncle from new zealand who is going to leave me all is money  wheres it coming from  demanded mr kemp with a little excitement  it aint coming was the reply  youve only got to say youve got it fact of the matter is ive got my eye on a young lady theres another chap after er too and if she thought id got a rich uncle it might make all the difference  she knows i ad an uncle that went to new zealand and was never heard of since  thats what made me think of it  mr kemp drank his beer in thoughtful silence  how can i be a rich uncle without any brass  he inquired at length  i should ave to lend you somea little said mr wright  illustration what i want you to do said mr george wright is to be an uncle to me  the old man pondered  ive had money lent me before he said candidly but i cant call to mind ever paying it back  i always meant to but thats as far as it got  it dont matter said the other  itll only be for a little while and then youll ave a letter calling you back to new zealand  see  and youll go back promising to come home in a years time after youve wound up your business and leave us all your money  see  mr kemp scratched the back of his neck  but shes sure to find it out in time he objected  praps said mr wright  and praps not  therell be plenty of time for me to get married before she does and you could write back and say you had got married yourself or given your money to a hospital  he ordered some more beer for mr kemp and in a low voice gave him as much of the family history as he considered necessary  ive only known you for about ten days he concluded but id sooner trust you than people ive known for years  i took a fancy to you the moment i set eyes on you rejoined mr kemp youre the living image of a young fellow that lent me five pounds once and was drowned afore my eyes the week after  he ad a bit of a squint and i spose thats how he came to fall overboard  he emptied his mug and then accompanied by mr wright fetched his sea chest from the boardinghouse where he was staying and took it to the young mans lodgings  fortunately for the latters pocket the chest contained a good best suit and boots and the only expenses incurred were for a large soft felt hat and a gilded watch and chain  dressed in his best with a bulging pocketbook in his breastpocket he set out with mr wright on the following evening to make his first call  mr wright who was also in his best clothes led the way to a small tobacconists in a side street off the mile end road and raising his hat with some ceremony shook hands with a goodlooking young woman who stood behind the counter mr kemp adopting an air of scornful dignity intended to indicate the possession of great wealth waited  this is my uncle said mr wright speaking rapidly from new zealand the one i spoke to you about  he turned up last night and you might have knocked me down with a feather  the last person in the world i expected to see  mr kemp in a good rolling voice said good evening miss i hope you are well and subsiding into a chair asked for a cigar  his surprise when he found that the best cigar they stocked only cost sixpence almost assumed the dimensions of a grievance  itll do to go on with he said smelling it suspiciously  have you got change for a fiftypound note  miss bradshaw concealing her surprise by an effort said that she would see and was scanning the contents of a drawer when mr kemp in some haste discovered a few odd sovereigns in his waistcoatpocket  five minutes later he was sitting in the little room behind the shop holding forth to an admiring audience  so far as i know he said in reply to a question of mrs bradshaws george is the only relation ive got  him and me are quite alone and i can tell you i was glad to find him  mrs bradshaw sighed  its a pity you are so far apart she said  its not for long said mr kemp  im just going back for about a year to wind up things out there and then im coming back to leave my old bones over here  george has very kindly offered to let me live with him  he wont suffer for it ill be bound said mrs bradshaw archly  so far as money goes he wont said the old man  not that that would make any difference to george  it would be the same to me if you hadnt got a farthing said mr wright promptly  illustration itll do to go on with he said  mr kemp somewhat affected shook hands with him and leaning back in the most comfortable chair in the room described his life and struggles in new zealand  hard work teetotalism and the simple life combined appeared to be responsible for a fortune which he affected to be too old to enjoy  misunderstandings of a painful nature were avoided by a timely admission that under medical advice he was now taking a fair amount of stimulant  illustration ow much did you say youd got in the bank  mind he said as he walked home with the elated george its your game not mine and its sure to come a bit expensive  i cant be a rich uncle without spending a bit  ow much did you say youd got in the bank  we must be as careful as we can said mr wright hastily  one thing is they cant leave the shop to go out much  its a very good little business and it ought to be all right for me and bella one of these days eh  mr kemp prompted by a nudge in the ribs assented  its wonderful how they took it all in about me he said but i feel certain in my own mind that i ought to chuck some money about  tell em of the money you have chucked about said mr wright  itll do just as well and come a good deal cheaper  and you had better go round alone tomorrow evening  itll look better  just go in for another one of their sixpenny cigars  mr kemp obeyed and the following evening after sitting a little while chatting in the shop was invited into the parlour where mindful of mr wrights instructions he held his listeners enthralled by tales of past expenditure  a tip of fifty pounds to his bedroom steward coming over was characterized by mrs bradshaw as extravagant  seems to be going all right said mr wright as the old man made his report but be careful dont go overdoing it  mr kemp nodded  i can turn em round my little finger he said youll have bella all to yourself tomorrow evening  mr wright flushed  how did you manage that  he inquired  its the first time she has ever been out with me alone  she aint coming out said mr kemp  shes going to stay at home and mind the shop its the mother whats coming out  going to spend the evening with me  mr wright frowned  what did you do that for  he demanded hotly  i didnt do it said mr kemp equably they done it  the old lady says that just for once in her life she wants to see how it feels to spend money like water  imoney like wateri  repeated the horrified mr wright  money like ill money herill  it dont matter to me said mr kemp  i can have a headache or a chill or something of that sort if you like  i dont want to go  its no pleasure to me  what will it cost  demanded mr wright pacing up and down the room  the rich uncle made a calculation  she wants to go to a place called the empire he said slowly and have something for supper and thered be cabs and things  i dessay it would cost a couple o pounds and it might be more  but id just as soon ave a chilljust  mr wright groaned and after talking of mrs bradshaw as though she were already his motherinlaw produced the money  his instructions as to economy lasted almost up to the moment when he stood with bella outside the shop on the following evening and watched the couple go off  its wonderful how well they get on together said bella as they reentered the shop and passed into the parlour  ive never seen mother take to anybody so quick as she has to him  i hope you like him too said mr wright  hes a dear said bella  fancy having all that money  i wonder what it feels like  i suppose i shall know some day said the young man slowly but it wont be much good to me unless  unless  said bella after a pause  unless it gives me what i want replied the other  id sooner be a poor man and married to the girl i love than a millionaire  miss bradshaw stole an uneasy glance at his somewhat sallow features and became thoughtful  its no good having diamonds and motorcars and that sort of thing unless you have somebody to share them with pursued mr wright  miss bradshaws eyes sparkled and at that moment the shopbell tinkled and a lively whistle sounded  she rose and went into the shop and mr wright settled back in his chair and scowled darkly as he saw the intruder  good evening said the latter  i want a sixpenny smoke for twopence please  how are we this evening  sitting up and taking nourishment  miss bradshaw told him to behave himself  always do said the young man  thats why i can never get anybody to play with  i had such an awful dream about you last night that i couldnt rest till i saw you  awful it was  what was it  inquired miss bradshaw  dreamt you were married said mr hills smiling at her  miss bradshaw tossed her head  who to pray  she inquired  me said mr hills simply  i woke up in a cold perspiration halloa is that georgie in there  how are you george  better  im all right said mr wright with dignity as the other hooked the door open with his stick and nodded at him  well why dont you look it  demanded the lively mr hills  have you got your feet wet or what  oh be quiet said miss bradshaw smiling at him  righto said mr hills dropping into a chair by the counter and caressing his moustache  but you wouldnt speak to me like that if you knew what a terrible day ive had  what have you been doing  asked the girl  working said the other with a huge sigh  wheres the millionaire i came round on purpose to have a look at him  him and mother have gone to the empire  said miss bradshaw  mr hills gave three long penetrating whistles and then placing his cigar with great care on the counter hid his face in a huge handkerchief  miss bradshaw glanced from him to the frowning mr wright and then entering the parlour closed the door with a bang  mr hills took the hint and with a somewhat thoughtful grin departed  he came in next evening for another cigar and heard all that there was to hear about the empire  mrs bradshaw would have treated him but coldly but the innocent mr kemp charmed by his manner paid him great attention  hes just like what i was at his age he said  lively  im not a patch on you said mr hills edging his way by slow degrees into the parlour  i dont take young ladies to the empire  were you telling me you came over here to get married or did i dream it  ark at him said the blushing mr kemp as mrs bradshaw shook her head at the offender and told him to behave himself  hes a man any woman might be happy with said mr hills  he never knows how much there is in his trouserspocket  fancy sewing on buttons for a man like that  goldmining aint in it  mrs bradshaw shook her head at him again and mr hills after apologizing to her for revealing her innermost thoughts before the most guileless of men began to question mr kemp as to the prospects of a bright and energetic young man with a distaste for work in new zealand the audience listened with keen attention to the replies the only disturbing factor being a cough of mr wrights which became more and more troublesome as the evening wore on  by the time uncle and nephew rose to depart the latter was so hoarse that he could scarcely speak  why didnt you tell em you had got a letter calling you home as i told you  he vociferated as soon as they were clear of the shop  ii forgot it said the old man  forgot it  repeated the incensed mr wright  what did you think i was coughing like that forfun  i forgot it said the old man doggedly  besides if you take my advice youd better let me stay a little longer to make sure of things  mr wright laughed disagreeably  i dare say he said but i am managing this affair not you  now you go round tomorrow afternoon and tell them youre off  dye hear  dye think im made of money  and what do you mean by making such a fuss of that fool charlie hills  you know he is after bella  he walked the rest of the way home in indignant silence and after giving minute instructions to mr kemp next morning at breakfast went off to work in a more cheerful frame of mind  mr kemp was out when he returned and after making his toilet he followed him to mrs bradshaws  to his annoyance he found mr hills there again and moreover it soon became clear to him that mr kemp had said nothing about his approaching departure  coughs and scowls passed unheeded and at last in a hesitating voice he broached the subject himself  there was a general chorus of lamentation  i hadnt got the heart to tell you said mr kemp  i dont know when ive been so happy  but you havent got to go back immediate said mrs bradshaw  tomorrow said mr wright before the old man could reply business  must you go said mrs bradshaw  mr kemp smiled feebly  i suppose i ought to he replied in a hesitating voice  take my tip and give yourself a bit of a holiday before you go back urged mr hills  just for a few days pleaded bella  to please us said mrs bradshaw  think ow georgell miss you  lay hold of him and dont let him go said mr hills  he took mr kemp round the waist and the laughing bella and her mother each secured an arm  an appeal to mr wright to secure his legs passed unheeded  we dont let you go till you promise said mrs bradshaw  mr kemp smiled and shook his head  promise  said bella  well well said mr kemp praps  he must go back shouted the alarmed  mr wright  let him speak for himself exclaimed bella indignantly  just another week then said mr kemp  its no good having money if i cant please myself  a week shouted mr wright almost beside himself with rage and dismay a week  another week  why you told me  oh dont listen to him said mrs bradshaw  croaker  its his own business aint it  and he knows best dont he  whats it got to do with you  she patted mr kemps hand mr kemp patted back and with his disengaged hand helped himself to a glass of beerthe fourthand beamed in a friendly fashion upon the company  george  he said suddenly  yes said mr wright in a harsh voice  did you think to bring my pocketbook along with you  no said mr wright sharply i didnt  tttt said the old man with a gesture of annoyance  well lend me a couple of pounds then or else run back and fetch my pocketbook he added with a sly grin  mr wrights face worked with impotent fury  whatwhatdo youwant it for  he gasped  mrs bradshaws well well seemed to sum up the general feeling mr kemp shaking his head eyed him with gentle reproach  me and mrs bradshaw are going to gave another evening out he said quietly  ive only got a few more days and i must make hay while the sun shines  to mr wright the room seemed to revolve slowly on its axis but regaining his selfpossession by a supreme effort he took out his purse and produced the amount  mrs bradshaw after a few feminine protestations went upstairs to put her bonnet on  and you can go and fetch a hansomcab george while shes adoing of it said mr kemp  pick out a good orsespottedgrey if you can  mr wright arose and departing with a suddenness that was almost startling exploded harmlessly in front of the barbers next door but one  then with lagging steps he went in search of the shabbiest cab and oldest horse he could find  thankee my boy said mr kemp bluffly as he helped mrs bradshaw in and stood with his foot on the step  by the way you had better go back and lock my pocketbook up  i left it on the washstand and theres best part of a thousand pounds in it  you can take fifty for yourself to buy smokes with  there was a murmur of admiration and mr wright with a frantic attempt to keep up appearances tried to thank him but in vain  long after the cab had rolled away he stood on the pavement trying to think out a position which was rapidly becoming unendurable  still keeping up appearances he had to pretend to go home to look after the pocketbook leaving the jubilant mr hills to improve the shining hour with miss bradshaw  mr kemp returning home at midnightin a cabfound the young man waiting up for him and taking a seat on the edge of the table listened unmoved to a wordpicture of himself which seemed interminable  he was only moved to speech when mr wright described him as a whitewhiskered jezebel who was a disgrace to his sex and then merely in the interests of natural science  dont you worry he said as the other paused from exhaustion  it wont be for long now  long  said mr wright panting  first thing tomorrow morning you have a telegram calling you backa telegram that must be minded  dye see  no i dont said mr kemp plainly  im not going back never no morenever  im going to stop here and court mrs bradshaw  mr wright fought for breath  youyou cant he gasped  im going to have a try said the old man  im sick of going to sea and itll be a nice comfortable home for my old age  you marry bella and ill marry her mother  happy family  mr wright trembling with rage sat down to recover and regaining his composure after a time pointed out almost calmly the various difficulties in the way  ive thought it all out said mr kemp nodding  she mustnt know im not rich till after were married then i ave a letter from new zealand saying ive lost all my money  its just as easy to have that letter as the one you spoke of  and im to find you money to play the rich uncle with till youre married i suppose said mr wright in a grating voice and then lose bella when mrs bradshaw finds youve lost your money  mr kemp scratched his ear  thats your lookout he said at last  now look here said mr wright with great determination  either you go and tell them that youve been telegraphed forcabled is the proper wordor i tell them the truth  thatll settle you then said mr kemp  no more than the other would retorted the young man and itll come cheaper  one thing ill take my oath of and that is i wont give you another farthing but if you do as i tell you ill give you a quid for luck  now think it over  mr kemp thought it over and after a vain attempt to raise the promised reward to five pounds finally compounded for two and went off to bed after a few stormy words on selfishness and ingratitude  he declined to speak to his host at breakfast next morning and accompanied him in the evening with the air of a martyr going to the stake  he listened in stony silence to the young mans instructions and only spoke when the latter refused to pay the two pounds in advance  the news communicated in halting accents by mr kemp was received with flattering dismay  mrs bradshaw refused to believe her ears and it was only after the information had been repeated and confirmed by mr wright that she understood  i must go said mr kemp  ive spent over eleven pounds cabling today but its all no good  but youre coming back  said mr hills  o course i am was the reply  george is the only relation ive got and ive got to look after him i suppose  after all blood is thicker than water  hear hear said mrs bradshaw piously  and theres you and bella continued mr kemp two of the best that ever breathed  the ladies looked

i should fancy  hes a goodarted goodlooking  draw it mild interrupted the blushing mr hills as mr wright bestowed a ferocious glance upon the speaker  clever lively young fellow concluded mr kemp  george  yes said mr wright  im going now  ive got to catch the train for southampton but i dont want you to come with me  i prefer to be alone  you stay here and cheer them up  oh and before i forget it lend me a couple o pounds out o that fifty i gave you last night  ive given all my small change away  he looked up and met mr wrights eye the latter too affected to speak took out the money and passed it over  we never know what may happen to us said the old man solemnly as he rose and buttoned his coat  im an old man and i like to have things shipshape  ive spent nearly the whole day with my lawyer and if anything appens to my old carcass it wont make any difference  i have left half my money to george half of all i have is to be his  in the midst of an awed silence he went round and shook hands  the other half with his hand on the doorthe other half and my best gold watch and chain i have left to my dear young pal charlie hills goodbye georgie
