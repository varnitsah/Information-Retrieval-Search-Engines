quality  i knew him from the days of my extreme youth because he made my fathers boots inhabiting with his elder brother two little shops let into one in a small bystreetnow no more but then most fashionably placed in the west end  that tenement had a certain quiet distinction there was no sign upon its face that he made for any of the royal familymerely his own german name of gessler brothers and in the window a few pairs of boots  i remember that it always troubled me to account for those unvarying boots in the window for he made only what was ordered reaching nothing down and it seemed so inconceivable that what he made could ever have failed to fit had he bought them to put there  that too seemed inconceivable  he would never have tolerated in his house leather on which he had not worked himself  besides they were too beautifulthe pair of pumps so inexpressibly slim the patent leathers with cloth tops making water come into ones mouth the tall brown riding boots with marvellous sooty glow as if though new they had been worn a hundred years  those pairs could only have been made by one who saw before him the soul of bootso truly were they prototypes incarnating the very spirit of all footgear these thoughts of course came to me later though even when i was promoted to him at the age of perhaps fourteen some inkling haunted me of the dignity of himself and brother  for to make bootssuch boots as he madeseemed to me then and still seems to me mysterious and wonderful  i remember well my shy remark one day while stretching out to him my youthful foot  isnt it awfully hard to do mr gessler  and his answer given with a sudden smile from out of the sardonic redness of his beard id is an ardt  himself he was a little as if made from leather with his yellow crinkly face and crinkly reddish hair and beard and neat folds slanting down his cheeks to the corners of his mouth and his guttural and onetoned voice for leather is a sardonic substance and stiff and slow of purpose  and that was the character of his face save that his eyes which were greyblue had in them the simple gravity of one secretly possessed by the ideal  his elder brother was so very like himthough watery paler in every way with a great industrythat sometimes in early days i was not quite sure of him until the interview was over then i knew that it was he if the words i will ask my brudder had not been spoken and that if they had it was his elder brother  when one grew old and wild and ran up bills one somehow never ran them up with gessler brothers  it would not have seemed becoming to go in there and stretch out ones foot to that blue ironspectacled glance owing him for more thansaytwo pairs just the comfortable reassurance that one was still his client  for it was not possible to go to him very oftenhis boots lasted terribly having something beyond the temporarysome as it were essence of boot stitched into them  one went in not as into most shops in the mood of please serve me and let me go but restfully as one enters a church and sitting on the single wooden chair waitedfor there was never anybody there soon over the top edge of that sort of wellrather dark and smelling soothingly of leatherwhich formed the shop there would be seen his face or that of his elder brother peering down  a guttural sound and the tiptap of bast slippers beating the narrow wooden stairs and he would stand before one without coat a little bent in leather apron with sleeves turned back blinkingas if awakened from some dream of boots or like an owl surprised in daylight and annoyed at this interruption  and i would say how do you do mr gessler  could you make me a pair of russia leather boots  without a word he would leave me retiring whence he came or into the other portion of the shop and i would continue to rest in the wooden chair inhaling the incense of his trade  soon he would come back holding in his thin veined hand a piece of goldbrown leather with eyes fixed on it he would remark what a beaudiful biece when i too had admired it he would speak again  when do you wand dem  and i would answer oh  as soon as you conveniently can and he would say tomorrow fordnighd  or if he were his elder brother i will ask my brudder  then i would murmur thank you  goodmorning mr  gessler gootmorning he would reply still looking at the leather in his hand and as i moved to the door i would hear the tiptap of his bast slippers restoring him up the stairs to his dream of boots  but if it were some new kind of footgear that he had not yet made me then indeed he would observe ceremonydivesting me of my boot and holding it long in his hand looking at it with eyes at once critical and loving as if recalling the glow with which he had created it and rebuking the way in which one had disorganized this masterpiece then placing my foot on a piece of paper he would two or three times tickle the outer edges with a pencil and pass his nervous fingers over my toes feeling himself into the heart of my requirements  i cannot forget that day on which i had occasion to say to him mr gessler that last pair of town walkingboots creaked you know  he looked at me for a time without replying as if expecting me to withdraw or qualify the statement then said  id shouldnd ave greaked  it did im afraid  you goddem wed before dey found demselves  i dont think so  at that he lowered his eyes as if hunting for memory of those boots and i felt sorry i had mentioned this grave thing  zend dem back he said i will look at dem  a feeling of compassion for my creaking boots surged up in me so well could i imagine the sorrowful long curiosity of regard which he would bend on them  zome boods he said slowly are bad from birdt  if i can do noding wid dem i dake dem off your bill  once once only i went absentmindedly into his shop in a pair of boots bought in an emergency at some large firms  he took my order without showing me any leather and i could feel his eyes penetrating the inferior integument of my foot  at last he said  dose are nod my boods  the tone was not one of anger nor of sorrow not even of contempt but there was in it something quiet that froze the blood  he put his hand down and pressed a finger on the place where the left boot endeavouring to be fashionable was not quite comfortable  id urds you dere he said  dose big virms ave no selfrespect drash  and then as if something had given way within him he spoke long and bitterly  it was the only time i ever heard him discuss the conditions and hardships of his trade  dey get id all he said dey get id by adverdisement nod by work dey dake it away from us who lofe our boods  id gomes to thisbresently i haf no work  every year id gets less you will see  and looking at his lined face i saw things i had never noticed before bitter things and bitter struggleand what a lot of grey hairs there seemed suddenly in his red beard  as best i could i explained the circumstances of the purchase of those illomened boots  but his face and voice made so deep impression that during the next few minutes i ordered many pairs nemesis fell  they lasted more terribly than ever  and i was not able conscientiously to go to him for nearly two years  when at last i went i was surprised to find that outside one of the two little windows of his shop another name was painted also that of a bootmakermaking of course for the royal family  the old familiar boots no longer in dignified isolation were huddled in the single window  inside the now contracted well of the one little shop was more scented and darker than ever  and it was longer than usual too before a face peered down and the tiptap of the bast slippers began  at last he stood before me and gazing through those rusty iron spectacles said  mr isnd it  ah  mr  gessler i stammered but your boots are really too good you know  see these are quite decent still  and i stretched out to him my foot  he looked at it  yes he said beople do nod wand good hoods id seems  to get away from his reproachful eyes and voice i hastily remarked what have you done to your shop  he answered quietly id was too exbensif  do you wand some boods  i ordered three pairs though i had only wanted two and quickly left  i had i do not know quite what feeling of being part in his mind of a conspiracy against him or not perhaps so much against him as against his idea of boot  one does not i suppose care to feel like that for it was again many months before my next visit to his shop paid i remember with the feeling oh well i cant leave the old boyso here goes perhaps itll be his elder brother  for his elder brother i knew had not character enough to reproach me even dumbly  and to my relief in the shop there did appear to be his elder brother handling a piece of leather  well mr  gessler i said how are you  he came close and peered at me  i am breddy well he said slowly but my elder brudder is dead  and i saw that it was indeed himselfbut how aged and wan  and never before had i heard him mention his brother  much shocked i murmured oh  i am sorry  yes he answered he was a good man he made a good bood but he is dead  and he touched the top of his head where the hair had suddenly gone as thin as it had been on that of his poor brother to indicate i suppose the cause of death  he could nod ged over losing de oder shop do you wand any hoods  and he held up the leather in his hand ids a beaudiful biece  i ordered several pairs  it was very long before they camebut they were better than ever  one simply could not wear them out  and soon after that i went abroad  it was over a year before i was again in london  and the first shop i went to was my old friends  i had left a man of sixty i came back to one of seventyfive pinched and worn and tremulous who genuinely this time did not at first know me  oh  mr gessler i said sick at heart how splendid your boots are see ive been wearing this pair nearly all the time ive been abroad and theyre not half worn out are they  he looked long at my bootsa pair of russia leather and his face seemed to regain steadiness  putting his hand on my instep he said  do dey vid you here  i ad drouble wid dat bair i remember  i assured him that they had fitted beautifully  do you wand any boods he said  i can make dem quickly id is a slack dime  i answered please please  i want boots all roundevery kind  i will make a vresh model  your food must be bigger  and with utter slowness he traced round my foot and felt my toes only once looking up to say  did i dell you my brudder was dead  to watch him was painful so feeble had he grown i was glad to get away  i had given those boots up when one evening they came  opening the parcel i set the four pairs out in a row  then one by one i tried them on  there was no doubt about it  in shape and fit in finish and quality of leather they were the best he had ever made me  and in the mouth of one of the town walkingboots i found his bill  the amount was the same as usual but it gave me quite a shock  he had never before sent it in till quarter day  i flew downstairs and wrote a cheque and posted it at once with my own hand  a week later passing the little street i thought i would go in and tell him how splendidly the new boots fitted  but when i came to where his shop had been his name was gone  still there in the window were the slim pumps the patent leathers with cloth tops the sooty riding boots  i went in very much disturbed  in the two little shopsagain made into onewas a young man with an english face  mr gessler in i said  he gave me a strange ingratiating look  no sir he said no  but we can attend to anything with pleasure weve taken the shop over  youve seen our name no doubt next door we make for some very good people  yes yes i said but mr gessler  oh he answered dead  dead  but i only received these boots from him last wednesday week  ah he said a shockin go  poor old man starved imself  good god  slow starvation the doctor called it  you see he went to work in such a way  would keep the shop on wouldnt have a soul touch his boots except himself  when he got an order it took him such a time people wont wait  he lost everybody  and there hed sit goin on and oni will say that for him not a man in london made a better boot  but look at the competition  he never advertised  would ave the best leather too and do it all imself  well there it is what could you expect with his ideas  but starvation  that may be a bit flowery as the sayin isbut i know myself he was sittin over his boots day and night to the very last  you see i used to watch him  never gave imself time to eat never had a penny in the house  all went in rent and leather  how he lived so long i dont know he regular let his fire go out  he was a character  but he made good boots  yes i said he made good boots  and i turned and went out quickly for i did not want that youth to know that i could hardly see 1911     the grand juryin two panels and a frame  read that piece of paper which summoned me to sit on the grand jury at the approaching sessions lying in a scoop of the shore close to the great rollers of the seathat span of eternal freedom deprived just there of too great liberty by the word atlantic  and i remember thinking as i read that in each breaking wave was some particle which had visited every shore in all the worldthat in each sparkle of hot sunlight stealing that bright water up into the sky was the microcosm of all change and of all unity   panel i  in answer to that piece of paper i presented myself at the proper place in due course and with a certain trepidation  what was it that i was about to do  for i had no experience of these things  and being too early i walked a little to and fro looking at all those my partners in this matter of the purification of society prosecutors witnesses officials policemen detectives undetected pressmen barristers loafers clerks cadgers jurymen  and i remember having something of the feeling that one has when one looks into a sink without holding ones nose  there was such uneasy hurry so strange a disenchanted look a sort of spiritual dirt about all that place and there werefaces  and i thought to them my face must seem as their faces seem to me  soon i was taken with my accomplices to have my name called and to be sworn  i do not remember much about that process too occupied with wondering what these companions of mine were like but presently we all came to a long room with a long table where nineteen lists of indictments and nineteen pieces of blotting paper were set alongside nineteen pens  we did not i recollect speak much to one another but sat down and studied those nineteen lists  we had eightyseven cases on which to pronounce whether the bill was true or no and the clerk assured us we should get through them in two days at most over the top of these indictments i regarded my eighteen fellows there was in me a hunger of inquiry as to what they thought about this business and a sort of sorrowful affection for them as if we were all a ships company bound on some strange and awkward expedition  i wondered till i thought my wonder must be coming through my eyes whether they had the same curious sensation that i was feeling of doing something illegitimate which i had not been born to do together with a sense of selfimportance a sort of unholy interest in thus dealing with the lives of my fellow men  and slowly watching them i came to the conclusion that i need not wonder all with the exception perhaps of two a painter and a jew looked such good citizens  i became gradually sure that they were not troubled with the lap and wash of speculation unclogged by any devastating sense of unity pure of doubt and undefiled by an uneasy conscience  but now they began to bring us in the evidence  they brought it quickly and at first we looked at it whatever it was with a sort of solemn excitement  were we not arbiters of mens fates purifiers of society more important by far than judge or common jury  for if we did not bring in a true bill there was an end the accused would be discharged  we set to work slowly at first then faster and still faster bringing in true bills and after every one making a mark in our lists so that we might know where we were  we brought in true bills for burglary and false pretences larceny and fraud we brought them in for manslaughter rape and arson  when we had ten or so two of us would get up and bear them away down to the court below and lay them before the judge  thank you gentlemen he would say or words to that effect and we would go up again and go on bringing in true bills  i noticed that at the evidence of each fresh bill we looked with a little less excitement and a little less solemnity making every time a shorter tick and a shorter note in the margin of our lists  all the bills we hadfiftysevenwe brought in true and the morning and the afternoon made that day till we rested and went to our homes  next day we were all back in our places at the appointed hour and not greeting each other much at once began to bring in bills  we brought them in not quite so fast as though some lurking megrim some microbe of dissatisfaction with ourselves was at work within us it was as if we wanted to throw one out as if we felt our work too perfect  and presently it came  a case of defrauding one sophie liebermann or laubermann or some such foreign name by giving her one of those fivepound christmascard banknotes just then in fashion and receiving from her as she alleged three real sovereigns change  there was a certain piquancy about the matter and i well remember noticing how we sat a little forward and turned in our seats when they brought in the prosecutrix to give evidence pale selfpossessed dressed in black and rather comely neither brazen nor furtive speaking but poor english her broad matteroffact face with its wideset grey eyes and thickish nose and lips made on me i recollect an impression of rather stupid honesty  i do not think they had told us in so many words what her calling was nor do i remember whether she actually disclosed it but by our demeanour i could tell that we had all realized what was the nature of the service rendered to the accused in return for which he had given her this worthless note  in her rather guttural but pleasant voice she answered all our questionsnot very far from tears i think but saved by native stolidity and perhaps a little by the fear that purifiers of society might not be the proper audience for emotion  when she had left us we recalled the detective and still as it were touching the delicate matter with the tips of our tongues so as not being men of the world to seem biassed against anything we definitely elicited from him her profession and these words if shes speaking the truth gentlemen but as you know these women they dont always specially the foreign ones  when he too had gone we looked at each other in unwonted silence  none of us quite liked it seemed to be first to speak  then our foreman said theres no doubt i think that he gave her the notemean trick of course but we cant have him on that alonebit too irregularno consideration in law i take it  he smiled a little at our smiles and then went on the question gentlemen really seems to be are we to take her word that she actually gave him change  again for quite half a minute we were silent and then the fattest one of us said suddenly very dangerousgoin on the word of these women  and at once as if he had released something in our souls we all save two or three broke out  it wouldnt do  it wasnt safe  seeing what these women were  it was exactly as if without word said we had each been swearing the other to some secret compact to protect society  as if we had been whispering to each other something like this these womenof course we need them but for all that we cant possibly recognise them as within the law we cant do that without endangering the safety of every one of us  in this matter we are trustees for all menindeed even for ourselves for who knows at what moment we might not ourselves require their services and it would be exceedingly awkward if their word were considered the equal of our own  not one of us certainly said anything so crude as this none the less did many of us feel it then the foreman looking slowly round the table said well gentlemen i think we are all agreed to throw out this bill and all except the painter the jew and one other murmured yes and as though in throwing out this bill we had cast some trouble off our minds we went on with the greater speed bringing in true bills  about two oclock we finished and trooped down to the court to be released  on the stairway the jew came close and having examined me a little sharply with his velvety slits of eyes as if to see that he was not making a mistake said ith fonnywe bring in eighty thix bills true and one we throw out and the one we throw out we know it to be true and the dirtieth job of the whole lot ith fonny  yes i answered him our sense of respectability does seem excessive  but just then we reached the court where in his red robe and grey wig with his clearcut handsome face the judge seemed to shine and radiate like sun through gloom  i thank you gentlemen he said in a voice courteous and a little mocking as though he had somewhere seen us before i thank you for the way in which you have performed your duties  i have not the pleasure of assigning to you anything for your services except the privilege of going over a prison where you will be able to see what sort of existence awaits many of those to whose cases you have devoted so much of your valuable time  you are released gentlemen  looking at each other a little hurriedly and not taking too much farewell for fear of having to meet again we separated  i was then freefree of the injunction of that piece of paper reposing in my pocket  yet its influence was still upon me  i did not hurry away but lingered in the courts fascinated by the notion that the fate of each prisoner had first passed through my hands  at last i made an effort and went out into the corridor  there i passed a woman whose figure seemed familiar  she was sitting with her hands in her lap looking straight before her palefaced and not uncomely with thickish mouth and nosethe woman whose bill we had thrown out  why was she sitting there  had she not then realised that we had quashed her claim or was she like myself kept here by mere attraction of the law following i know not what impulse i said your case was dismissed wasnt it  she looked up at me stolidly and a tear which had evidently been long gathering dropped at the movement  i do nod know i waid to see she said in her thick voice i tink there has been mistake  my face no doubt betrayed something of my sentiments about her case for the thick tears began rolling fast down her pasty cheeks and her pentup feeling suddenly flowed forth in words i work ard gott how i work hard  and there gomes dis liddle beastly man and rob me  and they say ah yes but you are a bad woman we don trust youyou speak lie  but i speak druth i am nod a bad womani gome from hamburg  yes yes i murmured yes yes  i do not know this country well sir  i speak bad english  is that why they do not drust my word  she was silent for a moment searching my face then broke out again it is all ard work in my profession i make very liddle i cannot afford to be rob  without the men i cannod make my living i must drust themand they rob me like this it is too ard  and the slow tears rolled faster and faster from her eyes on to her hands and her black lap  then quietly and looking for a moment singularly like a big unhappy child she asked will you blease dell me sir why they will not give me the law of that dirty little man  i knewand too well but i could not tell her  you see i said its just a case of your word against his  oh no but she said eagerly he give me the notei would not have taken it if i ad not thought it good would i  that is sure isnt it  but five pounds it is not my price  it must that i give im change  those gentlemen that heard my case they are men of business they must know that it is not my price  if i could tell the judgei think he is a man of business too he would know that too for sure  i am not so young  i am not so veree beautiful as all that he must see mustnt he sir  at my wits end how to answer that most strange question i stammered out but you know your profession is outside the law  at that a slow anger dyed her face  she looked down then suddenly lifting one of her dirty ungloved hands she laid it on her breast with the gesture of one baring to me the truth in her heart  i am not a bad woman she said dat beastly little man he do the same as mei am freewoman i am not a slave bound to do the same tomorrow night no more than he  such like him make me what i am he have all the pleasure i have all the work  he give me nodinghe rob my poor money and he make me seem to strangers a bad woman  oh dear  i am not happy  the impulse i had been having to press on her the money died within me i felt suddenly it would be another insult  from the movement of her fingers about her heart i could not but see that this grief of hers was not about the money  it was the inarticulate outburst of a bitter sense of deep injustice of all the dumb wondering at her own fate that went about with her behind that broad stolid face and bosom  this loss of the money was but a symbol of the furtive hopeless insecurity she lived with day and night now forced into the light for herself and all the world to see  she felt it suddenly a bitter unfair thing  this beastly little man did not share her insecurity  none of us shared itnone of us who had brought her down to this  and quite unable to explain to her how natural and proper it all was i only murmured i am sorry awfully sorry and fled away   panel ii  it was just a week later when having for passport my grand jury summons i presented myself at that prison where we had the privilege of seeing the existence to which we had assisted so many of the eightysix  im afraid i said to the guardian of the gate that i am rather late in availing myselfthe others no doubt  not at all sir he said smiling  youre the first and if youll excuse me i think youll be the last  will you wait in here while i send for the chief warder to take you over  he showed me then to what he called the warders libraryan ironbarred room more bare and brown than any i had seen since i left school  while i stood there waiting and staring out into the prison courtyard there came rolling and rumbling in a black maria  it drew up with a clatter and i saw through the barred door the single prisonera young girl of perhaps eighteendressed in rusty black she was resting her forehead against a bar and looking out her quick narrow dark eyes taking in her new surroundings with a sort of sharp restless indifference and her pale thinupped oval face quite expressionless  behind those bars she seemed to me for all the world like a little animal of the cat tribe being brought in to her zoo  me she did not see but if she had i felt she would not shrinkonly give me the same sharp indifferent look she was giving all else  the policeman on the step behind had disappeared at once and the driver now got down from his perch and coming round began to gossip with her  i saw her slink her eyes and smile at him and he smiled back a large man not unkindly  then he returned to his horses and she stayed as before with her forehead against the bars just staring out  watching her like that unseen i seemed to be able to see right through that tightlipped lynxeyed mask  i seemed to know that little creature through and through as one knows anything that one surprises off its guard sunk in its most private moods  i seemed to see her little restless furtive utterly unmoral soul so stripped of all defence as if she had taken it from her heart and handed it out to me i saw that she was one of those whose hands slip as indifferently into others pockets as into their own incapable of fidelity and incapable of trusting quick as cats and as devoid of application ready to scratch ready to purr ready to scratch again quick to change and secretly as unchangeable as a little pebble  and i thought here we are taking her to the zoo by no means for the first time if demeanour be any guide and we shall put her in a cage and make her sew and give her good books which she will not read and she will sew and walk up and down until we let her out then she will return to her old haunts and at once go prowling and do exactly the same again what ever it was until we catch her and lock her up once more  and in this way we shall go on purifying society until she dies  and i thought if indeed she had been created cat in body as well as in soul we should not have treated her thus but should have said go on little cat you scratch us sometimes you steal often you are as sensual as the night  all this we cannot help  it is your nature  so were you madewe know you cannot changeyou amuse us  go on little cat would it not then be better and less savoury of humbug if we said the same to her whose catsoul has chanced into this human shape  for assuredly she will but pilfer and scratch a little and be mildly vicious in her little life and do no desperate harm having but poor capacity for evil behind that petty thinupped mask  what is the good of all this padlock business for such as she are we not making mountains out of her mole hills  where is our sense of proportion and our sense of humour  why try to alter the make and shape of nature with our petty chisels  or if we must take care of her to save ourselves in the name of heaven let us do it in a better way than this  and suddenly i remembered that i was a grand juryman a purifier of society who had brought her bill in true and that i might not think these thoughts unworthy of a good citizen i turned my eyes away from her and took up my list of indictments  yes there she was at least so i decided number 42 pilson jenny larceny pocketpicking and i turned my memory back to the evidence about her case but i could not remember a single word  in the margin i had noted incorrigible from a child up bad surroundings  and a mad impulse came over me to go back to my window and call through the bars to her jenny pilson  jenny pilson  it was i who bred you and surrounded you with evil  it was i who caught you for being what i made you  i brought your bill in true i judged you and i caged you  jenny pilson  jenny pilson but just as i reached the window the door of my waitingroom was fortunately opened and a voice said now sir at your service  i sat again in that scoop of the shore by the long rolling seas burying in the sand the piece of paper which had summoned me away to my grand jury and the same thoughts came to me with the breaking of the waves that had come to me before how in every wave was a particle that had known the shore of every land and in each sparkle of the hot sunlight stealing up that bright water into the sky the microcosm of all change and of all unity 1912     gone  not possible to conceive of rarer beauty than that which clung about the summer day three years ago when first we had the news of the poor herds loveliness was a net of golden filaments in which the world was caught it was gravity itself so tranquil and it was a sort of intoxicating laughter  from the top field that we crossed to go down to their cottage all the far sweep of those outstretched wings of beauty could be seen  very wonderful was the poise of the sacred bird that moved nowhere but in our hearts  the limetree scent was just stealing out into air for some days already bereft of the scent of hay and the sun was falling to his evening home behind our pines and beeches  it was no more than radiant warm  and as we went we wondered why we had not been told before that mrs herd was so very ill  it was foolish to wonderthese people do not speak of suffering till it is late  to speak when it means what this meant loss of wife and motherwas to flatter reality too much  to be healthy ordie  that is their creed to go on till they dropthen very soon pass away  what room for states betweenon their poor wage in their poor cottages  we crossed the millstream in the hollowto their white thatched dwelling silent already awed almost resentful of this sovarying scheme of things  at the gateway herd himself was standing just in from his work  for work in the country does not wait on illnesseven death claims from its onlookers but a few hours birth none at all and it is as well for what must be must and in work alone man rests from grief sorrow and anxiety had made strange alteration already in herds face through every crevice of the rough stolid mask the spirit was peeping a sort of quivering suppliant that seemed to ask all the time is it true  a regular cottagers figure this of herdsa labourer of these partsstrong slow but active with just a touch of the untamed somewhere about the swing and carriage of him about the strong jaw and wide thicklipped mouth just that something independent which in great variety clings to the natives of these still remote halfpagan valleys by the moor  we all moved silently to the lee of the outer wall so that our voices might not carry up to the sick woman lying there under the eaves almost within hand reach  yes sir  no sir  yes maam  this and the constant unforgettable supplication of his eyes was all that came from him yet he seemed loath to let us go as though he thought we had some mysterious power to help himthe magic perhaps of money to those who have none  grateful at our promise of another doctor a specialist he yet seemed with his eyes to say that he knew that such were only embroideries of fate  and when we had wrung his hand and gone we heard him coming after us his wife had said she would like to see us please would we come up  an old woman and mrs herds sister were in the sittingroom they showed us to the crazy narrow stairway  though we lived distant but four hundred yards of a crows flight we had never seen mrs herd before for that is the way of things in this land of minding ones own businessa slight dark girlishlooking woman almost quite refined away and with those eyes of the dying where the spirit is coming through as it only does when it knows that all is over except just the passing  she lay in a double bed with clean white sheets a whitewashed room so low that the ceiling almost touched our heads some flowers in a bowl the small lattice window open  though it was hot in there it was better far than the rooms of most families in towns living on a wage of twice as much for here was no sign of defeat in decency or cleanliness  in her face as in poor herds was that same strange mingling of resigned despair and almost eager appeal so terrible to disappoint  yet trying not to disappoint it one felt guilty of treachery what was the good the kindness in making this poor bird flutter still with hope against the bars when fast prison had so surely closed in round her  but what else could we do  we could not give her those glib assurances that naive souls make so easily to others concerning their after state  secretly i think we knew that her philosophy of calm reality that queer and unbidden growing tranquillity which precedes death was nearer to our own belief than would be any giltedged orthodoxy but nevertheless such is the strength of what is expected we felt it dreadful that we could not console her with the ordinary presumptions  you mustnt give up hope we kept on saying the new doctor will do a lot for you hes a specialista very clever man  and she kept on answering yes sir  yes maam  but still her eyes went on asking as if there were something else she wanted  and then to one of us came an inspiration  you mustnt let your husband worry about expense  that will be all right  she smiled then as if the chief cloud on her soul had been the thought of the arrears her illness and death would leave weighing on him with whom she had shared this bed ten years and more  and with that smile warming the memory of those spirithaunted eyes we crept downstairs again and out into the fields  it was more beautiful than ever just touched already with evening mysteryit was better than ever to be alive  and the immortal wonder that has haunted man since first he became man and haunts i think even the animalsthe unanswerable questionwhy joy and beauty must ever be walking hand in hand with ugliness and pain haunted us across those fields of life and loveliness  it was all right no doubt even reasonable since without dark there is no light  it was part of that unending sum whose answer is not given the merest little swing of the great pendulum  and yet  to accept this violent contrast without a sigh of revolt without a question  no sirs it was not so jolly as all that  that she should be dying there at thirty of a creeping malady which she might have checked perhaps if she had not had too many things to do for the children and husband to do anything for herselfif she had not been forced to hold the creed be healthy or die  this was no doubt perfectly explicable and in accordance with the supreme equation yet we enjoying life and health and ease of money felt horror and revolt on this evening of such beauty  nor at the moment did we derive great comfort from the thought that life slips in and out of sheath like sunsparks on water and that of all the cloud of summer midges dancing in the last gleam not one would be alive tomorrow  it was three evenings later that we heard uncertain footfalls on the flagstones of the verandah then a sort of brushing sound against the wood of the long open window  drawing aside the curtain one of us looked out  herd was standing there in the bright moonlight bareheaded with roughened hair  he came in and seeming not to know quite where he went took stand by the hearth and putting up his dark hand gripped the mantelshelf  then as if recollecting himself he said gude evenin sir beg pardon mm  no more for a full minute but his hand taking some little china thing turned it over and over without ceasing and down his broken face tears ran then very suddenly he said shes gone  and his hand turned over and over that little china thing and the tears went on rolling down then stumbling and swaying like a man in drink he made his way out again into the moonlight  we watched him across the lawn and path and through the gate till his footfalls died out there in the field and his figure was lost in the black shadow of the holly hedge  and the night was so beautiful so utterly glamourously beautiful with its starflowers and its silence and its trees clothed in moonlight all was tranquil as a dream of sleep  but it was long before our hearts wandering with poor herd would let us remember that she had slipped away into so beautiful a dream  the dead do not suffer from their rest in beauty  but the living 1911     threshing  when the drone of the thresher breaks through the autumn sighing of trees and wind or through that stillness of the first frost i get restless and more restless till throwing down my pen i have gone out to see for there is nothing like the sight of threshing for making one feel goodnot in the sense of comfort but at heart there under the pines and the already leafless elms and beechtrees close to the great stacks is the big busy creature with its small black puffing engine astern and there all around it is that conglomeration of unsentimental labour which invests all the crises of farm work with such fascination  the crew of the farm is only five all told but today they are fifteen and none strangers save the owners of the travelling thresher  they are working without respite and with little speech not at all as if they had been brought together for the benefit of some one elses corn but as though they one and all had a private grudge against time and a personal pleasure in finishing this job which while it lasts is bringing them extra pay and most excellent free feeding  just as after a dilatory voyage a crew will brace themselves for the run in recording with sudden energy their consciousness of triumph over the elements so on a farm the harvests of hay and corn sheepshearing and threshing will bring out in all a common sentiment a kind of sporting energy a defiant spurt as it were to score off nature for it is only a philosopher here and there among them i think who sees that nature is eager to be scored off in this fashion being anxious that some one should eat her kindly fruits  with ceremonial as grave as that which is at work within the thresher itself the tasks have been divided  at the root of all things pitchforking from the stack standsthe farmer moustached and always upright was he not in the yeomanrydignified in a hard black hat no waistcoat and his working coat so ragged that it would never cling to him but for pure affection  between him and the body of the machine are five more pitch forks directing the pale flood of raw material  there amongst them is poor herd still so sad from his summer loss plodding doggedly away  to watch him even now makes one feel how terrible is that dumb grief which has never learned to moan and there is george yeoford almost too sober and murdon plying his pitchfork with a supernatural regularity that cannot quite dim his queer brigands face of dark soft gloom shot with sudden humours his soft dark corduroys and battered hat  occasionally he stops and taking off that hat wipes his corrugated brow under black hair and seems to brood over his own regularity  down here too where i stand each separate function of the thresher has its appointed slave  here cedric rakes the chaff pouring from the side down into the chaffshed  carting the straw that streams from the thresher bows are michelmore and neckthe little man who cannot read but can milk and whistle the hearts out of his cows till they follow him like dogs  at the threshers stern is morris the driver selected because of that utter reliability which radiates from his broad handsome face  his part is to attend the sacking of the three kinds of grain for ever sieving out  he murmurs busy work sir and opens a little door to show me how the machinery does it all holding a sack between his knees and some string in his white teeth  then away goes the sackfour bushels one hundred and sixty pounds of genuines seconds or seedwheeled by cedric on a little trolley thing to where georgethegaul or jimtheearlysaxon is waiting to bear it on his back up the stone steps into the cornchamber  it has been raining in the night the ground is a churn of straw and mud and the trees still drip but now there is sunlight a sweet air and clear sky winecoloured through the red naked beechtwigs tipped with white untimely buds  nothing can be more lovely than this late autumn day so still save for the droning of the thresher and the constant tinny chuckle of the grey thinheaded guineafowl driven by this business away from their usual haunts  and soon the feeling that i knew would come begins creeping over me the sense of an extraordinary sanity in this neverceasing harmonious labour pursued in the autumn air faintly perfumed with woodsmoke with the scent of chaff and whiffs from that black puffingbilly the sense that there is nothing between this clean toilnot too hard but hard enoughand the clean consumption of its clean results the sense that nobody except myself is in the least conscious of how sane it all is the brains of these sane ones are all too busy with the real affairs of life the disposition of their wages anticipation of dinner some girl some junketing some wager the last rifle match and more than all with that pleasant rhythmic nothingness companion of the busy swing and play of muscles which of all states is secretly most akin to the deep unconsciousness of life itself thus to work in the free air for the good of all and the hurt of none without worry or the breath of acrimonysurely no phase of human life so nears the life of the truly civilised communitythe life of a hive of bees  not one of these working so sanelyunless it be morris who will spend his sunday afternoon on some high rock just watching sunlight and shadow drifting on the moorsnot one i think is distraught by perception of his own sanity by knowledge of how near he is to harmony not even by appreciation of the still radiance of this day or its innumerable fine shades of colour  it is all work and no moody consciousnessall work and will end in sleep  i leave them soon and make my way up the stone steps to the corn chamber where tranquillity is crowned  in the whitewashed room the corn lies in drifts and ridges three to four feet deep all silverydun like some remote sand desert lifeless beneath the moon  here it lies and into it staggering under the sacks georgethegaul and jimtheearly saxon tramp up to their knees spill the sacks over their heads and out again and above where their feet have plunged the patient surface closes again smooth  and as i stand there in the doorway looking at that silvery corn drift i think of the whole process from seed sown to the last sieving into this tranquil restingplace  i think of the slow dogged ploughman with the crows above him on the wind of the swing of the sowers arm dark up against grey sky on the steep field  i think of the seed snugburrowing for safety and its mysterious ferment under the warm spring rain of the soft green shoots tapering up so shyly toward the first sun and hardening in air to thin wiry stalk i think of the unnumerable tiny beasts that have jangled in that pale forest of the winged blue jewels of butterfly risen from it to hover on the wildrustling blades of that continual music played there by the wind of the chicory and poppy flowers that have been its lightso love as it grew tawny and full of life before the appointed date when it should return to its captivity  i think of that slowtravelling hum and swish which laid it low of the gathering to stack and the long waiting under the rustle and drip of the sheltering trees until yesterday the hoot of the thresher blew and there began the falling into this dun silvery peace  here it will lie with the pale sun narrowly filtering in on it and by night the pale moon till slowly week by week it is stolen away and its ridges and drifts sink and sink and the beasts have eaten it all  when the dusk is falling i go out to them again  they have nearly finished now the chaff in the chaffshed is mounting hillockhigh only the little barley stack remains unthreshed  mrs  georgethegaul is standing with a jug to give drink to the tired ones  some stars are already netted in the branches of the pines the guineafowl are silent but still the harmonious thresher hums and showers from three sides the straw the chaff the corn and the men fork and rake and cart and carry sleep growing in their muscles silence on their tongues and the tranquillity of the long day nearly ended in their souls  they will go on till it is quite dark 1911     that oldtime place  yes suhhere we are at that oldtime place  and our dark driver drew up his little victoria gently  through the open doorway into a dim cavernous ruined house of new orleans we passed  the mildew and dirt the dark denuded dankness of that old hostel rotting down with damp and time  and our guide the tall thin greyhaired dame who came forward with such native ease and moved before us touching this fungused wall that rusting stairway and telling as it were no one in her soft slow speech things that any one could seewhat a strange and fitting figure  before the smell of the deserted oozing rooms before that old creature leading us on and on negligent of all our questions and talking to the air as though we were not we felt such discomfort that we soon made to go out again into such freshness as there was on that day of dismal heat then realising it seemed that she was losing us our old guide turned for the first time looking in our faces she smiled and said in her sweet weak voice like the sound from the strings of a spinet long unplayed on don you wahnd to see the domeroom an all the other rooms right here of this oldtime place  again those words  we had not the hearts to disappoint her  and as we followed on and on along the mouldering corridors and rooms where the black peeling papers hung like stalactites the dominance of our senses gradually dropped from us and with our souls we saw its soulthe soul of this oldtime place this mustering house of the old south bereft of all but ghosts and the grey pigeons niched in the rotting gallery round a narrow courtyard open to the sky  this is the domeroom suh and lady right over the slavemarket it is here they did the business of the statesure oldtime heroes up therein the roofwashington hamilton jefferson davis leethere they are all gonenow  yes suh  a fineyea even a splendid room of great height and carved grandeur with handwrought bronze sconces and a band of metal bordering all blackened with oblivion  and the faces of those old heroes encircling that domed ceiling were blackened too and scarred with damp beyond recognition  here beneath their gaze men had banqueted and danced and ruled  the pride and might and vivid strength of things still fluttered their uneasy flags of spirit moved disherited wings  those oldtime feasts and grave discussionswe seemed to see them printed on the thick air imprisoned in this great chamber built above their dark foundations the pride and the might and the vivid strength of thingsgone all gone  we became conscious again of that soft weak voice  not hearing very well suh i have it all printed ladybeautifully told hereyes indeed  she was putting cards into our hands then impassive maintaining ever her impersonal chant the guardian of past glory led us on  now we shall see the slavemarketdownstairs underneath  its wet for the lady the water comes in now yes suh  on the crumbling black and white marble floorings the water indeed was trickling into pools  and down in the halls there came to us wanderingstrangest thing that ever strayed through deserted grandeura brown broken horse lean with a sore flank and a head of tremendous age  it stopped and gazed at us as though we might be going to give it things to eat then passed on stumbling over the ruined marbles  for a moment we had thought him ghostone of the many  but he was not since his hoofs sounded  the scrambling clatter of them had died out into silence before we came to that dark cryptlike chamber whose marble columns were ringed in iron veritable pillars of foundation  and then we saw that our old guides hands were full of newspapers  she struck a match they caught fire and blazed  holding high that torch she said see  up theres his name above where he stood  the auctioneer  oh yes indeed  heres where they sold them  below that name decaying on the wall we had the slow uncanny feeling of some one standing there in the gleam and flicker from that paper torch  for a moment the whole shadowy room seemed full of forms and faces  then the torch lied out and our old guide pointing through an archway with the blackened stump of it said  twas here they kept them indeed yes  we saw before us a sort of vault stonebuilt and low and long the light there was too dim for us to make out anything but walls and heaps of rusting scrapiron cast away there and mouldering own  but trying to pierce that darkness we became conscious as it seemed of innumerable eyes gazing not at us but through the archway where we stood innumerable white eyeballs gleaming out of blackness  from behind us came a little laugh  it floated past through the archway toward those eyes  who was that  who laughed in there  the old south itselfthat incredible fine lost soul  that oldtime thing of old ideals blindfolded by its own history  that queer proud blend of simple chivalry and tyranny of piety and the abhorrent thing  who was it laughed there in the old slavemarketlaughed at these white eyeballs glaring from out of the blackness of their dark cattlepen  what poor departed soul in this house of melancholy  but there was no ghost when we turned to lookonly our old guide with her sweet smile  yes suh  here they all cametwas the finest hotelbefore the wartime old southern familiesbuyin an sellin their property yes maam very interesting  this way  and here were the bells to all the rooms  broken you seeall broken  and rather quickly we passed away out of that oldtime place where something had laughed and the drip drip drip of water down the walls was as the sound of a spirit grieving 1912     romancethree gleams  on that new years morning when i drew up the blind it was still nearly dark but for the faintest pink flush glancing out there on the horizon of black water  the far shore of the rivers mouth was just soft dusk and the dim trees below me were in perfect stillness there was no lap of water  and theni saw her drifting in on the tidethe little ship passaging below me a happy ghost  like no thing of this world she came ending her flight with sailwings closing and her glowing lantern eyes there was i know not what of stealthy joy about her thus creeping in to the unexpecting land  and i wished she would never pass  but go on gliding by down there for ever with her dark ropes and her bright lanterns and her mysterious felicity so that i might have for ever in my heart the blessed feeling she brought me coming like this out of that great mystery the sea  if only she need not change to solidity but ever be this visitor from the unknown this sacred bird telling with her halfseen trailingdown plumesails the story of uncharted wonder  if only i might go on trembling as i was with the rapture of all i did not know and could not see yet felt pressing against me and touching my face with its lips  to think of her at anchor in cold light was like flingingto a door in the face of happiness  and just then she struck her bell the faint silvery fardown sound fled away before her and to every side out into the utter hush to discover echo but nothing answered as if fearing to break the spell of her coming to brush with reality the dark sea dew from her sailwings  but within me in response there began the song of all unknown things the song so tenuous so ecstatic that seems to sweep and quiver across such thin golden strings and like an eager dream dies too soon  the song of the secretknowing wind that has peered through so great forests and over such wild sea blown on so many faces and in the jungles of the grass the song of all that the wind has seen and felt  the song of lives that i should never live of the loves that i should never love singlng to me as though i should  and suddenly i felt that i could not bear my little ship of dreams to grow hard and grey her bright lanterns drowned in the cold light her dark ropes spidery and taut her seawan sails all furled and she no more en chanted and turning away i let fall the curtain   ii  then what happens to the moon  she who shy and veiled slips out before dusk to take the air of heaven wandering timidly among the columned clouds and fugitive from the staring of the sun she who when dusk has come rules the sentient night with such chaste and icy spellwhither and how does she retreat  i came on her one morningi surprised her  she was stealing into a dark wintry wood and five little stars were chasing her  she was orangehooded a lightolove dismissedunashamed and unfatigued having takenall  and she was looking back with her almond eyes across her darkivory shoulder at night where he still lay drowned in the sleep she had brought him  what a strange slow mocking look  so might aphrodite herself have looked back at some weary lover remembering the fire of his first embrace  insatiate smiling creature slipping down to the rim of the world to her bath in the sweet waters of dawn whence emerging pure as a water lily she would float in the cool sky till evening came again  and just then she saw me looking and hid behind a holmoak tree but i could still see the gleam of one shoulder and her long narrow eyes pursuing me i went up to the tree and parted its dark boughs to take her but she had slipped behind another  i called to her to stand if only for one moment  but she smiled and went slip ping on and i ran thrusting through the wet bushes leaping the fallen trunks the scent of rotting leaves disturbed by my feet leaped out into the darkness and birds surprised fluttered away  and still i ranshe slipping ever further into the grove and ever looking back at me and i thought but i will catch you yet you nymph of perdition  the wood will soon be passed you will have no cover then  and from her eyes and the scanty gleam of her flying limbs i never looked away not even when i stumbled or ran against tree trunks in my blind haste  and at every clearing i flew more furiously thinking to seize all of her with my gaze before she could cross the glade but ever she found some little low tree some bush of birch ungrown or the far top branches of the next grove to screen her flying body and preserve allurement  and all the time she was dipping dipping to the rim of the world  and then i tripped but as i rose i saw that she had lingered for me her long sliding eyes were full it seemed to me of pity as if she would have liked for me to have enjoyed the sight of her  i stood still breathless thinking that at last she would consent but flinging back up into the air one darkivory arm she sighed and vanished  and the breath of her sigh stirred all the birchtree twigs just coloured with the dawn  long i stood in that thicket gazing at the spot where she had leapt from me over the edge of the worldmy heart quivering    iii  we embarked on the estuary steamer that winter morning just as daylight came full  the sun was on the wing scattering little white clouds as an eagle might scatter doves  they scurried up before him with their broken feathers tipped and tinged with gold  in the air was a touch of frost and a smoky mistdrift clung here and there above the reeds blurring the shores of the lagoon so that we seemed to be steaming across boundless water till some clump of trees would fling its top out of the fog then fall back into whiteness  and then in that thick vapour rounding i suppose some curve we came suddenly into we knew not whatall white and moving it was as if the mist were crazed murmuring too with a sort of restless beating  we seemed to be passing through a ghostthe ghost of all the life that had sprung from this water and its shores we seemed to have left reality to be travelling through live wonder  and the fantastic thought sprang into my mind i have died  this is the voyage of my soul in the wild  i am in the final wilderness of spiritslost in the ghost robe that wraps the earth  there seemed in all this white murmuration to be millions of tiny hands stretching out to me millions of whispering voices of wistful eyes  i had no fear but a curious baked eagerness the strangest feeling of having lost myself and become part of this around me exactly as if my own hands and voice and eyes had left me and were groping and whispering and gazing out there in the eeriness  i was no longer a man on an estuary steamer but part of sentient ghostliness  nor did i feel unhappy it seemed as though i had never been anything but this bedouin spirit wandering  we passed through again into the stillness of plain mist and all those eerie sensations went leaving nothing but curiosity to know what this was that we had traversed  then suddenly the sun came flaring out and we saw behind us thousands and thousands of white gulls dipping wheeling brushing the water with their wings bewitched with sun and mist  that was all  and yet that whitewinged legion through whom we had ploughed our way were not could never be to me just gullsthere was more than mere sunglamour gilding their misty plumes there was the wizardry of my past wonder the enchantment of romance 1912     memories  we set out to meet him at waterloo station on a dull day of februaryi who had owned his impetuous mother knowing a little what to expect while to my companion he would be all original  we stood there waiting for the salisbury train was late and wondering with a warm halffearful eagerness what sort of new thread life was going to twine into our skein  i think our chief dread was that he might have light eyesthose yellow chinese eyes of the common particoloured spaniel and each new minute of the trains tardiness increased our anxious compassion his first journey his first separation from his mother this black twomonths baby  then the train ran in and we hastened to look for him  have you a dog for us  a dog  not in this van  ask the rearguard  have you a dog for us  thats right  from salisbury  heres your wild beast sir  from behind a wooden crate we saw a long black muzzled nose poking round at us and heard a faint hoarse whimpering  i remember my first thought  isnt his nose too long  but to my companions heart it went at once because it was swollen from crying and being pressed against things that he could not see through we took him outsoft wobbly tearful set him down on his four as yet not quite simultaneous legs and regarded him  or rather my companion did having her head on one side and a quavering smile and i regarded her knowing that i should thereby get a truer impression of him  he wandered a little round our legs neither wagging his tail nor licking at our hands then he looked up and my companion said hes an angel  i was not so certain  he seemed hammerheaded with no eyes at all and little connection between his head his body and his legs  his ears were very long as long as his poor nose and gleaming down in the blackness of him i could see the same white star that disgraced his mothers chest  picking him up we carried him to a fourwheeled cab and took his muzzle off  his little darkbrown eyes were resolutely fixed on distance and by his refusal to even smell the biscuits we had brought to make him happy we knew that the human being had not yet come into a life that had contained so far only a mother a woodshed and four other soft wobbly black hammerheaded angels smelling of themselves and warmth and wood shavings  it was pleasant to feel that to us he would surrender an untouched love that is if he would surrender anything  suppose he did not take to us  and just then something must have stirred in him for he turned up his swollen nose and stared at my companion and a little later rubbed the dry pinkness of his tongue against my thumb  in that look and that unconscious restless lick he was trying hard to leave unhappiness behind trying hard to feel that these new creatures with stroking paws and queer scents were his mother yet all the time he knew i am sure that they were something bigger more permanently desperately his  the first sense of being owned perhaps who knows of owning had stirred in him  he would never again be quite the same unconscious creature  a little way from the end of our journey we got out and dismissed the cab  he could not too soon know the scents and pavements of this london where the chief of his life must pass  i can see now his first bumble down that wide backwater of a street how continually and suddenly he sat down to make sure of his own legs how continually he lost our heels he showed us then in full perfection what was afterwards to be an inconvenientif endearingcharacteristic at any call or whistle he would look in precisely the opposite direction  how many times all through his life have i not seen him at my whistle start violently and turn his tail to me then with nose thrown searchingly from side to side begin to canter toward the horizon  in that first walk we met fortunately but one vehicle a brewers dray he chose that moment to attend to the more serious affairs of life sitting quietly before the horses feet and requiring to be moved by hand  from the beginning he had his dignity and was extremely difficult to lift owing to the length of his middle distance  what strange feelings must have stirred in his little white soul when he first smelled carpet  but it was all so strange to him that dayi doubt if he felt more than i did when i first travelled to my private school reading tales of a grandfather and plied with tracts and sherry by my fathers man of business  that night indeed for several nights he slept with me keeping me too warm down my back and waking me now and then with quaint sleepy whimperings  indeed all through his life he flew a good deal in his sleep fighting dogs and seeing ghosts running after rabbits and thrown sticks and to the last one never quite knew whether or no to rouse him when his four black feet began to jerk and quiver  his dreams were like our dreams both good and bad happy sometimes sometimes tragic to weeping point  he ceased to sleep with me the day we discovered that he was a perfect little colony whose settlers were of an active species which i have never seen again  after that he had many beds for circumstance ordained that his life should be nomadic and it is to this i trace that philosophic indifference to place or property which marked him out from most of his own kind  he learned early that for a black dog with long silky ears a feathered tail and head of great dignity there was no home whatsoever away from those creatures with special scents who took liberties with his name and alone of all created things were privileged to smack him with a slipper  he would sleep anywhere so long as it was in their room or so close outside it as to make no matter for it was with him a principle that what he did not smell did not exist  i would i could hear again those long rubberlipped snufflings of recognition underneath the door with which each morning he would regale and reassure a spirit that grew with age more and more nervous and delicate about this matter of propinquity  for he was a dog of fixed ideas things stamped on his mind were indelible as for example his duty toward cats for whom he had really a perverse affection which had led to that first disastrous moment of his life when he was brought up poor bewildered puppy from a brief excursion to the kitchen with one eye closed and his cheek torn  he bore to his grave that jagged scratch across the eye  it was in dread of a repetition of this tragedy that he was instructed at the word cats to rush forward with a special towrowrowing which he never used toward any other form of creature  to the end he cherished a hope that he would reach the cat but never did and if he had we knew he would only have stood and wagged his tail but i well remember once when he returned important from some such sally how dreadfully my companion startled a catloving friend by murmuring in her most honeyed voice well my darling have you been killing pussies in the garden  his eye and nose were impeccable in their sense of form indeed he was very english in that matter people must be just so things smell properly and affairs go on in the one right way  he could tolerate neither creatures in ragged clothes nor children on their hands and knees nor postmen because with their bags they swelledup on one side and carried lanterns on their stomachs  he would never let the harmless creatures pass without religious barks  naturally a believer in authority and routine and distrusting spiritual adventure he yet had curious fads that seemed to have nested in him quite outside of all principle  he would for instance follow neither carriages nor horses and if we tried to make him at once left for home where he would sit with nose raised to heaven emitting through it a most lugubrious shrill noise  then again one must not place a stick a slipper a glove or anything with which he could play upon ones headsince such an action reduced him at once to frenzy  for so conservative a dog his environment was sadly anarchistic  he never complained in words of our shifting habits but curled his head round over his left paw and pressed his chin very hard against the ground whenever he smelled packing  what necessity he seemed continually to be saying what real necessity is there for change of any kind whatever  here we were all together and one day was like another so that i knew where i wasand now you only know what will happen next and ii cant tell you whether i shall be with you when it happens  what strange grieving minutes a dog passes at such times in the underground of his subconsciousness refusing realisation yet all the time only too well divining  some careless word some unmuted compassion in voice the stealthy wrapping of a pair of boots the unaccustomed shutting of a door that ought to be open the removal from a downstair room of an object always thereone tiny thing and he knows for certain that he is not going too  he fights against the knowledge just as we do against what we cannot bear he gives up hope but not effort protesting in the only way he knows of and now and then heaving a great sigh those sighs of a dog  they go to the heart so much more deeply than the sighs of our own kind because they are utterly unintended regardless of effect emerging from one who heaving them knows not that they have escaped him  the words yesgoing too spoken in a certain tone would call up in his eyes a stillquestioning halfhappiness and from his tail a quiet flutter but did not quite serve to put to rest either his doubt or his feeling that it was all unnecessaryuntil the cab arrived  then he would pour himself out of door or window and be found in the bottom of the vehicle looking severely away from an admiring cabman  once settled on our feet he travelled with philosophy but no digestion  i think no dog was ever more indifferent to an outside world of human creatures yet few dogs have made more conquestsespecially among strange women through whom however he had a habit of lookingvery discouraging  he had natheless one or two particular friends such as him to whom this book is dedicated and a few persons whom he knew he had seen before but broadly speaking there were in his world of men only his mistress andthe almighty  each august till he was six he was sent for health and the assuagement of his hereditary instincts up to a scotch shooting where he carried many birds in a very tender manner  once he was compelled by fate to remain there nearly a year and we went up ourselves to fetch him home down the long avenue toward the keepers cottage we walked it was high autumn there had been frost already for the ground was fine with red and yellow leaves and presently we saw himself coming professionally questing among those leaves and preceding his dear keeper with the businesslike selfcontainment of a sportsman not too fat glossy as a ravens wing swinging his ears and sporran like a little highlander  we approached him silently  suddenly his nose went up from its imagined trail and he came rushing at our legs  from him as a garment drops from a man dropped all his strange soberness he became in a single instant one fluttering eagerness  he leaped from life to life in one bound without hesitation without regret  not one sigh not one look back not the faintest token of gratitude or regret at leaving those good people who had tended him for a whole year buttered oatcake for him allowed him to choose each night exactly where he would sleep  no he just marched out beside us as close as ever he could get drawing us on in spirit and not even attending to the scents until the lodge gates were passed  it was strictly in accordance with the perversity of things and something in the nature of calamity that he had not been ours one year when there came over me a dreadful but overmastering aversion from killing those birds and creatures of which he was so fond as soon as they were dead  and so i never knew him as a sportsman for during that first year he was only an unbroken puppy tied to my waist for fear of accidents and carefully pulling me off every shot they tell me he developed a lovely nose and perfect mouth large enough to hold gingerly the biggest hare  i well believe it remembering the qualities of his mother whose character however in stability he far surpassed  but as he grew every year more devoted to dead grouse and birds and rabbits i liked them more and more alive it was the only real breach between us and we kept it out of sight  ah well it is consoling to reflect that i should infallibly have ruined his sporting qualities lacking that peculiar habit of meaning what one says so necessary to keep dogs virtuous  but surely to have had him with me quivering and alert with his solemn eager face would have given a new joy to those crisp mornings when the hope of wings coming to the gun makes poignant in the sports man as nothing else will an almost sensual love of nature a fierce delight in the soft glow of leaves in the white birch stems and tracery of sparse twigs against blue sky in the scents of sap and grass and gum and heather flowers stivers the hair of him with keenness for interpreting each sound and fills the very fern or moss he kneels on the very trunk he leans against with strange vibration  slowly fate prepares for each of us the religion that lies coiled in our most secret nerves with such we cannot trifle we do not even try  but how shall a man grudge any one sensations he has so keenly felt  let such as have never known those curious delights uphold the hand of horrorfor me there can be no such luxury  if i could i would still perhaps be knowing them but when once the joy of life in those winged and furry things has knocked at the very portals of ones spirit the thought that by pressing a little iron twig one will rive that joy out of their vitals is too hard to bear  call it aestheticism squeamishness nambypamby sentimentalism what you will it is stronger than oneself  yes after one had once watched with an eye that did not merely see the thirsty gaping of a slowly dying bird or a rabbit dragging a broken leg to a hole where he would lie for hours thinking of the fern to which he should never more come forthafter that there was always the following little matter of arithmetic given that all those who had been shooting were goodfair shotswhich heaven knew they never werethey yet missed one at least in four and did not miss it very much so that if seventyfive things were slain there were also twentyfive that had been fired at and of those twentyfive twelve and a half had gotten it somewhere in their bodies and would likely die at their great leisure  this was the sum that brought about the only cleavage in our lives and so as he grew older and trying to part from each other we no longer could he ceased going to scotland  but after that i often felt and especially when we heard guns how the best and most secret instincts of him were being stifled  but what was to be done  in that which was left of a clay pigeon he would take not the faintest interestthe scent of it was paltry  yet always even in his most cosseted and idle days he managed to preserve the grave preoccupation of one professionally concerned with retrieving things that smell and consoled himself with pastimes such as cricket which he played in a manner highly specialised following the ball up the moment it left the bowlers hand and sometimes retrieving it before it reached the batsman  when remonstrated with he would consider a little hanging out a pink tongue and looking rather too eagerly at the ball then canter slowly out to a sort of forward short leg  why he always chose that particular position it is difficult to say possibly he could lurk there better than anywhere else the batsmans eye not being on him and the bowlers not too much  as a fieldsman he was perfect but for an occasional belief that he was not merely short leg but slip point midoff and wicketkeep and perhaps a tendency to make the ball a little jubey  but he worked tremendously watching every movement for he knew the game thoroughly and seldom delayed it more than three minutes when he secured the ball  and if that ball were really lost then indeed he took over the proceedings with an intensity and quiet vigour that destroyed many shrubs and the solemn satisfaction which comes from being in the very centre of the stage  but his most passionate delight was swimming in anything except the sea for which with its unpleasant noise and habit of tasting salt he had little affection  i see him now cleaving the serpentine with his air of the world well lost striving to reach my stick before it had touched water  being only a large spaniel too small for mere heroism he saved no lives in the water but his ownand that on one occasion before our very eyes from a dark trout stream which was trying to wash him down into a black hole among the boulders  the call of the wildspring runningwhatever it isthat besets men and dogs seldom attained full mastery over him but one could often see it struggling against his devotion to the scent of us and watching that dumb contest i have time and again wondered how far this civilisation of ours was justifiably imposed on him how far the love for us that we had so carefully implanted could ever replace in him the satisfaction of his primitive wild yearnings he was like a man naturally polygamous married to one loved woman  it was surely not for nothing that rover is dogs most common name and would be ours but for our too tenacious fear of losing something to admit even to ourselves that we are hankering  there was a man who said strange that two such queerly opposite qualities as courage and hypocrisy are the leading characteristics of the anglosaxon  but is not hypocrisy just a product of tenacity which is again the lower part of courage  is not hypocrisy but an active sense of property in ones good name the clutching close of respectability at any price the feeling that one must not part even at the cost of truth with what he has sweated so to gain  and so we anglosaxons will not answer to the name of rover and treat our dogs so that they too hardly know their natures  the history of his one wandering for which no respectable reason can be assigned will never of course be known  it was in london of an october evening when we were told he had slipped out and was not anywhere  then began those four distressful hours of searching for that black needle in that blacker bundle of hay  hours of real dismay and suffering for it is suffering indeed to feel a loved thing swallowed up in that hopeless haze of london streets  stolen or run over  which was worst  the neighbouring police stations visited the dogs home notified an order of five hundred lost dog bills placed in the printers hands the streets patrolled  and then in a lull snatched for food and still endeavouring to preserve some aspect of assurance we heard the bark which meant here is a door i cannot open  we hurried forth and there he was on the top doorstepbusy unashamed giving no explanations asking for his supper and very shortly after him came his five hundred lost dog bills  long i sat looking at him that night after my companion had gone up thinking of the evening some years before when there followed as that shadow of a spaniel who had been lost for eleven days  and my heart turned over within me but he  he was asleep for he knew not remorse  ah and there was that other time when it was reported to me returning home at night that he had gone out to find me and i went forth again disturbed and whistling his special call to the empty fields  suddenly out of the darkness i heard a rushing and he came furiously dashing against my heels from he alone knew where he had been lurking and saying to himself i will not go in till he comes  i could not scold there was something too lyrical in the return of that live lonely rushing piece of blackness through the blacker night  after all the vagary was but a variation in his practice when one was away at bedtime of passionately scratching up his bed in protest till it resembled nothing for in spite of his long and solemn face and the silkiness of his ears there was much in him yet of the cave bearhe dug graves on the smallest provocations in which he never buried anything  he was not a clever dog and guiltless of all tricks  nor was he ever shown  we did not even dream of subjecting him to this indignity  was our dog a clown a hobby a fad a fashion a feather in our caps that we should subject him to periodic pennings in stuffy halls that we should harry his faithful soul with such tomfoolery  he never even heard us talk about his lineage deplore the length of his nose or call him cleverlooking we should have been ashamed to let him smell about us the tarbrush of a sense of property to let him think we looked on him as an asset to earn us pelf or glory  we wished that there should be between us the spirit that was between the sheep dog and that farmer who when asked his dogs age touched the old creatures head and answered thus teresa his daughter was born in november and this one in august  that sheep dog had seen eighteen years when the great white day came for him and his spirit passed away up to cling with the woodsmoke round the dark rafters of the kitchen where he had lain so vast a time beside his masters boots  no no  if a man does not soon pass beyond the thought by what shall this dog profit me into the large state of simple gladness to be with dog he shall never know the very essence of that companion ship which depends not on the points of dog but on some strange and subtle mingling of mute spirits  for it is by muteness that a dog becomes for one so utterly beyond value with him one is at peace where words play no torturing tricks when he just sits loving and knows that he is being loved those are the moments that i think are precious to a dog when with his adoring soul coming through his eyes he feels that you are really thinking of him  but he is touchingly tolerant of ones other occupations  the subject of these memories always knew when one was too absorbed in work to be so close to him as he thought proper yet he never tried to hinder or distract or asked for attention  it dinged his mood of course so that the red under his eyes and the folds of his crumply cheekswhich seemed to speak of a touch of bloodhound introduced a long way back into his breedingdrew deeper and more manifest  if he could have spoken at such times he would have said i have been a long time alone and i cannot always be asleep but you know best and i must not criticise  he did not at all mind ones being absorbed in other humans he seemed to enjoy the sounds of conversation lifting round him and to know when they were sensible  he could not for instance stand actors or actresses giving readings of their parts perceiving at once that the same had no connection with the minds and real feelings of the speakers and having wandered a little to show his disapproval he would go to the door and stare at it till it opened and let him out  once or twice it is true when an actor of large voice was declaiming an emotional passage he so far relented as to go up to him and pant in his face  music too made him restless inclined to sigh and to ask questions  sometimes at its first sound he would cross to the window and remain there looking for her at others he would simply go and lie on the loud pedal and we never could tell whether it was from sentiment or because he thought that in this way he heard less  at one special nocturne of chopins he always whimpered  he was indeed of rather polish temperamentvery gay when he was gay dark and brooding when he was not  on the whole perhaps his life was uneventful for so fartravelling a dog though it held its moments of eccentricity as when he leaped through the window of a fourwheeler into kensington or sat on a dartmoor adder  but that was fortunately of a sunday afternoonwhen adder and all were torpid so nothing happened till a friend who was following lifted him off the creature with his large boot  if only one could have known more of his private lifemore of his relations with his own kind  i fancy he was always rather a dark dog to them having so many thoughts about us that he could not share with any one and being naturally fastidious except with ladies for whom he had a chivalrous and catholic taste so that they often turned and snapped at him  he had however but one lasting love affair for a livercoloured lass of our village not quite of his own caste but a wholesome if somewhat elderly girl with loving and sphinxlike eyes  their children alas were not for this world and soon departed  nor was he a fighting dog but once attacked he lacked a sense of values being unable to distinguish between dogs that he could beat and dogs with whom he had no earthly  it was in fact as well to interfere at once especially in the matter of retrievers for he never forgot having in his youth been attacked by a retriever from behind  no he never forgot and never forgave an enemy  only a month before that day of which i cannot speak being very old and ill he engaged an irish terrier on whose impudence he had long had his eye and routed him  and how a battle cheered his spirit  he was certainly no christian but allowing for essential dog he was very much a gentleman  and i do think that most of us who live on this earth these days would rather leave it with that label on us than the other  for to be a christian as tolstoy understood the wordand no one else in our time has had logic and love of truth enough to give it coherent meaningis to be quite sincere not suited to men of western blood  whereasto be a gentleman  it is a far cry but perhaps it can be done  in him at all events there was no pettiness no meanness and no cruelty and though he fell below his ideal at times this never altered the true look of his eyes nor the simple loyalty in his soul  but what a crowd of memories come back bringing with them the perfume of fallen days  what delights and glamour what long hours of effort discouragements and secret fears did he not watch overour black familiar and with the sight and scent and touch of him deepen or assuage  how many thousand walks did we not go together so that we still turn to see if he is following at his padding gait attentive to the invisible trails  not the least hard thing to bear when they go from us these quiet friends is that they carry away with them so many years of our own lives  yet if they find warmth therein who would grudge them those years that they have so guarded  nothing else of us can they take to lie upon with outstretched paws and chin pressed to the ground and whatever they take be sure they have deserved  do they know as we do that their time must come  yes they know at rare moments  no other way can i interpret those pauses of his latter life when propped on his forefeet he would sit for long minutes quite motionlesshis head drooped utterly withdrawn then turn those eyes of his and look at me  that look said more plainly than all words could yes i know that i must go  if we have spirits that persistthey have  if we know after our departure who we were they do  no one i think who really longs for truth can ever glibly say which it will be for dog and man persistence or extinction of our consciousness  there is but one thing certainthe childishness of fretting over that eternal question  whichever it be it must be right the only possible thing he felt that too i know but then like his master he was what is called a pessimist  my companion tells me that since he left us he has once come back it was old years night and she was sad when he came to her in visible shape of his black body passing round the diningtable from the windowend to his proper place beneath the table at her feet she saw him quite clearly she heard the padding taptap of his paws and very toenails she felt his warmth brushing hard against the front of her skirt  she thought then that he would settle down upon her feet but something disturbed him and he stood pausing pressed against her then moved out toward where i generally sit but was not sitting that night  she saw him stand there as if considering then at some sound or laugh she became selfconscious and slowly very slowly he was no longer there  had he some message some counsel to give something he would say that last night of the last year of all those he had watched over us  will he come back again  no stone stands over where he lies  it is on our hearts that his life is engraved 1912     felicity  when god is so good to the fields of what use are wordsthose poor husks of sentiment  there is no painting felicity on the wing  no way of bringing on to the canvas the flying glory of things  a single buttercup of the twenty million in one field is worth all these dry symbolsthat can never body forth the very spirit of that froth of may breaking over the hedges the choir of birds and bees the losttravelling down of the wind flowers the whitethroated swallows in their odysseys  just here there are no skylarks but what joy of song and leaf of lanes lighted with bright trees the few oaks still golden brown and the ashes still spiritual  only the blackbirds and thrushes can singup this day and cuckoos over the hill  the year has flown so fast that the appletrees have dropped nearly all their bloom and in long meadow the daggers are out early beside the narrow bright streams  orpheus sits there on a stone when nobody is by and pipes to the ponies and pan can often be seen dancing with his nymphs in the raised beechgrove where it is always twilight if you lie still enough against the far bank  who can believe in growing old so long as we are wrapped in this cloak of colour and wings and song so long as this unimaginable vision is here for us to gaze atthe softfaced sheep about us and the woolbags drying out along the fence and great numbers of tiny ducks so trustful that the crows have taken several  blue is the colour of youth and all the blue flowers have a fey look everything seems young too young to work  there is but one thing busy a starling fetching grubs for its little family above my headit must take that flight at least two hundred times a day the children should be very fat  when the sky is so happy and the flowers so luminous it does not seem possible that the bright angels of this day shall pass into dark night that slowly these wings shall close and the cuckoo praise himself to sleep mad midges dancein the evening the grass shiver with dew wind die and no bird sing         yet so it is  day has gonethe song and glamour and swoop of wings slowly has passed the daily miracle  it is night  but felicity has not withdrawn she has but changed her robe for silence velvet and the pearl fan of the moon  everything is sleeping save only a single star and the pansies  why they should be more wakeful than the other flowers i do not know  the expressions of their faces if one bends down into the dusk are sweeter and more cunning than ever they have some compact no doubt in hand  what a number of voices have given up the ghost to this night of but one voicethe murmur of the stream out there in darkness  with what religion all has been done  not one buttercup open the yewtrees already with shadows flung down  no moths are abroad yet it is too early in the year for nightjars and the owls are quiet but who shall say that in this silence in this hovering wan light in this air bereft of wings and of all scent save freshness there is less of the ineffable less of that before which words are dumb  it is strange how this tranquillity of night that seems so final is inhabited if one keeps still enough  a lamb is bleating out there on the dim moor a bird somewhere a little one about three fields away makes the sweetest kind of chirruping some cows are still cropping there is a scent too underneath the freshnesssweetbrier i think and our dutch honeysuckle nothing else could so delicately twine itself with air  and even in this darkness the roses have colour more beautiful perhaps than ever  if colour be as they say but the effect of light on various fibre one may think of it as a tune the song of thanksgiving that each form puts forth to sun and moon and stars and fire  these mooncoloured roses are singing a most quiet song  i see all of a sudden that there are many more stars beside that one so red and watchful  the flown kite is there with its seven pale worlds it has adventured very high and far tonightwith a company of others remoter still     this serenity of night  what could seem less likely ever more to move and change again to day  surely now the world has found its long sleep and the pearly glimmer from the moon will last and the precious silence never again yield to clamour the grapebloom of this mystery never more pale out into gold         and yet it is not so  the nightly miracle has passed  it is dawn faint light has come  i am waiting for the first sound  the sky as yet is like nothing but grey paper with the shadows of wild geese passing  the trees are phantoms  and then it comesthat first call of a bird startled at discovering day  just one calland now here there on all the trees the sudden answers swelling of that most sweet and careless choir  was irresponsibility ever so divine as this of birds waking thensaffron into the sky and once more silence  what is it birds do after the first chorale  think of their sins and business  or just sleep again  the trees are fast dropping unreality and the cuckoos begin calling  colour is burning up in the flowers already the dew smells of them  the miracle is ended for the starling has begun its job and the sun is fretting those dark busy wings with gold  full day has come again  but the face of it is a little strange it is not like yesterday  queerto think no day is like to a day thats past and no night like a night thats coming  why then fear death which is but night  why care if next day have different face and spirit  the sun has lighted buttercupfield now the wind touches the limetree  something passes over me away up there  it is felicity on her wings 1912
