introduction  the jacobite enthusiasm of the eighteenth century particularly during the rebellion of 1745 afforded a theme perhaps the finest that could be selected for fictitious composition founded upon real or probable incident this civil war and its remarkable events were remembered by the existing generation without any degree of the bitterness of spirit which seldom fails to attend internal dissension the highlanders who formed the principal strength of charles edwards army were an ancient and highspirited race peculiar in their habits of war and of peace brave to romance and exhibiting a character turning upon points more adapted to poetry than to the prose of real life their prince young valiant patient of fatigue and despising danger heading his army on foot in the most toilsome marches and defeating a regular force in three battlesall these were circumstances fascinating to the imagination and might well be supposed to seduce young and enthusiastic minds to the cause in which they were found united although wisdom and reason frowned upon the enterprise  the adventurous prince as is well known proved to be one of those personages who distinguish themselves during some single and extraordinarily brilliant period of their lives like the course of a shootingstar at which men wonder as well on account of the briefness as the brilliancy of its splendour a long tract of darkness overshadowed the subsequent life of a man who in his youth showed himself so capable of great undertakings and without the painful task of tracing his course farther we may say the latter pursuits and habits of this unhappy prince are those painfully evincing a broken heart which seeks refuge from its own thoughts in sordid enjoyments  still however it was long ere charles edward appeared to be perhaps it was long ere he altogether became so much degraded from his original self as he enjoyed for a time the lustre attending the progress and termination of his enterprise those who thought they discerned in his subsequent conduct an insensibility to the distresses of his followers coupled with that egotistical attention to his own interests which has been often attributed to the stuart family and which is the natural effect of the principles of divine right in which they were brought up were now generally considered as dissatisfied and splenetic persons who displeased with the issue of their adventure and finding themselves involved in the ruins of a falling cause indulged themselves in undeserved reproaches against their leader indeed such censures were by no means frequent among those of his followers who if what was alleged had been just had the best right to complain far the greater number of those unfortunate gentlemen suffered with the most dignified patience and were either too proud to take notice of illtreatment an the part of their prince or so prudent as to be aware their complaints would meet with little sympathy from the world it may be added that the greater part of the banished jacobites and those of high rank and consequence were not much within reach of the influence of the princes character and conduct whether well regulated or otherwise  in the meantime that great jacobite conspiracy of which the insurrection of 17456 was but a small part precipitated into action on the failure of a far more general scheme was resumed and again put into motion by the jacobites of england whose force had never been broken as they had prudently avoided bringing it into the field the surprising effect which had been produced by small means in 17456 animated their hopes for more important successes when the whole nonjuring interest of britain identified as it then was with great part of the landed gentlemen should come forward to finish what had been gallantly attempted by a few highland chiefs  it is probable indeed that the jacobites of the day were incapable of considering that the very small scale on which the effort was made was in one great measure the cause of its unexpected success the remarkable speed with which the insurgents marched the singularly good discipline which they preserved the union and unanimity which for some time animated their councils were all in a considerable degree produced by the smallness of their numbers notwithstanding the discomfiture of charles edward the nonjurors of the period long continued to nurse unlawful schemes and to drink treasonable toasts until age stole upon them another generation arose who did not share the sentiments which they cherished and at length the sparkles of disaffection which had long smouldered but had never been heated enough to burst into actual flame became entirely extinguished but in proportion as the political enthusiasm died gradually away among men of ordinary temperament it influenced those of warm imaginations and weak understandings and hence wild schemes were formed as desperate as they were adventurous  thus a young scottishman of rank is said to have stooped so low as to plot the surprisal of st jamess palace and the assassination of the royal family while these illdigested and desperate conspiracies were agitated among the few jacobites who still adhered with more obstinacy to their purpose there is no question but that other plots might have been brought to an open explosion had it not suited the policy of sir robert walpole rather to prevent or disable the conspirators in their projects than to promulgate the tale of danger which might thus have been believed to be more widely diffused than was really the case  in one instance alone this very prudential and humane line of conduct was departed from and the event seemed to confirm the policy of the general course doctor archibald cameron brother of the celebrated donald cameron of lochiel attainted for the rebellion of 1745 was found by a party of soldiers lurking with a comrade in the wilds of loch katrine five or six years after the battle of culloden and was there seized there were circumstances in his case so far as was made known to the public which attracted much compassion and gave to the judicial proceedings against him an appearance of coldblooded revenge on the part of government and the following argument of a zealous jacobite in his favour was received as conclusive by dr johnson and other persons who might pretend to impartiality dr cameron had never borne arms although engaged in the rebellion but used his medical skill for the service indifferently of the wounded of both parties his return to scotland was ascribed exclusively to family affairs his behaviour at the bar was decent firm and respectful his wife threw herself on three different occasions before george ii and the members of his family was rudely repulsed from their presence and at length placed it was said in the same prison with her husband and confined with unmanly severity  dr cameron was finally executed with all the severities of the law of treason and his death remains in popular estimation a dark blot upon the memory of george ii being almost publicly imputed to a mean and personal hatred of donald cameron of lochiel the sufferers heroic brother  yet the fact was that whether the execution of archibald cameron was political or otherwise it might certainly have been justified had the kings ministers so pleased upon reasons of a public nature the unfortunate sufferer had not come to the highlands solely upon his private affairs as was the general belief but it was not judged prudent by the english ministry to let it be generally known that he came to inquire about a considerable sum of money which had been remitted from france to the friends of the exiled family he had also a commission to hold intercourse with the wellknown mpherson of cluny chief of the clan vourich whom the chevalier had left behind at his departure from scotland in 1746 and who remained during ten years of proscription and danger skulking from place to place in the highlands and maintaining an uninterrupted correspondence between charles and his friends that dr cameron should have held a commission to assist this chief in raking together the dispersed embers of disaffection is in itself sufficiently natural and considering his political principles in no respect dishonourable to his memory but neither ought it to be imputed to george ii that he suffered the laws to be enforced against a person taken in the act of breaking them when he lost his hazardous game dr cameron only paid the forfeit which he must have calculated upon the ministers however thought it proper to leave dr camerons new schemes in concealment lest by divulging them they had indicated the channel of communication which it is now well known they possessed to all the plots of charles edward but it was equally ill advised and ungenerous to sacrifice the character of the king to the policy of the administration both points might have been gained by sparing the life of dr cameron after conviction and limiting his punishment to perpetual exile  these repeated and successive jacobite plots rose and burst like bubbles on a fountain and one of them at least the chevalier judged of importance enough to induce him to risk himself within the dangerous precincts of the british capital this appears from dr kings anecdotes of his own times  september 1750i received a note from my lady primrose who desired to see me immediately as soon as i waited on her she led me into her dressingroom and presented me to the chevalier doubtless if i was surprised to find him there i was still more astonished when he acquainted me with the motives which had induced him to hazard a journey to england at this juncture the impatience of his friends who were in exile had formed a scheme which was impracticable but although it had been as feasible as they had represented it to him yet no preparation had been made nor was anything ready to carry it into execution he was soon convinced that he had been deceived and therefore after a stay in london of five days only he returned to the place from whence he came dr king was in 1750 a keen jacobite as may be inferred from the visit made by him to the prince under such circumstances and from his being one of that unfortunate persons chosen correspondents he as well as other men of sense and observation began to despair of making their fortune in the party which they had chosen it was indeed sufficiently dangerous for during the short visit just described one of dr kings servants remarked the strangers likeness to prince charles whom he recognized from the common busts  the occasion taken for breaking up the stuart interest we shall tell in dr kings own wordswhen he charles edward was in scotland he had a mistress whose name was walkinshaw and whose sister was at that time and is still housekeeper at leicester house some years after he was released from his prison and conducted out of france he sent for this girl who soon acquired such a dominion over him that she was acquainted with all his schemes and trusted with his most secret correspondence as soon as this was known in england all those persons of distinction who were attached to him were greatly alarmed they imagined that this wench had been placed in his family by the english ministers and considering her sisters situation they seemed to have some ground for their suspicion wherefore they dispatched a gentleman to paris where the prince then was who had instructions to insist that mrs walkinshaw should be removed to a convent for a certain term but her gallant absolutely refused to comply with this demand and although mr mnamara the gentleman who was sent to him who has a natural eloquence and an excellent understanding urged the most cogent reasons and used all the arts of persuasion to induce him to part with his mistress and even proceeded so far as to assure him according to his instructions that an immediate interruption of all correspondence with his most powerful friends in england and in short that the ruin of his interest which was now daily increasing would be the infallible consequence of his refusal yet he continued inflexible and all mnamaras entreaties and remonstrances were ineffectual mnamara stayed in paris some days beyond the time prescribed him endeavouring to reason the prince into a better temper but finding him obstinately persevere in his first answer he took his leave with concern and indignation saying as he passed out what has your family done sir thus to draw down the vengeance of heaven on every branch of it through so many ages it is worthy of remark that in all the conferences which mnamara had with the prince on this occasion the latter declared that it was not a violent passion or indeed any particular regard which attached him to mrs walkinshaw and that he could see her removed from him without any concern but he would not receive directions in respect to his private conduct from any man alive when mnamara returned to london and reported the princes answer to the gentlemen who had employed him they were astonished and confounded however they soon resolved on the measures which they were to pursue for the future and determined no longer to serve a man who could not be persuaded to serve himself and chose rather to endanger the lives of his best and most faithful friends than part with an harlot whom as he often declared he neither loved nor esteemed  from this anecdote the general truth of which is indubitable the principal fault of charles edwards temper is sufficiently obvious it was a high sense of his own importance and an obstinate adherence to what he had once determined onqualities which if he had succeeded in his bold attempt gave the nation little room to hope that he would have been found free from the love of prerogative and desire of arbitrary power which characterized his unhappy grandfather he gave a notable instance how far this was the leading feature of his character when for no reasonable cause that can be assigned he placed his own single will in opposition to the necessities of france which in order to purchase a peace become necessary to the kingdom was reduced to gratify britain by prohibiting the residence of charles within any part of the french dominions it was in vain that france endeavoured to lessen the disgrace of this step by making the most flattering offers in hopes to induce the prince of himself to anticipate this disagreeable alternative which if seriously enforced as it was likely to be he had no means whatever of resisting by leaving the kingdom as of his own free will inspired however by the spirit of hereditary obstinacy charles preferred a useless resistance to a dignified submission and by a series of idle bravadoes laid the french court under the necessity of arresting their late ally and sending him to close confinement in the bastille from which he was afterwards sent out of the french dominions much in the manner in which a convict is transported to the place of his destination  in addition to these repeated instances of a rash and inflexible temper dr king also adds faults alleged to belong to the princes character of a kind less consonant with his noble birth and high pretensions he is said by this author to have been avaricious or parsimonious at least to such a degree of meanness as to fail even when he had ample means in relieving the sufferers who had lost their fortune and sacrificed all in his illfated attempt the approach is thus expressed by dr king who brings the chargebut the most odious part of his character is his love of money a vice which i do not remember to have been imputed by our historians to any of his ancestors and is the certain index of a base and little mind i know it may be urged in his vindication that a prince in exile ought to be an economist and so he ought but nevertheless his purse should be always open as long as there is anything in it to relieve the necessities of his friends and adherents king charles ii during his banishment would have shared the last pistole in his pocket with his little family but i have known this gentleman with two thousand louisdors in his strongbox pretend he was in great distress and borrow money from a lady in paris who was not in affluent circumstances his most faithful servants who had closely attended him in all his difficulties were ill rewardedkings memoirs we must receive however with some degree of jealousy what is said by dr king on this subject recollecting that he had left at least if he did not desert the standard of the unfortunate prince and was not therefore a person who was likely to form the fairest estimate of his virtues and faults we must also remember that if the exiled prince gave little he had but little to give especially considering how late he nourished the scheme of another expedition to scotland for which he was long endeavouring to hoard money  the case also of charles edward must be allowed to have been a difficult one he had to satisfy numerous persons who having lost their all in his cause had with that all seen the extinction of hopes which they accounted nearly as good as certainties some of these were perhaps clamorous in their applications and certainly ill pleased with their want of success other parts of the chevaliers conduct may have afforded grounds for charging him with coldness to the sufferings of his devoted followers one of these was a sentiment which has nothing in it that is generous but it was certainly a principle in which the young prince was trained and which may be too probably denominated peculiar to his family educated in all the high notions of passive obedience and nonresistance if the unhappy prince gave implicit faith to the professions of statesmen holding such notions which is implied by his whole conduct      redgauntlet     letter i  darsie latimer to alan fairford  dumfries  cur me exanimas querelis tuis in plain english why do you deafen me with your croaking the disconsolate tone in which you bade me farewell at noble house the first stage on the road from edinburgh to dumfries via moffat and mounted your miserable hack to return to your law drudgery still sounds in my ears it seemed to say happy dog you can ramble at pleasure over hill and dale pursue every object of curiosity that presents itself and relinquish the chase when it loses interest while i your senior and your better must in this brilliant season return to my narrow chamber and my musty books  such was the import of the reflections with which you saddened our parting bottle of claret and thus i must needs interpret the terms of your melancholy adieu  and why should this be so alan why the deuce should you not be sitting precisely opposite to me at this moment in the same comfortable george inn thy heels on the fender and thy juridical brow expanding its plications as a pun rose in your fancy above all why when i fill this very glass of wine cannot i push the bottle to you and say fairford you are chased why i say should not all this be except because alan fairford has not the same true sense of friendship as darsie latimer and will not regard our purses as common as well as our sentiments  i am alone in the world my only guardian writes to me of a large fortune which will be mine when i reach the age of twentyfive complete my present income is thou knowest more than sufficient for all my wants and yet thoutraitor as thou art to the cause of friendshipdost deprive me of the pleasure of thy society and submittest besides to selfdenial on thine own part rather than my wanderings should cost me a few guineas more is this regard for my purse or for thine own pride is it not equally absurd and unreasonable whichever source it springs from for myself i tell thee i have and shall have more than enough for both this same methodical samuel griffiths of ironmonger lane guildhall london whose letter arrives as duly as quarterday has sent me as i told thee double allowance for this my twentyfirst birthday and an assurance in his brief fashion that it will be again doubled for the succeeding years until i enter into possession of my own property still i am to refrain from visiting england until my twentyfifth year expires and it is recommended that i shall forbear all inquiries concerning my family and so forth for the present  were it not that i recollect my poor mother in her deep widows weeds with a countenance that never smiled but when she looked on meand then in such wan and woful sort as the sun when he glances through an april cloudwere it not i say that her mild and matronlike form and countenance forbid such a suspicion i might think myself the son of some indian director or rich citizen who had more wealth than grace and a handful of hypocrisy to boot and who was breeding up privately and obscurely enriching one of whose existence he had some reason to be ashamed but as i said before i think on my mother and am convinced as much as of the existence of my own soul that no touch of shame could arise from aught in which she was implicated meantime i am wealthy and i am alone and why does my friend scruple to share my wealth  are you not my only friend and have you not acquired a right to share my wealth answer me that alan fairford when i was brought from the solitude of my mothers dwelling into the tumult of the gaits class at the high schoolwhen i was mocked for my english accentsalted with snow as a southernrolled in the gutter for a saxon pockpuddingwho with stout arguments and stouter blows stood forth my defenderwhy alan fairford who beat me soundly when i brought the arrogance of an only son and of course a spoiled urchin to the forms of the little republicwhy alan and who taught me to smoke a cobbler pin a losen head a bicker and hold the bannetsbreak a window head a skirmish with stones and hold the bonnet or handkerchief which used to divide high school boys when fighting alan once more if i became the pride of the yards and the dread of the hucksters in the high school wynd it was under thy patronage and but for thee i had been contented with humbly passing through the cowgate port without climbing over the top of it and had never seen the kittle ninesteps nearer than from barefords parks a pass on the very brink of the castle rock to the north by which it is just possible for a goat or a high school boy to turn the corner of the building where it rises from the edge of the precipice this was so favourite a feat with the hell and neck boys of the higher classes that at one time sentinels were posted to prevent its repetition one of the ninesteps was rendered more secure because the climber could take hold of the root of a nettle so precarious were the means of passing this celebrated spot the manning the cowgate port especially in snowball time was also a choice amusement as it offered an inaccessible station for the boys who used these missiles to the annoyance of the passengers the gateway is now demolished and probably most of its garrison lie as low as the fortress to recollect that the author himself however naturally disqualified was one of those juvenile dreadnoughts is a sad reflection to one who cannot now step over a brook without assistance  you taught me to keep my fingers off the weak and to clench my fist against the strongto carry no tales out of schoolto stand forth like a true manobey the stern order of a pande manum and endure my pawmies without wincing like one that is determined not to be the better for them in a word before i knew thee i knew nothing  at college it was the same when i was incorrigibly idle your example and encouragement roused me to mental exertion and showed me the way to intellectual enjoyment you made me an historian a metaphysician invita minervanay by heaven you had almost made an advocate of me as well as of yourself yes rather than part with you alan i attended a weary season at the scotch law class a wearier at the civil and with what excellent advantage my notebook filled with caricatures of the professors and my fellow students is it not yet extant to testify     thus far have i held on with thee untired  and to say truth purely and solely that i might travel the same road with thee but it will not do alan by my faith man i could as soon think of being one of those ingenious traders who cheat little master jackies on the outside of the partition with tops balls bats and battledores as a member of the longrobed fraternity within who impose on grown country gentlemen with bouncing brocards of law the hall of the parliament house of edinburgh was in former days divided into two unequal portions by a partition the inner side of which was consecrated to the use of the courts of justice and the gentlemen of the law while the outer division was occupied by the stalls of stationers toymen and the like as in a modern bazaar from the old play of the plain dealer it seems such was formerly the case with westminster hall minos has now purified his courts in both cities from all traffic but his own now dont you read this to your worthy father alanhe loves me well enough i know of a saturday night but he thinks me but idle company for any other day of the week and here i suspect lies your real objection to taking a ramble with me through the southern counties in this delicious weather i know the good gentleman has hard thoughts of me for being so unsettled as to leave edinburgh before the session rises perhaps too he quarrels a littlei will not say with my want of ancestry but with my want of connexions he reckons me a lone thing in this world alan and so in good truth i am and it seems a reason to him why you should not attach yourself to me that i can claim no interest in the general herd  do not suppose i forget what i owe him for permitting me to shelter for four years under his roof my obligations to him are not the less but the greater if he never heartily loved me he is angry too that i will not or cannot be a lawyer and with reference to you considers my disinclination that way as pessimi exempli as he might say  but he need not be afraid that a lad of your steadiness will be influenced by such a reed shaken by the winds as i am you will go on doubting with dirleton and resolving those doubts with stewart sir john nisbett of dirletons doubts and questions upon the law especiallly of scotland and sir james stewarts dirletons doubts and questions on the law of scotland resolved and answered are works of authority in scottish jurisprudence as is generally the case the doubts are held more in respect than the solution until the cramp speech till of late years every advocate who catered at the scottish bar made a latin address to the court faculty and audience in set terms and said a few words upon a text of the civil law to show his latinity and jurisprudence he also wore his hat for a minute in order to vindicate his right of being covered before the court which is said to have originated from the celebrated lawyer sir thomas hope having two sons on the bench while he himself remained at the bar of late this ceremony has been dispensed with as occupying the time of the court unnecessarily the entrant lawyer merely takes the oaths to government and swears to maintain the rules and privileges of his order has been spoken more solito from the corner of the bench and with covered headuntil you have sworn to defend the liberties and privileges of the college of justiceuntil the black gown is hung on your shoulders and you are free as any of the faculty to sue or defend then will i step forth alan and in a character which even your father will allow may be more useful to you than had i shared this splendid termination of your legal studies in a word if i cannot be a counsel i am determined to be a client a sort of person without whom a lawsuit would be as dull as a supposed case yes i am determined to give you your first fee one can easily i am assured get into a lawsuitit is only the getting out which is sometimes found troublesomeand with your kind father for an agent and you for my counsel learned in the law and the worshipful master samuel griffiths to back me a few sessions shall not tire my patience in short i will make my way into court even if it should cost me the committing a delict or at least a quasi delictyou see all is not lost of what erskine wrote and wallace taught  thus far i have fooled it off well enough and yet alan all is not at ease within me i am affected with a sense of loneliness the more depressing that it seems to me to be a solitude peculiarly my own in a country where all the world have a circle of consanguinity extending to sixth cousins at least i am a solitary individual having only one kind heart to throb in unison with my own if i were condemned to labour for my bread methinks i should less regard this peculiar species of deprivation the necessary communication of master and servant would be at least a tie which would attach me to the rest of my kindas it is my very independence seems to enhance the peculiarity of my situation i am in the world as a stranger in the crowded coffeehouse where he enters calls for what refreshment he wants pays his bill and is forgotten so soon as the waiters mouth has pronounced his thank ye sir  i know your good father would term this sinning my mercies a peculiar scottish phrase expressive of ingratitude for the favours of providence and ask how i should feel if instead of being able to throw down my reckoning i were obliged to deprecate the resentment of the landlord for consuming that which i could not pay for i cannot tell how it is but though this very reasonable reflection comes across me and though i do confess that four hundred a year in possession eight hundred in near prospect and the ld knows how many hundreds more in the distance are very pretty and comfortable things yet i would freely give one half of them to call your father father though he should scold me for my idleness every hour of the day and to call you brother though a brother whose merits would throw my own so completely into the shade  the faint yet not improbable belief has often come across me that your father knows something more about my birth and condition than he is willing to communicate it is so unlikely that i should be left in edinburgh at six years old without any other recommendation than the regular payment of my board to old m probably mathieson the predecessor of dr adams to whose memory the author and his contemporaries owe a deep debt of gratitude of the high school before that time as i have often told you i have but a recollection of unbounded indulgence on my mothers part and the most tyrannical exertion of caprice on my own i remember still how bitterly she sighed how vainly she strove to soothe me while in the full energy of despotism i roared like ten bullcalves for something which it was impossible to procure for me she is dead that kind that illrewarded mother i remember the long facesthe darkened roomsthe black hangingsthe mysterious impression made upon my mind by the hearse and mourning coaches and the difficulty which i had to reconcile all this to the disappearance of my mother i do not think i had before this event formed any idea of death or that i had even heard of that final consummation of all that lives the first acquaintance which i formed with it deprived me of my only relation  a clergyman of venerable appearance our only visitor was my guide and companion in a journey of considerable length and in the charge of another elderly man substituted in his place i know not how or why i completed my journey to scotlandand this is all i recollect  i repeat the little history now as i have a hundred times before merely because i would wring some sense out of it turn then thy sharp wiredrawing lawyerlike ingenuity to the same taskmake up my history as though thou wert shaping the blundering allegations of some bluebonneted hardheaded client into a condescendence of facts and circumstances and thou shalt be not my apolloquid tibi cum lyrabut my lord stair celebrated as a scottish lawyer meanwhile i have written myself out of my melancholy and blue devils merely by prosing about them so i will now converse half an hour with roan robin in his stallthe rascal knows me already and snickers whenever i cross the threshold of the stable  the black which you bestrode yesterday morning promises to be an admirable roadster and ambled as easily with sam and the portmanteau as with you and your load of lawlearning sam promises to be steady and has hitherto been so no long trial you will say he lays the blame of former inaccuracies on evil companythe people who were at the liverystable were too seductive i supposehe denies he ever did the horse injusticewould rather have wanted his own dinner he says in this i believe him as roan robins ribs and coat show no marks of contradiction however as he will meet with no saints in the inns we frequent and as oats are sometimes as speedily converted into ale as john barleycorn himself i shall keep a lookout after master sam stupid fellow had he not abused my good nature i might have chatted to him to keep my tongue in exercise whereas now i must keep him at a distance  do you remember what mr fairford said to me on this subjectit did not become my fathers son to speak in that manner to sams fathers son i asked you what your father could possibly know of mine and you answered as much you supposed as he knew of samsit was a proverbial expression this did not quite satisfy me though i am sure i cannot tell why it should not but i am returning to a fruitless and exhausted subject do not be afraid that i shall come back on this welltrodden yet pathless field of conjecture i know nothing so useless so utterly feeble and contemptible as the groaning forth ones lamentations into the ears of our friends  i would fain promise you that my letters shall be as entertaining as i am determined they shall be regular and well filled we have an advantage over the dear friends of old every pair of them neither david and jonathan nor orestes and pylades nor damon and pythiasalthough in the latter case particularly a letter by post would have been very acceptableever corresponded together for they probably could not write and certainly had neither post nor franks to speed their effusions to each other whereas yours which you had from the old peer being handled gently and opened with precaution may be returned to me again and serve to make us free of his majestys post office during the whole time of my proposed tour it is well known and remembered that when members of parliament enjoyed the unlimited privilege of franking by the mere writing the name on the cover it was extended to the most extraordinary occasions one noble lord to express his regard for a particular regiment franked a letter for every rank and file it was customary also to save the covers and return them in order that the correspondence might be carried on as long as the envelopes could hold together mercy upon us alan what letters i shall have to send to you with an account of all that i can collect of pleasant or rare in this wildgoose jaunt of mine all i stipulate is that you do not communicate them to the scots magazine for though you used in a lefthanded way to compliment me on my attainments in the lighter branches of literature at the expense of my deficiency in the weightier matters of the law i am not yet audacious enough to enter the portal which the learned ruddiman so kindly opened for the acolytes of the musesvale sis memor mei d l  ps direct to the post office here i shall leave orders to forward your letters wherever i may travel     letter ii  alan fairford to darsie latimer  negatur my dear darsieyou have logic and law enough to understand the word of denial i deny your conclusion the premises i admit namely that when i mounted on that infernal hack i might utter what seemed a sigh although i deemed it lost amid the puffs and groans of the brokenwinded brute matchless in the complication of her complaints by any save she the poor mans mare renowned in song that died    a mile aboon dundee   alluding as all scotsmen know to the humorous old song   the auld mans mares dead   the puir mans mares dead   the auld mans mares dead   a mile aboon dundee  but credit me darsie the sigh which escaped me concerned thee more than myself and regarded neither the superior mettle of your cavalry nor your greater command of the means of travelling i could certainly have cheerfully ridden with you for a few days and assure yourself i would not have hesitated to tax your better filled purse for our joint expenses but you know my father considers every moment taken from the law as a step down hill and i owe much to his anxiety on my account although its effects are sometimes troublesome for example  i found on my arrival at the shop in browns square that the old gentleman had returned that very evening impatient it seems of remaining a night out of the guardianship of the domestic lares having this information from james whose brow wore rather an anxious look on the occasion i dispatched a highland chairman to the livery stable with my bucephalus and slunk with as little noise as might be into my own den where i began to mumble certain halfgnawed and not halfdigested doctrines of our municipal code i was not long seated when my fathers visage was thrust in a peering sort of way through the halfopened door and withdrawn on seeing my occupation with a halfarticulated humph which seemed to convey a doubt of the seriousness of my application if it were so i cannot condemn him for recollection of thee occupied me so entirely during an hours reading that although stair lay before me and notwithstanding that i turned over three or four pages the sense of his lordships clear and perspicuous style so far escaped me that i had the mortification to find my labour was utterly in vain  ere i had brought up my leeway james appeared with his summons to our frugal supperradishes cheese and a bottle of the old aleonly two plates thoughand no chair set for mr darsie by the attentive james wilkinson said james with his long face lank hair and very long pigtail in its leathern strap was placed as usual at the back of my fathers chair upright as a wooden sentinel at the door of a puppetshow you may go down james said my father and exit wilkinsonwhat is to come next thought i for the weather is not clear on the paternal brow  my boots encountered his first glance of displeasure and he asked me with a sneer which way i had been riding he expected me to answer nowhere and would then have been at me with his usual sarcasm touching the humour of walking in shoes at twenty shillings a pair but i answered with composure that i had ridden out to dinner as far as noble house he started you know his way as if i had said that i had dined at jericho and as i did not choose to seem to observe his surprise but continued munching my radishes in tranquillity he broke forth in ire  to noble house sir and what had you to do at noble house sir do you remember you are studying law sirthat your scots law trials are coming on sirthat every moment of your time just now is worth hours at another timeand have you leisure to go to noble house sirand to throw your books behind you for so many hourshad it been a turn in the meadows or even a game at golfbut noble house sir  i went so far with darsie latimer sir to see him begin his journey  darsie latimer he replied in a softened tonehumphwell i do not blame you for being kind to darsie latimer but it would have done as much good if you had walked with him as far as the tollbar and then made your farewellsit would have saved horsehireand your reckoning too at dinner  latimer paid that sir i replied thinking to soften the matter but i had much better have left it unspoken  the reckoning sir replied my father and did you sponge upon any man for a reckoning sir no man should enter the door of a publichouse without paying his lawing  i admit the general rule sir i replied but this was a partingcup between darsie and me and i should conceive it fell under the exception of doch an dorroch  you think yourself a wit said my father with as near an approach to a smile as ever he permits to gild the solemnity of his features but i reckon you did not eat your dinner standing like the jews at their passover and it was decided in a case before the townbailies of cuparangus when luckie simpsons cow had drunk up luckie jamiesons browst of ale while it stood in the door to cool that there was no damage to pay because the crummie drank without sitting down such being the very circumstance constituting doch an dorroch which is a standing drink for which no reckoning is paid ha sir what says your advocateship fieri to that exeptio firmat regulambut come fill your glass alan i am not sorry ye have shown this attention to darsie latimer who is a good lad as times go and having now lived under my roof since he left the school why there is really no great matter in coming under this small obligation to him  as i saw my fathers scruples were much softened by the consciousness of his superiority in the legal argument i took care to accept my pardon as a matter of grace rather than of justice and only replied we should feel ourselves duller of an evening now that you were absent i will give you my fathers exact words in reply darsie you know him so well that they will not offend you and you are also aware that there mingles with the good mans preciseness and formality a fund of shrewd observation and practical good sense  it is very true he said darsie was a pleasant companionbut over waggish over waggish alan and somewhat scatterbrainedby the way wilkinson must get our ale bottled in english pints now for a quart bottle is too much night after night for you and me without his assistancebut darsie as i was saying is an arch lad and somewhat light in the upper storyi wish him well through the world but he has little solidity alan little solidity  i scorn to desert an absent friend darsie so i said for you a little more than my conscience warranted but your defection from your legal studies had driven you far to leeward in my fathers good opinion  unstable as water he shall not excel said my father or as the septuagint hath it efusa est sicut aquanon crescat he goeth to dancinghouses and readeth novelssat est  i endeavoured to parry these texts by observing that the dancinghouses amounted only to one night at la piques ballthe novels so far as matter of notoriety darsie to an odd volume of tom jones  but he danced from night to morning replied my father and he read the idle trash which the author should have been scourged for at least twenty times over it was never out of his hand  i then hinted that in all probability your fortune was now so easy as to dispense with your prosecuting the law any further than you had done and therefore you might think you had some title to amuse yourself this was the least palatable argument of all  if he cannot amuse himself with the law said my father snappishly it is the worse for him if he needs not law to teach him to make a fortune i am sure he needs it to teach him how to keep one and it would better become him to be learning this than to be scouring the country like a landlouper going he knows not where to see he knows not what and giving treats at noble house to fools like himself an angry glance at poor me noble house indeed he repeated with elevated voice and sneering tone as if there were something offensive to him in the name though i will venture to say that any place in which you had been extravagant enough to spend five shillings would have stood as deep in his reprobation  mindful of your idea that my father knows more of your real situation than he thinks proper to mention i thought i would hazard a fishing observation i did not see i said how the scottish law would be useful to a young gentleman whose fortune would seem to be vested in englandi really thought my father would have beat me  dye mean to come round me sir per ambages as counsellor pest says what is it to you where darsie latimers fortune is vested or whether he hath any fortune aye or no and what ill would the scottish law do to him though he had as much of it as either stair or bankton sir is not the foundation of our municipal law the ancient code of the roman empire devised at a time when it was so much renowned for its civil polity sir and wisdom go to your bed sir after your expedition to noble house and see that your lamp be burning and your book before you ere the sun peeps ars longa vita breviswere it not a sin to call the divine science of the law by the inferior name of art  so my lamp did burn dear darsie the next morning though the owner took the risk of a domiciliary visitation and lay snug in bed trusting its glimmer might without further inquiry be received as sufficient evidence of his vigilance and now upon this the third morning after your departure things are but little better for though the lamp burns in my den and voet on the pandects hath his wisdom spread open before me yet as i only use him as a readingdesk on which to scribble this sheet of nonsense to darsie latimer it is probable the vicinity will be of little furtherance to my studies  and now methinks i hear thee call me an affected hypocritical varlet who living under such a system of distrust and restraint as my father chooses to govern by nevertheless pretends not to envy you your freedom and independence  latimer i will tell you no lies i wish my father would allow me a little more exercise of my free will were it but that i might feel the pleasure of doing what would please him of my own accord a little more spare time and a little more money to enjoy it would besides neither misbecome my age nor my condition and it is i own provoking to see so many in the same situation winging the air at freedom while i sit here caged up like a cobblers linnet to chant the same unvaried lesson from sunrise to sunset not to mention the listening to so many lectures against idleness as if i enjoyed or was making use of the means of amusement but then i cannot at heart blame either the motive or the object of this severity for the motive it is and can only be my fathers anxious devoted and unremitting affection and zeal for my improvement with a laudable sense of the honour of the profession to which he has trained me  as we have no near relations the tie betwixt us is of even unusual closeness though in itself one of the strongest which nature can form i am and have all along been the exclusive object of my fathers anxious hopes and his still more anxious and engrossing fears so what title have i to complain although now and then these fears and hopes lead him to take a troublesome and incessant charge of all my motions besides i ought to recollect and darsie i do recollect that my father upon various occasions has shown that he can be indulgent as well as strict the leaving his old apartments in the luckenbooths was to him like divorcing the soul from the body yet dr r did but hint that the better air of this new district was more favourable to my health as i was then suffering under the penalties of too rapid a growth when he exchanged his old and beloved quarters adjacent to the very heart of midlothian for one of those new tenements entire within themselves which modern taste has so lately introduced instance also the inestimable favour which he conferred on me by receiving you into his house when you had only the unpleasant alternative of remaining though a grownup lad in the society of mere boys the diminutive and obscure place called browns square was hailed about the time of its erection as an extremely elegant improvement upon the style of designing and erecting edinburgh residences each house was in the phrase used by appraisers finished within itself or in the still newer phraseology selfcontained it was built about the year 17634 and the old part of the city being near and accessible this square soon received many inhabitants who ventured to remove to so moderate a distance from the high street this was a thing so contrary to all my fathers ideas of seclusion of economy and of the safety to my morals and industry which he wished to attain by preserving me from the society of other young people that upon my word i am always rather astonished how i should have had the impudence to make the request than that he should have complied with it  then for the object of his solicitudedo not laugh or hold up your hands my good darsie but upon my word i like the profession to which i am in the course of being educated and am serious in prosecuting the preliminary studies the law is my vocationin an especial and i may say in an hereditary way my vocation for although i have not the honour to belong to any of the great families who form in scotland as in france the noblesse of the robe and with us at least carry their heads as high or rather higher than the noblesse of the swordfor the former consist more frequently of the firstborn of egyptyet my grandfather who i dare say was a most excellent person had the honour to sign a bitter protest against the union in the respectable character of townclerk to the ancient borough of birlthegroat and there is some reasonshall i say to hope or to suspectthat he may have been a natural son of a first cousin of the then fairford of that ilk who had been long numbered among the minor barons now my father mounted a step higher on the ladder of legal promotion being as you know as well as i do an eminent and respected writer to his majestys signet and i myself am destined to mount a round higher still and wear the honoured robe which is sometimes supposed like charity to cover a multitude of sins i have therefore no choice but to climb upwards since we have mounted thus high or else to fall down at the imminent risk of my neck so that i reconcile myself to my destiny and while you are looking from mountain peaks at distant lakes and firths i am de apicibus juris consoling myself with visions of crimson and scarlet gownswith the appendages of handsome cowls well lined with salary  you smile darsie more tuo and seem to say it is little worth while to cozen ones self with such vulgar dreams yours being on the contrary of a high and heroic character bearing the same resemblance to mine that a bench covered with purple cloth and plentifully loaded with session papers does to some gothic throne rough with barbaric pearl and gold but what would you havesua quemque trahit voluptas and my visions of preferment though they may be as unsubstantial at present are nevertheless more capable of being realized than your aspirations after the lord knows what what says my fathers proverb look to a gown of gold and you will at least get a sleeve of it such is my pursuit but what dost thou look to the chance that the mystery as you call it which at present overclouds your birth and connexions will clear up into something inexpressibly and inconceivably brilliant and this without any effort or exertion of your own but purely by the goodwill of fortune i know the pride and naughtiness of thy heart and sincerely do i wish that thou hadst more beatings to thank me for than those which thou dost acknowledge so gratefully then had i thumped these quixotical expectations out of thee and thou hadst not as now conceived thyself to be the hero of some romantic history and converted in thy vain imaginations honest griffiths citizen and broker who never bestows more than the needful upon his quarterly epistles into some wise alexander or sage alquife the mystical and magical protector of thy peerless destiny but i know not how it was thy skull got harder i think and my knuckles became softer not to mention that at length thou didst begin to show about thee a spark of something dangerous which i was bound to respect at least if i did not fear it  and while i speak of this it is not much amiss to advise thee to correct a little this cockahoop courage of thine i fear much that like a hotmettled horse it will carry the owner into some scrape out of which he will find it difficult to extricate himself especially if the daring spirit which bore thee thither should chance to fail thee at a pinch remember darsie thou art not naturally courageous on the contrary we have long since agreed that quiet as i am i have the advantage in this important particular my courage consists i think in strength of nerves and constitutional indifference to danger which though it never pushes me on adventure secures me in full use of my recollection and tolerably complete selfpossession when danger actually arrives now thine seems more what may be called intellectual courage highness of spirit and desire of distinction impulses which render thee alive to the love of fame and deaf to the apprehension of danger until it forces itself suddenly upon thee i own that whether it is from my having caught my fathers apprehensions or that i have reason to entertain doubts of my own i often think that this wildfire chase of romantic situation and adventure may lead thee into some mischief and then what would become of alan fairford they might make whom they pleased lord advocate or solicitorgeneral i should never have the heart to strive for it all my exertions are intended to vindicate myself one day in your eyes and i think i should not care a farthing for the embroidered silk gown more than for an old womans apron unless i had hopes that thou shouldst be walking the boards to admire and perhaps to envy me  that this may be the case i pritheebeware see not a dulcinea in every slipshod girl who with blue eyes fair hair a tattered plaid and a willowwand in her grip drives out the village cows to the loaning do not think you will meet a gallant valentine in every english rider or an orson in every highland drover view things as they are and not as they may be magnified through thy teeming fancy i have seen thee look at an old gravel pit till thou madest out capes and bays and inlets crags and precipices and the whole stupendous scenery of the isle of feroe in what was to all ordinary eyes a mere horsepond besides did i not once find thee gazing with respect at a lizard in the attitude of one who looks upon a crocodile now this is doubtless so far a harmless exercise of your imagination for the puddle cannot drown you nor the lilliputian alligator eat you up but it is different in society where you cannot mistake the character of those you converse with or suffer your fancy to exaggerate their qualities good or bad without exposing yourself not only to ridicule but to great and serious inconveniences keep guard therefore on your imagination my dear darsie and let your old friend assure you it is the point of your character most pregnant with peril to its good and generous owner adieu let not the franks of the worthy peer remain unemployed above all sis memor mei a f     letter iii  darsie latimer to alan fairford  shepherds bush  i have received thine absurd and most conceited epistle it is well for thee that lovelace and belfordlike we came under a convention to pardon every species of liberty which we may take with each other since upon my word there are some reflections in your last which would otherwise have obliged me to return forthwith to edinburgh merely to show you i was not what you took me for  why what a pair of prigs hast thou made of us i plunging into scrapes without having courage to get out of themthy sagacious self afraid to put one foot before the other lest it should run away from its companion and so standing still like a post out of mere faintness and coldness of heart while all the world were driving full speed past thee thou a portraitpainter i tell thee alan i have seen a better seated on the fourth round of a ladder and painting a barebreeched highlander holding a pintstoup as big as himself and a booted lowlander in a bobwig supporting a glass of like dimensions the whole being designed to represent the sign of the salutation  how hadst thou the heart to represent thine own individual self with all thy motions like those of a great dutch doll depending on the pressure of certain springs as duty reflection and the like without the impulse of which thou wouldst doubtless have me believe thou wouldst not budge an inch but have i not seen gravity out of his bed at midnight and must i in plain terms remind thee of certain mad pranks thou hadst ever with the gravest sentiments in thy mouth and the most starched reserve in thy manner a kind of lumbering proclivity towards mischief although with more inclination to set it agoing than address to carry it through and i cannot but chuckle internally when i think of having seen my most venerable monitor the future president of some high scottish court puffing blowing and floundering like a clumsy carthorse in a bog where his efforts to extricate himself only plunged him deeper at every awkward struggle till some onei myself for exampletook compassion on the moaning monster and dragged him out by mane and tail  as for me my portrait is if possible even more scandalously caricatured i fail or quail in spirit at the upcome where canst thou show me the least symptom of the recreant temper with which thou hast invested me as i trust merely to set off the solid and impassible dignity of thine own stupid indifference if you ever saw me tremble be assured that my flesh like that of the old spanish general only quaked at the dangers into which my spirit was about to lead it seriously alan this imputed poverty of spirit is a shabby charge to bring against your friend i have examined myself as closely as i can being in very truth a little hurt at your having such hard thoughts of me and on my life i can see no reason for them i allow you have perhaps some advantage of me in the steadiness and indifference of your temper but i should despise myself if i were conscious of the deficiency in courage which you seem willing enough to impute to me however i suppose this ungracious hint proceeds from sincere anxiety for my safety and so viewing it i swallow it as i would do medicine from a friendly doctor although i believed in my heart he had mistaken my complaint  this offensive insinuation disposed of i thank thee alan for the rest of thy epistle i thought i heard your good father pronouncing the word noble house with a mixture of contempt and displeasure as if the very name of the poor little hamlet were odious to him or as if you had selected out of all scotland the very place at which you had no call to dine but if he had had any particular aversion to that blameless village and very sorry inn is it not his own fault that i did not accept the invitation of the laird of glengallacher to shoot a buck in what he emphatically calls his country truth is i had a strong desire to have complied with his lairdships invitation to shoot a buck think how magnificent an idea to one who never shot anything but hedgesparrows and that with a horsepistol purchased at a brokers stand in the cowgate you who stand upon your courage may remember that i took the risk of firing the said pistol for the first time while you stood at twenty yards distance and that when you were persuaded it would go off without bursting forgetting all law but that of the biggest and strongest you possessed yourself of it exclusively for the rest of the holidays such a days sport was no complete introduction to the noble art of deerstalking as it is practised in the highlands but i should not have scrupled to accept honest glengallachers invitation at the risk of firing a rifle for the first time had it not been for the outcry which your father made at my proposal in the full ardour of his zeal for king george the hanover succession and the presbyterian faith i wish i had stood out since i have gained so little upon his good opinion by submission all his impressions concerning the highlanders are taken from the recollections of the fortyfive when he retreated from the west port with his brother volunteers each to the fortalice of his own separate dwelling so soon as they heard the adventurer was arrived with his clans as near them as kirkliston the flight of falkirkparma non bene selectain which i think your sire had his share with the undaunted western regiment does not seem to have improved his taste for the company of the highlanders quaere alan dost thou derive the courage thou makest such boast of from an hereditary source and stories of rob roy macgregor and sergeant alan mhor cameron have served to paint them in still more sable colours to his imagination of rob roy we have had more than enough alan cameron commonly called sergeant mhor a freebooter of the same period was equally remarkable for strength courage and generosity  now from all i can understand these ideas as applied to the present state of the country are absolutely chimerical the pretender is no more remembered in the highlands than if the poor gentleman were gathered to his hundred and eight fathers whose portraits adorn the ancient walls of holyrood the broadswords have passed into other hands the targets are used to cover the butter churns and the race has sunk or is fast sinking from ruffling bullies into tame cheaters indeed it was partly my conviction that there is little to be seen in the north which arriving at your fathers conclusions though from different premisses inclined my course in this direction where perhaps i shall see as little  one thing however i have seen and it was with pleasure the more indescribable that i was debarred from treading the land which my eyes were permitted to gaze upon like those of the dying prophet from top of mount pisgahi have seen in a word the fruitful shores of merry england merry england of which i boast myself a native and on which i gaze even while raging floods and unstable quicksands divide us with the filial affection of a dutiful son  thou canst not have forgotten alanfor when didst thou ever forget what was interesting to thy friendthat the same letter from my friend griffiths which doubled my income and placed my motions at my own free disposal contained a prohibitory clause by which reason none assigned i was prohibited as i respected my present safety and future fortunes from visiting england every other part of the british dominions and a tour if i pleased on the continent being left to my own choicewhere is the tale alan of a covered dish in the midst of a royal banquet upon which the eyes of every guest were immediately fixed neglecting all the dainties with which the table was loaded this cause of banishment from englandfrom my native countryfrom the land of the brave and the wise and the freeaffects me more than i am rejoiced by the freedom and independence assigned to me in all other respects thus in seeking this extreme boundary of the country which i am forbidden to tread i resemble the poor tethered horse which you may have observed is always grazing on the very verge of the circle to which it is limited by its halter  do not accuse me of romance for obeying this impulse towards the south nor suppose that to satisfy the imaginary longing of an idle curiosity i am in any danger of risking the solid comforts of my present condition whoever has hitherto taken charge of my motions has shown me by convincing proofs more weighty than the assurances which they have witheld that my real advantage is their principal object i should be therefore worse than a fool did i object to their authority even when it seems somewhat capriciously exercised for assuredly at my age i mightintrusted as i am with the care and management of myself in every other particularexpect that the cause of excluding me from england should be frankly and fairly stated for my own consideration and guidance however i will not grumble about the matter i shall know the whole story one day i suppose and perhaps as you sometimes surmise i shall not find there is any mighty matter in it after all  yet one cannot help wonderingbut plague on it if i wonder any longer my letter will be as full of wonders as one of katterfeltos advertisements i have a months mind instead of this damnable iteration of guesses and forebodings to give thee the history of a little adventure which befell me yesterday though i am sure you will as usual turn the opposite side of the spyglass on my poor narrative and reduce more tuo to the most petty trivialities the circumstance to which thou accusest me of giving undue consequence hang thee alan thou art as unfit a confidant for a youthful gallant with some spice of imagination as the old taciturn secretary of facardin of trebizond nevertheless we must each perform our separate destinies i am doomed to see act and tell thou like a dutchman enclosed in the same diligence with a gascon to hear and shrug thy shoulders  of dumfries the capital town of this county i have but little to say and will not abuse your patience by reminding you that it is built on the gallant river nith and that its churchyard the highest place of the old town commands an extensive and fine prospect neither will i take the travellers privilege of inflicting upon you the whole history of bruce poniarding the red comyn in the church of the dominicans at this place and becoming a king and patriot because he had been a churchbreaker and a murderer the present dumfriezers remember and justify the deed observing it was only a papist churchin evidence whereof its walls have been so completely demolished that no vestiges of them remain they are a sturdy set of trueblue presbyterians these burghers of dumfries men after your fathers own heart zealous for the protestant successionthe rather that many of the great families around are suspected to be of a different way of thinking and shared a great many of them in the insurrection of the fifteen and some in the more recent business of the fortyfive the town itself suffered in the latter era for lord elcho with a large party of the rebels levied a severe contribution upon dumfries on account of the citizens having annoyed the rear of the chevalier during his march into england  many of these particulars i learned from provost c who happening to see me in the marketplace remembered that i was an intimate of your fathers and very kindly asked me to dinner pray tell your father that the effects of his kindness to me follow me everywhere i became tired however of this pretty town in the course of twentyfour hours and crept along the coast eastwards amusing myself with looking out for objects of antiquity and sometimes making or attempting to make use of my new anglingrod by the way old cottons instructions by which i hoped to qualify myself for one of the gentle society of anglers are not worth a farthing for this meridian i learned this by mere accident after i had waited four mortal hours i shall never forget an impudent urchin a cowherd about twelve years old without either brogue or bonnet barelegged and with a very indifferent pair of breecheshow the villain grinned in scorn at my landingnet my plummet and the gorgeous jury of flies which i had assembled to destroy all the fish in the river i was induced at last to lend the rod to the sneering scoundrel to see what he would make of it and he had not only half filled my basket in an hour but literally taught me to kill two trouts with my own hand this and sam having found the hay and oats not forgetting the ale very good at this small inn first made me take the fancy of resting here for a day or two and i have got my grinning blackguard of a piscator leave to attend on me by paying sixpence a day for a herdboy in his stead  a notably clean englishwoman keeps this small house and my bedroom is sweetened with lavender has a clean sashwindow and the walls are moreover adorned with ballads of fair rosamond and cruel barbara allan the womans accent though uncouth enough sounds yet kindly in my ear for i have never yet forgotten the desolate effect produced on my infant organs when i heard on all sides your slow and broad northern pronunciation which was to me the tone of a foreign land i am sensible i myself have since that time acquired scotch in perfection and many a scotticism withal still the sound of the english accentuation comes to my ears as the tones of a friend and even when heard from the mouth of some wandering beggar it has seldom failed to charm forth my mite you scotch who are so proud of your own nationality must make due allowance for that of other folks  on the next morning i was about to set forth to the stream where i had commenced angler the night before but was prevented by a heavy shower of rain from stirring abroad the whole forenoon during all which time i heard my varlet of a guide as loud with his blackguard jokes in the kitchen as a footman in the shilling gallery so little are modesty and innocence the inseparable companions of rusticity and seclusion  when after dinner the day cleared and we at length sallied out to the river side i found myself subjected to a new trick on the part of my accomplished preceptor apparently he liked fishing himself better than the trouble of instructing an awkward novice such as i and in hopes of exhausting my patience and inducing me to resign the rod as i had done the preceding day my friend contrived to keep me thrashing the water more than an hour with a pointless hook i detected this trick at last by observing the rogue grinning with delight when he saw a large trout rise and dash harmless away from the angle i gave him a sound cuff alan but the next moment was sorry and to make amends yielded possession of the fishingrod for the rest of the evening he undertaking to bring me home a dish of trouts for my supper in atonement for his offences  having thus got honourably rid of the trouble of amusing myself in a way i cared not for i turned my steps towards the sea or rather the solway firth which here separates the two sister kingdoms and which lay at about a miles distance by a pleasant walk over sandy knells covered with short herbage which you call links and we english downs  but the rest of my adventure would weary out my fingers and must be deferred until tomorrow when you shall hear from me by way of continuation and in the meanwhile to prevent overhasty conclusions i must just hint to you we are but yet on the verge of the adventure which it is my purpose to communicate     letter iv  the same to the same  shepherds bush  i mentioned in my last that having abandoned my fishingrod as an unprofitable implement i crossed over the open downs which divided me from the margin of the solway when i reached the banks of the great estuary which are here very bare and exposed the waters had receded from the large and level space of sand through which a stream now feeble and fordable found its way to the ocean the whole was illuminated by the beams of the low and setting sun who showed his ruddy front like a warrior prepared for defence over a huge battlemented and turreted wall of crimson and black clouds which appeared like an immense gothic fortress into which the lord of day was descending his setting rays glimmered bright upon the wet surface of the sands and the numberless pools of water by which it was covered where the inequality of the ground had occasioned their being left by the tide  the scene was animated by the exertions of a number of horsemen who were actually employed in hunting salmon aye alan lift up your hands and eyes as you will i can give their mode of fishing no name so appropriate for they chased the fish at full gallop and struck them with their barbed spears as you see hunters spearing boars in the old tapestry the salmon to be sure take the thing more quietly than the boars but they are so swift in their own element that to pursue and strike them is the task of a good horseman with a quick eye a determined hand and full command both of his horse and weapon the shouts of the fellows as they galloped up and down in the animating exercisetheir loud bursts of laughter when any of their number caught a falland still louder acclamations when any of the party made a capital stroke with his lancegave so much animation to the whole scene that i caught the enthusiasm of the sport and ventured forward a considerable space on the sands the feats of one horseman in particular called forth so repeatedly the clamorous applause of his companions that the very banks rang again with their shouts he was a tall man well mounted on a strong black horse which he caused to turn and wind like a bird in the air carried a longer spear than the others and wore a sort of fur cap or bonnet with a short feather in it which gave him on the whole rather a superior appearance to the other fishermen he seemed to hold some sort of authority among them and occasionally directed their motions both by voice and hand at which times i thought his gestures were striking and his voice uncommonly sonorous and commanding  the riders began to make for the shore and the interest of the scene was almost over while i lingered on the sands with my looks turned to the shores of england still gilded by the suns last rays and as it seemed scarce distant a mile from me the anxious thoughts which haunt me began to muster in my bosom and my feet slowly and insensibly approached the river which divided me from the forbidden precincts though without any formed intention when my steps were arrested by the sound of a horse galloping and as i turned the rider the same fisherman whom i had formerly distinguished called out to me in an abrupt manner soho brother you are too late for bowness tonightthe tide will make presently  i turned my head and looked at him without answering for to my thinking his sudden appearance or rather i should say his unexpected approach had amidst the gathering shadows and lingering light something in it which was wild and ominous  are you deaf he addedor are you mador have you a mind for the next world  i am a stranger i answered and had no other purpose than looking on at the fishingi am about to return to the side i came from  best make haste then said he he that dreams on the bed of the solway may wake in the next world the sky threatens a blast that will bring in the waves three feet abreast  so saying he turned his horse and rode off while i began to walk back towards the scottish shore a little alarmed at what i had heard for the tide advances with such rapidity upon these fatal sands that wellmounted horsemen lay aside hopes of safety if they see its white surge advancing while they are yet at a distance from the bank  these recollections grew more agitating and instead of walking deliberately i began a race as fast as i could feeling or thinking i felt each pool of salt water through which i splashed grow deeper and deeper at length the surface of the sand did seem considerably more intersected with pools and channels full of watereither that the tide was really beginning to influence the bed of the estuary or as i must own is equally probable that i had in the hurry and confusion of my retreat involved myself in difficulties which i had avoided in my more deliberate advance either way it was rather an unpromising state of affairs for the sands at the same time turned softer and my footsteps so soon as i had passed were instantly filled with water i began to have odd recollections concerning the snugness of your fathers parlour and the secure footing afforded by the pavement of browns square and scotts close when my better genius the tall fisherman appeared once more close to my side he and his sable horse looming gigantic in the now darkening twilight  are you mad he said in the same deep tone which had before thrilled on my ear or are you weary of your life you will be presently amongst the quicksands i professed my ignorance of the way to which he only replied there is no time for pratingget up behind me  he probably expected me to spring from the ground with the activity which these borderers have by constant practice acquired in everything relating to horsemanship but as i stood irresolute he extended his hand and grasping mine bid me place my foot on the toe of his boot and thus raised me in a trice to the croupe of his horse i was scarcely securely seated ere he shook the reins of his horse who instantly sprang forward but annoyed doubtless by the unusual burden treated us to two or three bounds accompanied by as many flourishes of his hind heels the rider sat like a tower notwithstanding that the unexpected plunging of the animal threw me forward upon him the horse was soon compelled to submit to the discipline of the spur and bridle and went off at a steady hand gallop thus shortening the devious for it was by no means a direct path by which the rider avoiding the loose quicksands made for the northern bank  my friend perhaps i may call him my preserverfor to a stranger my situation was fraught with real dangercontinued to press on at the same speedy pace but in perfect silence and i was under too much anxiety of mind to disturb him with any questions at length we arrived at a part of the shore with which i was utterly unacquainted when i alighted and began to return in the best fashion i could my thanks for the important service which he had just rendered me  the stranger only replied by an impatient pshaw and was about to ride off and leave me to my own resources when i implored him to complete his work of kindness by directing me to shepherds bush which was as i informed him my home for the present  to shepherds bush he said it is but three miles but if you know not the land better than the sand you may break your neck before you get there for it is no road for a moping boy in a dark night and besides there are the brook and the fens to cross  i was a little dismayed at this communication of such difficulties as my habits had not called on me to contend with once more the idea of thy fathers fireside came across me and i could have been well contented to have swapped the romance of my situation together with the glorious independence of control which i possessed at the moment for the comforts of that chimneycorner though i were obliged to keep my eyes chained to erskines larger institutes  i asked my new friend whether he could not direct me to any house of public entertainment for the night and supposing it probable he was himself a poor man i added with the conscious dignity of a wellfilled pocketbook that i could make it worth any mans while to oblige me the fisherman making no answer i turned away from him with as gallant an appearance of indifference as i could command and began to take as i thought the path which he had pointed out to me  his deep voice immediately sounded after me to recall me stay young man stayyou have mistaken the road alreadyi wonder your friends sent out such an inconsiderate youth without some one wiser than himself to take care of him  perhaps they might not have done so said i if i had any friends who cared about the matter  well sir he said it is not my custom to open my house to strangers but your pinch is like to be a smart one for besides the risk from bad roads fords and broken ground and the night which looks both black and gloomy there is bad company on the road sometimesat least it has a bad name and some have come to harm so that i think i must for once make my rule give way to your necessity and give you a nights lodging in my cottage  why was it alan that i could not help giving an involuntary shudder at receiving an invitation so seasonable in itself and so suitable to my naturally inquisitive disposition i easily suppressed this untimely sensation and as i returned thanks and expressed my hope that i should not disarrange his family i once more dropped a hint of my desire to make compensation for any trouble i might occasion the man answered very coldly your presence will no doubt give me trouble sir but it is of a kind which your purse cannot compensate in a word although i am content to receive you as my guest i am no publican to call a reckoning  i begged his pardon and at his instance once more seated myself behind hint upon the good horse which went forth steady as beforethe moon whenever she could penetrate the clouds throwing the huge shadow of the animal with its double burden on the wild and bare ground over which we passed  thou mayst laugh till thou lettest the letter fall if thou wilt but it reminded me of the magician atlantes on his hippogriff with a knight trussed up behind him in the manner ariosto has depicted that matter thou art i know matteroffact enough to affect contempt of that fascinating and delicious poem but think not that to conform with thy bad taste i shall forbear any suitable illustration which now or hereafter may occur to me  on we went the sky blackening around us and the wind beginning to pipe such a wild and melancholy tune as best suited the hollow sounds of the advancing tide which i could hear at a distance like the roar of some immense monster defrauded of its prey  at length our course was crossed by a deep dell or dingle such as they call in some parts of scotland a den and in others a cleuch or narrow glen it seemed by the broken glances which the moon continued to throw upon it to be steep precipitous and full of trees which are generally speaking rather scarce upon these shores the descent by which we plunged into this dell was both steep and rugged with two or three abrupt turnings but neither danger nor darkness impeded the motion of the black horse who seemed rather to slide upon his haunches than to gallop down the pass throwing me again on the shoulders of the athletic rider who sustaining no inconvenience by the circumstance continued to press the horse forward with his heel steadily supporting him at the same time by raising his bridlehand until we stood in safety at the bottom of the steepnot a little to my consolation as friend alan thou mayst easily conceive  a very short advance up the glen the bottom of which we had attained by this ugly descent brought us in front of two or three cottages one of which another blink of moonshine enabled me to rate as rather better than those of the scottish peasantry in this part of the world for the sashes seemed glazed and there were what are called stormwindows in the roof giving symptoms of the magnificence of a second story the scene around was very interesting for the cottages and the yards or crofts annexed to them occupied a haugh or helm of two acres which a brook of some consequence to judge from its roar had left upon one side of the little glen while finding its course close to the farther bank and which appeared to be covered and darkened with trees while the level space beneath enjoyed such stormy smiles as the moon had that night to bestow  i had little time for observation for my companions loud whistle seconded by an equally loud halloo speedily brought to the door of the principal cottage a man and a woman together with two large newfoundland dogs the deep baying of which i had for some time heard a yelping terrier or two which had joined the concert were silent at the presence of my conductor and began to whine jump up and fawn upon him the female drew back when she beheld a stranger the man who had a lighted lantern advanced and without any observation received the horse from my host and led him doubtless to stable while i followed my conductor into the house when we had passed the hallan the partition which divides a scottish cottage we entered a wellsized apartment with a clean brick floor where a fire blazed much to my contentment in the ordinary projecting sort of a chimney common in scottish houses there were stone seats within the chimney and ordinary utensils mixed with fishingspears nets and similar implements of sport were hung around the walls of the place the female who had first appeared at the door had now retreated into a side apartment she was presently followed by my guide after he had silently motioned me to a seat and their place was supplied by an elderly woman in a grey stuff gown with a check apron and toy obviously a menial though neater in her dress than is usual in her apparent rankan advantage which was counterbalanced by a very forbidding aspect but the most singular part of her attire in this very protestant country was a rosary in which the smaller beads were black oak and those indicating the paternoster of silver with a crucifix of the same metal  this person made preparations for supper by spreading a clean though coarse cloth over a large oaken table placing trenchers and salt upon it and arranging the fire to receive a gridiron i observed her motions in silence for she took no sort of notice of me and as her looks were singularly forbidding i felt no disposition to commence conversation  when this duenna had made all preliminary arrangements she took from the wellfilled pouch of my conductor which he had hung up by the door one or two salmon or grilses as the smaller sort are termed and selecting that which seemed best and in highest season began to cut it into slices and to prepare a grillade the savoury smell of which affected me so powerfully that i began sincerely to hope that no delay would intervene between the platter and the lip  as this thought came across me the man who had conducted the horse to the stable entered the apartment and discovered to me a countenance yet more uninviting than that of the old crone who was performing with such dexterity the office of cook to the party he was perhaps sixty years old yet his brow was not much furrowed and his jetblack hair was only grizzled not whitened by the advance of age all his motions spoke strength unabated and though rather undersized he had very broad shoulders was squaremade thinflanked and apparently combined in his frame muscular strength and activity the last somewhat impaired perhaps by years but the first remaining in full vigour a hard and harsh countenanceeyes far sunk under projecting eyebrows which were grizzled like his haira wide mouth furnished from ear to ear with it range of unimpaired teeth of uncommon whiteness and a size and breadth which might have become the jaws of an ogre completed this delightful portrait he was clad like a fisherman in jacket and trousers of the blue cloth commonly used by seamen and had a dutch caseknife like that of a hamburgh skipper stuck into a broad buff belt which seemed as if it might occasionally sustain weapons of a description still less equivocally calculated for violence  this man gave me an inquisitive and as i thought a sinister look upon entering the apartment but without any further notice of me took up the office of arranging the table which the old lady had abandoned for that of cooking the fish and with more address than i expected from a person of his coarse appearance placed two chairs at the head of the table and two stools below accommodating each seat to a cover beside which he placed an allowance of barleybread and a small jug which he replenished with ale from a large black jack three of these jugs were of ordinary earthenware but the fourth which he placed by the righthand cover at the upper end of the table was a flagon of silver and displayed armorial bearings beside this flagon he placed a saltcellar of silver handsomely wrought containing salt of exquisite whiteness with pepper and other spices a sliced lemon was also presented on a small silver salver the two large waterdogs who seemed perfectly to understand the nature of the preparations seated themselves one on each side of the table to be ready to receive their portion of the entertainment i never saw finer animals or which seemed to be more influenced by a sense of decorum excepting that they slobbered a little as the rich scent from the chimney was wafted past their noses the small dogs ensconced themselves beneath the table  i am aware that i am dwelling upon trivial and ordinary circumstances and that perhaps i may weary out your patience in doing so but conceive me alone in this strange place which seemed from the universal silence to be the very temple of harpocratesremember that this is my first excursion from homeforget not that the manner in which i had been brought hither had the dignity of danger and something the air of an adventure and that there was a mysterious incongruity in all i had hitherto witnessed and you will not i think be surprised that these circumstances though trifling should force themselves on my notice at the time and dwell in my memory afterwards  that a fisher who pursued the sport perhaps for his amusement as well as profit should be well mounted and better lodged than the lower class of peasantry had in it nothing surprising but there was something about all that i saw which seemed to intimate that i was rather in the abode of a decayed gentleman who clung to a few of the forms and observances of former rank than in that of a common peasant raised above his fellows by comparative opulence  besides the articles of plate which i have already noticed the old man now lighted and placed on the table a silver lamp or cruisie as the scottish term it filled with very pure oil which in burning diffused an aromatic fragrance and gave me a more perfect view of the cottage walls which i had hitherto only seen dimly by the light of the fire the bink the frame of wooden shelves placed in a scottish kitchen for holding plates with its usual arrangement of pewter and earthenware which was most strictly and critically clean glanced back the flame of the lamp merrily from one side of the apartment in a recess formed by the small bow of a latticed window was a large writingdesk of walnuttree wood curiously carved above which arose shelves of the same which supported a few books and papers the opposite side of the recess contained as far as i could discern for it lay in shadow and i could at any rate have seen it but imperfectly from the place where i was seated one or two guns together with swords pistols and other arms a collection which in a poor cottage and in a country so peaceful appeared singular at least if not even somewhat suspicious  all these observations you may suppose were made much sooner than i have recorded or you if you have not skipped have been able to read them they were already finished and i was considering how i should open some communication with the mute inhabitants of the mansion when my conductor reentered from the sidedoor by which he had made his exit  he had now thrown off his rough ridingcap and his coarse jockeycoat and stood before me in a grey jerkin trimmed with black which sat close to and set off his large and sinewy frame and a pair of trousers of a lighter colour cut as close to the body as they are used by highlandmen his whole dress was of finer cloth than that of the old man and his linen so minute was my observation clean and unsullied his shirt was without ruffles and tied at the collar with a black ribbon which showed his strong and muscular neck rising from it like that of an ancient hercules his head was small with a large forehead and wellformed ears he wore neither peruke nor hairpowder and his chestnut locks curling close to his head like those of an antique statue showed not the least touch of time though the owner must have been at least fifty his features were high and prominent in such a degree that one knew not whether to term them harsh or handsome in either case the sparkling grey eye aquiline nose and wellformed mouth combined to render his physiognomy noble and expressive an air of sadness or severity or of both seemed to indicate a melancholy and at the same time a haughty temper i could not help running mentally over the ancient heroes to whom i might assimilate the noble form and countenance before me he was too young and evinced too little resignation to his fate to resemble belisarius coriolanus standing by the hearth of tullus aufidius came nearer the mark yet the gloomy and haughty look of the stranger had perhaps still more of marius seated among the ruins of carthage  while i was lost in these imaginations my host stood by the fire gazing on me with the same attention which i paid to him until embarrassed by his look i was about to break silence at all hazards but the supper now placed upon the table reminded me by its appearance of those wants which i had almost forgotten while i was gazing on the fine form of my conductor he spoke at length and i almost started at the deep rich tone of his voice though what he said was but to invite me to sit down to the table he himself assumed the seat of honour beside which the silver flagon was placed and beckoned to me to sit down beside him  thou knowest thy fathers strict and excellent domestic discipline has trained me to bear the invocation of a blessing before we break the daily bread for which we are taught to prayi paused a moment and without designing to do so i suppose my manner made him sensible of what i expected the two domestics or inferiors as i should have before observed were already seated at the bottom of the table when my host shot a glance of a very peculiar expression towards the old man observing with something approaching to a sneer cristal nixon say gracethe gentleman expects one  the foul fiend shall be clerk and say amen when i turn chaplain growled out the party addressed in tones which might have become the condition of a dying bear if the gentleman is a whig he may please himself with his own mummery my faith is neither in word nor writ but in barleybread and brown ale  mabel moffat said my guide looking at the old woman and raising his sonorous voice probably because she was hard of hearing canst thou ask a blessing upon our victuals  the old woman shook her head kissed the cross which hung from her rosary and was silent  mabel will say grace for no heretic said the master of the house with the same latent sneer on his brow and in his accent  at the same moment the sidedoor already mentioned opened and the young woman so she proved whom i had first seen at the door of the cottage advanced a little way into the room then stopped bashfully as if she had observed that i was looking at her and asked the master of the house if he had called  not louder than to make old mabel hear me he replied and yet be added as she turned to retire it is a shame a stranger should see a house where not one of the family can or will say a gracedo thou be our chaplain  the girl who was really pretty came forward with timid modesty and apparently unconscious that she was doing anything uncommon pronounced the benediction in a silvertoned voice and with affecting simplicityher cheek colouring just so much as to show that on a less solemn occasion she would have felt more embarrassed  now if thou expectest a fine description of this young woman alan fairford in order to entitle thee to taunt me with having found a dulcinea in the inhabitant of a fishermans cottage on the solway firth thou shalt be disappointed for having said she seemed very pretty and that she was a sweet and gentlespeaking creature i have said all concerning her that i can tell thee she vanished when the benediction was spoken  my host with a muttered remark on the cold of our ride and the keen air of the solway sands to which he did not seem to wish an answer loaded my plate from mabels grillade which with a large wooden bowl of potatoes formed our whole meal a sprinkling from the lemon gave a much higher zest than the usual condiment of vinegar and i promise you that whatever i might hitherto have felt either of curiosity or suspicion did not prevent me from making a most excellent supper during which little passed betwixt me and my entertainer unless that he did the usual honours of the table with courtesy indeed but without even the affectation of hearty hospitality which those in his apparent condition generally affect on such occasions even when they do not actually feel it on the contrary his manner seemed that of a polished landlord towards an unexpected and unwelcome guest whom for the sake of his own credit he receives with civility but without either goodwill or cheerfulness  if you ask how i learned all this i cannot tell you nor were i to write down at length the insignificant intercourse which took place between us would it perhaps serve to justify these observations it is sufficient to say that in helping his dogs which he did from time to time with great liberality he seemed to discharge a duty much more pleasing to himself than when he paid the same attention to his guest upon the whole the result on my mind was as i tell it you  when supper was over a small casebottle of brandy in a curious frame of silver filigree circulated to the guests i had already taken a small glass of the liquor and when it had passed to mabel and to cristal and was again returned to the upper end of the table i could not help taking the bottle in my hand to look more at the armorial bearings which were chased with considerable taste on the silver framework encountering the eye of my entertainer i instantly saw that my curiosity was highly distasteful he frowned bit his lip and showed such uncontrollable signs of impatience that setting the bottle immediately down i attempted some apology to this he did not deign either to reply or even to listen and cristal at a signal from his master removed the object of my curiosity as well as the cup upon which the same arms were engraved  then ensued an awkward pause which i endeavoured to break by observing that i feared my intrusion upon his hospitality had put his family to some inconvenience  i hope you see no appearance of it sir he replied with cold civility what inconvenience a family so retired as ours may suffer from receiving an unexpected guest is like to be trifling in comparison of what the visitor himself sustains from want of his accustomed comforts so far therefore as our connexion stands our accounts stand clear  notwithstanding this discouraging reply i blundered on as is usual in such cases wishing to appear civil and being perhaps in reality the very reverse i was afraid i said that my presence had banished one of the family looking at the sidedoor from his table  if he coldly replied i meant the young woman whom i had seen in the apartment he bid me observe that there was room enough at the table for her to have seated herself and meat enough such as it was for her supper i might therefore be assured if she had chosen it she would have supped with us  there was no dwelling on this or any other topic longer for my entertainer taking up the lamp observed that my wet clothes might reconcile me for the night to their custom of keeping early hours that he was under the necessity of going abroad by peep of day tomorrow morning and would call me up at the same time to point out the way by which i was to return to the shepherds bush  this left no opening for further explanation nor was there room for it on the usual terms of civility for as he neither asked my name nor expressed the least interest concerning my condition ithe obliged personhad no pretence to trouble him with such inquiries on my part  he took up the lamp and led me through the sidedoor into a very small room where a bed had been hastily arranged for my accommodation and putting down the lamp directed me to leave my wet clothes on the outside of the door that they might be exposed to the fire during the night he then left me having muttered something which was meant to pass for good night  i obeyed his directions with respect to my clothes the rather that in despite of the spirits which i had drunk i felt my teeth begin to chatter and received various hints from an aguish feeling that a townbred youth like myself could not at once rush into all the hardihood of country sports with impunity but my bed though coarse and hard was dry and clean and i soon was so little occupied with my heats and tremors as to listen with interest to a heavy foot which seemed to be that of my landlord traversing the boards there was no ceiling as you may believe which roofed my apartment light glancing through these rude planks became visible as soon as my lamp was extinguished and as the noise of the slow solemn and regular step continued and i could distinguish that the person turned and returned as he reached the end of the apartment it seemed clear to me that the walker was engaged in no domestic occupation but merely pacing to and fro for his own pleasure an odd amusement this i thought for one who had been engaged at least a part of the preceding day in violent exercise and who talked of rising by the peep of dawn on the ensuing morning  meantime i heard the storm which had been brewing during the evening begin to descend with a vengeance sounds as of distantthunder the noise of the more distant waves doubtless on the shore mingled with the roaring of the neighbouring torrent and with the crashing groaning and even screaming of the trees in the glen whose boughs were tormented by the gale within the house windows clattered and doors clapped and the walls though sufficiently substantial for a building of the kind seemed to me to totter in the tempest  but still the heavy steps perambulating the apartment over my head were distinctly heard amid the roar and fury of the elements i thought more than once i even heard a groan but i frankly own that placed in this unusual situation my fancy may have misled me i was tempted several times to call aloud and ask whether the turmoil around us did not threaten danger to the building which we inhabited but when i thought of the secluded and unsocial master of the dwelling who seemed to avoid human society and to remain unperturbed amid the elemental war it seemed that to speak to him at that moment would have been to address the spirit of the tempest himself since no other being i thought could have remained calm and tranquil while winds and waters were thus raging around  in process of time fatigue prevailed over anxiety and curiosity the storm abated or my senses became deadened to its terrors and i fell asleep ere yet the mysterious paces of my host had ceased to shake the flooring over my head  it might have been expected that the novelty of my situation although it did not prevent my slumbers would have at least diminished their profoundness and shortened their duration it proved otherwise however for i never slept more soundly in my life and only awoke when at morning dawn my landlord shook me by the shoulder and dispelled some dream of which fortunately for you i have no recollection otherwise you would have been favoured with it in hopes you might have proved a second daniel upon the occasion  you sleep sound said his full deep voice ere five years have rolled over your head your slumbers will be lighterunless ere then you are wrapped in the sleep which is never broken  how said i starting up in the bed do you know anything of meof my prospectsof my views in life  nothing he answered with a grim smile but it is evident you are entering upon the world young inexperienced and full of hopes and i do but prophesy to you what i would to any one in your condition but come there lie your clothesa brown crust and a draught of milk wait you if you choose to break your fast but you must make haste  i must first i said take the freedom to spend a few minutes alone before beginning the ordinary works of the day  ohumphi cry your devotions pardon he replied and left the apartment  alan there is something terrible about this man  i joined him as i had promised in the kitchen where we had supped overnight where i found the articles which he had offered me for breakfast without butter or any other addition  he walked up and down while i partook of the bread and milk and the slow measured weighty step seemed identified with those which i had heard last night his pace from its funereal slowness seemed to keep time with some current of internal passion dark slow and unchanged we run and leap by the side of a lively and bubbling brook thought i internally as if we would run a race with it but beside waters deep slow and lonely our pace is sullen and silent as their course what thoughts may be now corresponding with that furrowed brow and bearing time with that heavy step  if you have finished said he looking up to me with a glance of impatience as he observed that i ate no longer but remained with my eyes fixed upon him i wait to show you the way  we went out together no individual of the family having been visible excepting my landlord i was disappointed of the opportunity which i watched for of giving some gratuity to the domestics as they seemed to be as for offering any recompense to the master of the household it seemed to me impossible to have attempted it  what would i have given for a share of thy composure who wouldst have thrust half a crown into a mans hand whose necessities seemed to crave it conscious that you did right in making the proffer and not caring sixpence whether you hurt the feelings of him whom you meant to serve i saw thee once give a penny to a man with a long beard who from the dignity of his exterior might have represented solon i had not thy courage and therefore i made no tender to my mysterious host although notwithstanding his display of silver utensils all around the house bespoke narrow circumstances if not actual poverty  we left the place together but i hear thee murmur thy very new and appropriate ejaculation ohe jam satisthe rest for another time perhaps i may delay further communication till i learn how my favours are valued     letter v  alan fairford to darsie latimer  i have thy two last epistles my dear darsie and expecting the third have been in no hurry to answer them do not think my silence ought to be ascribed to my failing to take interest in them for truly they excel though the task was difficult thy usual excellings since the mooncalf who earliest discovered the pandemonium of milton in an expiring woodfiresince the first ingenious urchin who blew bubbles out of soap and water thou my best of friends hast the highest knack at making histories out of nothing wert thou to plant the bean in the nurserytale thou wouldst make out so soon as it began to germinate that the castle of the giant was about to elevate its battlements on the top of it all that happens to thee gets a touch of the wonderful and the sublime from thy own rich imagination didst ever see what artists call a claude lorraine glass which spreads its own particular hue over the whole landscape which you see through itthou beholdest ordinary events just through such a medium  i have looked carefully at the facts of thy last long letter and they are just such as might have befallen any little truant of the high school who had got down to leith sands gone beyond the prawndub wet his hose and shoon and finally had been carried home in compassion by some highkilted fishwife cursing all the while the trouble which the brat occasioned her  i admire the figure which thou must have made clinging for dear life behind the old fellows backthy jaws chattering with fear thy muscles cramped with anxiety thy execrable supper of broiled salmon which was enough to ensure the nightmares regular visits for a twelvemonth may be termed a real affliction but as for the storm of thursday last such i observe was the date it roared whistled howled and bellowed as fearfully amongst the old chimneyheads in the candlemaker row as it could on the solway shore for the very wind of itteste me per totam noctem vigilante and then in the morning again whenlord help youin your sentimental delicacy you bid the poor man adieu without even tendering him half a crown for supper and lodging  you laugh at me for giving a penny to be accurate though thou shouldst have said sixpence to an old fellow whom thou in thy high flight wouldst have sent home supperless because he was like solon or belisarius but you forget that the affront descended like a benediction into the pouch of the old gaberlunzie who overflowed in blessings upon the generous donorlong ere he would have thanked thee darsie for thy barren veneration of his beard and his bearing then you laugh at my good fathers retreat from falkirk just as if it were not time for a man to trudge when three or four mountain knaves with naked claymores and heels as light as their fingers were scampering after him crying furinish you remember what he said himself when the laird of bucklivat told him that furinish signified stay a while what the devil he said surprised out of his presbyterian correctness by the unreasonableness of such a request under the circumstances would the scoundrels have had me stop to have my head cut off  imagine such a train at your own heels darsie and ask yourself whether you would not exert your legs as fast as you did in flying from the solway tide and yet you impeach my fathers courage i tell you he has courage enough to do what is right and to spurn what is wrongcourage enough to defend a righteous cause with hand and purse and to take the part of the poor man against his oppressor without fear of the consequences to himself this is civil courage darsie and it is of little consequence to most men in this age and country whether they ever possess military courage or no  do not think i am angry with you though i thus attempt to rectify your opinions on my fathers account i am well aware that upon the whole he is scarce regarded with more respect by me than by thee and while i am in a serious humour which it is difficult to preserve with one who is perpetually tempting me to laugh at him pray dearest darsie let not thy ardour for adventure carry thee into more such scrapes as that of the solway sands the rest of the story is a mere imagination but that stormy evening might have proved as the clown says to lear a naughty night to swim in  as for the rest if you can work mysterious and romantic heroes out of old crossgrained fishermen why i for one will reap some amusement by the metamorphosis yet hold even there there is some need of caution this same female chaplainthou sayest so little of her and so much of every one else that it excites some doubt in my mind very pretty she is it seemsand that is all thy discretion informs me of there are cases in which silence implies other things than consent wert thou ashamed or afraid darsie to trust thyself with the praises of the very pretty gracesayeras i live thou blushest why do i not know thee an inveterate squire of dames and have i not been in thy confidence an elegant elbow displayed when the rest of the figure was muffled in a cardinal or a neat wellturned ankle and instep seen by chance as its owner tripped up the old assembly close of old this almost deserted alley formed the most common access betwixt the high street and the southern suburbs turned thy brain for eight days thou wert once caught if i remember rightly with a single glance of a single matchless eye which when the fair owner withdrew her veil proved to be single in the literal sense of the word and besides were you not another time enamoured of a voicea mere voice that mingled in the psalmody at the old greyfriars churchuntil you discovered the proprietor of that dulcet organ to be miss dolly macizzard who is both back and breast as our saying goes  all these things considered and contrasted with thy artful silence on the subject of this gracesaying nereid of thine i must beg thee to be more explicit upon that subject in thy next unless thou wouldst have me form the conclusion that thou thinkest more of her than thou carest to talk of  you will not expect much news from this quarter as you know the monotony of my life and are aware it must at present be devoted to uninterrupted study you have said a thousand times that i am only qualified to make my way by dint of plodding and therefore plod i must  my father seems to be more impatient of your absence than he was after your first departure he is sensible i believe that our solitary meals want the light which your gay humour was wont to throw over them and feels melancholy as men do when the light of the sun is no longer upon the landscape if it is thus with him thou mayst imagine it is much more so with me and canst conceive how heartily i wish that thy frolic were ended and thou once more our inmate  i resume my pen after a few hours interval to say that an incident has occurred on which you will yourself be building a hundred castles in the air and which even i jealous as i am of such baseless fabrics cannot but own affords ground for singular conjecture  my father has of late taken me frequently along with him when he attends the courts in his anxiety to see me properly initiated into the practical forms of business i own i feel something on his account and my own from this overanxiety which i dare say renders us both ridiculous but what signifies my repugnance my father drags me up to his counsel learned in the laware you quite ready to come on today mr crossbitethis is my son designed for the bari take the liberty to bring him with me today to the consultation merely that he may see how these things are managed  mr crossbite smiles and bows as a lawyer smiles on the solicitor who employs him and i dare say thrusts his tongue into his cheek and whispers into the first great wig that passes him what the dl does old fairford mean by letting loose his whelp on me  as i stood beside them too much vexed at the childish part i was made to play to derive much information from the valuable arguments of mr crossbite i observed a rather elderly man who stood with his eyes firmly bent on my father as if he only waited an end of the business in which he was engaged to address him there was something i thought in the gentlemans appearance which commanded attention yet his dress was not in the present taste and though it had once been magnificent was now antiquated and unfashionable his coat was of branched velvet with a satin lining a waistcoat of violetcoloured silk much embroidered his breeches the same stuff as the coat he wore squaretoed shoes with foretops as they are called and his silk stockings were rolled up over his knee as you may have seen in pictures and here and there on some of those originals who seem to pique themselves on dressing after the mode of methuselah a chapeau bras and sword necessarily completed his equipment which though out of date showed that it belonged to a man of distinction  the instant mr crossbite had ended what he had to say this gentleman walked up to my father with your servant mr fairfordit is long since you and i met  my father whose politeness you know is exact and formal bowed and hemmed and was confused and at length professed that the distance since they had met was so great that though he remembered the face perfectly the name he was sorry to any hadreallysomehowescaped his memory  have you forgot herries of birrenswork said the gentleman and my father bowed even more profoundly than before though i think his reception of his old friend seemed to lose some of the respectful civility which he bestowed on him while his name was yet unknown it now seemed to be something like the lipcourtesy which the heart would have denied had ceremony permitted  my father however again bowed low and hoped he saw him well  so well my good mr fairford that i come hither determined to renew my acquaintance with one or two old friends and with you in the first place i halt at my old resting placeyou must dine with me today at patersons at the head of the horse wyndit is near your new fashionable dwelling and i have business with you  my father excused himself respectfully and not without embarrassmenthe was particularly engaged at home  then i will dine with you man said mr herries of birrenswork the few minutes you can spare me after dinner will suffice for my business and i will not prevent you a moment from minding your owni am no bottleman  you have often remarked that my father though a scrupulous ohserver of the rites of hospitality seems to exercise them rather as a duty than as a pleasure indeed but for a conscientious wish to feed the hungry and receive the stranger his doors would open to guests much seldomer than is the case i never saw so strong an example of this peculiarity which i should otherwise have said is caricatured in your description as in his mode of homologating the selfgiven invitation of mr herries the embarsassed brow and the attempt at a smile which accompanied his we will expect the honour of seeing you in brown square at three oclock could not deceive any one and did not impose upon the old laird it was with a look of scorn that he replied i will relieve you then till that hour mr fairford and his whole manner seemed to say it is my pleasure to dine with you and i care not whether i am welcome or no  when he turned away i asked my father who he was  an unfortunate gentleman was the reply  he looks pretty well on his misfortunes replied i i should not have suspected that so gay an outside was lacking a dinner  who told you that he does replied my father he is omni suspicione major so far as worldly circumstances are concerned it is to be hoped he makes a good use of them though if he does it will be for the first time in his life  he has then been an irregular liver insinuated i  my father replied by that famous brocard with which he silences all unacceptable queries turning in the slightest degree upon the failings of our neighboursif we mend our own faults alan we shall all of us have enough to do without sitting in judgement upon other folks  here i was again at fault but rallying once more i observed he had the air of a man of high rank and family  he is well entitled said my father representing herries of birrenswork a branch of that great and once powerful family of herries the elder branch whereof merged in the house of nithesdale at the death of lord robin the philosopher anno domini sixteen hundred and sixtyseven  has he still said i his patrimonial estate of birrenswork  no replied my father so far back as his fathers time it was a mere designationthe property being forfeited by herbert herries following his kinsman the earl of derwentwater to the preston affair in 1715 but they keep up the designation thinking doubtless that their claims may be revived in more favourable times for jacobites and for popery and folks who in no way partake of their fantastic capriccios do yet allow it to pass unchallenged ex comitate if not ex misericordiabut were he the pope and the pretender both we must get some dinner ready for him since he has thought fit to offer himself so hasten home my lad and tell hannah cook epps and james wilkinson to do their best and do thou look out a pint or two of maxwells bestit is in the fifth binthere are the keys of the winecellar do not leave them in the lockyou know poor jamess failing though he is an honest creature under all other temptationsand i have but two bottles of the old brandy leftwe must keep it for medicine alan  away went imade my preparationsthe hour of dinner came and so did mr herries of birrenswork  if i had thy power of imagination and description darsie i could make out a fine dark mysterious rembrandtlooking portrait of this same stranger which should be as far superior to thy fisherman as a shirt of chainmail is to a herringnet i can assure you there is some matter for description about him but knowing my own imperfections i can only say i thought him eminently disagreeable and illbredno illbred is not the proper word on the contrary he appeared to know the rules of goodbreeding perfectly and only to think that the rank of the company did not require that he should attend to thema view of the matter infinitely more offensive than if his behaviour had been that of uneducated and proper rudeness while my father said grace the laird did all but whistle aloud and when i at my fathers desire returned thanks he used his toothpick as if he had waited that moment for its exercise  so much for kirkwith king matters went even worse my father thou knowest is particularly full of deference to his guests and in the present care he seemed more than usually desirous to escape every cause of dispute he so far compromised his loyalty as to announce merely the king as his first toast after dinner instead of the emphatic king george which is his usual formula our guest made a motion with his glass so as to pass it over the waterdecanter which stood beside him and added over the water  my father coloured but would not seem to hear this much more there was of careless and disrespectful in the strangers manner and tone of conversation so that though i know my fathers prejudices in favour of rank and birth and though i am aware his otherwise masculine understanding has never entirely shaken off the slavish awe of the great which in his earlier days they had so many modes of commanding still i could hardly excuse him for enduring so much insolencesuch it seemed to be as this selfinvited guest was disposed to offer to him at his own table  one can endure a traveller in the same carriage if he treads upon your toes by accident or even through negligence but it is very different when knowing that they are rather of a tender description he continues to pound away at them with his hoofs in my poor opinionand i am a man of peaceyou can in that case hardly avoid a declaration of war  i believe my father read my thoughts in my eye for pulling out his watch he said halfpast four alanyou should be in your own room by this timebirrenswork will excuse you  our visitor nodded carelessly and i had no longer any pretence to remain but as i left the room i heard this magnate of nithesdale distinctly mention the name of latimer i lingered but at length a direct hint from my father obliged me to withdraw and when an hour afterwards i was summoned to partake of a cup of tea our guest had departed he had business that evening in the high street and could not spare time even to drink tea i could not help saying i considered his departure as a relief from incivility what business has he to upbraid us i said with the change of our dwelling from a more inconvenient to a better quarter of the town what was it to him if we chose to imitate some of the conveniences or luxuries of an english dwellinghouse instead of living piled up above each other in flats have his patrician birth and aristocratic fortunes given him any right to censure those who dispose of the fruits of their own industry according to their own pleasure  my father took a long pinch of snuff and replied very well alan very well indeed i wish mr crossbite or counsellor pest had heard you they must have acknowledged that you have a talent for forensic elocution and it may not be amiss to try a little declamation at home now and then to gather audacity and keep yourself in breath but touching the subject of this paraffle of words its not worth a pinch of tobacco dye think that i care for mr herries of birrenswork more than any other gentleman who comes here about business although i do not care to go tilting at his throat because he speaks like a grey goose as he is but to say no more about him i want to have darsie latimers present direction for it is possible i may have to write the lad a line with my own handand yet i do not well knowbut give me the direction at all events  i did so and if you have heard from my father accordingly you know more probably about the subject of this letter than i who write it but if you have not then shall i have discharged a friends duty in letting you know that there certainly is something afloat between this disagreeable laird and my father in which you are considerably interested  adieu and although i have given thee a subject for waking dreams beware of building a castle too heavy for the foundation which in the present instance is barely the word latimer occurring in a conversation betwixt a gentleman of dumfriesshire and a ws of edinburghcaetera prorsus ignoro     letter vi  darsie latimer to alan fairford  in continuation of letters iii and iv  i told thee i walked out into the open air with my grave and stern landlord i could now see more perfectly than on the preceding night the secluded glen in which stood the two or three cottages which appeared to be the abode of him and his family  it was so narrow in proportion to its depth that no ray of the morning sun was likely to reach it till it should rise high in the horizon looking up the dell you saw a brawling brook issuing in foamy haste from a covert of underwood like a racehorse impatient to arrive at the goal and if you gazed yet more earnestly you might observe part of a high waterfall glimmering through the foliage and giving occasion doubtless to the precipitate speed of the brook lower down the stream became more placid and opened into a quiet piece of water which afforded a rude haven to two or three fishermens boats then lying high and dry on the sand the tide being out two or three miserable huts could be seen beside this little haven inhabited probably by the owners of the boats but inferior in every respect to the establishment of mine host though that was miserable enough  i had but a minute or two to make these observations yet during that space my companion showed symptoms of impatience and more than once shouted cristalcristal nixon until the old man of the preceding evening appeared at the door of one of the neighbouring cottages or outhouses leading the strong black horse which i before commemorated ready bridled and saddled my conductor made cristal a sign with his finger and turning from the cottage door led the way up the steep path or ravine which connected the sequestered dell with the open country  had i been perfectly aware of the character of the road down which i had been hurried with so much impetuosity on the preceding evening i greatly question if i should have ventured the descent for it deserved no better name than the channel of a torrent now in a good measure filled with water that dashed in foam and fury into the dell being swelled with the rains of the preceding night i ascended this ugly path with some difficulty although on foot and felt dizzy when i observed from such traces as the rains had not obliterated that the horse seemed almost to have slid down it upon his haunches the evening before  my host threw himself on his horses back without placing a foot in the stirruppassed me in the perilous ascent against which he pressed his steed as if the animal had had the footing of a wild cat the water and mud splashed from his heels in his reckless course and a few bounds placed him on the top of the bank where i presently joined him and found the horse and rider standing still as a statue the former panting and expanding his broad nostrils to the morning wind the latter motionless with his eye fixed on the first beams of the rising sun which already began to peer above the eastern horizon and gild the distant mountains of cumberland and liddesdale  he seemed in a reverie from which he started at my approach and putting his horse in motion led the way at a leisurely pace through a broken and sandy road which traversed a waste level and uncultivated tract of downs intermixed with morass much like that in the neighbourhood of my quarters at shepherds bush indeed the whole open ground of this district where it approaches the sea has except in a few favoured spots the same uniform and dreary character  advancing about a hundred yards from the brink of the glen we gained a still more extensive command of this desolate prospect which seemed even more dreary as contrasted with the opposite shores of cumberland crossed and intersected by ten thousand lines of trees growing in hedgerows shaded with groves and woods of considerable extent animated by hamlets and villas from which thin clouds of smoke already gave sign of human life and human industry  my conductor had extended his arm and was pointing the road to shepherds bush when the step of a horse was heard approaching us he looked sharply round and having observed who was approaching proceeded in his instructions to me planting himself at the same time in the very middle of the path which at the place where we halted had a slough on the one side and a sandbank on the other  i observed that the rider who approached us slackened his horses pace from a slow trot to a walk as if desirous to suffer us to proceed or at least to avoid passing us at a spot where the difficulty of doing so must have brought us very close to each other you know my old failing alan and that i am always willing to attend to anything in preference to the individual who has for the time possession of the conversation  agreeably to this amiable propensity i was internally speculating concerning the cause of the rider keeping aloof from us when my companion elevating his deep voice so suddenly and so sternly as at once to recall my wandering thoughts exclaimed in the name of the devil young man do you think that others have no better use for their time than you have that you oblige me to repeat the same thing to you three times over do you see i say yonder thing at a miles distance that looks like a fingerpost or rather like a gallows i would it had a dreaming fool hanging upon it as an example to all meditative mooncalvesyon gibbetlooking pole will guide you to the bridge where you must pass the large brook then proceed straight forwards till several roads divide at a cairn plague on thee thou art wandering again  it is indeed quite true that at this moment the horseman approached us and my attention was again called to him as i made way to let him pass his whole exterior at once showed that he belonged to the society of friends or as the world and the worlds law calls them quakers a strong and useful irongrey galloway showed by its sleek and good condition that the merciful man was merciful to his beast his accoutrements were in the usual unostentatious but clean and servicable order which characterizes these sectaries his long surtout of darkgrey superfine cloth descended down to the middle of his leg and was buttoned up to his chin to defend him against the morning air as usual his ample beaver hung down without button or loop and shaded a comely and placid countenance the gravity of which appeared to contain some seasoning of humour and had nothing in common with the pinched puritanical air affected by devotees in general the brow was open and free from wrinkles whether of age or hypocrisy the eye was clear calm and considerate yet appeared to be disturbed by apprehension not to say fear as pronouncing the usual salutation of i wish thee a good morrow friend he indicated by turning his palfrey close to one side of the path a wish to glide past us with as little trouble as possiblejust as a traveller would choose to pass a mastiff of whose peaceable intentions he is by no means confident  but my friend not meaning perhaps that he should get off so easily put his horse quite across the path so that without plunging into the slough or scrambling up the bank the quaker could not have passed him neither of these was an experiment without hazard greater than the passenger seemed willing to incur he halted therefore as if waiting till my companion should make way for him and as they sat fronting each other i could not help thinking that they might have formed no bad emblem of peace and war for although my conductor was unarmed yet the whole of his manner his stern look and his upright seat on horseback were entirely those of a soldier in undress he accosted the quaker in these words so ho friend joshua thou art early to the road this morning has the spirit moved thee and thy righteous brethren to act with some honesty and pull down yonder tidenets that keep the fish from coming up the river  surely friend not so answered joshua firmly but goodhumouredly at the same time thou canst not expect that our own hands should pull down what our purses established thou killest the fish with spear line and coblenet and we with snares and with nets which work by the ebb and the flow of the tide each doth what seems best in his eyes to secure a share of the blessing which providence hath bestowed on the river and that within his own bounds i prithee seek no quarrel against us for thou shalt have no wrong at our hand  be assured i will take none at the hand of any man whether his hat be cocked or broadbrimmed answered the fisherman i tell you in fair terms joshua geddes that you and your partners are using unlawful craft to destroy the fish in the solway by stakenets and wears and that we who fish fairly and like men as our fathers did have daily and yearly less sport and less profit do not think gravity or hypocrisy can carry it off as you have done the world knows you and we know you you will destroy the salmon which makes the livelihood of fifty poor families and then wipe your mouth and go to make a speech at meeting but do not hope it will last thus i give you fair warning we will be upon you one morning soon when we will not leave a stake standing in the pools of the solway and down the tide they shall every one go and well if we do not send a lessee along with them  friend replied joshua with a constrained smile but that i know thou dost not mean as thou sayst i would tell thee we are under the protection of this countrys laws nor do we the less trust to obtain their protection that our principles permit us not by any act of violent resistance to protect ourselves  all villainous cant and cowardice exclaimed the fisherman and assumed merely as a cloak to your hypocritical avarice  nay say not cowardice my friend answered the quaker since thou knowest there may be as much courage in enduring as in acting and i will be judged by this youth or by any one else whether there is not more cowardiceeven in the opinion of that world whose thoughts are the breath in thy nostrilsin the armed oppressor who doth injury than in the defenceless and patient sufferer who endureth it with constancy  i will change no more words with you on the subject said the fisherman who as if something moved at the last argument which mr geddes had used now made room for him to pass forward on his journey do not forget however he added that you have had fair warning nor suppose that we will accept of fair words in apology for foul play these nets of yours are unlawfulthey spoil our fishingswe will have them down at all risks and hazards i am a man of my word friend joshua  i trust thou art said the quaker but thou art the rather bound to be cautious in rashly affirming what thou wilt never execute for i tell thee friend that though there is as great a difference between thee and one of our people as there is between a lion and a sheep yet i know and believe thou hast so much of the lion in thee that thou wouldst scarce employ thy strength and thy rage upon that which professeth no means of resistance report says so much good of thee at least if it says little more  time will try answered the fisherman and hark thee joshua before we part i will put thee in the way of doing one good deed which credit me is better than twenty moral speeches here is a stranger youth whom heaven has so scantily gifted with brains that he will bewilder himself in the sands as he did last night unless thou wilt kindly show him the way to shepherds bush for i have been in vain endeavouring to make him comprehend the road thither hast thou so much charity under thy simplicity quaker as to do this good turn  nay it is thou friend answered joshua that dost lack charity to suppose any one unwilling to do so simple a kindness  thou art righti should have remembered it can cost thee nothing young gentlemen this pious pattern of primitive simplicity will teach thee the right way to the shepherds bushaye and will himself shear thee like a sheep if you come to buying and selling with him  he then abruptly asked me how long i intended to remain at shepherds bush  i replied i was at present uncertainas long probably as i could amuse myself in the neighbourhood  you are fond of sport he added in the same tone of brief inquiry  i answered in the affirmative but added i was totally inexperienced  perhaps if you reside here for some days he said we may meet again and i may have the chance of giving you a lesson  ere i could express either thanks or assent he turned short round with a wave of his hand by way of adieu and rode back to the verge of the dell from which we had emerged together and as he remained standing upon the banks i could long hear his voice while he shouted down to those within its recesses  meanwhile the quaker and i proceeded on our journey for some time in silence he restraining his soberminded steed to a pace which might have suited a much less active walker than myself and looking on me from time to time with an expression of curiosity mingled with benignity for my part i cared not to speak first it happened i had never before been in company with one of this particular sect and afraid that in addressing him i might unwittingly infringe upon some of their prejudices or peculiarities i patiently remained silent at length he asked me whether i had been long in the service of the laird as men called him  i repeated the words in his service with such an accent of surprise as induced him to say nay but friend i mean no offence perhaps i should have said in his societyan inmate i mean in his house  i am totally unknown to the person from whom we have just parted said i and our connexion is only temporary he had the charity to give me his guidance from the sands and a nights harbourage from the tempest so our acquaintance began and there it is likely to end for you may observe that our friend is by no means apt to encourage familiarity  so little so answered my companion that thy case is i think the first in which i ever heard of his receiving any one into his house that is if thou hast really spent the night there  why should you doubt it replied i there is no motive i can have to deceive you nor is the object worth it  be not angry with me said the quaker but thou knowest that thine own people do not as we humbly endeavour to do confine themselves within the simplicity of truth but employ the language of falsehood not only for profit but for compliment and sometimes for mere diversion i have heard various stories of my neighbour of most of which i only believe a small part and even then they are difficult to reconcile with each other but this being the first time i ever beard of his receiving a stranger within his dwelling made me express some doubts i pray thee let them not offend thee  he does not said i appear to possess in much abundance the means of exercising hospitality and so may be excused from offering it in ordinary cases  that is to say friend replied joshua thou hast supped ill and perhaps breakfasted worse now my small tenement called mount sharon is nearer to us by two miles than thine inn and although going thither may prolong thy walk as taking thee of the straighter road to shepherds bush yet methinks exercise will suit thy youthful limbs as well as a good plain meal thy youthful appetite what sayst thou my young acquaintance  if it puts you not to inconvenience i replied for the invitation was cordially given and my bread and milk had been hastily swallowed and in small quantity  nay said joshua use not the language of compliment with those who renounce it had this poor courtesy been very inconvenient perhaps i had not offered it  i accept the invitation then said i in the same good spirit in which you give it  the quaker smiled reached me his hand i shook it and we travelled on in great cordiality with each other the fact is i was much entertained by contrasting in my own mind the open manner of the kindhearted joshua geddes with the abrupt dark and lofty demeanour of my entertainer on the preceding evening both were blunt and unceremonious but the plainness of the quaker had the character of devotional simplicity and was mingled with the more real kindness as if honest joshua was desirous of atoning by his sincerity for the lack of external courtesy on the contrary the manners of the fisherman were those of one to whom the rules of good behaviour might be familiar but who either from pride or misanthropy scorned to observe them still i thought of him with interest and curiosity notwithstanding so much about him that was repulsive and i promised myself in the course of my conversation with the quaker to learn all that he knew on the subject he turned the conversation however into a different channel and inquired into my own condition of life and views in visiting this remote frontier  i only thought it necessary to mention my name and add that i had been educated to the law but finding myself possessed of some independence i had of late permitted myself some relaxation and was residing at shepherds bush to enjoy the pleasure of angling  i do thee no harm young man said my new friend in wishing thee a better employment for thy grave hours and a more humane amusement if amusement thou must have for those of a lighter character  you are severe sir i replied i heard you but a moment since refer yourself to the protection of the laws of the countryif there be laws there must be lawyers to explain and judges to administer them  joshua smiled and pointed to the sheep which were grazing on the downs over which we were travelling were a wolf he said to come even now upon yonder flocks they would crowd for protection doubtless around the shepherd and his dogs yet they are bitten and harassed daily by the one shorn and finally killed and eaten by the other but i say not this to shock you for though laws and lawyers are evils yet they are necessary evils in this probationary state of society till man shall learn to render unto his fellows that which is their due according to the light of his own conscience and through no other compulsion meanwhile i have known many righteous men who have followed thy intended profession in honesty and uprightness of walk the greater their merit who walk erect in a path which so many find slippery  and angling said iyou object to that also as an amusement you who if i understood rightly what passed between you and my late landlord are yourself a proprietor of fisheries  not a proprietor he replied i am only in copartnery with others a tacksman or lessee of some valuable salmonfisheries a little down the coast but mistake me not the evil of angling with which i class all sports as they are called which have the sufferings of animals for their end and object does not consist in the mere catching and killing those animals with which the bounty of providence hath stocked the earth for the good of man but in making their protracted agony a principle of delight and enjoyment i do indeed cause these fisheries to be conducted for the necessary taking killing and selling the fish and in the same way were i a farmer i should send my lambs to market but i should as soon think of contriving myself a sport and amusement out of the trade of the butcher as out of that of the fisher  we argued the point no further for though i thought his arguments a little too highstrained yet as my mind acquitted me of having taken delight in aught but the theory of fieldsports i did not think myself called upon stubbornly to advocate a practice which had afforded me so little pleasure  we had by this time arrived at the remains of an old fingerpost which my host had formerly pointed out as a landmark here a ruinous wooden bridge supported by long posts resembling crutches served me to get across the water while my new friend sought a ford a good way higher up for the stream was considerably swelled  as i paused for his rejoining me i observed an angler at a little distance pouching trout after trout as fast almost as he could cast his line and i own in spite of joshuas lecture on humanity i could not but envy his adroitness and success so natural is the love of sport to our minds or so easily are we taught to assimilate success in fieldsports with ideas of pleasure and with the praise due to address and agility i soon recognized in the successful angler little benjie who had been my guide and tutor in that gentle art as you have learned from my former letters i calledi whistledthe rascal recognized me and starting like a guilty thing seemed hesitating whether to approach or to run away and when he determined on the former it was to assail me with a loud clamorous and exaggerated report of the anxiety of all at the shepherds bush for my personal safety how my landlady had wept how sam and the ostler had not the heart to go to bed but sat up all night drinkingand how he himself had been up long before daybreak to go in quest of me  and you were switching the water i suppose said i to discover my dead body  this observation produced a long naaa of acknowledged detection but with his natural impudence and confidence in my good nature he immediately added that he thought i would like a fresh trout or twa for breakfast and the water being in such a rare trim for the saumon raun the bait made of salmonroe salted and preserved in a swollen river and about the month of october it is a most deadly bait he couldna help taking a cast  while we were engaged in this discussion the honest quaker returned to the farther end of the wooden bridge to tell me he could not venture to cross the brook in its present state but would be under the necessity to ride round by the stone bridge which was a mile and a half higher up than his own house he was about to give me directions how to proceed without him and inquire for his sister when i suggested to him that if he pleased to trust his horse to little benjie the boy might carry him round by the bridge while we walked the shorter and more pleasant road  joshua shook his head for he was well acquainted with benjie who he said was the naughtiest varlet in the whole neighbourhood nevertheless rather than part company he agreed to put the pony under his charge for a short season with many injunctions that he should not attempt to mount but lead the pony even solomon by the bridle under the assurances of sixpence in case of proper demeanour and penalty that if he transgressed the orders given him verily he would be scourged  promises cost benjie nothing and he showered them out wholesale till the quaker at length yielded up the bridle to him repeating his charges and enforcing them by holding up his forefinger on my part i called to benjie to leave the fish he had taken at mount sharon making at the same time an apologetic countenance to my new friend not being quite aware whether the compliment would be agreeable to such a condemner of fieldsports  he understood me at once and reminded me of the practical distinction betwixt catching the animals as an object of cruel and wanton sport and eating them as lawful and gratifying articles of food after they were killed on the latter point he had no scruples but on the contrary assured me that this brook contained the real red trout so highly esteemed by all connoisseurs and that when eaten within an hour of their being caught they had a peculiar firmness of substance and delicacy of flavour which rendered them an agreeable addition to a morning meal especially when earned like ours by early rising and an hour or twos wholesome exercise  but to thy alarm be it spoken alan we did not come so far as the frying of our fish without further adventure so it is only to spare thy patience and mine own eyes that i pull up for the present and send thee the rest of my story in a subsequent letter     letter vii  the same to the same in continuation  little benjie with the pony having been sent off on the left side of the brook the quaker and i sauntered on like the cavalry and infantry of the same army occupying the opposite banks of a river and observing the same line of march but while my worthy companion was assuring me of a pleasant greensward walk to his mansion little benjie who had been charged to keep in sight chose to deviate from the path assigned him and turning to the right led his charge solomon out of our vision  the villain means to mount him cried joshua with more vivacity than was consistent with his profession of passive endurance  i endeavoured to appease his apprehensions as he pushed on wiping his brow with vexation assuring him that if the boy did mount he would for his own sake ride gently  you do not know him said joshua rejecting all consolation he do anything gentlyno he will gallop solomonhe will misuse the sober patience of the poor animal who has borne me so long yes i was given over to my own devices when i ever let him touch the bridle for such a little miscreant there never was before him in this country  he then proceeded to expatiate on every sort of rustic enormity of which he accused benjie he had been suspected of snaring partridgeswas detected by joshua himself in liming singingbirdsstood fully charged with having worried several cats by aid of a lurcher which attended him and which was as lean and ragged and mischievous as his master finally benjie stood accused of having stolen a duck to hunt it with the said lurcher which was as dexterous on water as on land i chimed in with my friend in order to avoid giving him further irritation and declared i should be disposed from my own experience to give up benjie as one of satans imps joshua geddes began to censure the phrase as too much exaggerated and otherwise unbecoming the mouth of a reflecting person and just as i was apologizing for it as being a term of common parlance we heard certain sounds on the opposite side of the brook which seemed to indicate that solomon and benjie were at issue together the sandhills behind which benjie seemed to take his course had concealed from us as doubtless he meant they should his ascent into the forbidden saddle and putting solomon to his mettle which he was seldom called upon to exert they had cantered away together in great amity till they came near to the ford from which the palfreys legitimate owner had already turned back  here a contest of opinions took place between the horse and his rider the latter according to his instructions attempted to direct solomon towards the distant bridge of stone but solomon opined that the ford was the shortest way to his own stable the point was sharply contested and we heard benjie geehupping tchektcheking and above all flogging in great style while solomon who docile in his general habits was now stirred beyond his patience made a great trampling and recalcitration and it was their joint noise which we heard without being able to see though joshua might too well guess the cause of it  alarmed at these indications the quaker began to shout out benjiethou varlet solomonthou fool when the couple presented themselves in full drive solomon having now decidedly obtained the better of the conflict and bringing his unwilling rider in high career down to the ford never was there anger changed so fast into humane fear as that of my good companion the varlet will be drowned he exclaimeda widows sonher only sonand drownedlet me goand he struggled with me stoutly as i hung upon him to prevent him from plunging into the ford  i had no fear whatever for benjie for the blackguard vermin though he could not manage the refractory horse stuck on his seat like a monkey solomon and benjie scrambled through the ford with little inconvenience and resumed their gallop on the other side  it was impossible to guess whether on this last occasion benjie was running off with solomon or solomon with benjie but judging from character and motives i rather suspected the former i could not help laughing as the rascal passed me grinning betwixt terror and delight perched on the very pommel of the saddle and holding with extended arms by bridle and mane while solomon the bit secured between his teeth and his head bored down betwixt his forelegs passed his master in this unwonted guise as hard as he could pelt  the mischievous bastard exclaimed the quaker terrified out of his usual moderation of speechthe doomed gallowsbirdhe will break solomons wind to a certainty  i prayed him to be comfortedassured him a brushing gallop would do his favourite no harm and reminded him of the censure he had bestowed on me a minute before for applying a harsh epithet to the boy  but joshua was not without his answer friend youth he said thou didst speak of the lads soul which thou didst affirm belonged to the enemy and of that thou couldst say nothing of thine own knowledge on the contrary i did but speak of his outward man which will assuredly be suspended by a cord if he mendeth not his manners men say that young as he is he is one of the lairds gang  of the lairds gang said i repeating the words in surprise do you mean the person with whom i slept last night i heard you call him the laird is he at the head of a gang  nay i meant not precisely a gang said the quaker who appeared in his haste to have spoken more than he intendeda company or party i should have said but thus it is friend latimer with the wisest men when they permit themselves to be perturbed with passion and speak as in a fever or as with the tongue of the foolish and the forward and although thou hast been hasty to mark my infirmity yet i grieve not that thou hast been a witness to it seeing that the stumbles of the wise may be no less a caution to youth and inexperience than is the fall of the foolish  this was a sort of acknowledgement of what i had already begun to suspectthat my new friends real goodness of disposition joined to the acquired quietism of his religious sect had been unable entirely to check the effervescence of a temper naturally warm and hasty  upon the present occasion as if sensible he had displayed a greater degree of emotion than became his character joshua avoided further allusion to benjie and solomon and proceeded to solicit my attention to the natural objects around us which increased in beauty and interest as still conducted by the meanders of the brook we left the common behind us and entered a more cultivated and enclosed country where arable and pasture ground was agreeably varied with groves and hedges descending now almost close to the stream our course lay through a little gate into a pathway kept with great neatness the sides of which were decorated with trees and flowering shrubs of the hardier species until ascending by a gentle slope we issued from the grove and stood almost at once in front of a low but very neat building of an irregular form and my guide shaking me cordially by the hand made me welcome to mount sharon  the wood through which we had approached this little mansion was thrown around it both on the north and northwest but breaking off into different directions was intersected by a few fields well watered and sheltered the house fronted to the southeast and from thence the pleasureground or i should rather say the gardens sloped down to the water i afterwards understood that the father of the present proprietor had a considerable taste for horticulture which had been inherited by his son and had formed these gardens which with their shaven turf pleached alleys wildernesses and exotic trees and shrubs greatly excelled anything of the kind which had been attempted in the neighbourhood  if there was a little vanity in the complacent smile with which joshua geddes saw me gaze with delight on a scene so different from the naked waste we had that day traversed in company it might surely be permitted to one who cultivating and improving the beauties of nature had found therein as he said bodily health and a pleasing relaxation for the mind at the bottom of the extended gardens the brook wheeled round in a wide semicircle and was itself their boundary the opposite side was no part of joshuas domain but the brook was there skirted by a precipitous rock of limestone which seemed a barrier of natures own erecting around his little eden of beauty comfort and peace  but i must not let thee forget said the kind quaker amidst thy admiration of these beauties of our little inheritance that thy breakfast has been a light one  so saying joshua conducted me to a small sashed door opening under a porch amply mantled by honeysuckle and clematis into a parlour of moderate size the furniture of which in plainness and excessive cleanliness bore the characteristic marks of the sect to which the owner belonged  thy fathers hannah is generally allowed to be an exception to all scottish housekeepers and stands unparalleled for cleanliness among the women of auld reekie but the cleanliness of hannah is sluttishness compared to the scrupulous purifications of these people who seem to carry into the minor decencies of life that conscientious rigour which they affect in their morals  the parlour would have been gloomy for the windows were small and the ceiling low but the present proprietor had rendered it more cheerful by opening one end into a small conservatory roofed with glass and divided from the parlour by a partition of the same i have never before seen this very pleasing manner of uniting the comforts of an apartment with the beauties of a garden and i wonder it is not more practised by the great something of the kind is hinted at in a paper of the spectator  as i walked towards the conservatory to view it more closely the parlour chimney engaged my attention it was a pile of massive stone entirely out of proportion to the size of the apartment on the front had once been an armorial scutcheon for the hammer or chisel which had been employed to deface the shield or crest had left uninjured the scroll beneath which bore the pious motto trust in god blackletter you know was my early passion and the tombstones in the greyfriars churchyard early yielded up to my knowledge as a decipherer what little they could tell of the forgotten dead  joshua geddes paused when he saw my eye fixed on this relic of antiquity thou canst read it he said  i repeated the motto and added there seemed vestiges of a date  it should be 1537 said he for so long ago at the least computation did my ancestors in the blinded times of papistry possess these lands and in that year did they build their house  it is an ancient descent said i looking with respect upon the monument i am sorry the arms have been defaced  it was perhaps impossible for my friend quaker as he was to seem altogether void of respect for the pedigree which he began to recount to me disclaiming all the while the vanity usually connected with the subject in short with the air of mingled melancholy regret and conscious dignity with which jack fawkes used to tell us at college of his ancestors unfortunate connexion with the gunpowder plot  vanity of vanities saith the preacher thus harangued joshua gleddes of mount sharon if we ourselves are nothing in the sight of heaven how much less than nothing must be our derivation from rotten bones and mouldering dust whose immortal spirits have long since gone to their private account yes friend latimer my ancestors were renowned among the ravenous and bloodthirsty men who then dwelt in this vexed country and so much were they famed for successful freebooting robbery and bloodshed that they are said to have been called geddes as likening them to the fish called a jack pike or luce and in our country tongue a geda goodly distinction truly for christian men yet did they paint this shark of the fresh waters upon their shields and these profane priests of a wicked idolatry the empty boasters called heralds who make engraven images of fishes fowls and fourfooted beasts that men may fall down and worship them assigned the ged for the device and escutcheon of my fathers and hewed it over their chimneys and placed it above their tombs and the men were elated in mind and became yet more gedlike slaying leading into captivity and dividing the spoil until the place where they dwelt obtained the name of sharingknowe from the booty which was there divided amongst them and their accomplices but a better judgement was given to my fathers father philip geddes who after trying to light his candle at some of the vain wildfires then held aloft at different meetings and steeplehouses at length obtained a spark from the lamp of the blessed george fox who came into scotland spreading light among darkness as he himself hath written as plentifully as fly the sparkles from the hoof of the horse which gallops swiftly along the stony roadhere the good quaker interrupted himself with and that is very true i must go speedily to see after the condition of solomon  a quaker servant here entered the room with a tray and inclining his head towards his master but not after the manner of one who bows said composedly thou art welcome home friend joshua we expected thee not so early but what hath befallen solomon thy horse  what hath befallen him indeed said my friend hath he not been returned hither by the child whom they call benjie  he hath said his domestic but it was after a strange fashion for he came hither at a swift and furious pace and flung the child benjie from his back upon the heap of dung which is in the stableyard  i am glad of it said joshua hastilyglad of it with all my heart and spirit but stay he is the child of the widowhath the boy any hurt  not so answered the servant for he rose and fled swiftly  joshua muttered something about a scourge and then inquired after solomons present condition  he seetheth like a steaming cauldron answered the servant and bauldie the lad walketh him about the yard with a halter lest he take cold  mr geddes hastened to the stableyard to view personally the condition of his favourite and i followed to offer my counsel as a jockey dont laugh alan sure i have jockeyship enough to assist a quakerin this unpleasing predicament  the lad who was leading the horse seemed to be no quaker though his intercourse with the family had given him a touch of their prim sobriety of look and manner he assured joshua that his horse had received no injury and i even hinted that the exercise would be of service to him solomon himself neighed towards his master and rubbed his head against the good quakers shoulder as if to assure him of his being quite well so that joshua returned in comfort to his parlour where breakfast was now about to be displayed  i have since learned that the affection of joshua for his pony is considered as inordinate by some of his own sect and that he has been much blamed for permitting it to be called by the name of solomon or any other name whatever but he has gained so much respect and influence among them that they overlook these foibles  i learned from him whilst the old servant jehoiachim entering and reentering seemed to make no end of the materials which he brought in for breakfast that his grandfather philip the convert of george fox had suffered much from the persecution to which these harmless devotees were subjected on all sides during that intolerant period and much of their family estate had been dilapidated but better days dawned on joshuas father who connecting himself by marriage with a wealthy family of quakers in lancashire engaged successfully in various branches of commerce and redeemed the remnants of the property changing its name in sense without much alteration of sound from the border appellation of sharingknowe to the evangelical appellation of mount sharon  this philip geddes as i before hinted had imbibed the taste for horticulture and the pursuits of the florist which are not uncommon among the peaceful sect he belonged to he had destroyed the remnants of the old peelhouse substituting the modern mansion in its place and while he reserved the hearth of his ancestors in memory of their hospitality as also the pious motto which they had chanced to assume he failed not to obliterate the worldly and military emblems displayed upon the shield and helmet together with all their blazonry  in a few minutes after mr geddes had concluded the account of himself and his family his sister rachel the only surviving member of it entered the room her appearance is remarkably pleasing and although her age is certainly thirty at least she still retains the shape and motion of an earlier period the absence of everything like fashion or ornament was as usual atoned for by the most perfect neatness and cleanliness of her dress and her simple close cap was particularly suited to eyes which had the softness and simplicity of the doves her features were also extremely agreeable but had suffered a little through the ravages of that professed enemy to beauty the smallpox a disadvantage which was in part counterbalanced by a wellformed mouth teeth like pearls and a pleasing sobriety of smile that seemed to wish good here and hereafter to every one she spoke to you cannot make any of your vile inferences here alan for i have given a fulllength picture of rachel geddes so that you cannot say in this case as in the letter i have just received that she was passed over as a subject on which i feared to dilate more of this anon  well we settled to our breakfast after a blessing or rather an extempore prayer which joshua made upon the occasion and which the spirit moved him to prolong rather more than i felt altogether agreeable then alan there was such a dispatching of the good things of the morning as you have not witnessed since you have seen darsie latimer at breakfast tea and chocolate eggs ham and pastry not forgetting the broiled fish disappeared with a celerity which seemed to astonish the goodhumoured quakers who kept loading my plate with supplies as if desirous of seeing whether they could by any possibility tire me out one hint however i received which put me in mind where i was miss geddes had offered me some sweetcake which at the moment i declined but presently afterwards seeing it within my reach i naturally enough helped myself to a slice and had just deposited it beside my plate when joshua mine host not with the authoritative air of sanchos doctor tirteafuera but in a very calm and quiet manner lifted it away and replaced it on the dish observing only thou didst refuse it before friend latimer  these good folks alan make no allowance for what your good father calls the aberdeenmans privilege of taking his word again or what the wise call second thoughts  bating this slight hint that i was among a precise generation there was nothing in my reception that was peculiarunless indeed i were to notice the solicitous and uniform kindness with which all the attentions of my new friends were seasoned as if they were anxious to assure me that the neglect of worldly compliments interdicted by their sect only served to render their hospitality more sincere at length my hunger was satisfied and the worthy quaker who with looks of great good nature had watched my progress thus addressed his sister  this young man rachel hath last night sojourned in the tents of our neighbour whom men call the laird i am sorry i had not met him the evening before for our neighbours hospitality is too unfrequently exercised to be well prepared with the means of welcome  nay but joshua said rachel if our neighbour hath done a kindness thou shouldst not grudge him the opportunity and if our young friend hath fared ill for a night he will the better relish what providence may send him of better provisions  and that he may do so at leisure said joshua we will pray him rachel to tarry a day or twain with us he is young and is but now entering upon the world and our habitation may if he will be like a restingplace from which he may look abroad upon the pilgrimage which he must take and the path which he has to travelwhat sayest thou friend latimer we constrain not our friends to our ways and thou art i think too wise to quarrel with us for following our own fashions and if we should even give thee a word of advice thou wilt not i think be angry so that it is spoken in season  you know alan how easily i am determined by anything resembling cordialityand so though a little afraid of the formality of my host and hostess i accepted their invitation provided i could get some messenger to send to shepherds bush for my servant and portmanteau  why truly friend said joshua thy outward frame would be improved by cleaner garments but i will do thine errand myself to the widow gregsons house of reception and send thy lad hither with thy clothes meanwhile rachel will show thee these little gardens and then will put thee in some way of spending thy time usefully till our meal calls us together at the second hour after noon i bid thee farewell for the present having some space to walk seeing i must leave the animal solomon to his refreshing rest  with these words mr joshua geddes withdrew some ladies we have known would have felt or at least affected reserve or embarrassment at being left to do the honours of the grounds to it will be out alana smart young fellowan entire stranger she went out for a few minutes and returned in her plain cloak and bonnet with her beaver gloves prepared to act as my guide with as much simplicity as if she had been to wait upon thy father so forth i sallied with my fair quakeress  if the house at mount sharon be merely a plain and convenient dwelling of moderate size and small pretensions the gardens and offices though not extensive might rival an earls in point of care and expense rachel carried me first to her own favourite resort a poultryyard stocked with a variety of domestic fowls of the more rare as well as the most ordinary kinds furnished with every accommodation which may suit their various habits a rivulet which spread into a pond for the convenience of the aquatic birds trickled over gravel as it passed through the yards dedicated to the land poultry which were thus amply supplied with the means they use for digestion  all these creatures seemed to recognize the presence of their mistress and some especial favourites hastened to her feet and continued to follow her as far as their limits permitted she pointed out their peculiarities and qualities with the discrimination of one who had made natural history her study and i own i never looked on barndoor fowls with so much interest beforeat least until they were boiled or roasted i could not help asking the trying question how she could order the execution of any of the creatures of which she seemed so careful  it was painful she said but it was according to the law of their being they must die but they knew not when death was approaching and in making them comfortable while they lived we contributed to their happiness as much as the conditions of their existence permitted to us  i am not quite of her mind alan i do not believe either pigs or poultry would admit that the chief end of their being was to be killed and eaten however i did not press the argument from which my quaker seemed rather desirous to escape for conducting me to the greenhouse which was extensive and filled with the choicest plants she pointed out an aviary which occupied the farther end where she said she employed herself with attending the inhabitants without being disturbed with any painful recollections concerning their future destination  i will not trouble you with any account of the various hothouses and gardens and their contents no small sum of money must have been expended in erecting and maintaining them in the exquisite degree of good order which they exhibited the family i understood were connected with that of the celebrated millar and had imbibed his taste for flowers and for horticulture but instead of murdering botanical names i will rather conduct you to the policy or pleasuregarden which the taste of joshua or his father had extended on the banks betwixt the house and river this also in contradistinction to the prevailing simplicity was ornamented in an unusual degree there were various compartments the connexion of which was well managed and although the whole ground did not exceed five or six acres it was so much varied as to seem four times larger the space contained close alleys and open walks a very pretty artificial waterfall a fountain also consisting of a considerable jetdeau whose streams glittered in the sunbeams and exhibited a continual rainbow there was a cabinet of verdure as the french call it to cool the summer heat and there was a terrace sheltered from the northeast by a noble holly hedge with all its glittering spears where you might have the full advantage of the sun in the clear frosty days of winter  i know that you alan will condemn all this as bad and antiquated for ever since dodsley has described the leasowes and talked of browns imitations of nature and horace walpoles late essay on gardening you are all for simple naturecondemn walking up and down stairs in the open air and declare for wood and wilderness but ne quid nimis i would not deface a scene of natural grandeur or beauty by the introduction of crowded artificial decorations yet such may i think be very interesting where the situation in its natural state otherwise has no particular charms  so that when i have a countryhouse who can say how soon you may look for grottoes and cascades and fountains nay if you vex me by contradiction perhaps i may go the length of a templeso provoke me not for you see of what enormities i am capable  at any rate alan had you condemned as artificial the rest of friend geddess grounds there is a willow walk by the very verge of the stream so sad so solemn and so silent that it must have commanded your admiration the brook restrained at the ultimate boundary of the grounds by a natural damdike or ledge of rocks seemed even in its present swollen state scarcely to glide along and the pale willowtrees dropping their long branches into the stream gathered around them little coronals of the foam that floated down from the more rapid stream above the high rock which formed the opposite bank of the brook was seen dimly through the branches and its pale and splintered front garlanded with long streamers of briers and other creeping plants seemed a barrier between the quiet path which we trod and the toiling and bustling world beyond the path itself following the sweep of the stream made a very gentle curve enough however served by its inflection completely to hide the end of the walk until you arrived at it a deep and sullen sound which increased as you proceeded prepared you for this termination which was indeed only a plain rootseat from which you looked on a fall of about six or seven feet where the brook flung itself over the ledge of natural rock i have already mentioned which there crossed its course  the quiet and twilight seclusion of this walk rendered it a fit scene for confidential communing and having nothing more interesting to say to my fair quaker i took the liberty of questioning her about the laird for you are or ought to be aware that next to discussing the affairs of the heart the fair sex are most interested in those of their neighbours  i did not conceal either my curiosity or the check which it had received from joshua and i saw that my companion answered with embarrassment i must not speak otherwise than truly she said and therefore i tell thee that my brother dislikes and that i fear the man of whom thou hast asked me perhaps we are both wrongbut he is a man of violence and hath great influence over many who following the trade of sailors and fishermen become as rude as the elements with which they contend he hath no certain name among them which is not unusual their rude fashion being to distinguish each other by nicknames and they have called him the laird of the lakes not remembering there should be no one called lord save one only in idle derision the pools of salt water left by the tide among the sands being called the lakes of solway  has he no other revenue than he derives from these sands i asked  that i cannot answer replied rachel men say that he wants not money though he lives like an ordinary fisherman and that he imparts freely of his means to the poor around him they intimate that he is a man of consequence once deeply engaged in the unhappy affair of the rebellion and even still too much in danger from the government to assume his own name he is often absent from his cottage at brokenburncliffs for weeks and months  i should have thought said i that the government would scarce at this time of day be likely to proceed against any one even of the most obnoxious rebels many years have passed away  it is true she replied yet such persons may understand that their being connived at depends on their living in obscurity but indeed there can nothing certain be known among these rude people the truth is not in themmost of them participate in the unlawful trade betwixt these parts and the neighbouring shore of england and they are familiar with every species of falsehood and deceit  it is a pity i remarked your brother should have neighbours of such a description especially as i understand he is at some variance with them  where when and about what matter answered miss geddes with an eager and timorous anxiety which made me regret having touched on the subject  i told her in a way as little alarming as i could devise the purport of what passed betwixt this laird of the lakes and her brother at their mornings interview  you affright me much answered she it is this very circumstance which has scared me in the watches of the night when my brother joshua withdrew from an active share in the commercial concerns of my father being satisfied with the portion of worldly substance which he already possessed there were one or two undertakings in which he retained an interest either because his withdrawing might have been prejudicial to friends or because he wished to retain some mode of occupying his time amongst the more important of these is a fishing station on the coast where by certain improved modes of erecting snares opening at the advance of the tide and shutting at the reflux many more fish are taken than can be destroyed by those who like the men of brokenburn use only the boatnet and spear or fishingrod they complain of these tidenets as men call them as an innovation and pretend to a right to remove and destroy them by the strong hand i fear me this man of violence whom they call the laird will execute these his threats which cannot be without both loss and danger to my brother  mr geddes said i ought to apply to the civil magistrate there are soldiers at dumfries who would be detached for his protection  thou speakest friend latimer answered the lady as one who is still in the gall of bitterness and bond of iniquity god forbid that we should endeavour to preserve nets of flax and stakes of wood or the mammon of gain which they procure for us by the hands of men of war and at the risk of spilling human blood  i respect your scruples i replied but since such is your way of thinking your brother ought to avert the danger by compromise or submission  perhaps it would be best answered rachel but what can i say even in the besttrained temper there may remain some leaven of the old adam and i know not whether it is this or a better spirit that maketh my brother joshua determine that though he will not resist force by force neither will he yield up his right to mere threats or encourage wrong to others by yielding to menaces his partners he says confide in his steadiness and that he must not disappoint them by yielding up their right for the fear of the threats of man whose breath is in his nostrils  this observation convinced me that the spirit of the old sharers of the spoil was not utterly departed even from the bosom of the peaceful quaker and i could not help confessing internally that joshua had the right when he averred that there was as much courage in sufferance as in exertion  as we approached the farther end of the willow walk the sullen and continuous sound of the dashing waters became still more and more audible and at length rendered it difficult for us to communicate with each other the conversation dropped but apparently my companion continued to dwell upon the apprehensions which it had excited at the bottom of the walk we obtained a view of the cascade where the swollen brook flung itself in foam and tumult over the natural barrier of rock which seemed in vain to attempt to bar its course i gazed with delight and turning to express my sentiment to my companion i observed that she had folded her hands in an attitude of sorrowful resignation which showed her thoughts were far from the scene which lay before her when she saw that her abstraction was observed she resumed her former placidity of manner and having given me sufficient time to admire this termination of our sober and secluded walk proposed that me should return to the house through her brothers farm even we quakers as we are called have our little pride she said and my brother joshua would not forgive me were i not to show thee the fields which he taketh delight to cultivate after the newest and best fashion for which i promise thee he hath received much praise from good judges as well as some ridicule from those who think it folly to improve on the customs of our ancestors  as she spoke she opened a low door leading through a moss and ivycovered wall the boundary of the pleasureground into the open fields through which we moved by a convenient path leading with good taste and simplicity by stile and hedgerow through pasturage and arable and woodland so that in all ordinary weather the good man might without even soiling his shoes perform his perambulation round the farm there were seats also on which to rest and though not adorned with inscriptions nor quite so frequent in occurrence as those mentioned in the account of the leasowes their situation was always chosen with respect to some distant prospect to be commanded or some homeview to be enjoyed  but what struck me most in joshuas domain was the quantity and the tameness of the game the hen partridge scarce abandoned the roost at the foot of the hedge where she had assembled her covey though the path went close beside her and the hare remaining on her form gazed at us as we passed with her full dark eye or rising lazily and hopping to a little distance stood erect to look at us with more curiosity than apprehension i observed to miss geddes the extreme tameness of these timid and shy animals and she informed me that their confidence arose from protection in the summer and relief during the winter  they are pets she said of my brother who considers them as the better entitled to his kindness that they are a race persecuted by the world in general he denieth himself she said even the company of a dog that these creatures may here at least enjoy undisturbed security yet this harmless or humane propensity or humour hath given offence she added to our dangerous neighbours  she explained this by telling me that my host of the preceding night was remarkable for his attachment to fieldsports which he pursued without much regard to the wishes of the individuals over whose property he followed them the undefined mixture of respect and fear with which he was generally regarded induced most of the neighbouring landholders to connive at what they would perhaps in another have punished as a trespass but joshua geddes would not permit the intrusion of any one upon his premises and as he had before offended several country neighbours who because he would neither shoot himself nor permit others to do so compared him to the dog in the manger so he now aggravated the displeasure which the laird of the lakes had already conceived against him by positively debarring him from pursuing his sport over his groundsso that said rachel geddes i sometimes wish our lot had been cast elsewhere than in these pleasant borders where if we had less of beauty around us we might have had a neighbourhood of peace and goodwill  we at length returned to the house where miss geddes showed me a small study containing a little collection of books in two separate presses  these said she pointing to the smaller press will if thou bestowest thy leisure upon them do thee good and these pointing to the other and larger cabinet can i believe do thee little harm some of our people do indeed hold that every writer who is not with us is against us but brother joshua is mitigated in his opinions and correspondeth with our friend john scot of amwell who hath himself constructed verses well approved of even in the world i wish thee many good thoughts till our family meet at the hour of dinner  left alone i tried both collections the first consisted entirely of religious and controversial tracts and the latter formed a small selection of history and of moral writers both in prose and verse  neither collection promising much amusement thou hast in these close pages the fruits of my tediousness and truly i think writing history ones self being the subject is as amusing as reading that of foreign countries at any time  sam still more drunk than sober arrived in due time with my portmanteau and enabled me to put my dress into order better befitting this temple of cleanliness and decorum where to conclude i believe i shall be a sojourner more days than one see note 1  psi have noted your adventure as you homebred youths may perhaps term it concerning the visit of your doughty laird we travellers hold such an incident no great consequence though it may serve to embellish the uniform life of browns square but art thou not ashamed to attempt to interest one who is seeing the world at large and studying human nature on a large scale by so bald a narrative why what does it amount to after all but that a tory laird dined with a whig lawyer no very uncommon matter especially as you state mr herries to have lost the estate though retaining the designation the laird behaves with haughtiness and impertinencenothing out of character in that is not kicked down stairs as he ought to have been were alan fairford half the man that he would wish his friends to think him aye but then as the young lawyer instead of showing his friend the door chose to make use of it himself he overheard the laird aforesaid ask the old lawyer concerning darsie latimerno doubt earnestly inquiring after the handsome accomplished inmate of his family who has so lately made themis his bow and declined the honour of following her farther you laugh at me for my airdrawn castles but confess have they not surer footing in general than two words spoken by such a man as herries and yetand yeti would rally the matter off alan but in dark nights even the glowworm becomes an object of lustre and to one plunged in my uncertainty and ignorance the slightest gleam that promises intelligence is interesting my life is like the subterranean river in the peak of derby visible only where it crosses the celebrated cavern i am here and this much i know but where i have sprung from or whither my course of life is like to tend who shall tell me your father too seemed interested and alarmed and talked of writing would to heaven he mayi send daily to the posttown for letters     letter viii  alan fairford to darsie latimer  thou mayst clap thy wings and crow as thou pleasest you go in search of adventures but adventures come to me unsought for and oh in what a pleasing shape came mine since it arrived in the form of a clientand a fair client to boot what think you of that darsie you who are such a sworn squire of dames will this not match my adventures with thine that hunt salmon on horseback and will it not besides eclipse the history of a whole tribe of broadbrimsbut i must proceed methodically  when i returned today from the college i was surprised to see a broad grin distending the adust countenance of the faithful james wilkinson which as the circumstance seldom happens above once a year was matter of some surprise moreover he had a knowing glance with his eye which i should have as soon expected from a dumbwaiteran article of furniture to which james in his usual state may be happily assimilated what the devil is the matter james  the devil may be in the matter for aught i ken said james with another provoking grin for here has been a woman calling for you maister alan  a woman calling for me said i in surprise for you know well that excepting old aunt peggy who comes to dinner of a sunday and the still older lady bedrooket who calls ten times a year for the quarterly payment of her jointure of four hundred merks a female scarce approaches our threshold as my father visits all his female clients at their own lodgings james protested however that there had been a lady calling and for me as bonny a lass as i have seen added james since i was in the fusileers and kept company with peg baxter thou knowest all jamess gay recollections go back to the period of his military service the years he has spent in ours having probably been dull enough  did the lady leave no name nor place of address  no replied james but she asked when you wad be at hame and i appointed her for twelve oclock when the house wad be quiet and your father at the bank  for shame james how can you think my fathers being at home or abroad could be of consequencethe lady is of course a decent person  ise uphaud her that sirshe is nane of yourwhewhere james supplied a blank with a low whistlebut i didna kenmy maister makes an unco wark if a woman comes here  i passed into my own room not illpleased that my father was absent notwithstanding i had thought it proper to rebuke james for having so contrived it i disarranged my books to give them the appearance of a graceful confusion on the table and laying my foils useless since your departure across the mantelpiece that the lady might see i was tam marte quam mercurioi endeavoured to dispose my dress so as to resemble an elegant morning deshabillegave my hair the general shade of powder which marks the gentlemanlaid my watch and seals on the table to hint that i understood the value of timeand when i had made all these arrangements of which i am a little ashamed when i think of them i had nothing better to do than to watch the dialplate till the index pointed to noon five minutes elapsed which i allowed for variation of clocksfive minutes more rendered me anxious and doubtfuland five minutes more would have made me impatient  laugh as thou wilt but remember darsie i was a lawyer expecting his first clienta young man how strictly bred up i need not remind you expecting a private interview with a young and beautiful woman but ere the third term of five minutes had elapsed the doorbell was heard to tinkle low and modestly as if touched by some timid hand  james wilkinson swift in nothing is as thou knowest peculiarly slow in answering the doorbell and i reckoned on five minutes good ere his solemn step should have ascended the stair time enough thought i for a peep through the blinds and was hastening to the window accordingly but i reckoned without my host for james who had his own curiosity as well as i was lying perdu in the lobby ready to open at the first tinkle and there was this way maamyes maamthe lady mr alan before i could get to the chair in which i proposed to be discovered seated in all legal dignity the consciousness of being halfcaught in the act of peeping joined to that native air of awkward bashfulness of which i am told the law will soon free me kept me standing on the floor in some confusion while the lady disconcerted on her part remained on the threshold of the room james wilkinson who had his senses most about him and was perhaps willing to prolong his stay in the apartment busied himself in setting a chair for the lady and recalled me to my goodbreeding by the hint i invited her to take possession of it and bid james withdraw  my visitor was undeniably a lady and probably considerably above the ordinary rankvery modest too judging from the mixture of grace and timidity with which she moved and at my entreaty sat down her dress was i should suppose both handsome and fashionable but it was much concealed by a walkingcloak of green silk fancifully embroidered in which though heavy for the season her person was enveloped and which moreover was furnished with a hood  the devil take that hood darsie for i was just able to distinguish that pulled as it was over the face it concealed from me as i was convinced one of the prettiest countenances i have seen and which from a sense of embarrassment seemed to be crimsoned with a deep blush i could see her complexion was beautifulher chin finely turnedher lips coraland her teeth rivals to ivory but further the deponent sayeth not for a clasp of gold ornamented with it sapphire closed the envious mantle under the incognitas throat and the cursed hood concealed entirely the upper part of the face  i ought to have spoken first that is certain but ere i could get my phrases well arranged the young lady rendered desperate i suppose by my hesitation opened the conversation herself  i fear i am an intruder siri expected to meet an elderly gentleman  this brought me to myself my father madam perhaps but you inquired for alan fairfordmy fathers name is alexander  it is mr alan fairford undoubtedly with whom i wished to speak she said with greater confusion but i was told that he was advanced in life  some mistake madam i presume betwixt my father and myselfour christian names have the same initials though the terminations are different iii would esteem it a most fortunate mistake if i could have the honour of supplying my fathers place in anything that could be of service to you  you are very obliging sir a pause during which she seemed undetermined whether to rise or sit still  i am just about to be called to the bar madam said i in hopes to remove her scruples to open her case to me and if my advice or opinion could be of the slightest use although i cannot presume to say that they are much to be depended upon yet  the lady arose i am truly sensible of your kindness sir and i have no doubt of your talents i will be very plain with youit is you whom i came to visit although now that we have met i find it will be much better that i should commit my communication to writing  i hope madam you will not be so cruelso tantalizing i would say consider you are my first clientyour business my first consultationdo not do me the displeasure of withdrawing your confidence because i am a few years younger than you seem to have expected my attention shall make amends for my want of experience  i have no doubt of either said the lady in a grave tone calculated to restrain the air of gallantry with which i had endeavoured to address her but when you have received my letter you will find good reasons assigned why a written communication will best suit my purpose i wish you sir a good morning and she left the apartment her poor baffled counsel scraping and bowing and apologizing for anything that might have been disagreeable to her although the front of my offence seems to be my having been discovered to be younger than my father  the door was openedout she wentwalked along the pavement turned down the close and put the sun i believe into her pocket when she disappeared so suddenly did dullness and darkness sink down on the square when she was no longer visible i stood for a moment as if i had been senseless not recollecting what a fund of entertainment i must have supplied to our watchful friends on the other side of the green then it darted on my mind that i might dog her and ascertain at least who or what she was off i setran down the close where she was no longer to be seen and demanded of one of the dyers lads whether he had seen a lady go down the close or had observed which way she turned  a leddysaid the dyer staring at me with his rainbow countenance mr alan what takes you out rinning like daft without your hat  the devil take my hat answered i running back however in quest of it snatched it up and again sallied forth but as i reached the head of the close once more i had sense enough to recollect that all pursuit would be now in vain besides i saw my friend the journeyman dyer in close confabulation with a peagreen personage of his own profession and was conscious like scrub that they talked of me because they laughed consumedly i had no mind by a second sudden appearance to confirm the report that advocate fairford was gaen daft which had probably spread from campbells closefoot to the mealmarket stairs and so slunk back within my own hole again  my first employment was to remove all traces of that elegant and fanciful disposition of my effects from which i had hoped for so much credit for i was now ashamed and angry at having thought an instant upon the mode of receiving a visit which had commenced so agreeably but terminated in a manner so unsatisfactory i put my folios in their placesthrew the foils into the dressingclosettormenting myself all the while with the fruitless doubt whether i had missed an opportunity or escaped a stratagem or whether the young person had been really startled as she seemed to intimate by the extreme youth of her intended legal adviser the mirror was not unnaturally called in to aid and that cabinetcounsellor pronounced me rather short thickset with a cast of features fitter i trust for the bar than the ballnot handsome enough for blushing virgins to pine for my sake or even to invent sham cases to bring them to my chambersyet not ugly enough either to scare those away who came on real businessdark to be sure butnigri sunt hyacinthithere are pretty things to be said in favour of that complexion  at lengthas common sense will get the better in all cases when a man will but give it fair playi began to stand convicted in my own mind as an ass before the interview for having expected too muchan ass during the interview for having failed to extract the ladys real purposeand an especial ass now that it was over for thinking so much about it but i can think of nothing else and therefore i am determined to think of this to some good purpose  you remember murtough oharas defence of the catholic doctrine of confession because by his soul his sins were always a great burden to his mind till he had told them to the priest and once confessed he never thought more about them i have tried his receipt therefore and having poured my secret mortification into thy trusty ear i will think no more about this maid of the mist     who with no face as twere outfaced me  four oclock plague on her green mantle she can be nothing better than a fairy she keeps possession of my head yet all during dinnertime i was terribly absent but luckily my father gave the whole credit of my reverie to the abstract nature of the doctrine vinco vincentem ergo vinco te upon which brocard of law the professor this morning lectured so i got an early dismissal to my own crib and here am i studying in one sense vincere vincentem to get the better of the silly passion of curiosityi thinki think it amounts to nothing elsewhich has taken such possession of my imagination and is perpetually worrying me with the questionwill she write or no she will notshe will not so says reason and adds why should she take the trouble to enter into correspondence with one who instead of a bold alert prompt gallant proved a chickenhearted boy and left her the whole awkwardness of explanation which he should have met halfway but then says fancy she will write for she was not a bit that sort of person whom you mr reason in your wisdom take her to be she was disconcerted enough without my adding to her distress by any impudent conduct on my part and she will write forby heaven she has written darsie and with a vengeance here is her letter thrown into the kitchen by a caddie too faithful to be bribed either by money or whisky to say more than that he received it with sixpence from an ordinarylooking woman as he was plying on his station near the cross   for alan fairford esquire barrister  sir  excuse my mistake of today i had accidentally learnt that mr darsie latimer had an intimate friend and associate in mr a fairford when i inquired for such a person he was pointed out to me at the cross as i think the exchange of your city is called in the character of a respectable elderly manyour father as i now understand on inquiry at browns square where i understood he resided i used the full name of alan which naturally occasioned you the trouble of this days visit upon further inquiry i am led to believe that you are likely to be the person most active in the matter to which i am now about to direct your attention and i regret much that circumstances arising out of my own particular situation prevent my communicating to you personally what i now apprise you of in this matter  your friend mr darsie latimer is in a situation of considerable danger you are doubtless aware that he has been cautioned not to trust himself in england now if he has not absolutely transgressed this friendly injunction he has at least approached as nearly to the menaced danger as he could do consistently with the letter of the prohibition he has chosen his abode in a neighbourhood very perilous to him and it is only by a speedy return to edinburgh or at least by a removal to some more remote part of scotland that he can escape the machinations of those whose enmity he has to fear i must speak in mystery but my words are not the less certain and i believe you know enough of your friends fortunes to be aware that i could not write this much without being even more intimate with them than you are  if he cannot or will not take the advice here given it is my opinion that you should join him if possible without delay and use by your personal presence and entreaty the arguments which may prove ineffectual in writing one word more and i implore of your candour to take it as it is meant no one supposes that mr fairfords zeal in his friends service needs to be quickened by mercenary motives but report says that mr alan fairford not having yet entered on his professional career may in such a case as this want the means though he cannot want the inclination to act with promptitude the enclosed note mr alan fairford must be pleased to consider as his first professional emolument and she who sends it hopes it will be the omen of unbounded success though the fee comes from a hand so unknown as that of green mantle  a banknote of l20 was the enclosure and the whole incident left me speechless with astonishment i am not able to read over the beginning of my own letter which forms the introduction to this extraordinary communication i only know that though mixed with a quantity of foolery god knows very much different from my present feelings it gives an account sufficiently accurate of the mysterious person from whom this letter comes and that i have neither time nor patience to separate the absurd commentary from the text which it is so necessary you should know  combine this warning so strangely conveyed with the caution impressed on you by your london correspondent griffiths against your visiting englandwith the character of your laird of the solway lakeswith the lawless habits of the people on that frontier country where warrants are not easily executed owing to the jealousy entertained by either country of the legal interference of the other remember that even sir john fielding said to my father that he could never trace a rogue beyond the briggend of dumfriesthink that the distinctions of whig and tory papist and protestant still keep that country in a loose and comparatively lawless statethink of all this my dearest darsie and remember that while at this mount sharon of yours you are residing with a family actually menaced with forcible interference and who while their obstinacy provokes violence are by principle bound to abstain from resistance  nay let me tell you professionally that the legality of the mode of fishing practised by your friend joshua is greatly doubted by our best lawyers and that if the stakenets be considered as actually an unlawful obstruction raised in the channel of the estuary an assembly of persons who shall proceed via facti to pull dawn and destroy them would not in the eye of the law be esteemed guilty of a riot so by remaining where you are you are likely to be engaged in a quarrel with which you have nothing to do and thus to enable your enemies whoever these may be to execute amid the confusion of a general hubbub whatever designs they may have against your personal safety blackfishers poachers and smugglers are a sort of gentry that will not be much checked either by your quakers texts or by your chivalry if you are don quixote enough to lay lance in rest in defence of those of the stakenet and of the sadcoloured garment i pronounce you but a lost knight for as i said before i doubt if these potent redressers of wrongs the justices and constables will hold themselves warranted to interfere in a word return my dear amadis the adventure of the solwaynets is not reserved for your worship come back and i will be your faithful sancho panza upon a more hopeful quest we will beat about together in search of this urganda the unknown she of the green mantle who can read this the riddle of thy fate better than wise eppie of buckhaven well known in the chapbook called the history of buckhaven or cassandra herself  i would fain trifle darsie for in debating with you jests will sometimes go farther than arguments but i am sick at heart and cannot keep the ball up if you have a moments regard for the friendship we have so often vowed to each other let my wishes for once prevail over your own venturous and romantic temper i am quite serious in thinking that the information communicated to my father by this mr herries and the admonitory letter of the young lady bear upon each other and that were you here you might learn something from one or other or from both that might throw light on your birth and parentage you will not surely prefer an idle whim to the prospect which is thus held out to you  i would agreeably to the hint i have received in the young ladys letter for i am confident that such is her condition have ere now been with you to urge these things instead of pouring them out upon paper but you know that the day for my trials is appointed i have already gone through the form of being introduced to the examinators and have gotten my titles assigned me all this should not keep me at home but my father would view any irregularity upon this occasion as a mortal blow to the hopes which he has cherished most fondly during his life viz my being called to the bar with some credit for my own part i know there is no great difficulty in passing these formal examinations else how have some of our acquaintance got through them but to my father these formalities compose an august and serious solemnity to which he has long looked forward and my absenting myself at this moment would wellnigh drive him distracted yet i shall go altogether distracted myself if i have not an instant assurance from you that you are hastening hither meanwhile i have desired hannah to get your little crib into the best order possible i cannot learn that my father has yet written to you nor has he spoken more of his communication with birrenswork but when i let him have some inkling of the dangers you are at present incurring i know my request that you will return immediately will have his cordial support  another reason yeti must give a dinner as usual upon my admission to our friends and my father laying aside all his usual considerations of economy has desired it may be in the best style possible come hither then dear darsie or i protest to you i shall send examination admissiondinner and guests to the devil and come in person to fetch you with a vengeance thine in much anxiety a f     letter ix  alexander fairford ws to mr darsie latimer  dear mr darsie  having been your factor loco tutoris or rather i ought to say in correctness since i acted without warrant from the court your negotiorum gestor that connexion occasions my present writing and although having rendered an account of my intromissions which have been regularly approved of not only by yourself whom i could not prevail upon to look at more than the docket and sum total but also by the worthy mr samuel griffiths of london being the hand through whom the remittances were made i may in some sense be considered as to you functus officio yet to speak facetiously i trust you will not hold me accountable as a vicious intromitter should i still consider myself as occasionally interested in your welfare my motives for writing at this time are twofold  i have met with a mr herries of birrenswork a gentleman of very ancient descent but who hath in time past been in difficulties nor do i know if his affairs are yet well redd birrenswork says that he believes he was very familiar with your father whom he states to have been called ralph latimer of langcote hall in westmoreland and he mentioned family affairs which it may be of the highest importance to you to be acquainted with but as he seemed to decline communicating them to me i could not civilly urge him thereanent thus much i know that mr herries had his own share in the late desperate and unhappy matter of 1745 and was in trouble about it although that is probably now over moreover although he did not profess the popish religion openly he had an eye that way and both of these are reasons why i have hesitated to recommend him to a youth who maybe hath not altogether so well founded his opinions concerning kirk and state that they might not be changed by some sudden wind of doctrine for i have observed ye master darsie to be rather tinctured with the old leaven of prelacythis under your leave and although god forbid that you should be in any manner disaffected to the protestant hanoverian line yet ye have ever loved to hear the blawing blazing stories which the hieland gentlemen tell of those troublous times which if it were their will they had better pretermit as tending rather to shame than to honour it is come to me also by a sidewind as i may say that you have been neighbouring more than was needful among some of the pestilent sect of quakersa people who own neither priest nor king nor civil magistrate nor the fabric of our law and will not depone either in civilibus or criminalibus be the loss to the lieges what it may anent which heresies it were good ye read the snake in the grass or the foot out of the snare being both wellapproved tracts touching these doctrines  now mr darsie ye are to judge for yourself whether ye can safely to your souls weal remain longer among these papists and quakersthese defections on the right hand and failings away on the left and truly if you can confidently resist these evil examples of doctrine i think ye may as well tarry in the bounds where ye are until you see mr herries of birrenswork who does assuredly know more of your matters than i thought had been communicated to any man in scotland i would fain have precognosced him myself on these affairs but found him unwilling to speak out as i have partly intimated before  to call a new causei have the pleasure to tell you that alan has passed his private scots law examinations with good approbationa great relief to my mind especially as worthy mr pest told me in my ear there was no fear of the callant as he familiarly called him which gives me great heart his public trials which are nothing in comparison save a mere form are to take place by order of the honourable dean of faculty on wednesday first and on friday he puts on the gown and gives a bit chack of dinner to his friends and acquaintances as is you know the custom your company will be wished for there master darsie by more than him which i regret to think is impossible to have as well by your engagements as that our cousin peter fairford comes from the west on purpose and we have no place to offer him but your chamber in the wall and to be plain with you after my use and wont master darsie it may be as well that alan and you do not meet till he is hefted as it were to his new calling you are a pleasant gentleman and full of daffing which may well become you as you have enough as i understand to uphold your merry humour if you regard the matter wisely you would perchance consider that a man of substance should have a douce and staid demeanour yet you are so far from growing grave and considerate with the increase of your annual income that the richer you become the merrier i think you grow but this must be at your own pleasure so far as you are concerned alan however overpassing my small savings has the world to win and louping and laughing as you and he were wont to do would soon make the powder flee out of his wig and the pence out of his pocket nevertheless i trust you will meet when you return from your rambles for there is a time as the wise man sayeth for gathering and a time for casting away it is always the part of a man of sense to take the gathering time first i remain dear sir your wellwishing friend and obedient to command alexander fairford  psalans thesis is upon the title de periculo et commodo rei venditae and is a very pretty piece of latinityross house in our neighbourhood is nearly finished and is thought to excel duff house in ornature     letter x  darsie latimer to alan fairford  the plot thickens alan i have your letter and also one from your father the last makes it impossible for me to comply with the kind request which the former urges noi cannot be with you alan and that for the best of all reasonsi cannot and ought not to counteract your fathers anxious wishes i do not take it unkind of him that he desires my absence it is natural that he should wish for his son what his son so well deservesthe advantage of a wiser and steadier companion than i seem to him and yet i am sure i have often laboured hard enough to acquire that decency of demeanour which can no more be suspected of breaking bounds than an owl of catching a butterfly  but it was in vain that i have knitted my brows till i had the headache in order to acquire the reputation of a grave solid and welljudging youth your father always has discovered or thought that he discovered a harebrained eccentricity lying folded among the wrinkles of my forehead which rendered me a perilous associate for the future counsellor and ultimate judge well corporal nyms philosophy must be my comfortthings must be as they mayi cannot come to your fathers house where he wishes not to see me and as to your coming hitherby all that is dear to me i vow that if you are guilty of such a piece of reckless follynot to say undutiful cruelty considering your fathers thoughts and wishesi will never speak to you again as long as i live i am perfectly serious and besides your father while he in a manner prohibits me from returning to edinburgh gives me the strongest reasons for continuing a little while longer in this country by holding out the hope that i may receive from your old friend mr herries of birrenswork some particulars concerning my origin with which that ancient recusant seems to be acquainted  that gentleman mentioned the name of a family in westmoreland with which he supposes me connected my inquiries here after such a family have been ineffectual for the borderers on either side know little of each other but i shall doubtless find some english person of whom to make inquiries since the confounded fetterlock clapped on my movements by old griffiths prevents me repairing to england in person at least the prospect of obtaining some information is greater here than elsewhere it will be an apology for my making a longer stay in this neighbourhood a line of conduct which seems to have your fathers sanction whose opinion must be sounder than that of your wandering damoselle  if the road were paved with dangers which leads to such a discovery i cannot for a moment hesitate to tread it but in fact there is no peril in the case if the tritons of the solway shall proceed to pull down honest joshuas tidenets i am neither quixote enough in disposition nor goliath enough in person to attempt their protection i have no idea of attempting to prop a falling house by putting my shoulders against it and indeed joshua gave me a hint that the company which he belongs to injured in the way threatened some of them being men who thought after the fashion of the world would pursue the rioters at law and recover damages in which probably his own ideas of nonresistance will not prevent his participating therefore the whole affair will take its course as law will as i only mean to interfere when it may be necessary to direct the course of the plaintiffs to thy chambers and i request they may find thee intimate with all the scottish statutes concerning salmon fisheries from the lex aquarum downward  as for the lady of the mantle i will lay a wager that the sun so bedazzled thine eyes on that memorable morning that everything thou didst look upon seemed green and notwithstanding james wilkinsons experience in the fusileers as well as his negative whistle i will venture to hold a crown that she is but a whatshallcallum after all let not even the gold persuade you to the contrary she may make a shift to cause you to disgorge that and immense spoil a sessions fees to boot if you look not all the sharper about you or if it should be otherwise and if indeed there lurk some mystery under this visitation credit me it is one which thou canst not penetrate nor can i as yet even attempt to explain it since if i prove mistaken and mistaken i may easily be i would be fain to creep into phalariss bull were it standing before me ready heated rather than be roasted with thy raillery do not tax me with want of confidence for the instant i can throw any light on the matter thou shalt have it but while i am only blundering about in the dark i do not choose to call wise folks to see me perchance break my nose against a post so if you marvel at this    een marvel on till time makes all things plain  in the meantime kind alan let me proceed in my diurnal  on the third or fourth day after my arrival at mount sharon time that bald sexton to whom i have just referred you did certainly limp more heavily along with me than he had done at first the quaint morality of joshua and huguenot simplicity of his sister began to lose much of their raciness with their novelty and my mode of life by dint of being very quiet began to feel abominably dull it was as thou sayst as if the quakers had put the sun in their pocketsall around was soft and mild and even pleasant but there was in the whole routine a uniformity a want of interest a helpless and hopeless languor which rendered life insipid no doubt my worthy host and hostess felt none of this void this want of excitation which was becoming oppressive to their guest they had their little round of occupations charities and pleasures rachel had her poultryyard and conservatory and joshua his garden besides this they enjoyed doubtless their devotional meditations and on the whole time glided softly and imperceptibly on with them though to me who long for stream and cataract it seemed absolutely to stand still i meditated returning to shepherds bush and began to think with some hankering after little benjie and the rod the imp has ventured hither and hovers about to catch a peep of me now and then i suppose the little sharper is angling for a few more sixpences but this would have been in joshuas eyes a return of the washed sow to wallowing in the mire and i resolved while i remained his guest to spare him so violent a shock to his prejudices the next point was to shorten the time of my proposed stay but alas that i felt to be equally impossible i had named a week and however rashly my promise had been pledged it must be held sacred even according to the letter from which the friends permit no deviation  all these considerations wrought me up to a kind of impatience yesterday evening so that i snatched up my hat and prepared for a sally beyond the cultivated farm and ornamented grounds of mount sharon just as if i were desirous to escape from the realms of art into those of free and unconstrained nature  i was scarcely more delighted when i first entered this peaceful demesne than i now wassuch is the instability and inconsistency of human naturewhen i escaped from it to the open downs which had formerly seemed so waste and dreary the air i breathed felt purer and more bracing the clouds riding high upon a summer breeze drove in gay succession over my head now obscuring the sun now letting its rays stream in transient flashes upon various parts of the landscape and especially upon the broad mirror of the distant firth of solway  i advanced on the scene with the light step of a liberated captive and like john bunyans pilgrim could have found in my heart to sing as i went on my way it seemed as if my gaiety had accumulated while suppressed and that i was in my present joyous mood entitled to expend the savings of the previous week but just as i was about to uplift a merry stave i heard to my joyful surprise the voices of three or more choristers singing with considerable success the lively old catch    for all our men were very very merry     and all our men were drinking     there were two men of mine     three men of thine   and three that belonged to old sir thom o lyne   as they went to the ferry they were very very merry     and all our men were drinking  the original of this catch is to be found in cowleys witty comedy of the guardian the first edition it does not exist in the second and revised edition called the cutter of coleman street    captain blade  ha ha boys another catch              and all our men are very very merry              and all our men were drinking   cutter    one man of mine   dogrel    two men of mine   blade     three men of mine   cutter    and one man of mine   omnes     as we went by the way we were drunk drunk damnably              drunk and all our men were very very merry c  such are the words which are somewhat altered and amplified in the text the play was acted in presence of charles ii then prince of wales in 1641 the catch in the text has been happily set to music  as the chorus ended there followed a loud and hearty laugh by way of cheers attracted by sounds which were so congenial to my present feelings i made towards the spot from which they camecautiously however for the downs as had been repeatedly hinted to me had no good name and the attraction of the music without rivalling that of the sirens in melody might have been followed by similarly inconvenient consequences to an incautious amateur  i crept on therefore trusting that the sinuosities of the ground broken as it was into knells and sandpits would permit me to obtain a sight of the musicians before i should be observed by them as i advanced the old ditty was again raised the voices seemed those of a man and two boys they were rough but kept good time and were managed with too much skill to belong to the ordinary country people    jack looked at the sun and cried fire fire fire   tom stabled his keffel in birkendale mire   jem started a calf and hallood for a stag   will mounted a gatepost instead of his nag   for all our men were very very merry     and all our men were drinking       there were two men of mine       three men of thine   and three that belonged to old sir thom o lyne   as they went to the ferry they were very very merry     for all our men were drinking  the voices as they mixed in their several parts and ran through them untwisting and again entwining all the links of the merry old catch seemed to have a little touch of the bacchanalian spirit which they celebrated and showed plainly that the musicians were engaged in the same joyous revel as the menyie of old sir thom o lyne at length i came within sight of them three in number where they sat cosily niched into what you might call a bunker a little sandpit dry and snug and surrounded by its banks and a screen of whins in full bloom  the only one of the trio whom i recognized as a personal acquaintance was the notorious little benjie who having just finished his stave was cramming a huge luncheon of piecrust into his mouth with one hand while in the other he held a foaming tankard his eyes dancing with all the glee of a forbidden revel and his features which have at all times a mischievous archness of expression confessing the full sweetness of stolen waters and bread eaten in secret  there was no mistaking the profession of the male and female who were partners with benjie in these merry doings the mans long loosebodied greatcoat wraprascal as the vulgar term it the fiddlecase with its straps which lay beside him and a small knapsack which might contain his few necessaries a clear grey eye features which in contending with many a storm had not lost a wild and careless expression of glee animated at present when he was exercising for his own pleasure the arts which he usually practised for breadall announced one of those peripatetic followers of orpheus whom the vulgar call a strolling fiddler gazing more attentively i easily discovered that though the poor musicians eyes were open their sense was shut and that the ecstasy with which he turned them up to heaven only derived its apparent expression from his own internal emotions but received no assistance from the visible objects around beside him sat his female companion in a mans hat a blue coat which seemed also to have been an article of male apparel and a red petticoat she was cleaner in person and in clothes than such itinerants generally are and having been in her day a strapping bona roba she did not even yet neglect some attention to her appearance wore a large amber necklace and silver earrings and had her laid fastened across her breast with a brooch of the same metal  the man also looked clean notwithstanding the meanness of his attire and had a decent silk handkerchief well knotted about his throat under which peeped a clean owerlay his beard also instead of displaying a grizzly stubble unmowed for several days flowed in thick and comely abundance over the breast to the length of six inches and mingled with his hair which was but beginning to exhibit a touch of age to sum up his appearance the loose garment which i have described was secured around him by a large oldfashioned belt with brass studs in which hung a dirk with a knife and fork its usual accompaniments altogether there was something more wild and adventurouslooking about the man than i could have expected to see in an ordinary modern crowder and the bow which he now and then drew across the violin to direct his little choir was decidedly that of no ordinary performer  you must understand that many of these observations were the fruits of after remark for i had scarce approached so near as to get a distinct view of the party when my friend benjies lurching attendant which he calls by the appropriate name of hemp began to cock his tail and ears and sensible of my presence flew barking like a fury to the place where i had meant to lie concealed till i heard another song i was obliged however to jump on my feet and intimidate hemp who would otherwise have bit me by two sound kicks on the ribs which sent him howling back to his master  little benjie seemed somewhat dismayed at my appearance but calculating on my placability and remembering perhaps that the illused solomon was no palfrey of mine he speedily affected great glee and almost in one breath assured the itinerants that i was a grand gentleman and had plenty of money and was very kind to poor folk and informed me that this was willie steensonwandering willie the best fiddler that ever kittled thairm with horsehair  the woman rose and curtsied and wandering willie sanctioned his own praises with a nod and the ejaculation all is true that the little boy says  i asked him if he was of this country  this country replied the blind mani am of every country in broad scotland and a wee bit of england to the boot but yet i am in some sense of this country for i was born within hearing of the roar of solway will i give your honour a touch of the auld breadwinner  he preluded as he spoke in a manner which really excited my curiosity and then taking the old tune of galashiels for his theme he graced it with a number of wild complicated and beautiful variations during which it was wonderful to observe how his sightless face was lighted up under the conscious pride and heartfelt delight in the exercise of his own very considerable powers  what think you of that now for threescore and twa  i expressed my surprise and pleasure  a rant manan auld rant said willie naething like the music ye hae in your ballhouses and your playhouses in edinbro but its weel aneugh anes in a way at a dykeside heres anotherits no a scotch tune but it passes for aneoswald made it himsell i reckonhe has cheated mony ane but he canna cheat wandering willie  he then played your favourite air of roslin castle with a number of beautiful variations some of which i am certain were almost extempore  you have another fiddle there my friend said ihave you a comrade but willies ears were deaf or his attention was still busied with the tune  the female replied in his stead o aye sirtroth we have a partnera gangrel body like oursells no but my hinny might have been better if he had liked for mony a bein nook in mony a braw house has been offered to my hinny willie if he wad but just bide still and play to the gentles  whisht woman whisht said the blind man angrily shaking his locks dinna deave the gentleman wi your havers stay in a house and play to the gentlesstrike up when my leddy pleases and lay down the bow when my lord bids na na thats nae life for willie look out maggiepeer out woman and see if ye can see robin coming deil be in him he has got to the leeside of some smugglers punchbowl and he wunna budge the night i doubt  that is your consorts instrument said i will you give me leave to try my skill i slipped at the same time a shilling into the womans hand  i dinna ken whether i dare trust robins fiddle to ye said willie bluntly his wife gave him a twitch hout awa maggie he said in contempt of the hint though the gentleman may hae gien ye siller he may have nae bowhand for a that and ill no trust robins fiddle wi an ignoramus but thats no sae muckle amiss he added as i began to touch the instrument i am thinking ye have some skill o the craft  to confirm him in this favourable opinion i began to execute such a complicated flourish as i thought must have turned crowdero into a pillar of stone with envy and wonder i scaled the top of the fingerboard to dive at once to the bottomskipped with flying fingers like timotheus from shift to shiftstruck arpeggios and harmonic tones but without exciting any of the astonishment which i had expected  willie indeed listened to me with considerable attention but i was no sooner finished than he immediately mimicked on his own instrument the fantastic complication of tones which i had produced and made so whimsical a parody of my performance that although somewhat angry i could not help laughing heartily in which i was joined by benjie whose reverence for me held him under no restraint while the poor dame fearful doubtless of my taking offence at this familiarity seemed divided betwixt her conjugal reverence for her willie and her desire to give him a hint for his guidance  at length the old man stopped of his own accord and as if he had sufficiently rebuked me by his mimicry he said but for a that ye will play very weel wi a little practice and some gude teaching but ye maun learn to put the heart into it manto put the heart into it  i played an air in simpler taste and received more decided approbation  thats something like it man od ye are a clever birkie  the woman touched his coat again the gentleman is a gentleman willieye

will go with me to a house hard by i would be glad to have a night with you  here i looked round and observed benjie smothering a laugh which i was sure had mischief in it i seized him suddenly by the ear and made him confess that he was laughing at the thoughts of the reception which a fiddler was likely to get from the quakers at mount sharon i chucked him from me not sorry that his mirth had reminded me in time of what i had for the moment forgotten and invited the itinerant to go with me to shepherds bush from which i proposed to send word to mr geddes that i should not return home that evening but the minstrel declined this invitation also he was engaged for the night he said to a dance in the neighbourhood and vented a round execration on the laziness or drunkenness of his comrade who had not appeared at the place of rendezvous  i will go with you instead of him said i in a sudden whim and i will give you a crown to introduce me as your comrade  you gang instead of rob the rambler my certie freend ye are no blate answered wandering willie in a tone which announced death to my frolic  but maggie whom the offer of the crown had not escaped began to open on that scent with a maundering sort of lecture oh willie hinny willie whan will ye learn to be wise theres a crown to be win for naething but saying ae mans name instead of anither and waes me i hae just a shilling of this gentlemans gieing and a boddle of my ain and ye wunna bend your will sae muckle as to take up the siller thats flung at your feet ye will die the death of a cadgers powney in a wreath of drift

disinterested man of music i would like to have a round wi you thats certainbut a farmer and with a hand that never held pleughstilt or pettle that will never do ye may pass for a tradeslad from

little manoeuvre  are ye at it again wi the siller ye jaud ill be sworn ye wad rather hear ae twalpenny clink against another than have a spring from rory dall blind rorie a famous musician according to tradition if he wascoming alive again anes errand gang doun the gate to lucky gregsons and get the things ye want and bide there till eleen hours in the morn and if you see robin send him on to me

the blessing o sight  your tongue gars me whiles tire of the blessing of hearing woman replied willie in answer to this tender exhortation  but i now put in for my interest hollo good folks remember that i am to send the boy to mount sharon and if you go to the shepherds bush honest woman how the deuce am i to guide the blind man where he is going i know little or nothing of the country  and ye ken mickle less of my hinnie sir replied maggie that think he needs ony guiding hes the best guide himsell that yell find between criffell and carlisle horseroad and footpath parishroad and kirkroad

the day i wish it was dark night and rain and wind for the gentlemans sake that i might show him there is whiles when ane had better want een than have them for i am as true a guide by darkness as by daylight  internally as well pleased that my companion was not put to give me this last proof of his skill i wrote a note with a pencil desiring samuel to bring my horses at midnight when i thought my frolic would be wellnigh over to the place to which the bearer should direct him and i sent little benjie with an apology to the worthy quakers  as we parted in different directions the good woman said oh sir if ye wad but ask willie to tell ye ane of his tales to shorten the gate he can speak like ony minister frae the pupit and he might have been a minister himsell but  haud your tongue ye fule said williebut stay meggie me a kiss ne maunna part in anger neitherand thus our society separated  it is certain that in many cases the blind have by constant exercise of their other organs learned to overcome a defect which one would think incapable of being supplied every reader must remember the celebrated blind jack of knaresborough who lived by laying out roads     letter xi  the same to the same  you are now to conceive us proceeding in our different directions across the bare downs yonder flies little benjie to the northward with hemp scampering at his heels both running as if for dear life so long as the rogue is within sight of his employer and certain to take the walk very easy so soon as he is out of ken stepping westward you see maggies tall form and highcrowned hat relieved by the fluttering of her plaid upon the left shoulder darkening as the distance diminishes her size and as the level sunbeams begin to sink upon the sea she is taking her quiet journey to the shepherds bush  then stoutly striding over the lea you have a full view of darsie latimer with his new acquaintance wandering willie who bating that he touched the ground now and then with his staff not in a doubtful groping manner but with the confident air of an experienced pilot heaving the lead when he has the soundings by heart walks as firmly and boldly as if he possessed the eyes of argus there they go each with his violin slung at his back but one of them at least totally ignorant whither their course is directed  and wherefore did you enter so keenly into such a mad frolic says my wise counsellorwhy i think upon the whole that as a sense of loneliness and a longing for that kindness which is interchanged in society led me to take up my temporary residence at mount sharon the monotony of my life there the quiet simplicity of the conversation of the geddeses and the uniformity of their amusements and employments wearied out my impatient temper and prepared me for the first escapade which chance might throw in my way  what would i have given that i could have procured that solemn grave visage of thine to dignify this joke as it has done full many a one of thine own thou hast so happy a knack of doing the most foolish things in the wisest manner that thou mightst pass thy extravagances for rational actions even in the eyes of prudence herself  from the direction which my guide observed i began to suspect that the dell at brokenburn was our probable destination and it became important to me to consider whether i could with propriety or even perfect safety intrude myself again upon the hospitality of my former host i therefore asked willie whether we were bound for the lairds as folk called him  do ye ken the laird said willie interrupting a sonata of corelli of which he had whistled several bars with great precision  i know the laird a little said i and therefore i was doubting whether i ought to go to his town in disguise  i should doubt not a little only but a great deal before i took ye there my chap said wandering willie for i am thinking it wad be worth little less than broken banes baith to you and me na na chap we are no ganging to the lairds but to a blithe birling at the brokenburnfoot where there will be mony a braw lad and lass and maybe there may be some of the lairds folks for he never comes to sic splores himsell he is all for fowlingpiece and salmonspear now that pike and musket are out of the question  he has been at soldier then said i  ise warrant him a soger answered willie but take my advice and speer as little about him as he does about you best to let sleeping dogs lie better say naething about the laird my man and tell me instead what sort of a chap ye are that are sae ready to cleik in with an auld gaberlunzie fiddler maggie says yere gentle but a shilling maks a the difference that maggie kens between a gentle and a semple and your crowns wad mak ye a prince of the blood in her een but i am ane that ken full weel that ye may wear good claithes and have a saft hand and yet that may come of idleness as weel as gentrice  i told him my name with the same addition i had formerly given to mr joshua geddes that i was a lawstudent tired of my studies and rambling about for exercise and amusement  and are ye in the wont of drawing up wi a the gangrel bodies that ye meet on the highroad or find cowering in a sandbunker upon the links demanded willie  oh no only with honest folks like yourself willie was my reply  honest folks like me how do ye ken whether i am honest or what i am i may be the deevil himsell for what ye ken for he has power to come disguised like an angel of light and besides he is a prime fiddler he played a sonata to corelli ye ken  there was something odd in this speech and the tone in which it was said it seemed as if my companion was not always in his constant mind or that he was willing to try if he could frighten me i laughed at the extravagance of his language however and asked him in reply if he was fool enough to believe that the foul fiend would play so silly a masquerade  ye ken little about itlittle about it said the old man shaking his head and beard and knitting his brows i could tell ye something about that  what his wife mentioned of his being a taleteller as well as a musician now occurred to me and as you know i like tales of superstition i begged to have a specimen of his talent as we went along  it is very true said the blind man that when i am tired of scraping thairm or singing ballants i whiles mak a tale serve the turn among the country bodies and i have some fearsome anes that make the auld carlines shake on the settle and the bits o bairns skirl on their minnies out frae their beds but this that i am gaun to tell you was a thing that befell in our ain house in my fathers timethat is my father was then a hafflins callant and i tell it to you that it may be a lesson to you that are but a young thoughtless chap wha ye draw up wi on a lonely road for muckle was the dool and care that came ot to my gudesire  he commenced his tale accordingly in a distinct narrative tone of voice which he raised and depressed with considerable skill at times sinking almost into a whisper and turning his clear but sightless eyeballs upon my face as if it had been possible for him to witness the impression which his narrative made upon my features i will not spare you a syllable of it although it be of the longest so i make a dashand begin  wandering willies tale  ye maun have heard of sir robert redgauntlet of that ilk who lived in these parts before the dear years the country will lang mind him and our fathers used to draw breath thick if ever they heard him named he was out wi the hielandmen in montroses time and again he was in the hills wi glencairn in the saxteen hundred and fiftytwa and sae when king charles the second came in wha was in sic favour as the laird of redgauntlet he was knighted at lonon court wi the kings ain sword and being a redhot prelatist he came down here rampauging like a lion with commissions of lieutenancy and of lunacy for what i ken to put down a the whigs and covenanters in the country wild wark they made of it for the whigs were as dour as the cavaliers were fierce and it was which should first tire the other redgauntlet was ay for the strong hand and his name is kend as wide in the country as claverhouses or tam dalyells glen nor dargle nor mountain nor cave could hide the puir hillfolk when redgauntlet was out with bugle and bloodhound after them as if they had been sae mony deer and troth when they fand them they didna mak muckle mair ceremony than a hielandman wi a roebuckit was just will ye tak the testif not make readypresentfireand there lay the recusant  far and wide was sir robert hated and feared men thought he had a direct compact with satanthat he was proof against steeland that bullets happed aff his buffcoat like hailstanes from a hearththat he had a mear that would turn a hare on the side of carrifragawns a precipitous side of a mountain in moffatdaleand muckle to the same purpose of whilk mair anon the best blessing they wared on him was deil scowp wi redgauntlet he wasna a bad master to his ain folk though and was weel aneugh liked by his tenants and as for the lackies and troopers that raid out wi him to the persecutions as the whigs caad those killing times they wad hae drunken themsells blind to his health at ony time  now you are to ken that my gudesire lived on redgauntlets grundthey ca the place primrose knowe we had lived on the grund and under the redgauntlets since the riding days and lang before it was a pleasant bit and i think the air is callerer and fresher there than onywhere else in the country its a deserted now and i sat on the broken doorcheek three days since and was glad i couldna see the plight the place was in but thats a wide o the mark there dwelt my gudesire steenie steenson a rambling rattling chiel he had been in his young days and could play weel on the pipes he was famous at hoopers and girdersa cumberland couldna touch him at jockie lattinand he had the finest finger for the backlilt between berwick and carlisle the like o steenie wasna the sort that they made whigs o and so he became a tory as they ca it which we now ca jacobites just out of a kind of needcessity that he might belang to some side or other he had nae ill will to the whig bodies and liked little to see the blude rin though being obliged to follow sir robert in hunting and hoisting watching and warding he saw muckle mischief and maybe did some that he couldna avoid  now steenie was a kind of favourite with his master and kend a the folks about the castle and was often sent for to play the pipes when they were at their merriment auld dougal maccallum the butler that had followed sir robert through gude and ill thick and thin pool and stream was specially fond of the pipes and ay gae my gudesire his gude word wi the laird for dougal could turn his master round his finger  weel round came the revolution and it had like to have broken the hearts baith of dougal and his master but the change was not athegether sae great as they feared and other folk thought for the whigs made an unco crawing what they wad do with their auld enemies and in special wi sir robert redgauntlet but there were ower mony great folks dipped in the same doings to mak a spick and span new warld so parliament passed it a ower easy and sir robert bating that he was held to hunting foxes instead of covenanters remained just the man he was the caution and moderation of king william iii and his principles of unlimited toleration deprived the cameronians of the opportunity they ardently desired to retaliate the injuries which they had received during the reign of prelacy and purify the land as they called it from the pollution of blood they esteemed the revolution therefore only a half measure which neither comprehended the rebuilding the kirk in its full splendour nor the revenge of the death of the saints on their persecutors his revel was as loud and his hall as weel lighted as ever it had been though maybe he lacked the fines of the nonconformists that used to come to stock his larder and cellar for it is certain he began to be keener about the rents than his tenants used to find him before and they behoved to be prompt to the rentday or else the laird wasna pleased and he was sic an awsome body that naebody cared to anger him for the oaths he swore and the rage that he used to get into and the looks that he put on made men sometimes think him a devil incarnate  weel my gudesire was nae managerno that he was a very great misguiderbut he hadna the saving gift and he got twa terms rent in arrear he got the first brash at whitsunday put ower wi fair word and piping but when martinmas came there was a summons from the grundofficer to come wi the rent on a day preceese or else steenie behoved to flit sair wark he had to get the siller but he was weelfreended and at last he got the haill scraped thegethera thousand merksthe maist of it was from a neighbour they cad laurie lapraika sly tod laurie had walth o gearcould hunt wi the hound and rin wi the hareand be whig or tory saunt or sinner as the wind stood he was a professor in this revolution warld but he liked an orra sough of this warld and a tune on the pipes weel aneugh at a bytime and abune a he thought he had gude security for the siller he lent my gudesire ower the stocking at primrose knowe  away trots my gudesire to redgauntlet castle wi a heavy purse and a light heart glad to be out of the lairds danger weel the first thing he learned at the castle was that sir robert had fretted himsell into a fit of the gout because he did not appear before twelve oclock it wasna athegether for sake of the money dougal thought but because he didna like to part wi my gudesire aff the grund dougal was glad to see steenie and brought him into the great oak parlour and there sat the laird his leesome lane excepting that he had beside him a great illfavoured jackanape that was a special pet of his a cankered beast it was and mony an illnatured trick it playedill to please it was and easily angeredran about the haill castle chattering and yowling and pinching and biting folk specially before ill weather or disturbances in the state sir robert caad it major weir after the warlock that was burnt a celebrated wizard executed at edinburgh for sorcery and other crimes and few folk liked either the name or the conditions of the creaturethey thought there was something in it by ordinarand my gudesire was not just easy in mind when the door shut on him and he saw himself in the room wi naebody but the laird dougal maccallum and the major a thing that hadna chanced to him before  sir robert sat or i should say lay in a great armed chair wi his grand velvet gown and his feet on a cradle for he had baith gout and gravel and his face looked as gash and ghastly as satans major weir sat opposite to him in a red laced coat and the lairds wig on his head and ay as sir robert girned wi pain the jackanape girned too like a sheepshead between a pair of tangsan illfaurd fearsome couple they were the lairds buffcoat was hung on a pin behind him and his broadsword and his pistols within reach for he keepit up the auld fashion of having the weapons ready and a horse saddled day and night just as he used to do when he was able to loup on horseback and away after ony of the hillfolk he could get speerings of some said it was for fear of the whigs taking vengeance but i judge it was just his auld customhe wasna gien to fear onything the rentalbook wi its black cover and brass clasps was lying beside him and a book of sculduddry sangs was put betwixt the leaves to keep it open at the place where it bore evidence against the goodman of primrose knowe as behind the hand with his mails and duties sir robert gave my gudesire a look as if he would have withered his heart in his bosom ye maun ken he had a way of bending his brows that men saw the visible mark of a horseshoe in his forehead deep dinted as if it had been stamped there  are ye come lighthanded ye son of a toom whistle said sir robert zounds if you are  my gudesire with as gude acountenance as he could put on made a leg and placed the bag of money on the table wi a dash like a man that does something clever the laird drew it to him hastilyis it all here steenie man  your honour will find it right said my gudesire  here dougal said the laird gie steenie a tass of brandy downstairs till i count the siller and write the receipt  but they werena weel out of the room when sir robert gied a yelloch that garrd the castle rock back ran dougalin flew the liverymenyell on yell gied the laird ilk ane mair awfu than the ither my gudesire knew not whether to stand or flee but he ventured back into the parlour where a was gaun hirdygirdienaebody to say come in or gae out terribly the laird roared for cauld water to his feet and wine to cool his throat and hell hell hell and its flames was ay the word in his mouth they brought him water and when they plunged his swollen feet into the tub he cried out it was burning and folk say that it did bubble and sparkle like a seething cauldron he flung the cup at dougals head and said he had given him blood instead of burgundy and sure aneugh the lass washed clotted blood aff the carpet the neist day the jackanape they caad major weir it jibbered and cried as if it was mocking its master my gudesires head was like to turnhe forgot baith siller and receipt and downstairs he banged but as he ran the shrieks came faint and fainter there was a deepdrawn shivering groan and word gaed through the castle that the laird was dead  weel away came my gudesire wi his finger in his mouth and his best hope was that dougal had seen the moneybag and heard the laird speak of writing the receipt the young laird now sir john came from edinburgh to see things put to rights sir john and his father never greed weel sir john had been bred an advocate and afterwards sat in the last scots parliament and voted for the union having gotten it was thought a rug of the compensationsif his father could have come out of his grave he would have brained him for it on his awn hearthstane some thought it was easier counting with the auld rough knight than the fairspoken young anebut mair of that anon  dougal maccallum poor body neither grat nor grained but gaed about the house looking like a corpse but directing as was his duty a the order of the grand funeral now dougal looked ay waur and waur when night was coming and was ay the last to gang to his bed whilk was in a little round just opposite the chamber of dais whilk his master occupied while he was living and where he now lay in state as they caad it weeladay the night before the funeral dougal could keep his awn counsel nae langer he came doun with his proud spirit and fairly asked auld hutcheon to sit in his room with him for an hour when they were in the round dougal took ae tass of brandy to himsell and gave another to hutcheon and wished him all health and lang life and said that for himsell he wasna lang for this world for that every night since sir roberts death his silver call had sounded from the state chamber just as it used to do at nights in his lifetime to call dougal to help to turn him in his bed dougal said that being alone with the dead on that floor of the tower for naebody cared to wake sir robert redgauntlet like another corpse he had never daured to answer the call but that now his conscience checked him for neglecting his duty for though death breaks service said maccallum it shall never break my service to sir robert and i will answer his next whistle so be you will stand by me hutcheon  hutcheon had nae will to the wark but he had stood by dougal in battle and broil and he wad not fail him at this pinch so down the carles sat ower a stoup of brandy and hutcheon who was something of a clerk would have read a chapter of the bible but dougal would hear naething but a blaud of davie lindsay whilk was the waur preparation  when midnight came and the house was quiet as the grave sure enough the silver whistle sounded as sharp and shrill as if sir robert was blowing it and up got the twa auld servingmen and tottered into the room where the dead man lay hutcheon saw aneugh at the first glance for there were torches in the room which showed him the foul fiend in his ain shape sitting on the lairds coffin ower he cowped as if he had been dead he could not tell how lang he lay in a trance at the door but when he gathered himself he cried on his neighbour and getting nae answer raised the house when dougal was found lying dead within twa steps of the bed where his masters coffin was placed as for the whistle it was gaen anes and ay but mony a time was it heard at the top of the house on the bartizan and amang the auld chimneys and turrets where the howlets have their nests sir john hushed the matter up and the funeral passed over without mair boglewark  but when a was ower and the laird was beginning to settle his affairs every tenant was called up for his arrears and my gudesire for the full sum that stood against him in the rentalbook weel away he trots to the castle to tell his story and there he is introduced to sir john sitting in his fathers chair in deep mourning with weepers and hanging cravat and a small wallring rapier by his side instead of the auld broadsword that had a hundredweight of steel about it what with blade chape and baskethilt i have heard their communing so often tauld ower that i almost think i was there mysell though i couldna be born at the time in fact alan my companion mimicked with a good deal of humour the flattering conciliating tone of the tenants address and the hypocritical melancholy of the lairds reply his grandfather he said had while he spoke his eye fixed on the rentalbook as if it were a mastiffdog that he was afraid would spring up and bite him  i wuss ye joy sir of the head seat and the white loaf and the braid lairdship your father was a kind man to friends and followers muckle grace to you sir john to fill his shoonhis boots i suld say for he seldom wore shoon unless it were muils when he had the gout  aye steenie quoth the laird sighing deeply and putting his napkin to his een his was a sudden call and he will be missed in the country no time to set his house in orderweel prepared godward no doubt which is the root of the matterbut left us behind a tangled heap to wind steeniehem hem we maun go to business steenie much to do and little time to do it in  here he opened the fatal volume i have heard of a thing they call doomsday booki am clear it has been a rental of backganging tenants  stephen said sir john still in the same soft sleekit tone of voicestephen stevenson or steenson ye are down here for a years rent behind the handdue at last term  stephen please your honour sir john i paid it to your father  sir john ye took a receipt then doubtless stephen and can produce it  stephen indeed i hadna time an it like your honour for nae sooner had i set doun the siller and just as his honour sir robert thats gaen drew it till him to count it and write out the receipt he was taen wi the pains that removed him  that was unlucky said sir john after a pause but ye maybe paid it in the presence of somebody i want but a talis qualis evidence stephen i would go ower strictly to work with no poor man  stephen troth sir john there was naebody in the room but dougal maccallum the butler but as your honour kens he has een followed his auld master  very unlucky again stephen said sir john without altering his voice a single note the man to whom ye paid the money is deadand the man who witnessed the payment is dead tooand the siller which should have been to the fore is neither seen nor heard tell of in the repositories how am i to believe a this  stephen i dinna ken your honour but there is a bit memorandum note of the very coins for god help me i had to borrow out of twenty purses and i am sure that ilka man there set down will take his grit oath for what purpose i borrowed the money  sir john i have little doubt ye borrowed the money steenie it is the payment to my father that i want to have some proof of  stephen the siller maun be about the house sir john and since your honour never got it and his honour that was canna have taen it wi him maybe some of the family may have seen it  sir john we will examine the servants stephen that is but reasonable  but lackey and lass and page and groom all denied stoutly that they had ever seen such a bag of money as my gudesire described what was waur he had unluckily not mentioned to any living soul of them his purpose of paying his rent ae quean had noticed something under his arm but she took it for the pipes  sir john redgauntlet ordered the servants out of the room and then said to my gudesire now steenie ye see ye have fair play and as i have little doubt ye ken better where to find the siller than ony other body i beg in fair terms and for your own sake that you will end this fasherie for stephen ye maun pay or flit  the lord forgie your opinion said stephen driven almost to his wits endi am an honest man  so am i stephen said his honour and so are all the folks in the house i hope but if there be a knave amongst us it must be he that tells the story he cannot prove he paused and then added mair sternly if i understand your trick sir you want to take advantage of some malicious reports concerning things in this family and particularly respecting my fathers sudden death thereby to cheat me out of the money and perhaps take away my character by insinuating that i have received the rent i am demanding where do you suppose this money to be i insist upon knowing  my gudesire saw everything look so muckle against him that he grew nearly desperatehowever he shifted from one foot to another looked to every corner of the room and made no answer  speak out sirrah said the laird assuming a look of his fathers a very particular ane which he had when he was angryit seemed as if the wrinkles of his frown made that selfsame fearful shape of a horses shoe in the middle of his browspeak out sir i will know your thoughtsdo you suppose that i have this money  far be it frae me to say so said stephen  do you charge any of my people with having taken it  i wad be laith to charge them that may be innocent said my gudesire and if there be any one that is guilty i have nae proof  somewhere the money must be if there is a word of truth in your story said sir john i ask where you think it isand demand a correct answer  in hell if you will have my thoughts of it said my gudesire driven to extremity in hell with your father his jackanape and his silver whistle  down the stairs he ran for the parlour was nae place for him after such a word and he heard the laird swearing blood and wounds behind him as fast as ever did sir robert and roaring for the bailie and the baronofficer  away rode my gudesire to his chief creditor him they cad laurie lapraik to try if he could make onything out of him but when he tauld his story he got but the worst word in his wamethief beggar and dyvour were the saftest terms and to the boot of these hard terms laurie brought up the auld story of his dipping his hand in the blood of gods saunts just as if a tenant could have helped riding with the laird and that a laird like sir robert redgauntlet my gudesire was by this time far beyond the bounds of patience and while he and laurie were at deil speed the liars he was wanchancie aneugh to abuse lapraiks doctrine as weel as the man ond said things that garrd folks flesh grue that heard themhe wasna just himsell and he had lived wi a wild set in his day  at last they parted and my gudesire was to ride hame through the wood of pitmurkie that is a fou of black firs as they sayi ken the wood but the firs may be black or white for what i can tellat the entry of the wood there is a wild common and on the edge of the common a little lonely changehouse that was keepit then by an ostlerwife they suld hae caad her tibbie faw and there puir steenie cried for a mutchkin of brandy for he had had no refreshment the haill day tibbie was earnest wi him to take a bite of meat but he couldna think ot nor would he take his foot out of the stirrup and took off the brandy wholely at twa draughts and named a toast at eachthe first was the memory of sir robert redgauntlet and might he never lie quiet in his grave till he had righted his poor bondtenant and the second was a health to mans enemy if he would but get him back the pock of siller or tell him what came ot for he saw the haill world was like to regard him as a thief and a cheat and he took that waur than even the ruin of his house and hauld  on he rode little caring where it was a dark night turned and the trees made it yet darker and he let the beast take its ain road through the wood when all of a sudden from tired and wearied that it was before the nag began to spring and flee and stend that my gudesire could hardly keep the saddle upon the whilk a horseman suddenly riding up beside him said thats a mettle beast of yours freend will you sell him so saying he touched the horses neck with his ridingwand and it fell into its auld heighho of a stumbling trot but his spunks soon out of him i think continued the stranger and that is like mony a mans courage that thinks he wad do great things till he come to the proof  my gudesire scarce listened to this but spurred his horse with gude een to you freend  but its like the stranger was ane that doesna lightly yield his point for ride as steenie liked he was ay beside him at the selfsame pace at last my gudesire steenie steenson grew half angry and to say the truth half feared  what is it that ye want with me freend he said if ye be a robber i have nae money if ye be a leal man wanting company i have nae heart to mirth or speaking and if ye want to ken the road i scarce ken it mysell  if you will tell me your grief said the stranger i am one that though i have been sair miscaad in the world am the only hand for helping my freends  so my gudesire to ease his ain heart mair than from any hope of help told him the story from beginning to end  its a hard pinch said the stranger but i think i can help you  if you could lend the money sir and take a lang dayi ken nae other help on earth said my gudesire  but there may be some under the earth said the stranger come ill be frank wi you i could lend you the money on bond but you would maybe scruple my terms now i can tell you that your auld laird is disturbed in his grave by your curses and the wailing of your family and if ye daur venture to go to see him he will give you the receipt  my gudesires hair stood on end at this proposal but he thought his companion might be some humoursome chield that was trying to frighten him and might end with lending him the money besides he was bauld wi brandy and desperate wi distress and he said he had courage to go to the gate of hell and a step farther for that receipt the stranger laughed  weel they rode on through the thickest of the wood when all of a sudden the horse stopped at the door of a great house and but that he knew the place was ten miles off my father would have thought he was at redgauntlet castle they rode into the outer courtyard through the muckle faulding yetts and aneath the auld portcullis and the whole front of the house was lighted and there were pipes and fiddles and as much dancing and deray within as used to be at sir roberts house at pace and yule and such high seasons they lap off and my gudesire as seemed to him fastened his horse to the very ring he had tied him to that morning when he gaed to wait on the young sir john  god said my gudesire if sir roberts death be but a dream  he knocked at the ha door just as he was wont and his auld acquaintance dougal maccallumjust after his wont toocame to open the door and said piper steenie are ye there lad sir robert has been crying for you  my gudesire was like a man in a dreamhe looked for the stranger but he was gane for the time at last he just tried to say ha dougal driveower are ye living i thought ye had been dead  never fash yoursell wi me said dougal but look to yoursell and see ye tak naethlng frae ony body here neither meat drink or siller except just the receipt that is your ain  so saying he led the way out through halls and trances that were weel kend to my gudesire and into the auld oak parlour and there was as much singing of profane sangs and birling of red wine and speaking blasphemy and sculduddry as had ever been in redgauntlet castle when it was at the blithest  but lord take us in keeping what a set of ghastly revellers they were that sat around that table my gudesire kend mony that had long before gane to their place for often had he piped to the most part in the hall of redgauntlet there was the fierce middleton and the dissolute rothes and the crafty lauderdale and dalyell with his bald head and a beard to his girdle and earlshall with camerons blude on his hand and wild bonshaw that tied blessed mr cargills limbs till the blude sprung and dunbarton douglas the twiceturned traitor baith to country and king there was the bluidy advocate mackenyie who for his worldly wit and wisdom had been to the rest as a god and there was claverhouse as beautiful as when he lived with his long dark curled locks streaming down over his laced buffcoat and his left hand always on his right spuleblade to hide the wound that the silver bullet had made see note 2 he sat apart from them all and looked at them with a melancholy haughty countenance while the rest hallooed and sang and laughed that the room rang but their smiles were fearfully contorted from time to time and their laugh passed into such wild sounds as made my gudesires very nails grow blue and chilled the marrow in his banes  they that waited at the table were just the wicked servingmen and troopers that had done their work and cruel bidding on earth there was the lang lad of the nethertown that helped to take argyle and the bishops summoner that they called the deils rattlebag and the wicked guardsmen in their laced coats and the savage highland amorites that shed blood like water and many a proud servingman haughty of heart and bloody of hand cringing to the rich and making them wickeder than they would be grinding the poor to powder when the rich had broken them to fragments and mony mony mair were coming and ganging a as busy in their vocation as if they had been alive  sir robert redgauntlet in the midst of a this fearful riot cried wi a voice like thunder on steenie piper to come to the boardhead where he was sitting his legs stretched out before him and swathed up with flannel with his holster pistols aside him while the great broadsword rested against his chair just as my gudesire had seen him the last time upon earththe very cushion for the jackanape was close to him but the creature itself was not thereit wasna its hour its likely for he heard them say as he came forward is not the major come yet and another answered the jackanape will be here betimes the morn and when my gudesire came forward sir robert or his ghaist or the deevil in his likeness said weel piper hae ye settled wi my son for the years rent  with much ado my father gat breath to say that sir john would not settle without his honours receipt  ye shall hae that for a tune of the pipes steenie said the appearance of sir robertplay us up weel hoddled luckie  now this was a tune my gudesire learned frae a warlock that heard it when they were worshipping satan at their meetings and my gudesire had sometimes played it at the ranting suppers in redgauntlet castle but never very willingly and now he grew cauld at the very name of it and said for excuse he hadna his pipes wi him  maccallum ye limb of beelzebub said the fearfu sir robert bring steenie the pipes that i am keeping for him  maccallum brought a pair of pipes might have served the piper of donald of the isles but he gave my gudesire a nudge as he offered them and looking secretly and closely steenie saw that the chanter was of steel and heated to a white heat so he had fair warning not to trust his fingers with it so he excused himself again and said he was faint and frightened and had not wind aneugh to fill the bag  then ye maun eat and drink steenie said the figure for we do little else here and its ill speaking between a fou man and a fasting  now these were the very words that the bloody earl of douglas said to keep the kings messenger in hand while he cut the head off maclellan of bombie at the threave castle the reader is referred for particulars to pitscotties history of scotland and that put steenie mair and mair on his guard so he spoke up like a man and said he came neither to eat or drink or make minstrelsy but simply for his ainto ken what was come o the money he had paid and to get a discharge for it and he was so stouthearted by this time that he charged sir robert for consciencesake he had no power to say the holy name and as he hoped for peace and rest to spread no snares for him but just to give him his ain  the appearance gnashed its teeth and laughed but it took from a large pocketbook the receipt and handed it to steenie there is your receipt ye pitiful cur and for the money my dogwhelp of a son may go look for it in the cats cradle  my gudesire uttered mony thanks and was about to retire when sir robert roared aloud stop though thou sackdoudling son of a whore i am not done with thee here we do nothing for nothing and you must return on this very day twelvemonth to pay your master the homage that you owe me for my protection  my fathers tongue was loosed of a suddenty and he said aloud i refer mysell to gods pleasure and not to yours  he had no sooner uttered the word than all was dark around him and he sank on the earth with such a sudden shock that he lost both breath and sense  how lang steenie lay there he could not tell but when he came to himsell he was lying in the auld kirkyard of redgauntlet parochine just at the door of the family aisle and the scutcheon of the auld knight sir robert hanging over his head there was a deep morning fog on grass and gravestane around him and his horse was feeding quietly beside the ministers twa cows steenie would have thought the whole was a dream but he had the receipt in his hand fairly written and signed by the auld laird only the last letters of his name were a little disorderly written like one seized with sudden pain  sorely troubled in his mind he left that dreary place rode through the mist to redgauntlet castle and with much ado he got speech of the laird  well you dyvour bankrupt was the first word have you brought me my rent  no answered my gudesire i have not but i have brought your honour sir roberts receipt for it  wow sirrah sir roberts receipt you told me he had not given you one  will your honour please to see if that bit line is right  sir john looked at every line and at every letter with much attention and at last at the date which my gudesire had not observedfrom my appointed place he read this twentyfifth of novemberwhat that is yesterdayvillain thou must have gone to hell for this  i got it from your honours fatherwhether he be in heaven or hell i know not said steenie  i will delate you for a warlock to the privy council said sir john i will send you to your master the devil with the help of a tarbarrel and a torch  i intend to delate mysell to the presbytery said steenie and tell them all i have seen last night whilk are things fitter for them to judge of than a borrel man like me  sir john paused composed himsell and desired to hear the full history and my gudesire told it him from point to point as i have told it youword for word neither more nor less  sir john was silent again for a long time and at last he said very composedly steenie this story of yours concerns the honour of many a noble family besides mine and if it be a leasingmaking to keep yourself out of my danger the least you can expect is to have a redhot iron driven through your tongue and that will be as bad as scauding your fingers wi a redhot chanter but yet it may be true steenie and if the money cast up i shall not know what to think of it but where shall we find the cats cradle there are cats enough about the old house but i think they kitten without the ceremony of bed or cradle  we were best ask hutcheon said my gudesire he kens a the odd corners about as weel asanother servingman that is now gane and that i wad not like to name  aweel hutcheon when he was asked told them that a ruinous turret lang disused next to the clockhouse only accessible by a ladder for the opening was on the outside and far above the battlements was called of old the cats cradle  there will i go immediately said sir john and he took with what purpose heaven kens one of his fathers pistols from the halltable where they had lain since the night he died and hastened to the battlements  it was a dangerous place to climb for the ladder was auld and frail and wanted ane or twa rounds however up got sir john and entered at the turretdoor where his body stopped the only little light that was in the bit turret something flees at him wi a vengeance maist dang him back owerbang gaed the knights pistol and hutcheon that held the ladder and my gudesire that stood beside him hears a loud skelloch a minute after sir john flings the body of the jackanape down to them and cries that the siller is fund and that they should come up and help him and there was the bag of siller sure aneugh and mony orra thing besides that had been missing for mony a day and sir john when he had riped the turret weel led my gudesire into the diningparlour and took him by the hand and spoke kindly to him and said he was sorry he should have doubted his word and that he would hereafter be a good master to him to make amends  and now steenie said sir john although this vision of yours tend on the whole to my fathers credit as an honest man that he should even after his death desire to see justice done to a poor man like you yet you are sensible that illdispositioned men might make bad constructions upon it concerning his souls health so i think we had better lay the haill dirdum on that illdeedie creature major weir and say naething about your dream in the wood of pitmurkie you had taken ower muckle brandy to be very certain about onything and steenie this receipt his hand shook while he held it outits but a queer kind of document and we will do best i think to put it quietly in the fire  od but for as queer as it is its a the voucher i have for my rent said my gudesire who was afraid it may be of losing the benefit of sir roberts discharge  i will bear the contents to your credit in the rentalbook and give you a discharge under my own hand said sir john and that on the spot and steenie if you can hold your tongue about this matter you shall sit from this term downward at an easier rent  mony thanks to your honour said steenie who saw easily in what corner the wind was doubtless i will be comformable to all your honours commands only i would willingly speak wi some powerful minister on the subject for i do not like the sort of sommons of appointment whilk your honours father  do not call the phantom my father said sir john interrupting him  weel then the thing that was so like him said my gudesire he spoke of my coming back to see him this time twelvemonth and its a weight on my conscience  aweel then said sir john if you be so much distressed in mind you may speak to our minister of the parish he is a douce man regards the honour of our family and the mair that he may look for some patronage from me  wi that my father readily agreed that the receipt should be burnt and the laird threw it into the chimney with his ain hand burn it would not for them though but away it flew up the lum wi a lang train of sparks at its tail and a hissing noise like a squib  my gudesire gaed down to the manse and the minister when he had heard the story said it was his real opinion that though my gudesire had gaen very far in tampering with dangerous matters yet as he had refused the devils arles for such was the offer of meat and drink and had refused to do homage by piping at his bidding he hoped that if he held a circumspect walk hereafter satan could take little advantage by what was come and gane and indeed my gudesire of his ain accord lang foreswore baith the pipes and the brandyit was not even till the year was out and the fatal day past that he would so much as take the fiddle or drink usquebaugh or tippeny  sir john made up his story about the jackanape as he liked himsell and some believe till this day there was no more in the matter than the filching nature of the brute indeed yell no hinder some to threap that it was nane o the auld enemy that dougal and my gudesire saw in the lairds room but only that wanchancy creature the major capering on the coffin and that as to the blawing on the lairds whistle that was heard after he was dead the filthy brute could do that as weel as the laird himsell if no better but heaven kens the truth whilk first came out by the ministers wife after sir john and her ain gudeman were baith in the moulds and then my gudesire wha was failed in his limbs but not in his judgement or memoryat least nothing to speak ofwas obliged to tell the real narrative to his friends for the credit of his good name he might else have been charged for a warlock see note 3  the shades of evening were growing thicker around us as my conductor finished his long narrative with this moralye see birkie it is nae chancy thing to tak a stranger traveller for a guide when you are in an uncouth land  i should not have made that inference said i your grandfathers adventure was fortunate for himself whom it saved from ruin and distress and fortunate for his landlord also whom it prevented from committing a gross act of injustice  aye but they had baith to sup the sauce ot sooner or later said wandering williewhat was fristed wasna forgiven sir john died before he was much over threescore and it was just like of a moments illness and for my gudesire though he departed in fullness of life yet there was my father a yauld man of fortyfive fell down betwixt the stilts of his pleugh and rase never again and left nae bairn but me a puir sightless fatherless motherless creature could neither work nor want things gaed weel aneugh at first for sir redwald redgauntlet the only son of sir john and the oye of auld sir robert and waes me the last of the honourable house took the farm aff our hands and brought me into his household to have care of me he liked music and i had the best teachers baith england and scotland could gie me mony a merry year was i wi him but waes me he gaed out with other pretty men in the fortyfiveill say nae mair about itmy head never settled weel since i lost him and if i say another word about it deil a bar will i have the heart to play the nightlook out my gentle chap he resumed in a different tone ye should see the lights at brokenburn glen by this time     letter xii  the same to the same    tam luter was their minstrel meet     gude lord as he could lance   he playd sae shrill and sang sae sweet     till towsie took a trance   auld lightfoot there he did forleet     and counterfeited

length though the subject may seem somewhat deficient in interest let the grace of the narrative therefore and the concern we take in each others matters make amends for its tenuity we fools of fancy who suffer ourselves like malvolio to be cheated with our own visions have nevertheless this advantage over the wise ones of the earth that we have our whole stock of enjoyments under our own command and can dish for ourselves an intellectual banquet with most moderate assistance from external objects it is to be sure something like the feast which the barmecide served up to alnaschar and we cannot expect to get fat upon such diet but then neither is there repletion nor nausea which often succeed the grosser and more material revel on the whole i still pray with the ode to castle building    give me thy hope which sickens not the heart     give me thy wealth which has no wings to fly   give me the bliss thy visions can impart     thy friendship give me warm in poverty  and so despite thy solemn smile and sapient shake of the head i will go on picking such interest as i can out of my trivial adventures even though that interest should be the creation of my own fancy nor will i cease to indict on thy devoted eyes the labour of perusing the scrolls in which i shall record my narrative  my last broke off as we were on the point of descending into the glen at brokenburn by the dangerous track which i had first travelled en croupe behind a furious horseman and was now again to brave under the precarious guidance of a blind man  it was now getting dark but this was no inconvenience to my guide who moved on as formerly with instinctive security of step so that we soon reached the bottom and i could see lights twinkling in the cottage which had been my place of refuge on a former occasion it was not thither however that our course was directed we left the habitation of the laird to the left and turning down the brook soon approached the small hamlet which had been erected at the mouth of the stream probably on account of the convenience which it afforded as a harbour to the fishingboats a large low cottage full in our front seemed highly illuminated for the light not only glanced from every window and aperture in its frail walls but was even visible from rents and fractures in the roof composed of tarred shingles repaired in part by thatch and divot  while these appearances engaged my attention that of my companion was attracted by a regular succession of sounds like a bouncing on the floor mixed with a very faint noise of music which willies acute organs at once recognized and accounted for while to me it was almost inaudible the old man struck the earth with his staff in a violent passion the whoreson fisher rabble they have brought another violer upon my walk they are such smuggling blackguards that they must run in their very music but ill sort them waur than ony gauger in the countrystayharkit s no a fiddle neitherits the pipe and tabor bastard simon of sowport frae the nicol forest but ill pipe and tabor himlet me hae ance my left hand on his cravat and ye shall see what my right will do come away chapcome away gentle chapnae time to be picking and waling your steps and on he passed with long and determined strides dragging me along with him  i was not quite easy in his company for now that his minstrel pride was hurt the man had changed from the quiet decorous i might almost say respectable person which he seemed while he told his tale into the appearance of a fierce brawling dissolute stroller so that when he entered the large hut where a great number of fishers with their wives and daughters were engaged in eating drinking and dancing i was somewhat afraid that the impatient violence of my companion might procure us an indifferent reception  but the universal shout of welcome with which wandering willie was receivedthe hearty congratulationsthe repeated heres t ye williewhere hae ya been ye blind deevil and the call upon him to pledge themabove all the speed with which the obnoxious pipe and tabor were put to silence gave the old man such effectual assurance of undiminished popularity and importance as at once put his jealousy to rest and changed his tone of offended dignity into one better fitted to receive such cordial greetings young men and women crowded round to tell how much they were afraid some mischance had detained him and how two or three young fellows had set out in quest of him  it was nae mischance praised be heaven said willie but the absence of the lazy loon rob the rambler my comrade that didna come to meet me on the links but i hae gotten a braw consort in his stead worth a dozen of him the unhanged blackguard  and wha ist tous gotten wullie lad said half a score of voices while all eyes were turned on your humble servant who kept the best countenance he could though not quite easy at becoming the centre to which all eyes were pointed  i ken him by his hemmed cravat said one fellow its gil hobson the souple tailor frae burgh ye are welcome to scotland ye pricktheclout loon he said thrusting forth a paw much the colour of a badgers back and of most portentous dimensions  gil hobson gil whoreson exclaimed wandering willie its a gentle chap that i judge to be an apprentice wi auld joshua geddes to the quakertrade  what trade bes that man said he of the badgercoloured fist  canting and lyingsaid willie which produced a thundering laugh but i am teaching the callant a better trade and that is feasting and fiddling  willies conduct in thus announcing something like my real character was contrary to compact and yet i was rather glad he did so for the consequence of putting a trick upon these rude and ferocious men might in case of discovery have been dangerous to us both and i was at the same time delivered from the painful effort to support a fictitious character the good company except perhaps one or two of the young women whose looks expressed some desire for better acquaintance gave themselves no further trouble about me but while the seniors resumed their places near an immense bowl or rather reeking cauldron of brandypunch the younger arranged themselves on the floor and called loudly on willie to strike up  with a brief caution to me to mind my credit for fishers have ears though fish have none willie led off in capital style and i followed certainly not so as to disgrace my companion who every now and then gave me a nod of approbation the dances were of course the scottish jigs and reels and twasome dances with a strathspey or hornpipe for interlude and the want of grace on the part of the performers was amply supplied by truth of ear vigour and decision of step and the agility proper to the northern performers my own spirits rose with the mirth around me and with old willies admirable execution and frequent weel dune gentle chap yetand to confess the truth i felt a great deal more pleasure in this rustic revel than i have done at the more formal balls and concerts in your famed city to which i have sometimes made my way perhaps this was because i was a person of more importance to the presiding matron of brokenburnfoot than i had the means of rendering myself to the farfamed miss nickie murray the patroness of your edinburgh assemblies the person i mean was a buxom dame of about thirty her fingers loaded with many a silver ring and three or four of gold her ankles liberally displayed from under her numerous blue white and scarlet short petticoats and attired in hose of the finest and whitest lambswool which arose from shoes of spanish cordwain fastened with silver buckles she took the lead in my favour and declared that the brave young gentleman should not weary himself to death wi playing but take the floor for a dance or twa  and whats to come of me dame martin said willie  come o thee said the dame mishanter on the auld beard o ye ye could play for twenty hours on end and tire out the haill countryside wi dancing before ye laid down your bow saving for a bydrink or the like o that  in troth dame answered willie ye are no sae far wrang sae if my comrade is to take his dance ye maun gie me my drink and then bob it away like madge of middlebie  the drink was soon brought but while willie was partaking of it a party entered the hut which arrested my attention at once and intercepted the intended gallantry with which i had proposed to present my hand to the freshcoloured wellmade whiteankled thetis who had obtained me manumission from my musical task  this was nothing less than the sudden appearance of the old woman whom the laird had termed mabel cristal nixon his male attendant and the young person who had said grace to us when i supped with him  this young personalan thou art in thy way a bit of a conjurerthis young person whom i did not describe and whom you for that very reason suspected was not an indifferent object to meis i am sorry to say it in very fact not so much so as in prudence she ought i will not use the name of love on this occasion for i have applied it too often to transient whims and fancies to escape your satire should i venture to apply it now for it is a phrase i must confess which i have useda romancer would say profaneda little too often considering how few years have passed over my head but seriously the fair chaplain of brokenburn has been often in my head when she had no business there and if this can give thee any clue for explaining my motives in lingering about the country and assuming the character of willies companion why hang thee thou art welcome to make use of ita permission for which thou needst not thank me much as thou wouldst not have failed to assume it whether it were given or no  such being my feelings conceive how they must have been excited when like a beam upon a cloud i saw this uncommonly beautiful girl enter the apartment in which they were dancing not however with the air of an equal but that of a superior come to grace with her presence the festival of her dependants the old man and woman attended with looks as sinister as hers were lovely like two of the worst winter months waiting upon the brighteyed may  when she enteredwonder if thou wiltshe wore a green mantle such as thou hast described as the garb of thy fair client and confirmed what i had partly guessed from thy personal description that my chaplain and thy visitor were the same person there was an alteration on her brow the instant she recognized me she gave her cloak to her female attendant and after a momentary hesitation as if uncertain whether to advance or retire she walked into the room with dignity and composure all making way the men unbonneting and the women curtsying respectfully as she assumed a chair which was reverently placed for her accommodation apart from others  there was then a pause until the bustling mistress of the ceremonies with awkward but kindly courtesy offered the young lady a glass of wine which was at first declined and at length only thus far accepted that bowing round to the festive company the fair visitor wished them all health and mirth and just touching the brim with her lip replaced it on the salver there was another pause and i did not immediately recollect confused as i was by this unexpected apparition that it belonged to me to break it at length a murmur was heard around me being expected to exhibitnay to lead down the dancein consequence of the previous conversation  deils in the fiddler lad was muttered from more quarters than onesaw folk ever sic a thing as a shamefaced fiddler before  at length a venerable triton seconding his remonstrances with a hearty thump on my shoulder cried out to the floorto the floor and let us see how ye can flingthe lasses are a waiting  up i jumped sprang from the elevated station which constituted our orchestra and arranging my ideas as rapidly as i could advanced to the head of the room and instead of offering my hand to the whitefooted thetis aforesaid i venturously made the same proposal to her of the green mantle  the nymphs lovely eyes seemed to open with astonishment at the audacity of this offer and from the murmurs i heard around me i also understood that it surprised and perhaps offended the bystanders but after the first moments emotion she wreathed her neck and drawing herself haughtily up like one who was willing to show that she was sensible of the full extent of her own condescension extended her hand towards me like a princess gracing a squire of low degree  there is affectation in all this thought i to myself if the green mantle has borne true evidencefor young ladies do not make visits or write letters to counsel learned in the law to interfere in the motions of those whom they hold as cheap as this nymph seems to do me and if i am cheated by a resemblance of cloaks still i am interested to show myself in some degree worthy of the favour she has granted with so much state and reserve the dance to be performed was the old scots jig in which you are aware i used to play no sorry figure at la piques when thy clumsy movements used to be rebuked by raps over the knuckles with that great professors fiddlestick the choice of the tune was left to my comrade willie who having finished his drink feloniously struck up the wellknown and popular measure    merrily danced the quakers wife   and merrily danced the quaker  an astounding laugh arose at my expense and i should have been annihilated but that the smile which mantled on the lip of my partner had a different expression from that of ridicule and seemed to say do not take this to heart and i did not alanmy partner danced admirably and i like one who was determined if outshone which i could not help not to be altogether thrown into the shade  i assure you our performance as well as willies music deserved more polished spectators and auditors but we could not then have been greeted with such enthusiastic shouts of applause as attended while i handed my partner to her seat and took my place by her side as one who had a right to offer the attentions usual on such an occasion she was visibly embarrassed but i was determined not to observe her confusion and to avail myself of the opportunity of learning whether this beautiful creatures mind was worthy of the casket in which nature had lodged it  nevertheless however courageously i formed this resolution you cannot but too well guess the difficulties i must needs have felt in carrying it into execution since want of habitual intercourse with the charmers of the other sex has rendered me a sheepish cur only one grain less awkward than thyself then she was so very beautiful and assumed an air of so much dignity that i was like to fall under the fatal error of supposing she should only be addressed with something very clever and in the hasty raking which my brains underwent in this persuasion not a single idea occurred that common sense did not reject as fustian on the one hand or weary flat and stale triticism on the other i felt as if my understanding were no longer my own but was alternately under the dominion of aldeborontiphoscophornio and that of his facetious friend rigdumfunnidos how did i envy at that moment our friend jack oliver who produces with such happy complacence his fardel of small talk and who as he never doubts his own powers of affording amusement passes them current with every pretty woman he approaches and fills up the intervals of chat by his complete acquaintance with the exercise of the fan the flacon and the other duties of the cavaliere servente some of these i attempted but i suppose it was awkwardly at least the lady green mantle received them as a princess accepts the homage of a clown  meantime the floor remained empty and as the mirth of the good meeting was somewhat checked i ventured as a dernier ressort to propose a minuet she thanked me and told me haughtily enough she was here to encourage the harmless pleasures of these good folks but was not disposed to make an exhibition of her own indifferent dancing for their amusement  she paused a moment as if she expected me to suggest something and as i remained silent and rebuked she bowed her head more graciously and said not to affront you however a countrydance if you please  what an ass was i alan not to have anticipated her wishes should i not have observed that the illfavoured couple mabel and cristal had placed themselves on each side of her seat like the supporters of the royal arms the man thick short shaggy and hirsute as the lion the female skindried tightlaced long lean and hungryfaced like the unicorn i ought to have recollected that under the close inspection of two such watchful salvages our communication while in repose could not have been easy that the period of dancing a minuet was not the very choicest time for conversation but that the noise the exercise and the mazy confusion of a countrydance where the inexperienced performers were every now and then running against each other and compelling the other couples to stand still for a minute at a time besides the more regular repose afforded by the intervals of the dance itself gave the best possible openings for a word or two spoken in season and without being liable to observation  we had but just led down when an opportunity of the kind occurred and my partner said with great gentleness and modesty it is not perhaps very proper in me to acknowledge an acquaintance that is not claimed but i believe i speak to mr darsie latimer  darsie latimer was indeed the person that had now the honour and happiness  i would have gone on in the false gallop of compliment but she cut me short and why she said is mr latimer here and in disguise or at least assuming an office unworthy of a man of educationi beg pardon she continuedi would not give you pain but surely making an associate of a person of that description  she looked towards my friend willie and was silent i felt heartily ashamed of myself and hastened to say it was an idle frolic which want of occupation had suggested and which i could not regret since it had procured me the pleasure i at present enjoyed  without seeming to notice my compliment she took the next opportunity to say will mr latimer permit a stranger who wishes him well to ask whether it is right that at his active age he should be in so far void of occupation as to be ready to adopt low society for the sake of idle amusement  you are severe madam i answered but i cannot think myself degraded by mixing with any society where i meet  here i stopped short conscious that i was giving my answer an unhandsome turn the argumentum ad hominem the last to which a polite man has recourse may however be justified by circumstances but seldom or never the argumentum ad foeminam  she filled up the blank herself which i had left where you meet me i suppose you would say but the case is different i am from my unhappy fate obliged to move by the will of others and to be in places which i would by my own will gladly avoid besides i am except for these few minutes no participator of the revelsa spectator only and attended by my servants your situation is differentyou are here by choice the partaker and minister of the pleasures of a class below you in education birth and fortunes if i speak harshly mr latimer she added with much sweetness of manner i mean kindly  i was confounded by her speech severe in youthful wisdom all of naive or lively suitable to such a dialogue vanished from my recollection and i answered with gravity like her own i am indeed better educated than these poor people but you madam whose kind admonition i am grateful for must know more of my condition than i do myselfi dare not say i am their superior in birth since i know nothing of my own or in fortunes over which hangs an impenetrable cloud  and why should your ignorance on these points drive you into low society and idle habits answered my female monitor is it manly to wait till fortune cast her beams upon you when by exertion of your own energy you might distinguish yourself do not the pursuits of learning lie open to youof manly ambitionof war but nonot of war that has already cost you too dear  i will be what you wish me to be i replied with eagernessyou have but to choose my path and you shall see if i do not pursue it with energy were it only because you command me  not because i command you said the maiden but because reason common sense manhood and in one word regard for your own safety give the same counsel  at least permit me to reply that reason and sense never assumed a fairer formof persuasion i hastily added for she turned from menor did she give me another opportunity of continuing what i had to say till the next pause of the dance when determined to bring our dialogue to a point i said you mentioned manhood also and in the same breath personal danger my ideas of manhood suggest that it is cowardice to retreat before dangers of a doubtful character you who appear to know so much of my fortunes that i might call you my guardian angel tell me what these dangers are that i may judge whether manhood calls on me to face or to fly them  she was evidently perplexed by this appeal  you make me pay dearly for acting as your humane adviser she replied at last i acknowledge an interest in your fate and yet i dare not tell you whence it arises neither am i at liberty to say why or from whom you are in danger but it is not less true that danger is near and imminent ask me no more but for your own sake begone from this country elsewhere you are safehere you do but invite your fate  but am i doomed to bid thus farewell to almost the only human being who has showed an interest in my welfare do not say sosay that we shall meet again and the hope shall be the leading star to regulate my course  it is more than probable she saidmuch more than probable that we may never meet again the help which i now render you is all that may be in my power it is such as i should render to a blind man whom i might observe approaching the verge of a precipice it ought to excite no surprise and requires no gratitude  so saying she again turned from me nor did she address me until the dance was on the point of ending when she said do not attempt to speak to or approach me again in the course of the night leave the company as soon as you can but not abruptly and god be with you  i handed her to her seat and did not quit the fair palm i held without expressing my feelings by a gentle pressure she coloured slightly and withdrew her hand but not angrily seeing the eyes of cristal and mabel sternly fixed on me i bowed deeply and withdrew from her my heart saddening and my eyes becoming dim in spite of me as the shifting crowd hid us from each other  it was my intention to have crept back to my comrade willie and resumed my bow with such spirit as i might although at the moment i would have given half my income for an instants solitude but my retreat was cut off by dame martin with the franknessif it is not an inconsistent phraseof rustic coquetry that goes straight up to the point  aye lad ye seem unco sune weary to dance sae lightly better the nag that ambles a the day than him that makes a brattle for a mile and thens dune wi the road  this was a fair challenge and i could not decline accepting it besides i could see dame martin was queen of the revels and so many were the rude and singular figures about me that i was by no means certain whether i might not need some protection i seized on her willing hand and we took our places in the dance where if i did not acquit myself with all the accuracy of step and movement which i had before attempted i at least came up to the expectations of my partner who said and almost swore i was prime at it while stimulated to her utmost exertions she herself frisked like a kid snapped her fingers like castanets whooped like a bacchanal and bounded from the floor like a tennisballaye till the colour of her garters was no particular mystery she made the less secret of this perhaps that they were skyblue and fringed with silver  the time has been that this would have been special fun or rather last night was the only time i can recollect these four years when it would not have been so yet at this moment i cannot tell you how i longed to be rid of dame martin i almost wished she would sprain one of those manytwinkling ankles which served her so alertly and when in the midst of her exuberant caprioling i saw my former partner leaving the apartment and with eyes as i thought turning towards me this unwillingness to carry on the dance increased to such a point that i was almost about to feign a sprain or a dislocation myself in order to put an end to the performance but there were around me scores of old women all of whom looked as if they might have some sovereign recipe for such an accident and remembering gil blas and his pretended disorder in the robbers cavern i thought it as wise to play dame martin fair and dance till she thought proper to dismiss me what i did i resolved to do strenuously and in the latter part of the exhibition i cut and sprang from the floor as high and as perpendicularly as dame martin herself and received i promise you thunders of applause for the common people always prefer exertion and agility to grace at length dame martin could dance no more and rejoicing at my release i led her to a seat and took the privilege of a partner to attend her  hegh sirs exclaimed dame martin i am sair forfoughen troth callant i think ye hae been amaist the death o me  i could only atone for the alleged offence by fetching her some refreshment of which she readily partook  i have been lucky in my partners i said first that pretty young lady and then you mrs martin  hout wi your fleeching said dame martin gae wagae wa lad dinna blaw in folks lugs that gate me and miss lilias evend thegither na na ladod she is maybe four or five years younger than the like o mebye and attour her gentle havings  she is the lairds daughter said i in as careless a tone of inquiry as i could assume  his daughter man na na only his nieceand sib aneugh to him i think  aye indeed i replied i thought she had borne his name  she bears her ain name and thats lilias  and has she no other name asked i  what needs she another till she gets a gudeman answered my thetis a little miffed perhapsto use the womens phrasethat i turned the conversation upon my former partner rather than addressed it to herself  there was a little pause which was interrupted by dame martin observing they are standing up again  true said i having no mind to renew my late violent capriole and i must go help old willie  ere i could extricate myself i heard poor thetis address herself to a sort of merman in a jacket of seamans blue and a pair of trousers whose hand by the way she had rejected at an earlier part of the evening and intimate that she was now disposed to take a trip  trip away then dearie said the vindictive man of the waters without offering his hand there pointing to the floor is a roomy berth for you  certain i had made one enemy and perhaps two i hastened to my original seat beside willie and began to handle my bow but i could see that my conduct had made an unfavourable impression the words flory conceited chaphafflins gentle and at length the still more alarming epithet of spy began to be buzzed about and i was heartily glad when the apparition of sams visage at the door who was already possessed of and draining a can of punch gave me assurance that my means of retreat were at hand i intimated as much to willie who probably had heard more of the murmurs of the company than i had for he whispered aye ayeawa wi yeower lang hereslide out cannydinna let them see ye are on the tramp  i slipped half a guinea into the old mans hand who answered truts pruts nonsense but i se no refuse trusting ye can afford it awa wi yeand if ony body stops ye cry on me  i glided by his advice along the room as if looking for a partner joined sam whom i disengaged with some difficulty from his can and we left the cottage together in a manner to attract the least possible observation the horses were tied in a neighbouring shed and as the moon was up and i was now familiar with the road broken and complicated as it is we soon reached the shepherds bush where the old landlady was sitting up waiting for us under some anxiety of mind to account for which she did not hesitate to tell me that some folks had gone to brokenburn from her house or neighbouring towns that did not come so safe back again wandering willie she said was doubtless a kind of protection  here willies wife who was smoking in the chimney corner took up the praises of her hinnie as she called him and endeavoured to awaken my generosity afresh by describing the dangers from which as she was pleased to allege her husbands countenance had assuredly been the means of preserving me i was not however to be fooled out of more money at this time and went to bed in haste full of vanous cogitations  i have since spent a couple of days betwixt mount sharon and this place and betwixt reading writing to thee this momentous history forming plans for seeing the lovely lilias andpartly i think for the sake of contradictionangling a little in spite of joshuaa scruplesthough i am rather liking the amusement better as i begin to have some success in it  and now my dearest alan you are in full possession of my secretlet me as frankly into the recesses of your bosom how do you feel towards this fair ignis fatuus this lily of the desert tell me honestly for however the recollection of her may haunt my own mind my love for alan fairford surpasses the love of woman i know too that when you do love it will be to    love once and love no more  a deepconsuming passion once kindled in a breast so steady as yours would never be extinguished but with life i am of another and more volatile temper and though i shall open your next with a trembling hand and uncertain heart yet let it bring a frank confession that this fair unknown has made a deeper impression on your gravity than you reckoned for and you will see i can tear the arrow from my own wound barb and all in the meantime though i have formed schemes once more to see her i will you may rely on it take no step for putting them into practice i have refrained from this hitherto and i give you my word of honour i shall continue to do so yet why should you need any further assurance from one who is so entirely yours as dl  psi shall be on thorns till i receive your answer i read and reread your letter and cannot for my soul discover what your real sentiments are sometimes i think you write of her as one in jestand sometimes i think that cannot be put me at ease as soon as possible     letter xiii  alan fairford to darsie latimer  i write on the instant as you direct and in a tragicomic humour for i have a tear in my eye and a smile on my cheek dearest darsie sure never a being but yourself could be so generoussure never a being but yourself could be so absurd i remember when you were a boy you wished to make your fine new whip a present to old aunt peggy merely because she admired it and now with like unreflecting and inappropriate liberality you would resign your beloved to a smokedried young sophister who cares not one of the hairs which it is his occupation to split for all the daughters of eve i in love with your liliasyour green mantleyour unknown enchantresswhy i scarce saw her for five minutes and even then only the tip of her chin was distinctly visible she was well made and the tip of her chin was of a most promising cast for the rest of the face but heaven save you she came upon business and for a lawyer to fall in love with a pretty client on a single consultation would be as wise as if he became enamoured of a particularly bright sunbeam which chanced for a moment to gild his barwig i give you my word i am heartwhole and moreover i assure you that before i suffer a woman to sit near my hearts core i must see her full face without mask or mantle aye and know a good deal of her mind into the bargain so never fret yourself on my account my kind and generous darsie but for your own sake have a care and let not an idle attachment so lightly taken up lead you into serious danger  on this subject i feel so apprehensive that now when i am decorated with the honours of the gown i should have abandoned my career at the very starting to come to you but for my father having contrived to clog my heels with fetters of a professional nature i will tell you the matter at length for it is comical enough and why should not you list to my juridical adventures as well as i to those of your fiddling knighterrantry  it was after dinner and i was considering how i might best introduce to my father the private resolution i had formed to set off for dumfriesshire or whether i had not better run away at once and plead my excuse by letter when assuming the peculiar look with which he communicates any of his intentions respecting me that he suspects may not be altogether acceptable alan he said ye now wear a gownye have opened shop as we would say of a more mechanical profession and doubtless ye think the floor of the courts is strewed with guineas and that ye have only to stoop down to gather them  i hope i am sensible sir i replied that i have some knowledge and practice to acquire and must stoop for that in the first place  it is well said answered my father and always afraid to give too much encouragement added very well said if it be well acted up tostoop to get knowledge and practice is the very word ye know very well alan that in the other faculty who study the ars medendi before the young doctor gets to the bedsides of palaces he must as they call it walk the hospitals and cure lazarus of his sores before he be admitted to prescribe for dives when he has gout or indigestion  i am aware sir that  whishtdo not interrupt the court wellalso the chirurgeons have a useful practice by which they put their apprentices and tyrones to work upon senseless dead bodies to which as they can do no good so they certainly can do as little harm while at the same time the tyro or apprentice gains experience and becomes fit to whip off a leg or arm from a living subject as cleanly as ye would slice an onion  i believe i guess your meaning sir answered i and were it not for a very particular engagement  do not speak to me of engagements but whishtthere is a good ladand do not interrupt the court  my father you know is aptbe it said with all filial dutyto be a little prolix in his harangues i had nothing for it but to lean back and listen  maybe you think alan because i have doubtless the management of some actions in dependence whilk my worthy clients have intrusted me with that i may think of airting them your way instanter and so setting you up in practice so far as my small business or influence may go and doubtless alan that is a day whilk i hope may come round but then before i give as the proverb hath it my own fishguts to my own seamaws i must for the sake of my own character be very sure that my seamaw can pick them to some purpose what say ye  i am so far answered i from wishing to get early into practice sir that i would willingly bestow a few days  in further study ye would say alan but that is not the way eitherye must walk the hospitalsye must cure lazarusye must cut and carve on a departed subject to show your skill  i am sure i replied i will undertake the cause of any poor man with pleasure and bestow as much pains upon it as if it were a dukes but for the next two or three days  they must be devoted to close study alanvery close study indeed for ye must stand primed for a hearing in presentia dominorum upon tuesday next  i sir i replied in astonishmenti have not opened my mouth in the outer house yet  never mind the court of the gentiles man said my father we will have you into the sanctuary at onceover shoes over boots  but sir i should really spoil any cause thrust on me so hastily  ye cannot spoil it alan said my father rubbing his hands with much complacency that is the very cream of the business manit is just as i said before a subject upon whilk all the tyrones have been trying their whittles for fifteen years and as there have been about ten or a dozen agents concerned and each took his own way the case is come to that pass that stair or amiston could not mend it and i do not think even you alan can do it much harmye may get credit by it but ye can lose none  and pray what is the name of my happy client sir said i ungraciously enough i believe  it is a wellknown name in the parliament house replied my father to say the truth i expect him every moment it is peter peebles see note 4  peter peebles exclaimed i in astonishment he is an insane beggaras poor as job and as mad as a march hare  he has been pleaing in the court for fifteen years said my father in a tone of commiseration which seemed to acknowledge that this fact was enough to account for the poor mans condition both in mind and circumstances  besides sir i added he is on the poors roll and you know there are advocates regularly appointed to manage those cases and for me to presume to interfere  whisht alannever interrupt the courtall that is managed for ye like a teed ball my father sometimes draws his similes from his once favourite game of golf you must know alan that peters cause was to have been opened by young dumtoustieye may ken the lad a son of dumtoustie of that ilk member of parliament for the county of and a nephew of the lairds younger brother worthy lord bladderskate whilk ye are aware sounds as like being akin to a peatship formerly a lawyer supposed to be under the peculiar patronage of any particular judge was invidiously termed his peat or pet and a sheriffdom as a sieve is sib to a riddle now peter drudgeit my lords clerk came to me this morning in the house like ane bereft of his wits for it seems that young dumtoustie is ane of the poors lawyers and peter peebless process had been remitted to him of course but so soon as the harebrained goose saw the pokes processbags as indeed alan they are none of the least he took fright called for his nag lap on and away to the country is he gone and so said peter my lord is at his wits end wi vexation and shame to see his nevoy break off the course at the very starting ill tell you peter said i were i my lord and a friend or kinsman of mine should leave the town while the court was sitting that kinsman or be he what he liked should never darken my door again and then alan i thought to turn the ball our own way and i said that you were a gey sharp birkie just off the irons and if it would oblige my lord and so forth you would open peters cause on tuesday and make some handsome apology for the necessary absence of your learned friend and the loss which your client and the court had sustained and so forth peter lap at the proposition like a cock at a grossart for he said the only chance was to get a new hand that did not ken the charge he was taking upon him for there was not a lad of two sessions standing that was not deadsick of peter peebles and his cause and he advised me to break the matter gently to you at the first but i told him you were a good bairn alan and had no will and pleasure in these matters but mine  what could i say darsie in answer to this arrangement so very well meantso very vexatious at the same time to imitate the defection and flight of young dumtoustie was at once to destroy my fathers hopes of me for ever nay such is the keenness with which he regards all connected with his profession it might have been a step to breaking his heart i was obliged therefore to bow in sad acquiescence when my father called to james wilkinson to bring the two bits of pokes he would find on his table  exit james and presently reenters bending under the load of two huge leathern bags full of papers to the brim and labelled on the greasy backs with the magic impress of the clerks of court and the title peebles against plainstanes this huge mass was deposited on the table and my father with no ordinary glee in his countenance began to draw out the various bundles of papers secured by none of your red tape or whipcord but stout substantial casts of tarred rope such as might have held small craft at their moorings  i made a last and desperate effort to get rid of the impending job i am really afraid sir that this case seems so much complicated and there is so little time to prepare that we had better move the court to supersede it till next session  how sirhow alan said my fatherwould you approbate and reprobate sir you have accepted the poor mans cause and if you have not his fee in your pocket it is because he has none to give you and now would you approbate and reprobate in the same breath of your mouth think of your oath of office alan and your duty to your father my dear boy  once more what could i say i saw from my fathers hurried and alarmed manner that nothing could vex him so much as failing in the point he had determined to carry and once more intimated my readiness to do my best under every disadvantage  well well my boy said my father the lord will make your days long in the land for the honour you have given to your fathers grey hairs you may find wiser advisers alan but none that can wish you better  my father you know does not usually give way to expressions of affection and they are interesting in proportion to their rarity my eyes began to fill at seeing his glisten and my delight at having given him such sensible gratification would have been unmixed but for the thoughts of you these out of the question i could have grappled with the bags had they been as large as cornsacks but to turn what was grave into farce the door opened and wilkinson ushered in peter peebles  you must have seen this original darsie who like others in the same predicament continues to haunt the courts of justice where he has made shipwreck of time means and understanding such insane paupers have sometimes seemed to me to resemble wrecks lying upon the shoals on the goodwin sands or in yarmouth roads warning other vessels to keep aloof from the banks on which they have been lost or rather such ruined clients are like scarecrows and potatobogies distributed through the courts to scare away fools from the scene of litigation  the identical peter wears a huge greatcoat threadbare and patched itself yet carefully so disposed and secured by what buttons remain and many supplementary pins as to conceal the still more infirm state of his under garments the shoes and stockings of a ploughman were however seen to meet at his knees with a pair of brownish blackish breeches a rustycoloured handkerchief that has been black in its day surrounded his throat and was an apology for linen his hair half grey half black escaped in elflocks around a huge wig made of tow as it seemed to me and so much shrunk that it stood up on the very top of his head above which he plants when covered an immense cocked hat which like the chieftains banner in an ancient battle may be seen any sederunt day betwixt nine and ten high towering above all the fluctuating and changeful scene in the outer house where his eccentricities often make him the centre of a group of petulant and teasing boys who exercise upon him every art of ingenious torture his countenance originally that of a portly comely burgess is now emaciated with poverty and anxiety and rendered wild by an insane lightness about the eyes a withered and blighted skin and complexion features begrimed with snuff charged with the selfimportance peculiar to insanity and a habit of perpetually speaking to himself such was my unfortunate client and i must allow darsie that my profession had need to do a great deal of good if as is much to be feared it brings many individuals to such a pass  after we had been with a good deal of form presented to each other at which time i easily saw by my fathers manner that he was desirous of supporting peters character in my eyes as much as circumstances would permit alan he said this is the gentleman who has agreed to accept of you as his counsel in place of young dumtoustie  entirely out of favour to my old acquaintance your father said peter with a benign and patronizing countenance out of respect to your father and my old intimacy with lord bladderskate otherwise by the regiam majestatem i would have presented a petition and complaint against daniel dumtoustie advocate by name and surnamei would by all the practiquesi know the forms of process and i am not to be triffled with  my father here interrupted my client and reminded him that there was a good deal of business to do as he proposed to give the young counsel an outline of the state of the conjoined process with a view to letting him into the merits of the cause disencumbered from the points of form i have made a short abbreviate mr peebles said he having sat up late last night and employed much of this morning in wading through these papers to save alan some trouble and i am now about to state the result  i will state it myself said peter breaking in without reverence upon his solicitor  no by no means said my father i am your agent for the time  mine eleventh in number said peter i have a new one every year i wish i could get a new coat as regularly  your agent for the time resumed my father and you who are acquainted with the forms know that the client states the cause to the agentthe agent to the counsel  the counsel to the lord ordinary continued peter once set agoing like the peal of an alarm clock the ordinary to the inner house the president to the bench it is just like the rope to the man the man to the ox the ox to the water the water to the fire  hush for heavens sake mr peebles said my father cutting his recitation short time wears onwe must get to businessyou must not interrupt the court you knowhem hem from this abbreviate it appears  before you begin said peter peebles ill thank you to order me a morsel of bread and cheese or some cauld meat or broth or the like alimentary provision i was so anxious to see your son that i could not eat a mouthful of dinner  heartily glad i believe to have so good a chance of stopping his clients mouth effectually my father ordered some cold meat to which james wilkinson for the honour of the house was about to add the brandy bottle which remained on the sideboard but at a wink from my father supplied its place with small beer peter charged the provisions with the rapacity of a famished lion and so well did the diversion engage him that though while my father stated the case he looked at him repeatedly as if he meant to interrupt his statement yet he always found more agreeable employment for his mouth and returned to the cold beef with an avidity which convinced me he had not had such an opportunity for many a day of satiating his appetite omitting much formal phraseology and many legal details i will endeavour to give you in exchange for your fiddlers tale the history of a litigant or rather the history of his lawsuit  peter peebles and paul plainstanes said my father entered into partnership in the year as mercers and linendrapers in the luckenbooths and carried on a great line of business to mutual advantage but the learned counsel needeth not to be told societas est mater discordiarum partnership oft makes pleaship the company being dissolved by mutual consent in the year the affairs had to be wound up and after certain attempts to settle the matter extrajudicially it was at last brought into the court and has branched out into several distinct processes most of whilk have been conjoined by the ordinary it is to the state of these processes that counsels attention is particularly directed there is the original action of peebles v plainstanes convening him for payment of 3000l less or more as alleged balance due by plainstanes secondly there is a counter action in which plainstanes is pursuer and peebles defender for 2500l less or more being balance alleged per contra to be due by peebles thirdly mr peebles seventh agent advised an action of compt and reckoning at his instance wherein what balance should prove due on either side might be fairly struck and ascertained fourthly to meet the hypothetical case that peebles might be found liable in a balance to plainstanes mr wildgoose mr peebless eighth agent recommended a multiplepoinding to bring all parties concerned into the field  my brain was like to turn at this account of lawsuit within lawsuit like a nest of chipboxes with all of which i was expected to make myself acquainted  i understand i said that mr peebles claims a sum of money from plainstaneshow then can he be his debtor and if not his debtor how can he bring a multiplepoinding the very summons of which sets forth that the pursuer does owe certain monies which he is desirous to pay by warrant of a judge multiplepoinding is i believe equivalent to what is called in england a case of double distress  ye know little of the matter i doubt friend said mr peebles a multiplepoinding is the safest remedium juris in the whole form of process i have known it conjoined with a declarator of marriageyour beef is excellent he said to my father who in vain endeavoured to resume his legal disquisition but something highly powderedand the twopenny is undeniable but it is small swipessmall swipesmore of hop than maltwith your leave ill try your black bottle  my father started to help him with his own hand and in due measure but infinitely to my amusement peter got possession of the bottle by the neck and my fathers ideas of hospitality were far too scrupulous to permit his attempting by any direct means to redeem it so that peter returned to the table triumphant with his prey in his clutch  better have a wineglass mr peebles said my father in an admonitory tone you will find it pretty strong  if the kirk is ower muckle we can sing mass in the quire said peter helping himself in the goblet out of which he had been drinking the small beer what is it usquebaughbrandy as i am an honest man i had almost forgotten the name and taste of brandy mr fairford elder your good health a mouthful of brandy mr alan fairford wishing you well through your arduous undertaking another godown of the comfortable liquor and now though you have given a tolerable breviate of this great lawsuit of whilk everybody has heard something that has walked the boards in the outer house heres to ye again by way of interim decreet yet ye have omitted to speak a word of the arrestments  i was just coming to that point mr peebles  or of the action of suspension of the charge on the bill  i was just coming to that  or the advocation of the sheriffcourt process  i was just coming to it  as tweed comes to melrose i think said the litigant and then filling his goblet about a quarter full of brandy as if in absence of mind oh mr alan fairford ye are a lucky man to buckle to such a cause as mine at the very outset it is like a specimen of all causes man by the regiam there is not a remedium juris in the practiques but yell find a spice ot heres to your getting weel through with itpshuti

loud and animated a style of elocution thumping the table drinking and snuffing alternately that my father abandoning all attempts to interrupt him sat silent and ashamed suffering and anxious for the conclusion of the scene  and then to come back to my pet process of allmy battery and assault process when i had the good luck to provoke him to pull my nose at the very threshold of the court whilk

worthless drunken beast home  when peter peebles was removed from this memorable consultation under the care of an ablebodied celt my father hastily bundled up the papers as a showman whose exhibition has miscarried hastes to remove his booth here are my memoranda alan he said in a hurried way look them carefully overcompare them with the processes and turn it in your head before tuesday many a good speech has been made for a beast of a client and hark ye lad hark yei never intended to cheat you of your fee when all was done though i would have liked to have heard the speech first but there

confused as they are and on tuesday i shall plead as well for peter peebles as i could for a duke indeed i feel my head so clear on the subject as to be able to write this long letter to you into which however peter and his lawsuit have insinuated themselves so far as to show you how much they at present occupy my thoughts once more be careful of yourself and mindful of me who am ever thine while alan fairford  from circumstances to be hereafter mentioned it was long ere this letter reached the person to whom it was addressed                      chapter i  narrative  the advantage of laying before the reader in the words of the actors themselves the adventures which we must otherwise have narrated in our own has given great popularity to the publication of epistolary correspondence as practised by various great authors and by ourselves in the preceding chapters nevertheless a genuine correspondence of this kind and heaven forbid it should be in any respect sophisticated by interpolations of our own can seldom be found to contain all in which it is necessary to instruct the reader for his full comprehension of the story also it must often happen that various prolixities and redundancies occur in the course of an interchange of letters which must hang as a dead weight on the progress of the narrative to avoid this dilemma some biographers have used the letters of the personages concerned or liberal extracts from them to describe particular incidents or express the sentiments which they entertained while they connect them occasionally with such portions of narrative as may serve to carry on the thread of the story  it is thus that the adventurous travellers who explore the summit of mont blanc now move on through the crumbling snowdrift so slowly that their progress is almost imperceptible and anon abridge their journey by springing over the intervening chasms which cross their path with the assistance of their pilgrimstaves or to make a briefer simile the course of storytelling which we have for the present adopted resembles the original discipline of the dragoons who were trained to serve either on foot or horseback as the emergencies of the service required with this explanation we shall proceed to narrate some circumstances which alan fairford did not and could not write to his correspondent  our reader we trust has formed somewhat approaching to a distinct idea of the principal characters who have appeared before him during our narrative but in case our good opinion of his sagacity has been exaggerated and in order to satisfy such as are addicted to the laudable practice of skipping with whom we have at times a strong fellowfeeling the following particulars may not be superfluous  mr saunders fairford as he was usually called was a man of business of the old school moderate in his charges economical and even niggardly in his expenditure strictly honest in conducting his own affairs and those of his clients but taught by long experience to be wary and suspicious in observing the motions of others punctual as the clock of saint giles tolled nine the neat dapper form of the little hale old gentleman was seen at the threshold of the court hall or at farthest at the head of the back stairs trimly dressed in a complete suit of snuffcoloured brown with stockings of silk or woollen as suited the weather a bobwig and a small cocked hat shoes blacked as warren would have blacked them silver shoebuckles and a gold stockbuckle a nosegay in summer and a sprig of holly in winter completed his wellknown dress and appearance his manners corresponded with his attire for they were scrupulously civil and not a little formal he was an elder of the kirk and of course zealous for king george and the government even to slaying as he had showed by taking up arms in their cause but then as he had clients and connexions of business among families of opposite political tenets he was particularly cautious to use all the conventional phrases which the civility of the time had devised as an admissible mode of language betwixt the two parties thus he spoke sometimes of the chevalier but never either of the prince which would have been sacrificing his own principles or of the pretender which would have been offensive to those of others again he usually designated the rebellion as the affair of 1745 and spoke of any one engaged in it as a person who had been out at a certain period oldfashioned scottish civilitysuch were literally the points of politeness observed in general society during the authors youth where it was by no means unusual in a company assembled by chance to find individuals who had borne arms on one side or other in the civil broils of 1745 nothing according to my recollection could be more gentle and decorous than the respect these old enemies paid to each others prejudices but in this i speak generally i have witnessed one or two explosions so that on the whole mr fairford was a man much liked and respected on all sides though his friends would not have been sorry if he had given a dinner more frequently as his little cellar contained some choice old wine of which on such rare occasions he was no niggard  the whole pleasure of this good oldfashioned man of method besides that which he really felt in the discharge of his daily business was the hope to see his son alan the only fruit of a union which death early dissolved attain what in the fathers eyes was the proudest of all distinctionsthe rank and fame of a wellemployed lawyer  every profession has its peculiar honours and mr fairfords mind was constructed upon so limited and exclusive a plan that he valued nothing save the objects of ambition which his own presented he would have shuddered at alans acquiring the renown of a hero and laughed with scorn at the equally barren laurels of literature it was by the path of the law alone that he was desirous to see him rise to eminence and the probabilities of success or disappointment were the thoughts of his father by day and his dream by night  the disposition of alan fairford as well as his talents were such as to encourage his fathers expectations he had acuteness of intellect joined to habits of long and patient study improved no doubt by the discipline of his fathers house to which generally speaking he conformed with the utmost docility expressing no wish for greater or more frequent relaxation than consisted with his fathers anxious and severe restrictions when he did indulge in any juvenile frolics his father had the candour to lay the whole blame upon his more mercurial companion darsie latimer  this youth as the reader must be aware had been received as an inmate into the family of mr fairford senior at a time when some of the delicacy of constitution which had abridged the life of his consort began to show itself in the son and when the father was of course peculiarly disposed to indulge his slightest wish that the young englishman was able to pay a considerable board was a matter of no importance to mr fairford it was enough that his presence seemed to make his son cheerful and happy he was compelled to allow that darsie was a fine lad though unsettled and he would have had some difficulty in getting rid of him and the apprehensions which his levities excited had it not been for the voluntary excursion which gave rise to the preceding correspondence and in which mr fairford secretly rejoiced as affording the means of separating alan from his gay companion at least until he should have assumed and become accustomed to the duties of his dry and laborious profession  but the absence of darsie was far from promoting the end which the elder mr fairford had expected and desired the young men were united by the closest bonds of intimacy and the more so that neither of them sought nor desired to admit any others into their society alan fairford was averse to general company from a disposition naturally reserved and darsie latimer from a painful sense of his own unknown origin peculiarly afflicting in a country where high and low are professed genealogists the young men were all in all to each other it is no wonder therefore that their separation was painful and that its effects upon alan fairford joined to the anxiety occasioned by the tenor of his friends letters greatly exceeded what the senior had anticipated the young man went through his usual duties his studies and the examinations to which he was subjected but with nothing like the zeal and assiduity which he had formerly displayed and his anxious and observant father saw but too plainly that his heart was with his absent comrade  a philosopher would have given way to this tide of feeling in hopes to have diminished its excess and permitted the youths to have been some time together that their intimacy might have been broken off by degrees but mr fairford only saw the more direct mode of continued restraint which however he was desirous of veiling under some plausible pretext in the anxiety which he felt on this occasion he had held communication with an old acquaintance peter drudgeit with whom the reader is partly acquainted alan he said was ance wud and ay waur and he was expecting every moment when he would start off in a wildgoosechase after the callant latimer will sampson the horsehirer in candlemaker row had given him a hint that alan had been looking for a good hack to go to the country for a few days and then to oppose him downrighthe could not but think on the way his poor mother was removed would to heaven he was yoked to some tight piece of business no matter whether well or ill paid but some job that would hamshackle him at least until the courts rose if it were but for decencys sake  peter drudgeit sympathized for peter had a son who reason or none would needs exchange the torn and inky fustian sleeves for the blue jacket and white lapelle and he suggested as the reader knows the engaging our friend alan in the matter of poor peter peebles just opened by the desertion of young dumtoustie whose defection would be at the same time concealed and this drudgeit said would be felling two dogs with one stone  with these explanations the reader will hold a man of the elder fairfords sense and experience free from the hazardous and impatient curiosity with which boys fling a puppy into a deep pond merely to see if the creature can swim however confident in his sons talents which were really considerable he would have been very sorry to have involved him in the duty of pleading a complicated and difficult case upon his very first appearance at the bar had he not resorted to it as an effectual way to prevent the young man from taking a step which his habits of thinking represented as a most fatal one at his outset of life  betwixt two evils mr fairford chose that which was in his own apprehension the least and like a brave officer sending forth his son to battle rather chose he should die upon the breach than desert the conflict with dishonour neither did he leave him to his own unassisted energies like alpheus preceding hercules he himself encountered the augean mass of peter peebles lawmatters it was to the old man a labour of love to place in a clear and undistorted view the real merits of this case which the carelessness and blunders of peters former solicitors had converted into a huge chaotic mass of unintelligible technicality and such was his skill and industry that he was able after the severe toil of two or three days to present to the consideration of the young counsel the principal facts of the case in a light equally simple and comprehensible with the assistance of a solicitor so affectionate and indefatigable alan fairford was enabled then the day of trial arrived to walk towards the court attended by his anxious yet encouraging parent with some degree of confidence that he would lose no reputation upon this arduous occasion  they were met at the door of the court by poor peter peebles in his usual plenitude of wig and celsitude of hat he seized on the young pleader like a lion on his prey how is a wi you mr alanhow is a wi you man the awfu day is come at lasta day that will be lang minded in this house poor peter peebles against plainstanesconjoined proceaseshearing in presencestands for the short roll for this dayi have not been able to sleep for a week for thinking of it and i dare to say neither has the lord president himsellfor such a cause but your father garrd me tak a wee drap ower muckle of his pint bottle the other night its no right to mix brandy wi business mr fairford i would have been the waur o liquor if i would have drank as muckle as you twa would have had me but theres a time for a things and if ye will dine with me after the case is heard or whilk is the same or maybe better ill gang my ways hame wi you and i winna object to a cheerfu glass within the bounds of moderation  old fairford shrugged his shoulders and hurried past the client saw his son wrapped in the sable bombazine which in his eyes was more venerable than an archbishops lawn and could not help fondly patting his shoulder and whispering to him to take courage and show he was worthy to wear it the party entered the outer hall of the court once the place of meeting of the ancient scottish parliament and which corresponds to the use of westminster hall in england serving as a vestibule to the inner house as it is termed and a place of dominion to certain sedentary personages called lords ordinary  the earlier part of the morning was spent by old fairford in reiterating his instructions to alan and in running from one person to another from whom he thought he could still glean some grains of information either concerning the point at issue or collateral cases meantime poor peter peebles whose shallow brain was altogether unable to bear the importance of the moment kept as close to his young counsel as shadow to substance affected now to speak loud now to whisper in his ear now to deck his ghastly countenance with wreathed smiles now to cloud it with a shade of deep and solemn importance and anon to contort it with the sneer of scorn and derision these moods of the clients mind were accompanied with singular mockings and mowings fantastic gestures which the man of rags and litigation deemed appropriate to his changes of countenance now he brandished his arm aloft now thrust his fist straight out as if to knock his opponent down now he laid his open palm on his bosom and now hinging it abroad he gallantly snapped his fingers in the air  these demonstrations and the obvious shame and embarrassment of alan fairford did not escape the observation of the juvenile idlers in the hall they did not indeed approach peter with their usual familiarity from some feeling of deference towards fairford though many accused him of conceit in presuming to undertake at this early stage of his practice a case of considerable difficulty but alan notwithstanding this forbearance was not the less sensible that he and his companion were the subjects of many a passing jest and many a shout of laughter with which that region at all times abounds  at length the young counsels patience gave way and as it threatened to carry his presence of mind and recollection along with it alan frankly told his father that unless he was relieved from the infliction of his clients personal presence and instructions he must necessarily throw up his brief and decline pleading the case  hush hush my dear alan said the old gentleman almost at his own wits end upon hearing this dilemma dinna mind the silly neerdoweel we cannot keep the man from hearing his own cause though he be not quite right in the head  on my life sir answered alan i shall be unable to go on he drives everything out of my remembrance and if i attempt to speak seriously of the injuries he has sustained and the condition he is reduced to how can i expect but that the very appearance of such an absurd scarecrow will turn it all into ridicule  there is something in that said saunders fairford glancing a look at poor peter and then cautiously inserting his forefinger under his bobwig in order to rub his temple and aid his invention he is no figure for the forebar to see without laughing but how to get rid of him to speak sense or anything like it is the last thing he will listen to stay ayealan my darling hae patience ill get him off on the instant like a gowff ba  so saying he hastened to his ally peter drudgeit who on seeing him with marks of haste in his gait and care upon his countenance clapped his pen behind his ear with whats the stir now mr saunders is there aught wrang  heres a dollar man said mr saunders now or never peter do me a good turn yonders your namesake peter peebles will drive the swine through our bonny hanks of yarn get him over to johns coffeehouse mangie him his meridiankeep him there drunk or sober till the hearing is ower the simile is obvious from the old manufacture of scotland when the gudewifes thrift as the yarn wrought in the winter was called when laid down to bleach by the burnside was peculiarly exposed to the inroads of pigs seldom well regulated about a scottish farmhouse  eneugh said quoth peter drudgeit no way displeased with his own share in the service required wese do your bidding  accordingly the scribe was presently seen whispering in the ear of peter peebles whose response came forth in the following broken form  leave the court for ae minute on this great day of judgement not i by the regeh what brandy did ye sayfrench brandycouldna ye fetch a stoup to the bar under your coat man impossible nay if its clean impossible and if we have an hour good till they get through the single bill and the summarroll i carena if i cross the close wi you i am sure i need something to keep my heart up this awful day but ill no stay above an instantnot above a minute of timenor drink aboon a single gill  in a few minutes afterwards the two peters were seen moving through the parliament close which newfangled affectation has termed a square the triumphant drudgeit leading captive the passive peebles whose legs conducted him towards the dramshop while his reverted eyes were fixed upon the court they dived into the cimmerian abysses of johns coffeehouse see note 5 formerly the favourite rendezvous of the classical and genial doctor pitcairn and were for the present seen no more  relieved from his tormentor alan fairford had time to rally his recollections which in the irritation of his spirits had nearly escaped him and to prepare himself far a task the successful discharge or failure in which must he was aware have the deepest influence upon his fortunes he had pride was not without a consciousness of talent and the sense of his fathers feelings upon the subject impelled him to the utmost exertion above all he had that sort of selfcommand which is essential to success in every arduous undertaking and he was constitutionally free from that feverish irritability by which those whose overactive imaginations exaggerate difficulties render themselves incapable of encountering such when they arrive  having collected all the scattered and broken associations which were necessary alans thoughts reverted to dumfriesshire and the precarious situation in which he feared his beloved friend had placed himself and once and again he consulted his watch eager to have his present task commenced and ended that he might hasten to darsies assistance the hour and moment at length arrived the macer shouted with all his wellremembered brazen strength of lungs poor peter peebles versus plainstanes per dumtoustie et toughmaister daaniel dumtoustie dumtoustie answered not the summons which deep and swelling as it was could not reach across the queensferry but our maister alan fairford appeared in his place  the court was very much crowded for much amusement had been received on former occasions when peter had volunteered his own oratory and had been completely successful in routing the gravity of the whole procedure and putting to silence not indeed the counsel of the opposite party but his own  both bench and audience seemed considerably surprised at the juvenile appearance of the young man who appeared in the room of dumtoustie for the purpose of opening this complicated and long depending process and the common herd were disappointed at the absence of peter the client the punchinello of the expected entertainment the judges looked with a very favourable countenance on our friend alan most of them being acquainted more or less with so old a practitioner as his father and all or almost all affording from civility the same fair play to the first pleading of a counsel which the house of commons yields to the maiden speech of one of its members  lord bladderskate was an exception to this general expression of benevolence he scowled upon alan from beneath his large shaggy grey eyebrows just as if the young lawyer had been usurping his nephews honours instead of covering his disgrace and from feelings which did his lordship little honour he privately hoped the young man would not succeed in the cause which his kinsman had abandoned  even lord bladderskate however was in spite of himself pleased with the judicious and modest tone in which alan began his address to the court apologizing for his own presumption and excusing it by the sudden illness of his learned brother for whom the labour of opening a cause of some difficulty and importance had been much more worthily designed he spoke of himself as he really was and of young dumtoustie as what he ought to have been taking care not to dwell on either topic a moment longer than was necessary the old judges looks became benign his family pride was propitiated and pleased equally with the modesty and civility of the young man whom he had thought forward and officious he relaxed the scorn of his features into an expression of profound attention the highest compliment and the greatest encouragement which a judge can render to the counsel addressing him  having succeeded in securing the favourable attention of the court the young lawyer using the lights which his fathers experience and knowledge of business had afforded him proceeded with an address and clearness unexpected from one of his years to remove from the case itself those complicated formalities with which it had been loaded as a surgeon strips from a wound the dressings which had been hastily wrapped round it in order to proceed to his cure secundum artem developed of the cumbrous and complicated technicalities of litigation with which the perverse obstinacy of the client the inconsiderate haste or ignorance of his agents and the evasions of a subtle adversary had invested the process the cause of poor peter peebles standing upon its simple merits was no bad subject for the declamation of a young counsel nor did our friend alan fail to avail himself of its strong points  he exhibited his client as a simplehearted honest wellmeaning man who during a copartnership of twelve years had gradually become impoverished while his partner his former clerk having no funds but his share of the same business into which he had been admitted without any advance of stock had become gradually more and more wealthy  their association said alan and the little flight was received with some applause resembled the ancient story of the fruit which was carved with a knife poisoned on one side of the blade only so that the individual to whom the envenomed portion was served drew decay and death from what afforded savour and sustenance to the consumer of the other moiety he then plunged boldly into the mare magnum of accompts between the parties he pursued each false statement from the wastebook to the daybook from the daybook to the billbook from the billbook to the ledger placed the artful interpolations and insertions of the fallacious plainstanes in array against each other and against the fact and availing himself to the utmost of his fathers previous labours and his own knowledge of accompts in which he had been sedulously trained he laid before the court a clear and intelligible statement of the affairs of the copartnery showing with precision that a large balance must at the dissolution have been due to his client sufficient to have enabled him to have carried on business on his own account and thus to have retained his situation in society as an independent and industrious tradesman but instead of this justice being voluntarily rendered by the former clerk to his former masterby the party obliged to his benefactorby one honest man to anotherhis wretched client had been compelled to follow his quondam clerk his present debtor from court to court had found his just claims met with wellinvented but unfounded counterclaims had seen his party shift his character of pursuer or defender as often as harlequin effects his transformations till in a chase so varied and so long the unhappy litigant had lost substance reputation and almost the use of reason itself and came before their lordships an object of thoughtless derision to the unreflecting of compassion to the betterhearted and of awful meditation to every one who considered that in a country where excellent laws were administered by upright and incorruptible judges a man might pursue an almost indisputable claim through all the mazes of litigation lose fortune reputation and reason itself in the chase and now come before the supreme court of his country in the wretched condition of his unhappy client a victim to protracted justice and to that hope delayed which sickens the heart  the force of this appeal to feeling made as much impression on the bench as had been previously effected by the clearness of alans argument the absurd form of peter himself with his towwig was fortunately not present to excite any ludicrous emotion and the pause that took place when the young lawyer had concluded his speech was followed by a murmur of approbation which the ears of his father drank in as the sweetest sounds that had ever entered them many a hand of gratulation was thrust out to his grasp trembling as it was with anxiety and finally with delight his voice faltering as he replied aye aye i kend alan was the lad to make a spoon or spoil a horn said of an adventurous gipsy who resolves at all risks to convert a sheeps horn into a spoon  the counsel on the other side arose an old practitioner who had noted too closely the impression made by alans pleading not to fear the consequences of an immediate decision he paid the highest compliments to his very young brotherthe benjamin as he would presume to call him of the learned facultysaid the alleged hardships of mr peebles were compensated by his being placed in a situation where the benevolence of their lordships had assigned him gratuitously such assistance as he might not otherwise have obtained at a high priceand allowed his young brother had put many things in such a new point of view that although he was quite certain of his ability to refute them he was honestly desirous of having a few hours to arrange his answer in order to be able to follow mr fairford from point to point he had further to observe there was one point of the case to which his brother whose attention had been otherwise so wonderfully comprehensive had not given the consideration which he expected it was founded on the interpretation of certain correspondence which had passed betwixt the parties soon after the dissolution of the copartnery  the court having heard mr tough readily allowed him two days for preparing himself hinting at the same time that he might find his task difficult and affording the young counsel with high encomiums upon the mode in which he had acquitted himself the choice of speaking either now or at the next calling of the cause upon the point which plainstaness lawyer had adverted to  alan modestly apologized for what in fact had been an omission very pardonable in so complicated a case and professed himself instantly ready to go through that correspondence and prove that it was in form and substance exactly applicable to the view of the case he had submitted to their lordships he applied to his father who sat behind him to hand him from time to time the letters in the order in which he meant to read and comment upon them  old counsellor tough had probably formed an ingenious enough scheme to blunt the effect of the young lawyers reasoning by thus obliging him to follow up a process of reasoning clear and complete in itself by a hasty and extemporary appendix if so he seemed likely to be disappointed for alan was well prepared on this as on other parts of the cause and recommenced his pleading with a degree of animation which added force even to what he had formerly stated and might perhaps have occasioned the old gentleman to regret his having again called him up when his father as he handed him the letters put one into his hand which produced a singular effect on the pleader  at the first glance he saw that the paper had no reference to the affairs of peter peebles but the first glance also showed him what even at that time and in that presence he could not help reading and which being read seemed totally to disconcert his ideas he stopped short in his haranguegazed on the paper with a look of surprise and horroruttered an exclamation and flinging down the brief which he had in his hand hurried out of court without returning a single word of answer to the various questions what was the matterwas he taken unwellshould not a chair be called c c c  the elder mr fairford who remained seated and looking as senseless as if he had been made of stone was at length recalled to himself by the anxious inquiries of the judges and the counsel after his sons health he then rose with an air in which was mingled the deep habitual reverence in which he held the court with some internal cause of agitation and with difficulty mentioned something of a mistakea piece of bad newsalan he hoped would be well enough tomorrow but unable to proceed further he clasped his hands together exclaiming my son my son and left the court hastily as if in pursuit of him  whats the matter with the auld bitch next tradition ascribes this whimsical style of language to the ingenious and philosophical lord kaimes said an acute metaphysical judge though somewhat coarse in his manners aside to his brethren this is a daft cause bladderskatefirst it drives the poor man mad that aught itthen your nevoy goes daft with fright and flies the pitthen this smart young hopeful is aff the hooks with too hard study i fancyand now auld saunders fairford is as lunatic as the best of them what say ye tillt ye bitch  nothing my lord answered bladderskate much too formal to admire the levities in which his philosophical brother sometimes indulgedi say nothing but pray to heaven to keep our own wits  amen amen answered his learned brother for some of us have but few to spare  the court then arose and the audience departed greatly wondering at the talent displayed by alan fairford at his first appearance in a case so difficult and so complicated and assigning a hundred conjectural causes each different from the others for the singular interruption which had clouded his day of success the worst of the whole was that six agents who had each come to the separate resolution of thrusting a retaining fee into alans hand as he left the court shook their heads as they returned the money into their leathern pouches and said that the lad was clever but they would like to see more of him before they engaged him in the way of businessthey did not like his lowping away like a flea in a blanket     chapter ii  had our friend alexander fairford known the consequences of his sons abrupt retreat from the court which are mentioned in the end of the last chapter it might have accomplished the prediction of the lively old judge and driven him utterly distracted as it was he was miserable enough his son had risen ten degrees higher in his estimation than ever by his display of juridical talents which seemed to assure him that the applause of the judges and professors of the law which in his estimation was worth that of all mankind besides authorized to the fullest extent the advantageous estimate which even his parental partiality had been induced to form of alans powers on the other hand he felt that he was himself a little humbled from a disguise which he had practised towards this son of his hopes and wishes  the truth was that on the morning of this eventful day mr alexander fairford had received from his correspondent and friend provost crosbie of dumfries a letter of the following tenor  dear sir your respected favour of 25th ultimo per favour of mr darsie latimer reached me in safety and i showed to the young gentleman such attention as he was pleased to accept of the object of my present writing is twofold first the council are of opinion that you should now begin to stir in the thirlage cause and they think they will be able from evidence noviter repertum to enable you to amend your condescendence upon the use and wont of the burgh touching the grana invecta et illata so you will please consider yourself as authorized to speak to mr pest and lay before him the papers which you will receive by the coach the council think that a fee of two guineas may be sufficient on this occasion as mr pest had three for drawing the original condescendence  i take the opportunity of adding that there has been a great riot among the solway fishermen who have destroyed in a masterful manner the stakenets set up near the mouth of this river and have besides attacked the house of quaker geddes one of the principal partners of the tidenet fishing company and done a great deal of damage am sorry to add young mr latimer was in the fray and has not since been heard of murder is spoke of but that may be a word of course as the young gentleman has behaved rather oddly while in these parts as in declining to dine with me more than once and going about the country with strolling fiddlers and suchlike i rather hope that his present absence is only occasioned by a frolic but as his servant has been making inquiries of me respecting his master i thought it best to acquaint you in course of post i have only to add that our sheriff has taken a precognition and committed one or two of the rioters if i can be useful in this matter either by advertising for mr latimer as missing publishing a reward or otherwise i will obey your respected instructions being your most obedient to command william crosbie  when mr fairford received this letter and had read it to an end his first idea was to communicate it to his son that an express might be instantly dispatched or a kings messenger sent with proper authority to search after his late guest  the habits of the fishers were rude as he well knew though not absolutely sanguinary or ferocious and there had been instances of their transporting persons who had interfered in their smuggling trade to the isle of man and elsewhere and keeping them under restraint for many weeks on this account mr fairford was naturally led to feel anxiety concerning the fate of his late inmate and at a less interesting moment would certainly have set out himself or licensed his son to go in pursuit of his friend  but alas he was both a father and an agent in the one capacity he looked on his son as dearer to him than all the world besides in the other the lawsuit which he conducted was to him like an infant to its nurse and the case of poor peter peebles against plainstanes was he saw adjourned perhaps sine die should this document reach the hands of his son the mutual and enthusiastical affection betwixt the young men was well known to him and he concluded that if the precarious state of latimer were made known to alan fairford it would render him not only unwilling but totally unfit to discharge the duty of the day to which the old gentleman attached such ideas of importance  on mature reflection therefore he resolved though not without some feelings of compunction to delay communicating to his son the disagreeable intelligence which he had received until the business of the day should be ended the delay he persuaded himself could be of little consequence to darsie latimer whose folly he dared to say had led him into some scrape which would meet an appropriate punishment in some accidental restraint which would be thus prolonged for only a few hours longer besides he would have time to speak to the sheriff of the countyperhaps to the kings advocateand set about the matter in a regular manner or as he termed it as summing up the duties of a solicitor to age as accords a scots law phrase of no very determinate import meaning generally to do what is fitting  the scheme as we have seen was partially successful and was only ultimately defeated as he confessed to himself with shame by his own very unbusinesslike mistake of shuffling the provosts letter in the hurry and anxiety of the morning among some papers belonging to peter peebless affairs and then handing it to his son without observing the blunder he used to protest even till the day of his death that he never had been guilty of such an inaccuracy as giving a paper out of his hand without looking at the docketing except on that unhappy occasion when of all others he had such particular reason to regret his negligence  disturbed by these reflections the old gentleman had for the first time in his life some disinclination arising from shame and vexation to face his own son so that to protract for a little the meeting which he feared would be a painful one he went to wait upon the sheriffdepute who he found had set off for dumfries in great haste to superintend in person the investigation which had been set on foot by his substitute this gentlemans clerk could say little on the subject of the riot excepting that it had been serious much damage done to property and some personal violence offered to individuals but as far as he had yet heard no lives lost on the spot  mr fairford was compelled to return home with this intelligence and on inquiring at james wilkinson where his son was received for answer that maister alan was in his own room and very busy  we must have our explanation over said saunders fairford to himself better a finger off as ay wagging and going to the door of his sons apartment he knocked at first gentlythen more loudlybut received no answer somewhat alarmed at this silence he opened the door of the chamber it was emptyclothes lay mixed in confusion with the lawbooks and papers as if the inmate had been engaged in hastily packing for a journey as mr fairford looked around in alarm his eye was arrested by a sealed letter lying upon his sons writingtable and addressed to himself it contained the following words  my dearest father you will not i trust be surprised nor perhaps very much displeased to learn that i am on my way to dumfriesshire to learn by my own personal investigation the present state of my dear friend and afford him such relief as may be in my power and which i trust will be effectual i do not presume to reflect upon you dearest sir for concealing from me information of so much consequence to my peace of mind and happiness but i hope your having done so will be if not an excuse at least some mitigation of my present offence in taking a step of consequence without consulting your pleasure and i must further own under circumstances which perhaps might lead to your disapprobation of my purpose i can only say in further apology that if anything unhappy which heaven forbid shall have occurred to the person who next to yourself is dearest to me in this world i shall have on my heart as a subject of eternal regret that being in a certain degree warned of his danger and furnished with the means of obviating it i did not instantly hasten to his assistance but preferred giving my attention to the business of this unlucky morning no view of personal distinction nothing indeed short of your earnest and often expressed wishes could have detained me in town till this day and having made this sacrifice to filial duty i trust you will hold me excused if i now obey the calls of friendship and humanity do not be in the least anxious on my account i shall know i trust how to conduct myself with due caution in any emergence which may occur otherwise my legal studies for so many years have been to little purpose i am fully provided with money and also with arms in case of need but you may rely on my prudence in avoiding all occasions of using the latter short of the last necessity god almighty bless you my dearest father and grant that you may forgive the first and i trust the last act approaching towards premeditated disobedience of which i either have now or shall hereafter have to accuse myself i remain till death your dutiful and affectionate son alan fairford  psi shall write with the utmost regularity acquainting you with my motions and requesting your advice i trust my stay will be very short and i think it possible that i may bring back darsie along with me  the paper dropped from the old mans hand when he was thus assured of the misfortune which he apprehended his first idea was to get a postchaise and pursue the fugitive but he recollected that upon the very rare occasions when alan had shown himself indocile to the patria potestas his natural ease and gentleness of disposition seemed hardened into obstinacy and that now entitled as arrived at the years of majority and a member of the learned faculty to direct his own motions there was great doubt whether in the event of his overtaking his son he might be able to prevail upon him to return back in such a risk of failure he thought it wiser to desist from his purpose especially as even his success in such a pursuit would give a ridiculous eclat to the whole affair which could not be otherwise than prejudicial to his sons rising character  bitter however were saunders fairfords reflections as again picking up the fatal scroll he threw himself into his sons leathern easychair and bestowed upon it a disjointed commentary bring back darsie little doubt of thatthe bad shilling is sure enough to come back again i wish darsie no worse ill than that he were carried where the silly fool alan should never see him again it was an ill hour that he darkened my doors in for ever since that alan has given up his ain oldfashioned motherwit for the tothers capernoited maggots and nonsense provided with money you must have more than i know of then my friend for i trow i kept you pretty short for your own good can he have gotten more fees or does he think five guineas has neither beginning nor end arms what would he do with arms or what would any man do with them that is not a regular soldier under government or else a thieftaker i have had enough of arms i trow although i carried them for king george and the government but this is a worse strait than falkirk field yet god guide us we are poor inconsistent creatures to think the lad should have made so able an appearance and then bolted off this gate after a glaiket neerdoweel like a hound upon a false scent lasaday its a sore thing to see a stunkard cow kick down the pail when its reaming fou but after all its an ill bird that defiles its ain nest i must cover up the scandal as well as i can whats the matter now james  a message sir said james wilkinson from my lord president and he hopes mr alan is not seriously indisposed  from the lord president the lord preserve usill send an answer this instant bid the lad sit down and ask him to drink james let me see continued he taking a sheet of gilt paper how we are to draw our answers  ere his pen had touched the paper james was in the room again  what now james  lord bladderskates lad is come to ask how mr alan is as he left the court  aye aye aye answered saunders bitterly he has een made a moonlight flitting like my lords ain nevoy  shall i say sae sir said james who as an old soldier was literal in all things touching the service  the devil no nobid the lad sit down and taste our ale i will write his lordship an answer  once more the gilt paper was resumed and once more the door was opened by james  lord  sends his servitor to ask after mr alan  oh the deevil take their civility said poor saunders set him down to drink tooi will write to his lordship  the lads will bide your pleasure sir as lang as i keep the bicker fou but this ringing is like to wear out the bell i think there are they at it again  he answered the fresh summons accordingly and came back to inform mr fairford that the dean of faculty was below inquiring for mr alan will i set him down to drink too said james  will you be an idiot sir said mr fairford show mr dean into the parlour  in going slowly downstairs step by step the perplexed man of business had time enough to reflect that if it be possible to put a fair gloss upon a true story the verity always serves the purpose better than any substitute which ingenuity can devise he therefore told his learned visitor that although his son had been incommoded by the heat of the court and the long train of hard study by day and night preceding his exertions yet he had fortunately so far recovered as to be in condition to obey upon the instant a sudden summons which had called him to the country on a matter of life and death  it should be a serious matter indeed that takes my young friend away at this moment said the goodnatured dean i wish he had stayed to finish his pleading and put down old tough without compliment mr fairford it was as fine a first appearance as i ever heard i should be sorry your son did not follow it up in a reply nothing like striking while the iron is hot  mr saunders fairford made a bitter grimace as he acquiesced in an opinion which was indeed decidedly his own but he thought it most prudent to reply that the affair which rendered his son alans presence in the country absolutely necessary regarded the affairs of a young gentleman of great fortune who was a particular friend of alans and who never took any material step in his affairs without consulting his counsel learned in the law  well well mr fairford you know best answered the learned dean if there be death or marriage in the case a will or a wedding is to be preferred to all other business i am happy mr alan is so much recovered as to be able for travel and wish you a very good morning  having thus taken his ground to the dean of faculty mr fairford hastily wrote cards in answer to the inquiry of the three judges accounting for alans absence in the same manner these being properly sealed and addressed he delivered to james with directions to dismiss the particoloured gentry who in the meanwhile had consumed a gallon of twopenny ale while discussing points of law and addressing each other by their masters titles the scottish judges are distinguished by the title of lord prefixed to their own temporal designation as the ladies of these official dignitaries do not bear any share in their husbands honours they are distinguished only by their lords family name they were not always contented with this species of salique law which certainly is somewhat inconsistent but their pretensions to title are said to have been long since repelled by james v the sovereign who founded the college of justice i said he made the caries lords but who the devil made the carlines ladies  the exertion which these matters demanded and the interest which so many persons of legal distinction appeared to have taken in his son greatly relieved the oppressed spirit of saunders fairford who continued to talk mysteriously of the very important business which had interfered with his sons attendance during the brief remainder of the session he endeavoured to lay the same unction to his own heart but here the application was less fortunate for his conscience told him that no end however important which could be achieved in darsie latimers affairs could be balanced against the reputation which alan was like to forfeit by deserting the cause of poor peter peebles  in the meanwhile although the haze which surrounded the cause or causes of that unfortunate litigant had been for a time dispelled by alans eloquence like a fog by the thunder of artillery yet it seemed once more to settle down upon the mass of litigation thick as the palpable darkness of egypt at the very sound of mr toughs voice who on the second day after alans departure was heard in answer to the opening counsel deepmouthed longbreathed and pertinacious taking a pinch of snuff betwixt every sentence which otherwise seemed interminablethe veteran pleader prosed over all the themes which had been treated so luminously by fairford he quietly and imperceptibly replaced all the rubbish which the other had cleared away and succeeded in restoring the veil of obscurity and unintelligibility which had for many years darkened the case of peebles against plainstanes and the matter was once more hung up by a remit to an accountant with instruction to report before answer so different a result from that which the public had been led to expect from alans speech gave rise to various speculations  the client himself opined that it was entirely owing first to his own absence during the first days pleading being as he said deboshed with brandy usquebaugh and other strong waters at johns coffeehouse per ambages of peter drudgeit employed to that effect by and through the device counsel and covyne of saunders fairford his agent or pretended agent secondly by the flight and voluntary desertion of the younger fairford the advocate on account of which he served both father and son with a petition and complaint against them for malversation in office so that the apparent and most probable issue of this cause seemed to menace the melancholy mr saunders fairford with additional subject for plague and mortification which was the more galling as his conscience told him that the case was really given away and that a very brief resumption of the former argument with reference to the necessary authorities and points of evidence would have enabled alan by the mere breath as it were of his mouth to blow away the various cobwebs with which mr tough had again invested the proceedings but it went he said just like a decreet in absence and was lost for want of a contradictor  in the meanwhile nearly a week passed over without mr fairford hearing a word directly from his son he learned indeed by a letter from mr crosbie that the young counsellor had safely reached dumfries but had left that town upon some ulterior researches the purpose of which he had not communicated the old man thus left to suspense and to mortifying recollections deprived also of the domestic society to which he had been habituated began to suffer in body as well as in mind he had formed the determination of setting out in person for dumfriesshire when after having been dogged peevish and snappish to his clerks and domestics to an unusual and almost intolerable degree the acrimonious humours settled in a hissinghot fit of the gout which is a wellknown tamer of the most froward spirits and under whose discipline we shall for the present leave him as the continuation of this history assumes with the next division a form somewhat different from direct narrative and epistolary correspondence though partaking of the character of both     chapter iii  journal of darsie latimer the following address is written on the inside of the envelope which contained the journal  into what hands soever these leaves may fall they will instruct him during a certain time at least in the history of the life of an unfortunate young man who in the heart of a free country and without any crime being laid to his charge has been and is subjected to a course of unlawful and violent restraint he who opens this letter is therefore conjured to apply to the nearest magistrate and following such indications as the papers may afford to exert himself for the relief of one who while he possesses every claim to assistance which oppressed innocence can give has at the same time both the inclination and the means of being grateful to his deliverers or if the person obtaining these letters shall want courage or means to effect the writers release he is in that case conjured by every duty of a man to his fellow mortals and of a christian towards one who professes the same holy faith to take the speediest measures for conveying them with speed and safety to the hands of alan fairford esq advocate residing in the family of his father alexander fairford esq writer to the signet browns square edinburgh he may be assured of a liberal reward besides the consciousness of having discharged a real duty to humanity  my dearest alan feeling as warmly towards you in doubt and in distress as i ever did in the brightest days of our intimacy it is to you whom i address a history which may perhaps fall into very different hands a portion of my former spirit descends to my pen when i write your name and indulging the happy thought that you may be my deliverer from my present uncomfortable and alarming situation as you have been my guide and counsellor on every former occasion i will subdue the dejection which would otherwise overwhelm me therefore as heaven knows i have time enough to write i will endeavour to pour my thoughts out as fully and freely as of old though probably without the same gay and happy levity  if the papers should reach other hands than yours still i will not regret this exposure of my feelings for allowing for an ample share of the folly incidental to youth and inexperience i fear not that i have much to be ashamed of in my narrative nay i even hope that the open simplicity and frankness with which i am about to relate every singular and distressing circumstance may prepossess even a stranger in my favour and that amid the multitude of seemingly trivial circumstances which i detail at length a clue may be found to effect my liberation  another chance certainly remainsthe journal as i may call it may never reach the hands either of the dear friend to whom it is addressed or those of an indifferent stranger but may become the prey of the persons by whom i am at present treated as a prisoner let it be sothey will learn from it little but what they already know that as a man and an englishman my soul revolts at the usage which i have received that i am determined to essay every possible means to obtain my freedom that captivity has not broken my spirit and that although they may doubtless complete their oppression by murder i am still willing to bequeath my cause to the justice of my country undeterred therefore by the probability that my papers may be torn from me and subjected to the inspection of one in particular who causelessly my enemy already may be yet further incensed at me for recording the history of my wrongs i proceed to resume the history of events which have befallen me since the conclusion of my last letter to my dear alan fairford dated if i mistake not on the 5th day of this still current month of august  upon the night preceding the date of that letter i had been present for the purpose of an idle frolic at a dancing party at the village of brokenburn about six miles from dumfries many persons must have seen me there should the fact appear of importance sufficient to require investigation i danced played on the violin and took part in the festivity till about midnight when my servant samuel owen brought me my horses and i rode back to a small inn called shepherds bush kept by mrs gregson which had been occasionally my residence for about a fortnight past i spent the earlier part of the forenoon in writing a letter which i have already mentioned to you my dear alan and which i think you must have received in safety why did i not follow your advice so often given me why did i linger in the neighbourhood of a danger of which a kind voice had warned me these are now unavailing questions i was blinded by a fatality and remained fluttering like a moth around the candle until i have been scorched to some purpose  the greater part of the day had passed and time hung heavy on my hands i ought perhaps to blush at recollecting what has been often objected to me by the dear friend to whom this letter is addressed viz the facility with which i have in moments of indolence suffered my motions to be directed by any person who chanced to be near me instead of taking the labour of thinking or deciding for myself i had employed for some time as a sort of guide and errandboy a lad named benjamin the son of one widow coltherd who lives near the shepherds bush and i cannot but remember that upon several occasions i had of late suffered him to possess more influence over my motions than at all became the difference of our age and condition at present he exerted himself to persuade me that it was the finest possible sport to see the fish taken out from the nets placed in the solway at the reflux of the tide and urged my going thither this evening so much that looking back on the whole circumstances i cannot but think he had some especial motive for his conduct these particulars i have mentioned that if these papers fall into friendly hands the boy may be sought after and submitted to examination  his eloquence being unable to persuade me that i should take any pleasure in seeing the fruitless struggles of the fish when left in the nets and deserted by the tide he artfully suggested that mr and miss geddes a respectable quaker family well known in the neighbourhood and with whom i had contracted habits of intimacy would possibly be offended if i did not make them an early visit both he said had been particularly inquiring the reasons of my leaving their house rather suddenly on the previous day i resolved therefore to walk up to mount sharon and make my apologies and i agreed to permit the boy to attend upon me and wait my return from the house that i might fish on my way homeward to shepherds bush for which amusement he assured me i would find the evening most favourable i mention this minute circumstance because i strongly suspect that this boy had a presentiment how the evening was to terminate with me and entertained the selfish though childish wish of securing to himself an anglingrod which he had often admired as a part of my spoils i may do the boy wrong but i had before remarked in him the peculiar art of pursuing the trifling objects of cupidity proper to his age with the systematic address of much riper years  when we had commenced our walk i upbraided him with the coolness of the evening considering the season the easterly wind and other circumstances unfavourable for angling he persisted in his own story and made a few casts as if to convince me of my error but caught no fish and indeed as i am now convinced was much more intent on watching my motions than on taking any when i ridiculed him once more on his fruitless endeavours he answered with a sneering smile that the trouts would not rise because there was thunder in the air an intimation which in one sense i have found too true  i arrived at mount sharon was received by my friends there with their wonted kindness and after being a little rallied on my having suddenly left them on the preceding evening i agreed to make atonement by staying all night and dismissed the lad who attended with my fishingrod to carry that information to shepherds bush it may be doubted whether he went thither or in a different direction  betwixt eight and nine oclock when it began to become dark we walked on the terrace to enjoy the appearance of the firmament glittering with ten million stars to which a slight touch of early frost gave tenfold lustre as we gazed on this splendid scene miss geddes i think was the first to point out to our admiration a shooting or falling star which she said drew a long train after it looking to the part of the heavens which she pointed out i distinctly observed two successive skyrockets arise and burst in the sky  these meteors said mr geddes in answer to his sisters observation are not formed in heaven nor do they bode any good to the dwellers upon earth  as he spoke i looked to another quarter of the sky and a rocket as if a signal in answer to those which had already appeared rose high from the earth and burst apparently among the stars  mr geddes seemed very thoughtful for some minutes and then said to his sister rachel though it waxes late i must go down to the fishing station and pass the night in the overseers room there  nay then replied the lady i am but too well assured that the sons of belial are menacing these nets and devices joshua art thou a man of peace and wilt thou willingly and wittingly thrust thyself where thou mayst be tempted by the old man adam within thee to enter into debate and strife  i am a man of peace rachel answered mr geddes even to the utmost extent which our friends can demand of humanity and neither have i ever used nor with the help of god will i at any future time employ the arm of flesh to repel or to revenge injuries but if i can by mild reasons and firm conduct save those rude men from committing a crime and the property belonging to myself and others from sustaining damage surely i do but the duty of a man and a christian  with these words he ordered his horse instantly and his sister ceasing to argue with him folded her arms upon her bosom and looked up to heaven with a resigned and yet sorrowful countenance  these particulars may appear trivial but it is better in my present condition to exert my faculties in recollecting the past and in recording it than waste them in vain and anxious anticipations of the future  it would have been scarcely proper in me to remain in the house from which the master was thus suddenly summoned away and i therefore begged permission to attend him to the fishing station assuring his sister that i would be a guarantee for his safety  that proposal seemed to give much pleasure to miss geddes let it be so brother she said and let the young man have the desire of his heart that there may be a faithful witness to stand by thee in the hour of need and to report how it shall fare with thee  nay rachel said the worthy man thou art to blame in this that to quiet thy apprehensions on my account thou shouldst thrust into dangerif danger it shall prove to bethis youth our guest for whom doubtless in case of mishap as many hearts will ache as may be afflicted on our account  no my good friend said i taking mr geddess hand i am not so happy as you suppose me were my span to be concluded this evening few would so much as know that such a being had existed for twenty years on the face of the earth and of these few only one would sincerely regret me do not therefore refuse me the privilege attending you and of showing by so trifling an act of kindness that if i have few friends i am at least desirous to serve them  thou hast a kind heart i warrant thee said joshua geddes returning the pressure of my hand rachel the young man shall go with me why should he not face danger in order to do justice and preserve peace there is that within me he added looking upwards and with a passing enthusiasm which i had not before observed and the absence of which perhaps rather belonged to the sect than to his own personal characteri say i have that within which assures me that though the ungodly may rage even like the storm of the ocean they shall not have freedom to prevail against us  having spoken thus mr geddes appointed a pony to be saddled for my use and having taken a basket with some provisions and a servant to carry back the horses for which there was no accommodation at the fishing station we set off about nine oclock at night and after threequarters of an hours riding arrived at our place of destination  the station consists or then consisted of huts for four or five fishermen a cooperage and shed and a better sort of cottage at which the superintendent resided we gave our horses to the servant to be carried back to mount sharon my companion expressing himself humanely anxious for their safetyand knocked at the door of the house at first we only heard a barking of dogs but these animals became quiet on snuffing beneath the door and acknowledging the presence of friends a hoarse voice then demanded in rather unfriendly accents who we were and what we wanted and it was not until joshua named himself and called upon his superintendent to open that the latter appeared at the door of the hut attended by three large dogs of the newfoundland breed he had a flambeau in his hand and two large heavy shippistols stuck into his belt he was a stout elderly man who had been a sailor as i learned during the earlier part of his life and was now much confided in by the fishing company whose concerns he directed under the orders of mr geddes  thou didst not expect me tonight friend davies said my friend to the old man who was arranging seats for us by the fire  no master geddes answered he i did not expect you nor to speak the truth did i wish for you either  these are plain terms john davies answered mr geddes  aye aye sir i know your worship loves no holiday speeches  thou dost guess i suppose what brings us here so late john davies said mr geddes  i do suppose sir answered the superintendent that it was because those dd smuggling wreckers on the coast are showing their lights to gather their forces as they did the night before they broke down the damdyke and weirs up the country but if that same be the case i wish once more you had stayed away for your worship carries no fighting tackle aboard i think and there will be work for such ere morning your worship  worship is due to heaven only john davies said geddes i have often desired thee to desist from using that phrase to me  i wont then said john no offence meant but how the devil can a man stand picking his words when he is just going to come to blows  i hope not john davies said joshua geddes call in the rest of the men that i may give them their instructions  i may cry till doomsday master geddes ere a soul answersthe cowardly lubbers have all made sailthe cooper and all the rest of them so soon as they heard the enemy were at sea they have all taken to the longboat and left the ship among the breakers except little phil and myselfthey have by  swear not at all john daviesthou art an honest man and i believe without an oath that thy comrades love their own bones better than my goods and chattels and so thou hast no assistance but little phil against a hundred men or two  why there are the dogs your honour knows neptune and thetisand the puppy may do something and then though your worshipi beg pardonthough your honour be no great fighter this young gentleman may bear a hand  aye and i see you are provided with arms said mr geddes let me see them  aye aye sir here be a pair of buffers will bite as well as barkthese will make sure of two rogues at least it would be a shame to strike without firing a shot take care your honour they are doubleshotted  aye john davies i will take care of them throwing the pistols into a tub of water beside him and i wish i could render the whole generation of them useless at the same moment  a deep shade of displeasure passed over john daviess weatherbeaten countenance belike your honour is going to take the command yourself then he said after a pause why i can be of little use now and since your worship or your honour or whatever you are means to strike quietly i believe you will do it better without me than with me for i am like enough to make mischief i admit but ill never leave my post without orders  then you have mine john davies to go to mount sharon directly and take the boy phil with you where is he  he is on the outlook for these scums of the earth answered davies but it is to no purpose to know when they come if we are not to stand to our weapons  we will use none but those of sense and reason john  and you may just as well cast chaff against the wind as speak sense and reason to the like of them  well well be it so said joshua and now john davies i know thou art what the world calls a brave fellow and i have ever found thee an honest one and now i command you to go to mount sharon and let phil lie on the banksidesee the poor boy hath a seacloak thoughand watch what happens there and let him bring you the news and if any violence shall be offered to the property there i trust to your fidelity to carry my sister to dumfries to the house of our friends the corsacks and inform the civil authorities of what mischief hath befallen  the old seaman paused a moment it is hard lines for me he said to leave your honour in tribulation and yet staying here i am only like to make bad worse and your honours sister miss rachel must be looked to thats certain for if the rogues once get their hand to mischief they will come to mount sharon after they have wasted and destroyed this here snug little roadstead where i thought to ride at anchor for life  right right john davies said joshua geddes and best call the dogs with you  aye aye sir said the veteran for they are something of my mind and would not keep quiet if they saw mischief doing so maybe they might come to mischief poor dumb creatures so god bless your honouri mean your worshipi cannot bring my mouth to say fare you well here neptune thetis come dogs come  so saying and with a very crestfallen countenance john davies left the hut  now there goes one of the best and most faithful creatures that ever was born said mr geddes as the superintendent shut the door of the cottage nature made him with a heart that would not have suffered him to harm a fly but thou seest friend latimer that as men arm their bulldogs with spiked collars and their gamecocks with steel spurs to aid them in fight so they corrupt by education the best and mildest natures until fortitude and spirit become stubbornness and ferocity believe me friend latimer i would as soon expose my faithful household dog to a vain combat with a herd of wolves as yon trusty creature to the violence of the enraged multitude but i need say little on this subject to thee friend latimer who i doubt not art trained to believe that courage is displayed and honour attained not by doing and suffering as becomes a man that which fate calls us to suffer and justice commands us to do but because thou art ready to retort violence for violence and considerest the lightest insult as a sufficient cause for the spilling of blood nay the taking of life but leaving these points of controversy to a more fit season let us see what our basket of provision contains for in truth friend latimer i am one of those whom neither fear nor anxiety deprives of their ordinary appetite  we found the means of good cheer accordingly which mr geddes seemed to enjoy as much as if it had been eaten in a situation of perfect safety nay his conversation appeared to be rather more gay than on ordinary occasions after eating our supper we left the hut together and walked for a few minutes on the banks of the sea it was high water and the ebb had not yet commenced the moon shone broad and bright upon the placid face of the solway firth and showed a slight ripple upon the stakes the tops of which were just visible above the waves and on the darkcoloured buoys which marked the upper edge of the enclosure of nets at a much greater distancefor the estuary is here very widethe line of the english coast was seen on the verge of the water resembling one of those fogbanks on which mariners are said to gaze uncertain whether it be land or atmospherical delusion  we shall be undisturbed for some hours said mr geddes they will not come down upon us till the state of the tide permits them to destroy the tidenets is it not strange to think that human passions will so soon transform such a tranquil scene as this into one of devastation and confusion  it was indeed a scene of exquisite stillness so much so that the restless waves of the solway seemed if not absolutely to sleep at least to slumber on the shore no nightbird was heardthe cock had not sung his first matins and we ourselves walked more lightly than by day as if to suit the sounds of our own paces to the serene tranquillity around us at length the plaintive cry of a dog broke the silence and on our return to the cottage we found that the younger of the three animals which had gone along with john davies unaccustomed perhaps to distant journeys and the duty of following to heel had strayed from the party and unable to rejoin them had wandered back to the place of its birth  another feeble addition to our feeble garrison said mr geddes as he caressed the dog and admitted it into the cottage poor thing as thou art incapable of doing any mischief i hope thou wilt sustain none at least thou mayst do us the good service of a sentinel and permit us to enjoy a quiet repose under the certainty that thou wilt alarm us when the enemy is at hand  there were two beds in the superintendents room upon which we threw ourselves mr geddes with his happy equanimity of temper was asleep in the first five minutes i lay for some time in doubtful and anxious thoughts watching the fire and the motions of the restless dog which disturbed probably at the absence of john davies wandered from the hearth to the door and back again then came to the bedside and licked my hands and face and at length experiencing no repulse to its advances established itself at my feet and went to sleep an example which i soon afterwards followed  the rage of narration my dear alanfor i will never relinquish the hope that what i am writing may one day reach your handshas not forsaken me even in my confinement and the extensive though unimportant details into which i have been hurried renders it necessary that i commence another sheet fortunately my pygmy characters comprehend a great many words within a small space of paper     chapter iv  darsie latimers journal in continuation  the morning was dawning and mr geddes and i myself were still sleeping soundly when the alarm was given by my canine bedfellow who first growled deeply at intervals and at length bore more decided testimony to the approach of some enemy i opened the door of the cottage and perceived at the distance of about two hundred yards a small but close column of men which i would have taken for a dark hedge but that i could perceive it was advancing rapidly and in silence  the dog flew towards them but instantly ran howling back to me having probably been chastised by a stick or a stone uncertain as to the plan of tactics or of treaty which mr geddes might think proper to adopt i was about to retire into the cottage when he suddenly joined me at the door and slipping his arm through mine said let us go to meet them manfully we have done nothing to be ashamed offriends he said raising his voice as we approached them who and what are you and with what purpose are you here on my property  a loud cheer was the answer returned and a brace of fiddlers who occupied the front of the march immediately struck up the insulting air the words of which begin    merrily danced the quakers wife   and merrily danced the quaker  even at that moment of alarm i think i recognized the tones of the blind fiddler will known by the name of wandering willie from his itinerant habits they continued to advance swiftly and in great order in their front    the fiery fiddlers playing martial airs  when coming close up they surrounded us by a single movement and there was a universal cry whoop quakerwhoop quaker here have we them both the wet quaker and the dry one  hang up the wet quaker to dry and wet the dry one with a ducking answered another voice  where is the seaotter john davies that destroyed more fish than any sealch upon ailsa craig exclaimed a third voice i have an old crow to pluck with him and a pock to put the feathers in  we stood perfectly passive for to have attempted resistance against more than a hundred men armed with guns fishspears ironcrows spades and bludgeons would have been an act of utter insanity mr geddes with his strong sonorous voice answered the question about the superintendent in a manner the manly indifference of which compelled them to attend to him  john davies he said will i trust soon be at dumfries  to fetch down redcoats and dragoons against us you canting old villain  a blow was at the same time levelled at my friend which i parried by interposing the stick i had in my hand i was instantly struck down and have a faint recollection of hearing some crying kill the young spy and others as i thought interposing on my behalf but a second blow on the head received in the scuffle soon deprived me of sense and consciousness and threw me into it state of insensibility from which i did not recover immediately when i did come to myself i was lying on the bed from which i had just risen before the fray and my poor companion the newfoundland puppy its courage entirely cowed by the tumult of the riot had crept as close to me as it could and lay trembling and whining as if under the most dreadful terror i doubted at first whether i had not dreamed of the tumult until as i attempted to rise a feeling of pain and dizziness assured me that the injury i had sustained was but too real i gathered together my senses listenedand heard at a distance the shouts of the rioters busy doubtless in their work of devastation i made a second effort to rise or at least to turn myself for i lay with my face to the wall of the cottage but i found that my limbs were secured and my motions effectually preventednot indeed by cords but by linen or cloth bandages swathed around my ankles and securing my arms to my sides aware of my utterly captive condition i groaned betwixt bodily pain and mental distress  a voice by my bedside whispered in a whining tone whisht aye hinniewhisht aye haud your tongue like a gude bairnye have cost us dear aneugh already my hinnies clean gane now  knowing as i thought the phraseology of the wife of the itinerant musician i asked her where her husband was and whether he had been hurt  broken answered the dame all broken to pieces fit for naught but to be made spunks ofthe best blood that was in scotland  brokenbloodis your husband wounded has there been bloodshed broken limbs  broken limbs i wish answered the beldam that my hinnie had broken the best bane in his body before he had broken his fiddle that was the best blood in scotlandit was a cremony for aught that i ken  pshawonly his fiddle said i  i dinna ken what waur your honour could have wished him to do unless he had broken his neck and this is muckle the same to my hinnie willie and me chaw indeed it is easy to say chaw but wha is to gie us ony thing to chawthe breadwinners gane and we may een sit down and starve  no no i said i will pay you for twenty such fiddles  twenty such is that a ye ken about it the country hadna the like ot but if your honour were to pay us as nae doubt wad be to your credit here and hereafter where are ye to get the siller  i have enough of money said i attempting to reach my hand towards my sidepocket unloose these bandages and i will pay you on the spot  this hint appeared to move her and she was approaching the bedside as i hoped to liberate me from my bonds when a nearer and more desperate shout was heard as if the rioters were close by the hut  i daurna i daurna said the poor woman they would murder me and my hinnie willie baith and they have misguided us aneugh alreadybut if there is anything worldly i could do for your honour leave out loosing ye  what she said recalled me to my bodily suffering agitation and the effects of the usage i had received had produced a burning thirst i asked for a drink of water  heaven almighty forbid that epps ainslie should gie ony sick gentleman cauld wellwater and him in a fever na na hinnie let me alane ill do better for ye than the like of that  give me what you will i replied let it but be liquid and cool  the woman gave me a large horn accordingly filled with spirits and water which without minute inquiry concerning the nature of its contents i drained at a draught either the spirits taken in such a manner acted more suddenly than usual on my brain or else there was some drug mixed with the beverage i remember little after drinking it off only that the appearance of things around me became indistinct that the womans form seemed to multiply itself and to flit in various figures around me bearing the same lineaments as she herself did i remember also that the discordant noises and cries of those without the cottage seemed to die away in a hum like that with which a nurse hushes her babe at length i fell into a deep sound sleep or rather a state of absolute insensibility  i have reason to think this species of trance lasted for many hours indeed for the whole subsequent day and part of the night it was not uniformly so profound for my recollection of it is chequered with many dreams all of a painful nature but too faint and too indistinct to be remembered at length the moment of waking came and my sensations were horrible  a deep sound which in the confusion of my senses i identified with the cries of the rioters was the first thing of which i was sensible next i became conscious that i was carried violently forward in some conveyance with an unequal motion which gave me much pain my position was horizontal and when i attempted to stretch my hands in order to find some mode of securing myself against this species of suffering i found i was bound as before and the horrible reality rushed on my mind that i was in the hands of those who had lately committed a great outrage on property and were now about to kidnap if not to murder me i opened my eyes it was to no purposeall around me was dark for a day had passed over during my captivity a dispiriting sickness oppressed my headmy heart seemed on fire while my feet and hands were chilled and benumbed with want of circulation it was with the utmost difficulty that i at length and gradually recovered in a sufficient degree the power of observing external sounds and circumstances and when i did so they presented nothing consolatory  groping with my hands as far as the bandages would permit and receiving the assistance of some occasional glances of the moonlight i became aware that the carriage in which i was transported was one of the light carts of the country called tumblers and that a little attention had been paid to my accommodation as i was laid upon some sacks covered with matting and filled with straw without these my condition would have been still more intolerable for the vehicle sinking now on one side and now on the other sometimes sticking absolutely fast and requiring the utmost exertions of the animal which drew it to put it once more in motion was subjected to jolts in all directions which were very severe at other times it rolled silently and smoothly over what seemed to be wet sand and as i heard the distant roar of the tide i had little doubt that we were engaged in passing the formidable estuary which divides the two kingdoms  there seemed to be at least five or six people about the cart some on foot others on horseback the former lent assistance whenever it was in danger of upsetting or sticking fast in the quicksand the others rode before and acted as guides often changing the direction of the vehicle as the precarious state of the passage required  i addressed myself to the men around the cart and endeavoured to move their compassion i had harmed i said no one and for no action in my life had deserved such cruel treatment i had no concern whatever in the fishing station which had incurred their displeasure and my acquaintance with mr geddes was of a very late date lastly and as my strongest argument i endeavoured to excite their fears by informing them that my rank in life would not permit me to be either murdered or secreted with impunity and to interest their avarice by the promises i made them of reward if they would effect my deliverance i only received a scornful laugh in reply to my threats my promises might have done more for the fellows were whispering together as if in hesitation and i began to reiterate and increase my offers when the voice of one of the horsemen who had suddenly come up enjoined silence to the men on foot and approaching the side of the cart said to me with a strong and determined voice young man there is no personal harm designed to you if you remain silent and quiet you may reckon on good treatment but if you endeavour to tamper with these men in the execution of their duty i will take such measures for silencing you as you shall remember the longest day you have to live  i thought i knew the voice which uttered these threats but in such a situation my perceptions could not be supposed to be perfectly accurate i was contented to reply whoever you are that speak to me i entreat the benefit of the meanest prisoner who is not to be subjected legally to greater hardship than is necessary for the restraint of his person i entreat that these bonds which hurt me so cruelly may be slackened at least if not removed altogether  i will slacken the belts said the former speaker nay i will altogether remove them and allow you to pursue your journey in a more convenient manner provided you will give me your word of honour that you will not attempt an escape  never i answered with an energy of which despair alone could have rendered me capablei will never submit to loss of freedom a moment longer than i am subjected to it by force  enough he replied the sentiment is natural but do not on your side complain that i who am carrying on an important undertaking use the only means in my power for ensuring its success  i entreated to know what it was designed to do with me but my conductor in a voice of menacing authority desired me to be silent on my peril and my strength and spirits were too much exhausted to permit my continuing a dialogue so singular even if i could have promised myself any good result by doing so  it is proper here to add that from my recollections at the time and from what has since taken place i have the strongest possible belief that the man with whom i held this expostulation was the singular person residing at brokenburn in dumfriesshire and called by the fishers of that hamlet the laird of the solway lochs the cause for his inveterate persecution i cannot pretend even to guess at  in the meantime the cart was dragged heavily and wearily on until the nearer roar of the advancing tide excited the apprehension of another danger i could not mistake the sound which i had heard upon another occasion when it was only the speed of a fleet horse which saved me from perishing in the quicksands thou my dear alan canst not but remember the former circumstances and now wonderful contrast the very man to the best of my belief who then saved me from peril was the leader of the lawless band who had deprived me of my liberty i conjectured that the danger grew imminent for i heard some words and circumstances which made me aware that a rider hastily fastened his own horse to the shafts of the cart in order to assist the exhausted animal which drew it and the vehicle was now pulled forward at a faster pace which the horses were urged to maintain by blows and curses the men however were inhabitants of the neighbourhood and i had strong personal reason to believe that one of them at least was intimately acquainted with all the depths and shallows of the perilous paths in which we were engaged but they were in imminent danger themselves and if so as from the whispering and exertions to push on with the cart was much to be apprehended there was little doubt that i should be left behind as a useless encumbrance and that while i was in a condition which rendered every chance of escape impracticable these were awful apprehensions but it pleased providence to increase them to a point which my brain was scarcely able to endure  as we approached very near to a black line which dimly visible as it was i could make out to be the shore we heard two or three sounds which appeared to be the report of firearms immediately all was bustle among our party to get forward presently a fellow galloped up to us crying out ware hawk ware hawk the landsharks are out from burgh and allonby tom will lose his cargo if you do not bear a hand  most of my company seemed to make hastily for the shore on receiving this intelligence a driver was left with the cart but at length when after repeated and hairbreadth escapes it actually stuck fast in a slough or quicksand the fellow with an oath cut the harness and as i presume departed with the horses whose feet i heard splashing over the wet sand and through the shallows as he galloped off  the dropping sound of firearms was still continued but lost almost entirely in the thunder of the advancing surge by a desperate effort i raised myself in the cart and attained a sitting posture which served only to show me the extent of my danger there lay my native landmy own englandthe land where i was born and to which my wishes since my earliest age had turned with all the prejudices of national feelingthere it lay within a furlong of the place where i yet was that furlong which an infant would have raced over in a minute was yet a barrier effectual to divide me for ever from england and from life i soon not only heard the roar of this dreadful torrent but saw by the fitful moonlight the foamy crests of the devouring waves as they advanced with the speed and fury of a pack of hungry wolves  the consciousness that the slightest ray of hope or power of struggling was not left me quite overcame the constancy which i had hitherto maintained my eyes began to swimmy head grew giddy and mad with feari chattered and howled to the howling and roaring sea one or two great waves already reached the cart when the conductor of the party whom i have mentioned so often was as if by magic at my side he sprang from his horse into the vehicle cut the ligatures which restrained me and bade me get up and mount in the fiends name  seeing i was incapable of obeying he seized me as if i had been a child of six months old threw me across the horse sprang on behind supporting with one hand while he directed the animal with the other in my helpless and painful posture i was unconscious of the degree of danger which we incurred but i believe at one time the horse was swimming or nearly so and that it was with difficulty that my stern and powerful assistant kept my head above water i remember particularly the shock which i felt when the animal endeavouring to gain the bank reared and very nearly fell back on his burden the time during which i continued in this dreadful condition did not probably exceed two or three minutes yet so strongly were they marked with horror and agony that they seem to my recollection a much more considerable space of time  when i had been thus snatched from destruction i had only power to say to my protectoror oppressorfor he merited either name at my hand you do not then design to murder me  he laughed as he replied but it was a sort of laughter which i scarce desire to hear againelse you think i had let the waves do the work but remember the shepherd saves his sheep from the torrentis it to preserve its lifebe silent however with questions or entreaties what i mean to do thou canst no more discover or prevent than a man with his bare palm can scoop dry the solway  i was too much exhausted to continue the argument and still numbed and torpid in all my limbs permitted myself without reluctance to be placed on a horse brought for the purpose my formidable conductor rode on the one side and another person on the other keeping me upright in the saddle in this manner we travelled forward at a considerable rate and by byroads with which my attendant seemed as familiar as with the perilous passages of the solway  at length after stumbling through a labyrinth of dark and deep lanes and crossing more than one rough and barren heath we found ourselves on the edge of a highroad where a chaise and four awaited as it appeared our arrival to my great relief we now changed our mode of conveyance for my dizziness and headache had returned in so strong a degree that i should otherwise have been totally unable to keep my seat on horseback even with the support which i received  my doubted and dangerous companion signed to me to enter the carriagethe man who had ridden on the left side of my horse stepped in after me and drawing up the blinds of the vehicle gave the signal for instant departure  i had obtained a glimpse of the countenance of my new companion as by the aid of a dark lantern the drivers opened the carriage door and i was wellnigh persuaded that i recognized in him the domestic of the leader of this party whom i had seen at his house in brokenburn on a former occasion to ascertain the truth of my suspicion i asked him whether his name was not cristal nixon  what is other folks names to you he replied gruffly who cannot tell your own father and mother  you know them perhaps i exclaimed eagerly you know them and with that secret is connected the treatment which i am now receiving it must be so for in my life have i never injured any one tell me the cause of my misfortunes or rather help me to my liberty and i will reward you richly  aye aye replied my keeper but what use to give you liberty who know nothing how to use it like a gentleman but spend your time with quakers and fiddlers and such like raff if i was yourhem hem hem  here cristal stopped short just on the point as it appeared when some information was likely to escape him i urged him once more to be my friend and promised him all the stock of money which i had about me and it was not inconsiderable if he would assist in my escape  he listened as if to a proposition which had some interest and replied but in a voice rather softer than before aye but men do not catch old birds with chaff my master where have you got the rhino you are so flush of  i will give you earnest directly and that in banknotes said i but thrusting my hand into my sidepocket i found my pocketbook was gone i would have persuaded myself that it was only the numbness of my hands which prevented my finding it but cristal nixon who bears in his countenance that cynicism which is especially entertained with human misery no longer suppressed his laughter  oh ho my young master he said we have taken good enough care you have not kept the means of bribing poor folks fidelity what man they have souls as well as other people and to make them break trust is a deadly sin and as for me young gentleman if you would fill saint marys kirk with gold cristal nixon would mind it no more than so many chuckystones  i would have persisted were it but in hopes of his letting drop that which it concerned me to know but he cut off further communication by desiring me to lean back in the corner and go to sleep  thou art cockbrained enough already he added and we shall have thy young pate addled entirely if you do not take some natural rest  i did indeed require repose if not slumber the draught which i had taken continued to operate and satisfied in my own mind that no attempt on my life was designed the fear of instant death no longer combated the torpor which crept over mei slept and slept soundly but still without refreshment  when i awoke i found myself extremely indisposed images of the past and anticipations of the future floated confusedly through my brain i perceived however that my situation was changed greatly for the better i was in a good bed with the curtains drawn round it i heard the lowered voice and cautious step of attendants who seemed to respect my repose it appeared as if i was in the hands either of friends or of such as meant me no personal harm  i can give but an indistinct account of two or three broken and feverish days which succeeded but if they were chequered with dreams and visions of terror other and more agreeable objects were also sometimes presented alan fairford will understand me when i say i am convinced i saw gm during this interval of oblivion i had medical attendance and was bled more than once i also remember a painful operation performed on my head where i had received a severe blow on the night of the riot my hair was cut short and the bone of the skull examined to discover if the cranium had received any injury  on seeing the physician it would have been natural to have appealed to him on the subject of my confinement and i remember more than once attempting to do so but the fever lay like a spell upon my tongue and when i would have implored the doctors assistance i rambled from the subject and spoke i know not what nonsense some power which i was unable to resist seemed to impel me into a different course of conversation from what i intended and though conscious in some degree of the failure i could not mend it and resolved therefore to be patient until my capacity of steady thought and expression was restored to me with my ordinary health which had sustained a severe shock from the vicissitudes to which i had been exposed see note 6     chapter v  darsie latimers journal in continuation  two or three days perhaps more perhaps less had been spent in bed where i was carefully attended and treated i believe with as much judgement as the case required and i was at length allowed to quit my bed though not the chamber i was now more able to make some observation on the place of my confinement  the room in appearance and furniture resembled the best apartment in a farmers house and the window two stories high looked into a backyard or court filled with domestic poultry there were the usual domestic offices about this yard i could distinguish the brewhouse and the barn and i heard from a more remote building the lowing of the cattle and other rural sounds announcing a large and wellstocked farm these were sights and sounds qualified to dispel any apprehension of immediate violence yet the building seemed ancient and strong a part of the roof was battlemented and the walls were of great thickness lastly i observed with some unpleasant sensations that the windows of my chamber had been lately secured with iron stanchions and that the servants who brought me victuals or visited my apartment to render other menial offices always locked the door when they retired  the comfort and cleanliness of my chamber were of true english growth and such as i had rarely seen on the other side of the tweed the very old wainscot which composed the floor and the panelling of the room was scrubbed with a degree of labour which the scottish housewife rarely bestows on her most costly furniture  the whole apartments appropriated to my use consisted of the bedroom a small parlour adjacent within which was a still smaller closet having a narrow window which seemed anciently to have been used as a shothole admitting indeed a very moderate portion of light and air but without its being possible to see anything from it except the blue sky and that only by mounting on a chair there were appearances of a separate entrance into this cabinet besides that which communicated with the parlour but it had been recently built up as i discovered by removing a piece of tapestry which covered the fresh masonwork i found some of my clothes here with linen and other articles as well as my writingcase containing pen ink and paper which enables me at my leisure which god knows is undisturbed enough to make this record of my confinement it may be well believed however that i do not trust to the security of the bureau but carry the written sheets about my person so that i can only be deprived of them by actual violence i also am cautious to write in the little cabinet only so that i can hear any person approach me through the other apartments and have time enough to put aside my journal before they come upon me  the servants a stout country fellow and a very pretty milkmaidlooking lass by whom i am attended seem of the true joan and hedge school thinking of little and desiring nothing beyond the very limited sphere of their own duties or enjoyments and having no curiosity whatever about the affairs of others their behaviour to me in particular is at the same time very kind and very provoking my table is abundantly supplied and they seem anxious to comply with my taste in that department but whenever i make inquiries beyond whats for dinner the brute of a lad baffles me by his anan and his dunna knaw and if hard pressed turns his back on me composedly and leaves the room the girl too pretends to be as simple as he but an arch grin which she cannot always suppress seems to acknowledge that she understands perfectly well the game which she is playing and is determined to keep me in ignorance both of them and the wench in particular treat me as they would do a spoiled child and never directly refuse me anything which i ask taking care at the same time not to make their words good by effectually granting my request thus if i desire to go out i am promised by dorcas that i shall walk in the park at night and see the cows milked just as she would propose such an amusement to a child but she takes care never to keep her word if it is in her power to do so  in the meantime there has stolen on me insensibly an indifference to my freedoma carelessness about my situation for which i am unable to account unless it be the consequence of weakness and loss of blood i have read of men who immured as i am have surprised the world by the address with which they have successfully overcome the most formidable obstacles to their escape and when i have heard such anecdotes i have said to myself that no one who is possessed only of a fragment of freestone or a rusty nail to grind down rivets and to pick locks having his full leisure to employ in the task need continue the inhabitant of a prison here however i sit day after day without a single effort to effect my liberation  yet my inactivity is not the result of despondency but arises in part at least from feelings of a very different cast my story long a mysterious one seems now upon the verge of some strange development and i feel a solemn impression that i ought to wait the course of events to struggle against which is opposing my feeble efforts to the high will of fate thou my alan wilt treat as timidity this passive acquiescence which has sunk down on me like a benumbing torpor but if thou hast remembered by what visions my couch was haunted and dost but think of the probability that i am in the vicinity perhaps under the same roof with gm thou wilt acknowledge that other feelings than pusillanimity have tended in some degree to reconcile me to my fate  still i own it is unmanly to submit with patience to this oppressive confinement my heart rises against it especially when i sit down to record my sufferings in this journal and i am determined as the first step to my deliverance to have my letters sent to the posthouse   i am disappointed when the girl dorcas upon whom i had fixed for a messenger heard me talk of sending a letter she willingly offered her services and received the crown which i gave her for my purse had not taken flight with the more valuable contents of my pocketbook with a smile which showed her whole set of white teeth  but when with the purpose of gaining some intelligence respecting my present place of abode i asked to which posttown she was to send or carry the letter a stolid anan showed me she was either ignorant of the nature of a postoffice or that for the present she chose to seem sosimpleton i said with some sharpness  o lord sir answered the girl turning pale which they always do when i show any sparks of anger dont put yourself in a passionill put the letter in the post  what and not know the name of the posttown said i out of patience how on earth do you propose to manage that  la you there good master what need you frighten a poor girl that is no schollard bating what she learned at the charity school of saint bees  is saint bees far from this place dorcas do you send your letters there said i in a manner as insinuating and yet careless as i could assume  saint bees la who but a madmanbegging your honours pardonits a matter of twenty years since fader lived at saint bees which is twenty or forty or i dunna know not how many miles from this part to the west on the coast side and i would not have left saint bees but that fader  oh the devil take your father replied i  to which she answered nay but thof your honour be a little howcomeso you shouldnt damn folks faders and i wont stand to it for one  oh i beg you a thousand pardonsi wish your father no ill in the worldhe was a very honest man in his way  was an honest man she exclaimed for the cumbrians are it would seem like their neighbours the scotch ticklish on the point of ancestryhe is a very honest man as ever led nag with halter on head to staneshaw bank fair honest he is a horsecouper  right right i replied i know iti have heard of your fatheras honest as any horsecouper of them all why dorcas i mean to buy a horse of him  ah your honour sighed dorcas he is the man to serve your honour wellif ever you should get round againor thof you were a bit off the hooks he would no more cheat you than  well well we will deal my girl you may depend ont but tell me now were i to give you a letter what would you do to get it forward  why put it into squires own bag that hangs in hall answered poor dorcas what else could i do he sends it to brampton or to carloisle or where it pleases him once a week and that gate  ah said i and i suppose your sweetheart john carries it  noadisnt nowand jan is no sweetheart of mine ever since he danced at his mothers feast with kitty rutlege and let me sit still that a did  it was most abominable in jan and what i could never have thought of him i replied  oh but a did thougha let me sit still on my seat a did  well well my pretty may you will get a handsomer fellow than janjans not the fellow for you i see that  noa noa answered the damsel but he is weel aneugh for a that mon but i carena a button for him for there is the millers son that suitored me last appleby fair when i went wi oncle is a gway canny lad as you will see in the sunshine  aye a fine stout fellow do you think he would carry my letter to carlisle  to carloisle twould be all his life is worth he maun wait on clap and hopper as they say odd his father would brain him if he went to carloisle bating to wrestling for the belt or sic loike but i ha more bachelors than him there is the schoolmaster can write almaist as weel as tou canst mon  then he is the very man to take charge of a letter he knows the trouble of writing one  aye marry does he an tou comest to that mon only it takes him four hours to write as mony lines tan it is a great round hand loike that one can read easily and not loike your honours that are like midges taes but for ganging to carloisle hes dead foundered man as cripple as eckies mear  in the name of god said i how is it that you propose to get my letter to the post  why just to put it into squires bag loike reiterated dorcas he sends it by cristal nixon to post as you call it when such is his pleasure  here i was then not much edified by having obtained a list of dorcass bachelors and by finding myself with respect to any information which i desired just exactly at the point where i set out it was of consequence to me however to accustom the girl to converse with me familiarly if she did so she could not always be on her guard and something i thought might drop from her which i could turn to advantage  does not the squire usually look into his letterbag dorcas said i with as much indifference as i could assume  that a does said dorcas and a threw out a letter of mine to raff miller because a said  well well i wont trouble him with mine said i dorcas but instead i will write to himself dorcas but how shall i address him  anan was again dorcass resource  i mean how is he called what is his name  sure you honour should know best said dorcas  i know the devil you drive me beyond patience  noa noa donna your honour go beyond patiencedonna ye now implored the wench and for his neame they say he has mair nor ane in westmoreland and on the scottish side but he is but seldom wi us excepting in the cocking season and then we just call him squoire loike and so do my measter and dame  and is he here at present said i  not he not he he is a buckhoonting as they tell me somewhere up the patterdale way but he comes and gangs like a flap of a whirlwind or sic loike  i broke off the conversation after forcing on dorcas a little silver to buy ribbons with which she was so much delighted that she exclaimed god cristal nixon may say his worst on thee but thou art a civil gentleman for all him and a quoit man wi woman folk loike  there is no sense in being too quiet with women folk so i added a kiss with my crown piece and i cannot help thinking that i have secured a partisan in dorcas at least she blushed and pocketed her little compliment with one hand while with the other she adjusted her cherrycoloured ribbons a little disordered by the struggle it cost me to attain the honour of a salute  as she unlocked the door to leave the apartment she turned back and looking on me with a strong expression of compassion added the remarkable words labest mad or no thouse a mettled lad after all  there was something very ominous in the sound of these farewell words which seemed to afford me a clue to the pretext under which i was detained in confinement my demeanour was probably insane enough while i was agitated at once by the frenzy incident to the fever and the anxiety arising from my extraordinary situation but is it possible they can now establish any cause for confining me arising out of the state of my mind  if this be really the pretext under which i am restrained from my liberty nothing but the sedate correctness of my conduct can remove the prejudices which these circumstances may have excited in the minds of all who have approached me during my illness i have hearddreadful thoughtof men who for various reasons have been trepanned into the custody of the keepers of private madhouses and whose brain after years of misery became at length unsettled through irresistible sympathy with the wretched beings among whom they were classed this shall not be my case if by strong internal resolution it is in human nature to avoid the action of exterior and contagious sympathies  meantime i sat down to compose and arrange my thoughts for my purposed appeal to my jailerso i must call himwhom i addressed in the following manner having at length and after making several copies found language to qualify the sense of resentment which burned in the first drafts of my letter and endeavoured to assume a tone more conciliating i mentioned the two occasions on which he had certainly saved my life when at the utmost peril and i added that whatever was the purpose of the restraint now practised on me as i was given to understand by his authority it could not certainly be with any view to ultimately injuring me he might i said have mistaken me for some other person and i gave him what account i could of my situation and education to correct such an error i supposed it next possible that he might think me too weak for travelling and not capable of taking care of myself and i begged to assure him that i was restored to perfect health and quite able to endure the fatigue of a journey lastly i reminded him in firm though measured terms that the restraint which i sustained was an illegal one and highly punishable by the laws which protect the liberties of the subject i ended by demanding that he would take me before a magistrate or at least that he would favour me with a personal interview and explain his meaning with regard to me  perhaps this letter was expressed in a tone too humble for the situation of an injured man and i am inclined to think so when i again recapitulate its tenor but what could i do i was in the power of one whose passions seem as violent as his means of gratifying them appear unbounded i had reason too to believe this to thee alan that all his family did not approve of the violence of his conduct towards me my object in fine was freedom and who would not sacrifice much to attain it  i had no means of addressing my letter excepting for the squires own hand he could be at no great distance for in the course of twentyfour hours i received an answer it was addressed to darsie latimer and contained these words you have demanded an interview with me you have required to be carried before a magistrate your first wish shall be grantedperhaps the second also meanwhile be assured that you are a prisoner for the time by competent authority and that such authority is supported by adequate power beware therefore of struggling with a force sufficient to crush you but abandon yourself to that train of events by which we are both swept along and which it is impossible that either of us can resist  these mysterious words were without signature of any kind and left me nothing more important to do than to prepare myself for the meeting which they promised for that purpose i must now break off and make sure of the manuscriptso far as i can in my present condition be sure of anythingby concealing it within the lining of my coat so as not to be found without strict search     chapter vi  latimers journal in continuation  the important interview expected at the conclusion of my last took place sooner than i had calculated for the very day i received the letter and just when my dinner was finished the squire or whatever he is called entered the room so suddenly that i almost thought i beheld an apparition the figure of this man is peculiarly noble and stately and his voice has that deep fullness of accent which implies unresisted authority i had risen involuntarily as he entered we gazed on each other for a moment in silence which was at length broken by my visitor  you have desired to see me he said i am here if you have aught to say let me hear it my time is too brief to be consumed in childish dumbshow  i would ask of you said i by what authority i am detained in this place of confinement and for what purpose  i have told you already said he that my authority is sufficient and my power equal to it this is all which it is necessary for you at present to know  every british subject has a right to know why he suffers restraint i replied nor can he be deprived of liberty without a legal warrant show me that by which you confine me thus  you shall see more he said you shall see the magistrate by whom it is granted and that without a moments delay  this sudden proposal fluttered and alarmed me i felt nevertheless that i had the right cause and resolved to plead it boldly although i could well have desired a little further time for preparation he turned however threw open the door of the apartment and commanded me to follow him i felt some inclination when i crossed the threshold of my prisonchamber to have turned and run for it but i knew not where to find the stairshad reason to think the outer doors would be secured and to conclude so soon as i had quitted the room to follow the proud step of my conductor i observed that i was dogged by cristal nixon who suddenly appeared within two paces of me and with whose great personal strength independent of the assistance he might have received from his master i saw no chance of contending i therefore followed unresistingly and in silence along one or two passages of much greater length than consisted with the ideas i had previously entertained of the size of the house at length a door was flung open and we entered a large oldfashioned parlour having coloured glass in the windows oaken panelling on the wall a huge grate in which a large faggot or two smoked under an arched chimneypiece of stone which bore some armorial device whilst the walls were adorned with the usual number of heroes in armour with large wigs instead of helmets and ladies in sacques smelling to nosegays  behind a long table on which were several books sat a smart underbredlooking man wearing his own hair tied in a club and who from the quire of paper laid before him and the pen which he handled at my entrance seemed prepared to officiate as clerk as i wish to describe these persons as accurately as possible i may add he wore a darkcoloured coat corduroy breeches and spatterdashes at the upper end of the same table in an ample easychair covered with black leather reposed a fat personage about fifty years old who either was actually a country justice or was well selected to represent such a character his leathern breeches were faultless in make his jockey boots spotless in the varnish and a handsome and flourishing pair of bootgarters as they are called united the one part of his garments to the other in fine a richlylaced scarlet waistcoat and a purple coat set off the neat though corpulent figure of the little man and threw an additional bloom upon his plethoric aspect i suppose he had dined for it was two hours past noon and he was amusing himself and aiding digestion with a pipe of tobacco there was an air of importance in his manner which corresponded to the rural dignity of his exterior and a habit which he had of throwing out a number of interjectional sounds uttered with a strange variety of intonation running from bass up to treble in a very extraordinary manner or breaking off his sentences with a whiff of his pipe seemed adopted to give an air of thought and mature deliberation to his opinions and decisions notwithstanding all this alan it might be dooted as our old professor used to say whether the justice was anything more then an ass certainly besides a great deference for the legal opinion of his clerk which might be quite according to the order of things he seemed to be wonderfully under the command of his brother squire if squire either of them were and indeed much more than was consistent with so much assumed consequence of his own  hohaayesosohumhumphthis is the young man i supposehumayeseems sickly young gentleman you may sit down  i used the permission given for i had been much more reduced by my illness than i was aware of and felt myself really fatigued even by the few paces i had walked joined to the agitation i suffered  and your name young man ishumphayehawhat is it  darsie latimer  rightayehumphvery right darsie latimer is the very thinghaayewhere do you come from  from scotland sir i replied  a native of scotlandahumphehhow is it  i am an englishman by birth sir  rightayeyes you are so but pray mr darsie latimer have you always been called by that name or have you any othernick write down his answers nick  as far as i remember i never bore any other was my answer  how no well i should not have thought so hey neighbour would you  here he looked towards the other squire who had thrown himself into a chair and with his legs stretched out before him and his arms folded on his bosom seemed carelessly attending to what was going forward he answered the appeal of the justice by saying that perhaps the young mans memory did not go back to a very early period  ahehhayou hear the gentleman pray how far may your memory be pleased to run back toumph  perhaps sir to the age of three years or a little further  and will you presume to say sir said the squire drawing himself suddenly erect in his seat and exerting the strength of his powerful voice that you then bore your present name  i was startled at the confidence with which this question was put and in vain rummaged my memory for the means of replying at least i said i always remember being called darsie children at that early age seldom get more than their christian name  oh i thought so he replied and again stretched himself on his seat in the same lounging posture as before  so you were called darsie in your infancy said the justice andhumayewhen did you first take the name of latimer  i did not take it sir it was given to me  i ask you said the lord of the mansion but with less severity in his voice than formerly whether you can remember that you were ever called latimer until you had that name given you in scotland  i will be candid i cannot recollect an instance that i was so called when in england but neither can i recollect when the name was first given me and if anything is to be founded on these queries and my answers i desire my early childhood may be taken into consideration  humayeyes said the justice all that requires consideration shall be duly considered young manehi beg to know the name of your father and mother  this was galling a wound that has festered for years and i did not endure the question so patiently as those which preceded it but replied i demand in my turn to know if i am before an english justice of the peace  his worship squire foxley of foxley hall has been of the quorum these twenty years said master nicholas  then he ought to know or you sir as his clerk should inform him said i that i am the complainer in this case and that my complaint ought to be heard before i am subjected to crossexamination  humphhoywhat ayethere is something in that neighbour said the poor justice who blown about by every wind of doctrine seemed desirous to attain the sanction of his brother squire  i wonder at you foxley said his firmminded acquaintance how can you render the young man justice unless you know who he is  hayesegad thats true said mr justice foxley and nowlooking into the matter more closelythere is eh upon the wholenothing at all in what he saysso sir you must tell your fathers name and surname  it is out of my power sir they are not known to me since you must needs know so much of my private affairs  the justice collected a great afflatus in his cheeks which puffed them up like those of a dutch cherub while his eyes seemed flying out of his head from the effort with which he retained his breath he then blew it forth withwhewhoompoofhanot know your parents youngsterthen i must commit you for a vagrant i warrant you omne ignotum pro terribili as we used to say at appleby school that is every one that is not known to the justice is a rogue and a vagabond haaye you may sneer sir but i question if you would have known the meaning of that latin unless i had told you  i acknowledged myself obliged for a new edition of the adage and an interpretation which i could never have reached alone and unassisted i then proceeded to state my case with greater confidence the justice was an ass that was clear but if was scarcely possible he could be so utterly ignorant as not to know what was necessary in so plain a case as mine i therefore informed him of the riot which had been committed on the scottish side of the solway firth explained how i came to be placed in my present situation and requested of his worship to set me at liberty i pleaded my cause with as much earnestness as i could casting an eye from time to time upon the opposite party who seemed entirely indifferent to all the animation with which i accused him  as for the justice when at length i had ceased as really not knowing what more to say in a case so very plain he replied hoayeayeyeswonderful and so this is all the gratitude you show to this good gentleman for the great charge and trouble he hath had with respect to and concerning of you  he saved my life sir i acknowledge on one occasion certainly and most probably on two but his having done so gives him no right over my person i am not however asking for any punishment or revenge on the contrary i am content to part friends with the gentleman whose motives i am unwilling to suppose are bad though his actions have been towards me unauthorized and violent  this moderation alan thou wilt comprehend was not entirely dictated by my feelings towards the individual of whom i complained there were other reasons in which regard for him had little share it seemed however as if the mildness with which i pleaded my cause had more effect upon him than anything i had yet said we was moved to the point of being almost out of countenance and took snuff repeatedly as if to gain time to stifle some degree of emotion  but on justice foxley on whom my eloquence was particularly designed to make impression the result was much less favourable he consulted in a whisper with mr nicholas his clerkpshawed hemmed and elevated his eyebrows as if in scorn of my supplication at length having apparently made up his mind he leaned back in his chair and smoked his pipe with great energy with a look of defiance designed to make me aware that all my reasoning was lost on him  at length when i stopped more from lack of breath than want of argument he opened his oracular jaws and made the following reply interrupted by his usual interjectional ejaculations and by long volumes of smokehemayeehpoof and youngster do you think matthew foxley who has been one of the quorum for these twenty years is to be come over with such trash as would hardly cheat an applewoman poofpoofeh why manehdost thou not know the charge is not a bailable matterand thathumayethe greatest manpoofthe baron of graystock himself must stand committed and yet you pretend to have been kidnapped by this gentleman and robbed of property and what not andehpoofyou would persuade me all you want is to get away from him i do believeehthat it is all you want therefore as you are a sort of a slipstring gentleman andayehuma kind of idle apprentice and something cockbrained withal as the honest folks of the house tell mewhy you must een remain under custody of your guardian till your coming of age or my lord chancellors warrant shall give you the management of your own affairs which if you can gather your brains again you will even then not beayehempoofin particular haste to assume  the time occupied by his worships hums and haws and puffs of tobacco smoke together with the slow and pompous manner in which he spoke gave me a minutes space to collect my ideas dispersed as they were by the extraordinary purport of this annunciation  i cannot conceive sir i replied by what singular tenure this person claims my obedience as a guardian it is a barefaced imposture i never in my life saw him until i came unhappily to this country about four weeks since  aye sirweehknow and are awarethatpoofyou do not like to hear some folks names and thatehyou understand methere are things and sounds and matters conversation about names and suchlike which put you off the hookswhich i have no humour to witness nevertheless mr darsieorpoofmr darsie latimerorpoof poofehaye mr darsie without the latimeryou have acknowledged as much today as assures me you will best be disposed of under the honourable care of my friend hereall your confessionsbesides that poofehi know him to be a most responsible personahayayemost responsible and honourable personcan you deny this  i know nothing of him i repeated not even his name and i have not as i told you seen him in the course of my whole life till a few weeks since  will you swear to that said the singular man who seemed to await the result of this debate secure as a rattlesnake is of the prey which has once felt its fascination and while he said these words in deep undertone he withdrew his chair a little behind that of the justice so as to be unseen by him or his clerk who sat upon the same side while he bent on me a frown so portentous that no one who has witnessed the look can forget it during the whole of his life the furrows of the brow above the eyes became livid and almost black and were bent into a semicircular or rather elliptical form above the junction of the eyebrows i had heard such a look described in an old tale of diablerie which it was my chance to be entertained with not long since when this deep and gloomy contortion of the frontal muscles was not unaptly described as forming the representation of a small horseshoe  the tale when told awaked a dreadful vision of infancy which the withering and blighting look now fixed on me again forced on my recollection but with much more vivacity indeed i was so much surprised and i must add terrified at the vague ideas which were awakened in my mind by this fearful sign that i kept my eyes fixed on the face in which it was exhibited as on a frightful vision until passing his handkerchief a moment across his countenance this mysterious man relaxed at once the look which had for me something so appalling the young man will no longer deny that he has seen me before said he to the justice in a tone of complacency and i trust he will now be reconciled to my temporary guardianship which may end better for him than he expects  whatever i expect i replied summoning my scattered recollections together i see i am neither to expect justice nor protection from this gentleman whose office it is to render both to the lieges for you sir how strangely you have wrought yourself into the fate of an unhappy young man or what interest you can pretend in me you yourself only can explain that i have seen you before is certain for none can forget the look with which you seem to have the power of blighting those upon whom you cast it  the justice seemed not very easy under this hinthaaye he said it is time to be going neighbour i have a many miles to ride and i care not to ride darkling in these parts you and i mr nicholas must be jogging  the justice fumbled with his gloves in endeavouring to draw them on hastily and mr nicholas bustled to get his greatcoat and whip their landlord endeavoured to detain them and spoke of supper and beds both pouring forth many thanks for his invitation seemed as if they would much rather not and mr justice foxley was making a score of apologies with at least a hundred cautionary hems and ehehs when the girl dorcas burst into the room and announced a gentleman on justice business  what gentlemanand whom does he want  he is cuome post on his ten toes said the wench and on justice business to his worship loike ise uphald him a gentleman for he speaks as good latin as the schulemeaster but lackaday he has gotten a queer mop of a wig  the gentleman thus announced and described bounced into the room but i have already written as much as fills a sheet of my paper and my singular embarrassments press so hard on me that i have matter to fill another from what followed the intrusion ofmy dear alanyour crazy clientpoor peter peebles     chapter vii  latimers journal in continuation  sheet 2  i have rarely in my life till the last alarming days known what it was to sustain a moments real sorrow what i called such was i am now well convinced only the weariness of mind which having nothing actually present to complain of turns upon itself and becomes anxious about the past and the future those periods with which human life has so little connexion that scripture itself hath said sufficient for the day is the evil thereof  if therefore i have sometimes abused prosperity by murmuring at my unknown birth and uncertain rank in society i will make amends by bearing my present real adversity with patience and courage and if i can even with gaiety what can theydare theydo to me foxley i am persuaded is a real justice of peace and country gentleman of estate though wonderful to tell he is an ass notwithstanding and his functionary in the drab coat must have a shrewd guess at the consequences of being accessory to an act of murder or kidnapping men invite not such witnesses to deeds of darkness i have alsoalan i have hopes arising out of the family of the oppressor himself i am encouraged to believe that gm is likely again to enter on the field more i dare not here say nor must i drop a hint which another eye than thine might be able to construe enough my feelings are lighter than they have been and though fear and wonder are still around me they are unable entirely to overcloud the horizon  even when i saw the spectral form of the old scarecrow of the parliament house rush into the apartment where i had undergone so singular an examination i thought of thy connexion with him and could almost have parodied lear    deathnothing could have thus subdued nature   to such a lowness but his learned lawyers  he was een as we have seen him of yore alan when rather to keep thee company than to follow my own bent i formerly frequented the halls of justice the only addition to his dress in the capacity of a traveller was a pair of boots that seemed as if they might have seen the field of sheriffmoor so large and heavy that tied as they were to the creatures wearied hams with large bunches of worsted tape of various colours they looked as if he had been dragging them along either for a wager or by way of penance  regardless of the surprised looks of the party on whom he thus intruded himself peter blundered into the middle of the apartment with his head charged like a rams in the act of butting and saluted them thus  gude day to ye gude day to your honours ist here they sell the fugie warrants  i observed that on his entrance my friendor enemydrew himself back and placed himself as if he would rather avoid attracting the observation of the newcomer i did the same myself as far as i was able for i thought it likely that mr peebles might recognize me as indeed i was too frequently among the group of young juridical aspirants who used to amuse themselves by putting cases for peters solution and playing him worse tricks yet i was uncertain whether i had better avail myself of our acquaintance to have the advantage such as it might be of his evidence before the magistrate or whether to make him if possible bearer of a letter which might procure me more effectual assistance i resolved therefore to be guided by circumstances and to watch carefully that nothing might escape me i drew back as far as i could and even reconnoitred the door and passage to consider whether absolute escape might not be practicable but there paraded cristal nixon whose little black eyes sharp as those of a basilisk seemed the instant when they encountered mine to penetrate my purpose  i sat down as much out of sight of all parties as i could and listened to the dialogue which followeda dialogue how much more interesting to me than any i could have conceived in which peter peebles was to be one of the dramatis personae  is it here where ye sell the warrantsthe fugies ye ken said peter  heyehwhat said justice foxley what the devil does the fellow meanwhat would you have a warrant for  it is to apprehend a young lawyer that is in meditatione fugae for he has taen my memorial and pleaded my cause and a good fee i gave him and as muckle brandy as he could drink that day at his fathers househe loes the brandy ower weel for sae youthful a creature  and what has this drunken young dog of a lawyer done to you that you are come to meehha has he robbed you not unlikely if he be a lawyerehnickha said justice foxley  he has robbed me of himself sir answered peter of his help comfort aid maintenance and assistance whilk as a counsel to a client he is bound to yield me ratione officiithat is it ye see he has pouched my fee and drucken a mutchkin of brandy and now hes ower the march and left my cause half won half lostas dead a heat as eer was run ower the backsands now i was advised by some cunning laddies that are used to crack a bit law wi me in the house that the best thing i could do was to take heart o grace and set out after him so i have taken post on my ain shanks forby a cast in a cart or the like i got wind of him in dumfries and now i have run him ower to the english side and i want a fugie warrant against him  how did my heart throb at this information dearest alan thou art near me then and i well know with what kind purpose thou hast abandoned all to fly to my assistance and no wonder that knowing thy friendship and faith thy sound sagacity and persevering disposition my bosoms lord should now sit lightly on his throne that gaiety should almost involuntarily hover on my pen and that my heart should beat like that of a general responsive to the drums of his advancing ally without whose help the battle must have been lost  i did not suffer myself to be startled by this joyous surprise but continued to bend my strictest attention to what followed among this singular party that poor peter peebles had been put on this wildgoose chase by some of his juvenile advisers in the parliament house he himself had intimated but he spoke with much confidence and the justice who seemed to have some secret apprehension of being put to trouble in the matter and as sometimes occurs on the english frontier a jealousy lest the superior acuteness of their northern neighbours might overreach their own simplicity turned to his clerk with a perplexed countenance  ehohnickdn theehast thou got nothing to say this is more scots law i take it and more scotsmen here he cast a sideglance at the owner of the mansion and winked to his clerk i would solway were as deep as it is wide and we had then some chance of keeping of them out  nicholas conversed an instant aside with the supplicant and then reported  the man wants a borderwarrant i think but they are only granted for debtnow he wants one to catch a lawyer  and what for no answered peter peebles doggedly what for no i would be glad to ken if a days labourer refuse to work yell grant a warrant to gar him do out his daurgif a wench quean rin away from her hairst yell send her back to her heuck againif sae mickle as a collier or a salter make a moonlight flitting ye will cleek him by the backspaul in a minute of timeand yet the damage canna amount to mair than a creelfu of coals and a forpit or twa of saut and here is a chield taks leg from his engagement and damages me to the tune of sax thousand punds sterling that is three thousand that i should win and three thousand mair that i am like to lose and you that ca yourself a justice canna help a poor man to catch the rinaway a bonny like justice i am like to get amang ye  the fellow must be drunk said the clerk  black fasting from all but sin replied the supplicant i havena had mair than a mouthful of cauld water since i passed the border and deil a ane of ye is like to say to me dog will ye drink  the justice seemed moved by this appeal hemtush man replied he thou speakst to us as if thou wert in presence of one of thine own beggarly justicesget downstairsget something to eat man with permission of my friend to make so free in his house and a mouthful to drink and i warrant we get ye such justice as will please ye  i winna refuse your neighbourly offer said poor peter peebles making his bow muckle grace be wi your honour and wisdom to guide you in this extraordinary cause  when i saw peter peebles about to retire from the room i could not forbear an effort to obtain from him such evidence as might give me some credit with the justice i stepped forward therefore and saluting him asked him if he remembered me  after a stare or two and a long pinch of snuff recollection seemed suddenly to dawn on peter peebles recollect ye he said by my troth do ihaud him a grip gentlemenconstables keep him fast where that illdeedie hempy is ye are sure that alan fairford is not far off haud him fast master constable i charge ye wi him for i am mistaen if he is not at the bottom of this rinaway business he was aye getting the silly callant alan awa wi gigs and horse and the like of that to roslin and prestonpans and a the idle gates he could think of hes a rinaway apprentice that ane  mr peebles i said do not do me wrong i am sure you can say no harm of me justly but can satisfy these gentlemen if you will that i am a student of law in edinburghdarsie latimer by name  me satisfy how can i satisfy the gentlemen answered peter that am sae far from being satisfied mysell i ken naething about your name and can only testify nihil novit in causa  a pretty witness you have brought forward in your favour said mr foxley buthaayeill ask him a question or two pray friend will you take your oath to this youth being a runaway apprentice  sir said peter i will make oath to onything in reason when a case comes to my oath its a won cause but i am in some haste to prie your worships good cheer for peter had become much more respectful in his demeanour towards the justice since he had heard some intimation of dinner  you shall haveehhumayea bellyful if it be possible to fill it first let me know if this young man be really what he pretends nick make his affidavit  ow he is just a wud harumscarum creature that wad never take to his studies daft sir clean daft  deft said the justice what dye mean by defteh  just fifish replied peter wowfa wee bit by the east nook or sae its a common casethe ae half of the warld thinks the tither daft i have met with folk in my day that thought i was daft mysell and for my part i think our court of session clean daft that have had the great cause of peebles against plainstanes before them for this score of years and have never been able to ding the bottom out of it yet  i cannot make out a word of his cursed brogue said the cumbrian justice can you neighboureh what can he mean by deft  he means mad said the party appealed to thrown off his guard by impatience of this protracted discussion  ye have itye have it said peter that is not clean skivie but  here he stopped and fixed his eye on the person he addressed with an air of joyful recognitionaye aye mr herries of birrenswork is this your ainsell in blood and bane i thought ye had been hanged at kennington common or hairiebie or some of these places after the bonny ploy ye made in the fortyfive  i believe you are mistaken friend said herries sternly with whose name and designation i was thus made unexpectedly acquainted  the deil a bit answered the undaunted peter peebles i mind ye weel for ye lodged in my house the great year of fortyfive for a great year it was the grand rebellion broke out and my causethe great causepeebles against plainstanes et per contrawas called in the beginning of the winter session and would have been heard but that there was a surcease of justice with your plaids and your piping and your nonsense  i tell you fellow said herries yet more fiercely you have confused me with some of the other furniture of your crazy pate  speak like a gentleman sir answered peebles these are not legal phrases mr herries of birrenswork speak in form of law or i sall bid ye gude day sir i have nae pleasure in speaking to proud folk though i am willing to answer onything in a legal way so if you are for a crack about auld langsyne and the splores that you and captain redgimlet used to breed in my house and the girded cask of brandy that ye drank and neer thought of paying for it not that i minded it muckle in thae days though i have felt a lack of it sin syne why i will waste an hour on ye at ony timeand where is captain redgimlet now he was a wild chap like yoursell though they arena sae keen after you poor bodies for these some years bygane the heading and hanging is weel ower nowawful jobawful jobwill ye try my sneeshing  he concluded his desultory speech by thrusting out his large bony paw filled with a scottish mull of huge dimensions which herries who had been standing like one petrified by the assurance of this unexpected address rejected with a contemptuous motion of his hand which spilled some of the contents of the box  aweel aweel said peter peebles totally unabashed by the repulse een as ye like a wilful man maun hae his way but he added stooping down and endeavouring to gather the spilled snuff from the polished floor i canna afford to lose my sneeshing for a that ye are gumplefoisted wi me  my attention had been keenly awakened during this extraordinary and unexpected scene i watched with as much attention as my own agitation permitted me to command the effect produced on the parties concerned it was evident that our friend peter peebles had unwarily let out something which altered the sentiments of justice foxley and his clerk towards mr herries with whom until he was known and acknowledged under that name they had appeared to be so intimate they talked with each other aside looked at a paper or two which the clerk selected from the contents of a huge black pocketbook and seemed under the influence of fear and uncertainty totally at a loss what line of conduct to adopt  herries made a different and far more interesting figure however little peter peebles might resemble the angel ithuriel the appearance of herries his high and scornful demeanour vexed at what seemed detection yet fearless of the consequences and regarding the whispering magistrate and his clerk with looks in which contempt predominated over anger or anxiety bore in my opinion no slight resemblance to       the regal port   and faded splendour wan  with which the poet has invested the detected king of the powers of the air  as he glanced round with a look which he had endeavoured to compose to haughty indifference his eye encountered mine and i thought at the first glance sank beneath it but he instantly rallied his natural spirit and returned me one of those extraordinary looks by which he could contort so strangely the wrinkles on his forehead i started but angry at myself for my pusillanimity i answered him by a look of the same kind and catching the reflection of my countenance in a large antique mirror which stood before me i started again at the real or imaginary resemblance which my countenance at that moment bore to that of herries surely my fate is somehow strangely interwoven with that of this mysterious individual i had no time at present to speculate upon the subject for the subsequent conversation demanded all my attention  the justice addressed herries after a pause of about five minutes in which all parties seemed at some loss how to proceed he spoke with embarrassment and his faltering voice and the long intervals which divided his sentences seemed to indicate fear of him whom he addressed  neighbour he said i could not have thought this or if iehdid thinkin a corner of my own mind as it werethat you i saythat you might have unluckily engaged inehthe matter of the fortyfivethere was still time to have forgot all that  and is it so singular that a man should have been out in the fortyfive said herries with contemptuous composureyour father i think mr foxley was out with derwentwater in the fifteen  and lost half of his estate answered foxley with more rapidity than usual and was very nearhembeing hanged into the boot but this isanother guess jobforehfifteen is not fortyfive and my father had a remission and you i take it have none  perhaps i have said herries indifferently or if i have not i am but in the case of half a dozen others whom government do not think worth looking after at this time of day so they give no offence or disturbance  but you have given both sir said nicholas faggot the clerk who having some petty provincial situation as i have since understood deemed himself bound to be zealous for government mr justice foxley cannot be answerable for letting you pass free now your name and surname have been spoken plainly out there are warrants out against you from the secretary of states office  a proper allegation mr attorney that at the distance of so many years the secretary of state should trouble himself about the unfortunate relics of a ruined cause answered mr herries  but if it be so said the clerk who seemed to assume more confidence upon the composure of herriess demeanour and if cause has been given by the conduct of a gentleman himself who hath been it is alleged raking up old matters and mixing them with new subjects of disaffectioni say if it be so i should advise the party in his wisdom to surrender himself quietly into the lawful custody of the next justice of peacemr foxley supposewhere and by whom the matter should be regularly inquired into i am only putting a case he added watching with apprehension the effect which his words were likely to produce upon the party to whom they were addressed  and were i to receive such advice said herries with the same composure as beforeputting the case as you say mr faggoti should request to see the warrant which countenanced such a scandalous proceeding  mr nicholas by way of answer placed in his hand a paper and seemed anxiously to expect the consequences which were to ensue mr herries looked it over with the same equanimity as before and then continued and were such a scrawl as this presented to me in my own house i would throw it into the chimney and mr faggot upon the top of it  accordingly seconding the word with the action he flung the warrant into the fire with one hand and fixed the other with a stern and irresistible grip on the breast of the attorney who totally unable to contend with him in either personal strength or mental energy trembled like a chicken in the ravens clutch he got off however for the fright for herries having probably made him fully sensible of the strength of his grasp released him with a scornful laugh  deforcementspulziestouthriefmasterful rescue exclaimed peter peebles scandalized at the resistance offered to the law in the person of nicholas faggot but his shrill exclamations were drowned in the thundering voice of herries who calling upon cristal nixon ordered him to take the bawling fool downstairs fill his belly and then give him a guinea and thrust him out of doors under such injunctions peter easily suffered himself to be withdrawn from the scene  herries then turned to the justice whose visage wholly abandoned by the rubicund hue which so lately beamed upon it hung out the same pale livery as that of his dismayed clerk old friend and acquaintance he said you came here at my request on a friendly errand to convince this silly young man of the right which i have over his person for the present i trust you do not intend to make your visit the pretext of disquieting me about other matters all the world knows that i have been living at large in these northern counties for some months not to say years and might have been apprehended at any time had the necessities of the state required or my own behaviour deserved it but no english magistrate has been ungenerous enough to trouble a gentleman under misfortune on account of political opinions and disputes which have been long ended by the success of the reigning powers i trust my good friend you will not endanger yourself by taking any other view of the subject than you have done ever since we were acquainted  the justice answered with more readiness as well as more spirit than usual neighbour ingoldsbywhat you sayisehin some sort true and when you were coming and going at markets horseraces and cockfights fairs hunts and suchlikeit wasehneither my business nor my wish to dispeli sayto inquire into and dispel the mysteries which hung about you for while you were a good companion in the field and over a bottle now and theni did notehthink it necessary to askinto your private affairs and if i thought you wereahemsomewhat unfortunate in former undertakings and enterprises and connexions which might cause you to live unsettledly and more private i could haveehvery little pleasureto aggravate your case by interfering or requiring explanations which are often more easily asked than given but when there are warrants and witnesses to namesand those names christian and surname belong toehan attainted personchargedi trust falselywithahemtaking advantage of modern broils and heartburnings to renew our civil disturbances the case is altered and i mustahemdo my duty  the justice got on his feet as he concluded this speech and looked as bold as he could i drew close beside him and his clerk mr faggot thinking the moment favourable for my own liberation and intimated to mr foxley my determination to stand by him but mr herries only laughed at the menacing posture which we assumed my good neighbour said he you talk of a witness is yon crazy beggar a fit witness in an affair of this nature  but you do not deny that you are mr herries of birrenswork mentioned in the secretary of states warrant said mr foxley  how can i deny or own anything about it said herries with a sneer there is no such warrant in existence now its ashes like the poor traitor whose doom it threatened have been dispersed to the four winds of heaven there is now no warrant in the world  but you will not deny said the justice that you were the person named in it and thatehyour own act destroyed it  i will neither deny my name nor my actions justice replied mr herries when called upon by competent authority to avow or defend them but i will resist all impertinent attempts either to intrude into my private motives or to control my person i am quite well prepared to do so and i trust that you my good neighbour and brother sportsman in your expostulation and my friend mr nicholas faggot here in his humble advice and petition that i should surrender myself will consider yourselves as having amply discharged your duty to king george and government  the cold and ironical tone in which he made this declaration the look and attitude so nobly expressive of absolute confidence in his own superior strength and energy seemed to complete the indecision which had already shown itself on the side of those whom he addressed  the justice looked to the clerkthe clerk to the justice the former had ehd without bringing forth an articulate syllable the latter only said as the warrant is destroyed mr justice i presume you do not mean to proceed with the arrest  humayewhy nonicholasit would not be quite advisableand as the fortyfive was an old affairandhemas my friend here will i hope see his errorthat is if he has not seen it alreadyand renounce the pope the devil and the pretenderi mean no harm neighbouri think weas we have no posse or constables or the likeshould order our horsesand in one word look the matter over  judiciously resolved said the person whom this decision affected but before you go i trust you will drink and be friends  why said the justice rubbing his brow our business has beenhemrather a thirsty one  cristal nixon said mr herries let us have a cool tankard instantly large enough to quench the thirst of the whole commission  while cristal was absent on this genial errand there was a pause of which i endeavoured to avail myself by bringing back the discourse to my own concerns sir i said to justice foxley i have no direct business with your late discussion with mr herries only just thus faryou leave me a loyal subject of king george an unwilling prisoner in the hands of a person whom you have reason to believe unfriendly to the kings cause i humbly submit that this is contrary to your duty as a magistrate and that you ought to make mr herries aware of the illegality of his proceedings and take steps for my rescue either upon the spot or at least as soon as possible after you have left this case  young man said mr justice foxley i would have you remember you are under the power the lawful powerahemof your guardian  he calls himself so indeed i replied but he has shown no evidence to establish so absurd a claim and if he had his circumstances as an attainted traitor excepted from pardon would void such a right if it existed i do therefore desire you mr justice and you his clerk to consider my situation and afford me relief at your peril  here is a young fellow now said the justice with muchembarrassed looks thinks that i carry the whole statute law of england in my head and a posse comitatus to execute them in my pocket why what good would my interference dobuthumehi will speak to your guardian in your favour  he took mr herries aside and seemed indeed to urge something upon him with much earnestness and perhaps such a species of intercession was all which in the circumstances i was entitled to expect from him  they often looked at me as they spoke together and as cristal nixon entered with a huge fourpottle tankard filled with the beverage his master had demanded herries turned away from mr foxley somewhat impatiently saying with emphasis i give you my word of honour that you have not the slightest reason to apprehend anything on his account he then took up the tankard and saying aloud in gaelic slaint an rey the kings health just tasted the liquor and handed the tankard to justice foxley who to avoid the dilemma of pledging him to what might be the pretenders health drank to mr herriess own with much pointed solemnity but in a draught far less moderate  the clerk imitated the example of his principal and i was fain to follow their example for anxiety and fear are at least as thirsty as sorrow is said to be in a word we exhausted the composition of ale sherry lemonjuice nutmeg and other good things stranded upon the silver bottom of the tankard the huge toast as well as the roasted orange which had whilom floated jollily upon the brim and rendered legible dr byroms celebrated lines engraved thereon    god bless the kinggod bless the faiths defender   god blessno harm in blessingthe pretender   who that pretender is and who that king   god bless us allis quite another thing  i had time enough to study this effusion of the jacobite muse while the justice was engaged in the somewhat tedious ceremony of taking leave that of mr faggot was less ceremonious but i suspect something besides empty compliment passed betwixt him and mr herries for i remarked that the latter slipped a piece of paper into the hand of the former which might perhaps be a little atonement for the rashness with which he had burnt the warrant and imposed no gentle hand on the respectable minion of the law by whom it was exhibited and i observed that he made this propitiation in such a manner as to be secret from the worthy clerks principal  when this was arranged the party took leave of each other with much formality on the part of squire foxley amongst whose adieus the following phrase was chiefly remarkable i presume you do not intend to stay long in these parts  not for the present justice you may be sure there are good reasons to the contrary but i have no doubt of arranging my affairs so that we shall speedily have sport together again  he went to wait upon the justice to the courtyard and as he did so commanded cristal nixon to see that i returned into my apartment knowing it would be to no purpose to resist or tamper with that stubborn functionary i obeyed in silence and was once more a prisoner in my former quarters     chapter viii  latimers journal in continuation  i spent more than an hour after returning to the apartment which i may call my prison in reducing to writing the singular circumstances which i had just witnessed methought i could now form some guess at the character of mr herries upon whose name and situation the late scene had thrown considerable lightone of those fanatical jacobites doubtless whose arms not twenty years since had shaken the british throne and some of whom though their party daily diminished in numbers energy and power retained still an inclination to renew the attempt they had found so desperate he was indeed perfectly different from the sort of zealous jacobites whom it had been my luck hitherto to meet with old ladies of family over their hyson and greyhaired lairds over their punch i had often heard utter a little harmless treason while the former remembered having led down a dance with the chevalier and the latter recounted the feats they had performed at preston clifton and falkirk  the disaffection of such persons was too unimportant to excite the attention of government i had heard however that there still existed partisans of the stuart family of a more daring and dangerous description men who furnished with gold from rome moved secretly and in disguise through the various classes of society and endeavoured to keep alive the expiring zeal of their party  i had no difficulty in assigning an important post among this class of persons whose agency and exertion are only doubted by those who look on the surface of things to this mr herries whose mental energies as well as his personal strength and activity seemed to qualify him well to act so dangerous a part and i knew that all along the western border both in england and scotland there are so many nonjurors that such a person may reside there with absolute safety unless it becomes in a very especial degree the object of the government to secure his person and which purpose even then might be disappointed by early intelligence or as in the case of mr foxley by the unwillingness of provincial magistrates to interfere in what is now considered an invidious pursuit of the unfortunate  there have however been rumours lately as if the present state of the nation or at least of some discontented provinces agitated by a variety of causes but particularly by the unpopularity of the present administration may seem to this species of agitators a favourable period for recommencing their intrigues while on the other hand government may not at such a crisis be inclined to look upon them with the contempt which a few years ago would have been their most appropriate punishment  that men should be found rash enough to throw away their services and lives in a desperate cause is nothing new in history which abounds with instances of similar devotionthat mr herries is such an enthusiast is no less evident but all this explains not his conduct towards me had he sought to make me a proselyte to his ruined cause violence and compulsion were arguments very unlikely to prevail with any generous spirit but even if such were his object of what use to him could be the acquisition of a single reluctant partisan who could bring only his own person to support any quarrel which he might adopt he had claimed over me the rights of a guardian he had more than hinted that i was in a state of mind which could not dispense with the authority of such a person was this man so sternly desperate in his purposehe who seemed willing to take on his own shoulders the entire support of a cause which had been ruinous to thousandswas he the person that had the power of deciding on my fate was it from him those dangers flowed to secure me against which i had been educated under such circumstances of secrecy and precaution  and if this was so of what nature was the claim which he assertedwas it that of propinquity and did i share the blood perhaps the features of this singular beingstrange as it may seem a thrill of awe which shot across my mind at that instant was not unmingled with a wild and mysterious feeling of wonder almost amounting to pleasure i remembered the reflection of my own face in the mirror at one striking moment during the singular interview of the day and i hastened to the outward apartment to consult a glass which hung there whether it were possible for my countenance to be again contorted into the peculiar frown which so much resembled the terrific look of herries but i folded my brows in vain into a thousand complicated wrinkles and i was obliged to conclude either that the supposed mark on my brow was altogether imaginary or that it could not be called forth by voluntary effort or in fine what seemed most likely that it was such a resemblance as the imagination traces in the embers of a wood fire or among the varied veins of marble distinct at one time and obscure or invisible at another according as the combination of lines strikes the eye or impresses the fancy  while i was moulding my visage like a mad player the door suddenly opened and the girl of the house entered angry and ashamed at being detected in my singular occupation i turned round sharply and i suppose chance produced the change on my features which i had been in vain labouring to call forth  the girl started back with her dont ya look so nowdont ye for loves sakeyou be as like the ould squoire asbut here a comes she said huddling away out of the room and if you want a third there is none but ould harry as i know of that can match ye for a brent broo  as the girl muttered this exclamation and hastened out of the room herries entered he stopped on observing that i had looked again to the mirror anxious to trace the look by which the wench had undoubtedly been terrified he seemed to guess what was passing in my mind for as i turned towards him he observed doubt not that it is stamped on your foreheadthe fatal mark of our race though it is not now so apparent as it will become when age and sorrow and the traces of stormy passions and of bitter penitence shall have drawn their furrows on your brow  mysterious man i replied i know not of what you speak your language is as dark as your purposes  sit down then he said and listen thus far at least must the veil of which you complain be raised when withdrawn it will only display guilt and sorrowguilt followed by strange penalty and sorrow which providence has entailed upon the posterity of the mourners  he paused a moment and commenced his narrative which he told with the air of one who remote as the events were which he recited took still the deepest interest in them the tone of his voice which i have already described as rich and powerful aided by its inflections the effects of his story which i will endeavour to write down as nearly as possible in the very words which he used  it was not of late years that the english learned that their best chance of conquering their independent neighbours must be by introducing amongst them division and civil war you need not be reminded of the state of thraldom to which scotland was reduced by the unhappy wars betwixt the domestic factions of bruce and baliol nor how after scotland had been emancipated from a foreign yoke by the conduct and valour of the immortal bruce the whole fruits of the triumphs of bannockburn were lost in the dreadful defeats of dupplin and halidon and edward baliol the minion and feudatory of his namesake of england seemed for a brief season in safe and uncontested possession of the throne so lately occupied by the greatest general and wisest prince in europe but the experience of bruce had not died with him there were many who had shared his martial labours and all remembered the successful efforts by which under circumstances as disadvantageous as those of his son he had achieved the liberation of scotland  the usurper edward baliol was feasting with a few of his favourite retainers in the castle of annan when he was suddenly surprised by a chosen band of insurgent patriots their chiefs were douglas randolph the young earl of moray and sir simon fraser and their success was so complete that baliol was obliged to fly for his life scarcely clothed and on a horse which there was no leisure to saddle it was of importance to seize his person if possible and his flight was closely pursued by a valiant knight of norman descent whose family had been long settled in the marches of dumfriesshire their norman appellation was fitzaldin but this knight from the great slaughter which he had made of the southron and the reluctance which he had shown to admit them to quarter during the former war of that bloody period had acquired the name of redgauntlet which he transmitted to his posterity  redgauntlet i involuntarily repeated  yes redgauntlet said my alleged guardian looking at me keenly does that name recall any associations to your mind  no i replied except that i had lately heard it given to the hero of a supernatural legend  there are many such current concerning the family he answered and then proceeded in his narrative  alberick redgauntlet the first of his house so termed was as may be supposed from his name of a stern and implacable disposition which had been rendered more so by family discord an only son now a youth of eighteen shared so much the haughty spirit of his father that he became impatient of domestic control resisted paternal authority and finally fled from his fathers house renounced his political opinions and awakened his mortal displeasure by joining the adherents of baliol it was said that his father cursed in his wrath his degenerate offspring and swore that if they met he should perish by his hand meantime circumstances seemed to promise atonement for this great deprivation the lady of alberick redgauntlet was again after many years in a situation which afforded her husband the hope of a more dutiful heir  but the delicacy and deep interest of his wifes condition did not prevent alberick from engaging in the undertaking of douglas and moray he had been the most forward in the attack of the castle and was now foremost in the pursuit of baliol eagerly engaged in dispersing or cutting down the few daring followers who endeavoured to protect the usurper in his flight  as these were successively routed or slain the formidable redgauntlet the mortal enemy of the house of baliol was within two lances length of the fugitive edward baliol in a narrow pass when a youth one of the last who attended the usurper in his flight threw himself between them received the shock of the pursuer and was unhorsed and overthrown the helmet rolled from his head and the beams of the sun then rising over the solway showed redgauntlet the features of his disobedient son in the livery and wearing the cognizance of the usurper  redgauntlet beheld his son lying before his horses feet but he also saw baliol the usurper of the scottish crown still as it seemed within his grasp and separated from him only by the prostrate body of his overthrown adherent without pausing to inquire whether young edward was wounded he dashed his spurs into his horse meaning to leap over him but was unhappily frustrated in his purpose the steed made indeed a bound forward but was unable to clear the body of the youth and with its hind foot struck him in the forehead as he was in the act of rising the blow was mortal it is needless to add that the pursuit was checked and baliol escaped  redgauntlet ferocious as he is described was yet overwhelmed with the thoughts of the crime he had committed when he returned to his castle it was to encounter new domestic sorrows his wife had been prematurely seized with the pangs of labour upon hearing the dreadful catastrophe which had taken place the birth of an infant boy cost her her life redgauntlet sat by her corpse for more than twentyfour hours without changing either feature or posture so far as his terrified domestics could observe the abbot of dundrennan preached consolation to him in vain douglas who came to visit in his affliction a patriot of such distinguished zeal was more successful in rousing his attention he caused the trumpets to sound an english point of war in the courtyard and redgauntlet at once sprang to his arms and seemed restored to the recollection which had been lost in the extent of his misery  from that moment whatever he might feel inwardly he gave way to no outward emotion douglas caused his infant to be brought but even the ironhearted soldiers were struck with horror to observe that by the mysterious law of nature the cause of his mothers death and the evidence of his fathers guilt was stamped on the innocent face of the babe whose brow was distinctly marked by the miniature resemblance of a horseshoe redgauntlet himself pointed it out to douglas saying with a ghastly smile it should have been bloody  moved as he was to compassion for his brotherinarms and steeled against all softer feelings by the habits of civil war douglas shuddered at this sight and displayed a desire to leave the house which was doomed to be the scene of such horrors as his parting advice he exhorted alberick redgauntlet to make a pilgrimage to saint ninians of whiteherne then esteemed a shrine of great sanctity and departed with a precipitation which might have aggravated had that been possible the forlorn state of his unhappy friend but that seems to have been incapable of admitting any addition sir alberick caused the bodies of his slaughtered son and the mother to be laid side by side in the ancient chapel of his house after he had used the skill of a celebrated surgeon of that time to embalm them and it was said that for many weeks he spent some hours nightly in the vault where they reposed  at length he undertook the proposed pilgrimage to whiteherne where he confessed himself for the first time since his misfortune and was shrived by an aged monk who afterwards died in the odour of sanctity it is said that it was then foretold to the redgauntlet that on account of his unshaken patriotism his family should continue to be powerful amid the changes of future times but that in detestation of his unrelenting cruelty to his own issue heaven had decreed that the valour of his race should always be fruitless and that the cause which they espoused should never prosper  submitting to such penance as was there imposed sir alberick went it is thought on a pilgrimage either to rome or to the holy sepulchre itself he was universally considered as dead and it was not till thirteen years afterwards that in the great battle of durham fought between david bruce and queen philippa of england a knight bearing a horseshoe for his crest appeared in the van of the scottish army distinguishing himself by his reckless and desperate valour who being at length overpowered and slain was finally discovered to be the brave and unhappy sir alberick redgauntlet  and has the fatal sign said i when herries had ended his narrative descended on all the posterity of this unhappy house  it has been so handed down from antiquity and is still believed said herries but perhaps there is in the popular evidence something of that fancy which creates what it sees certainly as other families have peculiarities by which they are distinguished this of redgauntlet is marked in most individuals by a singular indenture of the forehead supposed to be derived from the son of alberick their ancestor and brother to the unfortunate edward who had perished in so piteous a manner it is certain there seems to have been a fate upon the house of redgauntlet which has been on the losing side in almost all the civil broils which have divided the kingdom of scotland from david bruces days till the late valiant and unsuccessful attempt of the chevalier charles edward  he concluded with a deep sigh as one whom the subject had involved in a train of painful reflections  and am i then i exclaimed descended from this unhappy race do you belong to it and if so why do i sustain restraint and hard usage at the hands of a relation  inquire no further for the present he said the line of conduct which i am pursuing towards you is dictated not by choice but by necessity you were withdrawn from the bosom of your family and the care of your legal guardian by the timidity and ignorance of a doting mother who was incapable of estimating the arguments or feelings of those who prefer honour and principle to fortune and even to life the young hawk accustomed only to the fostering care of its dam must be tamed by darkness and sleeplessness ere it is trusted on the wing for the purposes of the falconer  i was appalled at this declaration which seemed to threaten a long continuance and a dangerous termination of my captivity i deemed it best however to show some spirit and at the same time to mingle a tone of conciliation mr herries i said if i call you rightly by that name let us speak upon this matter without the tone of mystery and fear in which you seem inclined to envelop it i have been long alas deprived of the care of that affectionate mother to whom you alludelong under the charge of strangersand compelled to form my own resolutions upon the reasoning of my own mind misfortuneearly deprivationhas given me the privilege of acting for myself and constraint shall not deprive me of an englishmans best privilege  the true cant of the day said herries in a tone of scorn the privilege of free action belongs to no mortalwe are tied down by the fetters of dutyour mortal path is limited by the regulations of honourour most indifferent actions are but meshes of the web of destiny by which we are all surrounded  he paced the room rapidly and proceeded in a tone of enthusiasm which joined to some other parts of his conduct seems to intimate an overexcited imagination were it not contradicted by the general tenor of his speech and conduct  nothing he said in an earnest yet melancholy voicenothing is the work of chancenothing is the consequence of freewillthe liberty of which the englishman boasts gives as little real freedom to its owner as the despotism of an eastern sultan permits to his slave the usurper william of nassau went forth to hunt and thought doubtless that it was by an act of his own royal pleasure that the horse of his murdered victim was prepared for his kingly sport but heaven had other views and before the sun was high a stumble of that very animal over an obstacle so inconsiderable as a molehillock cost the haughty rider his life and his usurped crown do you think an inclination of the rein could have avoided that trifling impediment i tell you it crossed his way as inevitably as all the long chain of caucasus could have done yes young man in doing and suffering we play but the part allotted by destiny the manager of this strange drama stand bound to act no more than is prescribed to say no more than is set down for us and yet we mouth about freewill and freedom of thought and action as if richard must not die or richmond conquer exactly where the author has decreed it shall be so  he continued to pace the room after this speech with folded arms and downcast looks and the sound of his steps and tone of his voice brought to my remembrance that i had heard this singular person when i met him on a former occasion uttering such soliloquies in his solitary chamber i observed that like other jacobites in his inveteracy against the memory of king william he had adopted the party opinion that the monarch on the day he had his fatal accident rode upon a horse once the property of the unfortunate sir john friend executed for high treason in 1698  it was not my business to aggravate but if possible rather to soothe him in whose power i was so singularly placed when i conceived that the keenness of his feelings had in some degree subsided i answered him as followsi will notindeed i feel myself incompetent to argue a question of such metaphysical subtlety as that which involves the limits betwixt freewill and predestination let us hope we may live honestly and die hopefully without being obliged to form a decided opinion upon a point so far beyond our comprehension  wisely resolved he interrupted with a sneerthere came a note from some geneva sermon  but i proceeded i call your attention to the fact that i as well as you am acted upon by impulses the result either of my own free will or the consequences of the part which is assigned to me by destiny these may benay at present they arein direct contradiction to those by which you are actuated and how shall we decide which shall have precedenceyou perhaps feel yourself destined to act as my jailer i feel myself on the contrary destined to attempt and effect my escape one of us must be wrong but who can say which errs till the event has decided betwixt us  i shall feel myself destined to have recourse to severe modes of restraint said he in the same tone of half jest half earnest which i had used  in that case i answered it will be my destiny to attempt everything for my freedom  and it may be mine young man he replied in a deep and stern tone to take care that you should rather die than attain your purpose  this was speaking out indeed and i did not allow him to go unanswered you threaten me in vain said i the laws of my country will protect me or whom they cannot protect they will avenge  i spoke this firmly and he seemed for a moment silenced and the scorn with which he at last answered me had something of affectation in it  the laws he said and what stripling do you know of the laws of your country could you learn jurisprudence under a baseborn blotter of parchment such as saunders fairford or from the empty pedantic coxcomb his son who now forsooth writer himself advocate when scotland was herself and had her own king and legislature such plebeian cubs instead of being called to the bar of her supreme courts would scarce have been admitted to the honour of bearing a sheepskin processbag  alan i could not bear this but answered indignantly that he knew not the worth and honour from which he was detracting  i know as much of these fairfords as i do of you he replied  as much said i and as little for you can neither estimate their real worth nor mine i know you saw them when last in edinburgh  ha he exclaimed and turned on me an inquisitive look  it is true said i you cannot deny it and having thus shown you that i know something of your motions let me warn you i have modes of communication with which you are not acquainted oblige me not to use them to your prejudice  prejudice me he replied young man i smile at and forgive your folly nay i will tell you that of which you are not aware namely that it was from letters received from these fairfords that i first suspected what the result of my visit to them confirmed that you were the person whom i had sought for years  if you learned this said i from the papers which were about my person on the night when i was under the necessity of becoming your guest at brokenburn i do not envy your indifference to the means of acquiring information it was dishonourable to  peace young man said herries more calmly than i might have expected the word dishonour must not be mentioned as in conjunction with my name your pocketbook was in the pocket of your coat and did not escape the curiosity of another though it would have been sacred from mine my servant cristal nixon brought me the intelligence after you were gone i was displeased with the manner in which he had acquired his information but it was not the less my duty to ascertain its truth and for that purpose i went to edinburgh i was in hopes to persuade mr fairford to have entered into my views but i found him too much prejudiced to permit me to trust him he is a wretched yet a timid slave of the present government under which our unhappy country is dishonourably enthralled and it would have been altogether unfit and unsafe to have entrusted him with the secret either of the right which i possess to direct your actions or of the manner in which i purpose to exercise it  i was determined to take advantage of his communicative humour and obtain if possible more light upon his purpose he seemed most accessible to being piqued on the point of honour and i resolved to avail myself but with caution of his sensibility upon that topic you say i replied that you are not friendly to indirect practices and disapprove of the means by which your domestic obtained information of my name and qualityis it honourable to avail yourself of that knowledge which is dishonourably obtained  it is boldly asked he replied but within certain necessary limits i dislike not boldness of expostulation you have in this short conference displayed more character and energy than i was prepared to expect you will i trust resemble a forest plant which has indeed by some accident been brought up in the greenhouse and thus rendered delicate and effeminate but which regains its native firmness and tenacity when exposed for a season to the winter air i will answer your question plainly in business as in war spies and informers are necessary evils which all good men detest but which yet all prudent men must use unless they mean to fight and act blindfold but nothing can justify the use of falsehood and treachery in our own person  you said to the elder mr fairford continued i with the same boldness which i began to find was my best game that i was the son of ralph latimer of langcote hall how do you reconcile this with your late assertion that my name is not latimer  he coloured as he replied the doting old fool lied or perhaps mistook my meaning i said that gentleman might be your father to say truth i wished you to visit england your native country because when you might do so my rights over you would revive  this speech fully led me to understand a caution which had been often impressed upon me that if i regarded my safety i should not cross the southern border and i cursed my own folly which kept me fluttering like a moth around the candle until i was betrayed into the calamity with which i had dallied what are those rights i said which you claim over me to what end do you propose to turn them  to a weighty one you may be certain answered mr herries but i do not at present mean to communicate to you either its nature or extent you may judge of its importance when in order entirely to possess myself of your person i condescended to mix myself with the fellows who destroyed the fishing station of yon wretched quaker that i held him in contempt and was displeased at the greedy devices with which he ruined a manly sport is true enough but unless as it favoured my designs on you he might have for me maintained his stakenets till solway should cease to ebb and flow  alas i said it doubles my regret to have been the unwilling cause of misfortune to an honest and friendly man  do not grieve for that said herries honest joshua is one of those who by dint of long prayers can possess themselves of widows houseshe will quickly repair his losses when he sustains any mishap he and the other canters set it down as a debt against heaven and by way of setoff practise rogueries without compunction till the they make the balance even or incline it to the winning side enough of this for the presenti must immediately shift my quarters for although i do not fear the overzeal of mr justice foxley or his clerk will lead them to any extreme measure yet that mad scoundrels unhappy recognition of me may make it more serious for them to connive at me and i must not put their patience to an over severe trial you must prepare to attend me either as a captive or a companion if as the latter you must give your parole of honour to attempt no escape should you be so ill advised as to break your word once pledged be assured that i will blow your brains out without a moments scruple  i am ignorant of your plans and purposes i replied and cannot but hold them dangerous i do not mean to aggravate my present situation by any unavailing resistance to the superior force which detains me but i will not renounce the right of asserting my natural freedom should it favourable opportunity occur i will therefore rather be your prisoner than your confederate  that is spoken fairly he said and yet not without the canny caution of one brought up in the gude town of edinburgh on my part i will impose no unnecessary hardship upon you but on the contrary your journey shall be made as easy as is consistent with your being kept safely do you feel strong enough to ride on horseback as yet or would you prefer a carriage the former mode of travelling is best adapted to the country through which we are to travel but you are at liberty to choose between them  i said i felt my strength gradually returning and that i should much prefer travelling on horseback a carriage i added is so close  and so easily guarded replied herries with a look as if he would have penetrated my very thoughtsthat doubtless you think horseback better calculated for an escape  my thoughts are my own i answered and though you keep my person prisoner these are beyond your control  oh i can read the book he said without opening the leaves but i would recommend to you to make no rash attempt and it will be my care to see that you have no power to make any that is likely to be effectual linen and all other necessaries for one in your circumstances are amply provided cristal nixon will act as your valeti should rather perhaps say your femme de chambre your travelling dress you may perhaps consider as singular but it is such as the circumstances require and if you object to use the articles prepared for your use your mode of journeying will be as personally unpleasant as that which conducted you hitheradieuwe now know each other better than we didit will not be my fault if the consequences of further intimacy be not a more favourable mutual opinion  he then left me with a civil good night to my own reflections and only turned back to say that we should proceed on our journey at daybreak next morning at furthest perhaps earlier he said but complimented me by supposing that as i was a sportsman i must always be ready for a sudden start  we are then at issue this singular man and myself his personal views are to a certain point explained he has chosen an antiquated and desperate line of politics and he claims from some pretended tie of guardianship or relationship which he does not deign to explain but which he seems to have been able to pass current on a silly country justice and his knavish clerk a right to direct and to control my motions the danger which awaited me in england and which i might have escaped had i remained in scotland was doubtless occasioned by the authority of this man but what my poor mother might fear for me as a childwhat my english friend samuel griffiths endeavoured to guard against during my youth and nonage is now it seems come upon me and under a legal pretext i am detained in what must be a most illegal manner by a person foe whose own political immunities have been forfeited by his conduct it matters notmy mind is made up neither persuasion nor threats shall force me into the desperate designs which this man meditates whether i am of the trifling consequence which my life hitherto seems to intimate or whether i have as would appear from my adversarys conduct such importance by birth or fortune as may make me a desirable acquisition to a political faction my resolution is taken in either case those who read this journal if it shall be perused by impartial eyes shall judge of me truly and if they consider me as a fool in encountering danger unnecessarily they shall have no reason to believe me a coward or a turncoat when i find myself engaged in it i have been bred in sentiments of attachment to the family on the throne and in these sentiments i will live and die i have indeed some idea that mr herries has already discovered that i am made of different and more unmalleable metal than he had at first believed there were letters from my dear alan fairford giving a ludicrous account of my instability of temper in the same pocketbook which according to the admission of my pretended guardian fell under the investigation of his domestic during the night i passed at brokenburn where as i now recollect my wet clothes with the contents of my pockets were with the thoughtlessness of a young traveller committed too rashly to the care of a strange servant and my kind friend and hospitable landlord mr alexander fairford may also and with justice have spoken of my levities to this man but he shall find he has made a false estimate upon these plausible grounds since  i must break off for the present     chapter ix  latimers journal in continuation  there is at length a haltat length i have gained so much privacy as to enable me to continue my journal it has become a sort of task of duty to me without the discharge of which i do not feel that the business of the day is performed true no friendly eye may ever look upon these labours which have amused the solitary hours of an unhappy prisoner yet in the meanwhile the exercise of the pen seems to act as a sedative upon my own agitated thoughts and tumultuous passions i never lay it down but i rise stronger in resolution more ardent in hope a thousand vague fears wild expectations and indigested schemes hurry through ones thoughts in seasons of doubt and of danger but by arresting them as they flit across the mind by throwing them on paper and even by that mechanical act compelling ourselves to consider them with scrupulous and minute attention we may perhaps escape becoming the dupes of our own excited imagination just as a young horse is cured of the vice of starting by being made to stand still and look for some time without any interruption at the cause of its terror  there remains but one risk which is that of discovery but besides the small characters in which my residence in mr fairfords house enabled me to excel for the purpose of transferring as many scroll sheets as possible to a huge sheet of stamped paper i have as i have elsewhere intimated had hitherto the comfortable reflection that if the record of my misfortunes should fall into the hands of him by whom they are caused they would without harming any one show him the real character and disposition of the person who has become his prisonerperhaps his victim now however that other names and other characters are to be mingled with the register of my own sentiments i must take additional care of these papers and keep them in such a manner that in case of the least hazard of detection i may be able to destroy them at a moments notice i shall not soon or easily forget the lesson i have been taught by the prying disposition which cristal nixon this mans agent and confederate manifested at brokenburn and which proved the original cause of my sufferings  my laying aside the last sheet of my journal hastily was occasioned by the unwonted sound of a violin in the farmyard beneath my windows it will not appear surprising to those who have made music their study that after listening to a few notes i became at once assured that the musician was no other than the itinerant formerly mentioned as present at the destruction of joshua geddess stakenets the superior delicacy and force of whose execution would enable me to swear to his bow amongst a whole orchestra i had the less reason to doubt his identity because he played twice over the beautiful scottish air called wandering willie and i could not help concluding that he did so for the purpose of intimating his own presence since what the french called the nom de guerre of the performer was described by the tune  hope will catch at the most feeble twig for support in extremity i knew this man though deprived of sight to be bold ingenious and perfectly capable of acting as a guide i believed i had won his goodwill by having in a frolic assumed the character of his partner and i remembered that in a wild wandering and disorderly course of life men as they become loosened from the ordinary bonds of civil society hold those of comradeship more closely sacred so that honour is sometimes found among thieves and faith and attachment in such as the law has termed vagrants the history of richard coeur de lion and his minstrel blondel rushed at the same time on my mind though i could not even then suppress a smile at the dignity of the example when applied to a blind fiddler and myself still there was something in all this to awaken a hope that if i could open a correspondence with this poor violer he might be useful in extricating me from my present situation  his profession furnished me with some hope that this desired communication might be attained since it is well known that in scotland where there is so much national music the words and airs of which are generally known there is a kind of freemasonry amongst performers by which they can by the mere choice of a tune express a great deal to the hearers personal allusions are often made in this manner with much point and pleasantry and nothing is more usual at public festivals than that the air played to accompany a particular health or toast is made the vehicle of compliment of wit and sometimes of satire every one must remember instances of this festive custom in which the adaptation of the tune to the toast was remarkably felicitous old neil gow and his son nathaniel were peculiarly happy on such occasions  while these things passed through my mind rapidly i heard my friend beneath recommence for the third time the air from which his own name had been probably adopted when he was interrupted by his rustic auditors  if thou canst play no other spring but that mon ho hadst best put up hos pipes and be jogging squoire will be back anon or master nixon and well see who will pay poiper then  oho thought i if i have no sharper ears than those of my friends jan and dorcas to encounter i may venture an experiment upon them and as most expressive of my state of captivity i sang two or three lines of the 137th psalm    by babels streams we sat and wept  the country people listened with attention and when i ceased i heard them whisper together in tones of commiseration lackaday poor soul so pretty a man to be beside his wits  an he be that gate said wandering willie in a tone calculated to reach my ears i ken naething will raise his spirits like a spring and he struck up with great vigour and spirit the lively scottish air the words of which instantly occurred to me    oh whistle and ill come tye my lad   oh whistle and ill come tye my lad   though father and mother and a should gae mad   oh whistle and ill come tye my lad  i soon heard a clattering noise of feet in the courtyard which i concluded to be jan and dorcas dancing a jig in their cumberland wooden clogs under cover of this din i endeavoured to answer willies signal by whistling as loud as i could    come back again and loe me   when a the lave are gane  he instantly threw the dancers out by changing his air to    theres my thumb ill neer beguile thee  i no longer doubted that a communication betwixt us was happily established and that if i had an opportunity of speaking to the poor musician i should find him willing to take my letter to the post to invoke the assistance of some active magistrate or of the commandingofficer of carlisle castle or in short to do whatever else i could point out in the compass of his power to contribute to my liberation but to obtain speech of him i must have run the risk of alarming the suspicions of dorcas if not of her yet more stupid corydon my allys blindness prevented his receiving any communication by signs from the windoweven if i could have ventured to make them consistently with prudenceso that notwithstanding the mode of intercourse we had adopted was both circuitous and peculiarly liable to misapprehension i saw nothing i could do better than to continue it trusting my own and my correspondents acuteness in applying to the airs the meaning they were intended to convey i thought of singing the words themselves of some significant song but feared i might by doing so attract suspicion i endeavoured therefore to intimate my speedy departure from my present place of residence by whistling the wellknown air with which festive parties in scotland usually conclude the dance    good night and joy be wi ye a   for here nae langer maun i stay   theres neither friend nor foe of mine   but wishes that i were away  it appeared that willies powers of intelligence were much more active than mine and that like a deaf person accustomed to be spoken to by signs he comprehended from the very first notes the whole meaning i intended to convey and he accompanied me in the air with his violin in such a manner as at once to show he understood my meaning and to prevent my whistling from being attended to  his reply was almost immediate and was conveyed in the old martial air of hey johnnie lad cock up your beaver i ran over the words and fixed on the following stanza as most applicable to my circumstances    cock up your beaver and cock it fu sprush   well over the border and give them a brush   theres somebody there well teach better behaviour   hey johnnie lad cock up your beaver  if these sounds alluded as i hope they do to the chance of assistance from my scottish friends i may indeed consider that a door is open to hope and freedom i immediately replied with    my hearts in the highlands my heart is not here   my hearts in the highlands achasing the deer   achasing the wild deer and following the roe   my hearts in the highlands wherever i go    farewell to the highlands  farewell to the north   the birthplace of valour the cradle of worth   wherever i wander wherever i rove   the hills of the highlands for ever i love  willie instantly played with a degree of spirit which might have awakened hope in despair herself if despair could be supposed to understand scotch music the fine old jacobite air    for a that and a that   and twice as much as a that  i next endeavoured to intimate my wish to send notice of my condition to my friends and despairing to find an air sufficiently expressive of my purpose i ventured to sing a verse which in various forms occurs so frequently in old ballads    whare will i get a bonny boy   that will win hose and shoon   that will gae down to durisdeer   and bid my merry men come  he drowned the latter part of the verse by playing with much emphasis    kind robin loes me  of this though i ran over the verses of the song in my mind i could make nothing and before i could contrive any mode of intimating my uncertainty a cry arose in the courtyard that cristal nixon was coming my faithful willie was obliged to retreat but not before he had half played half hummed by way of farewell    leave theeleave thee lad   ill never leave thee   the stars shall gae withershins   ere i will leave thee  i am thus i think secure of one trusty adherent in my misfortunes and however whimsical it may be to rely much on a man of his idle profession and deprived of sight withal it is deeply impressed on my mind that his services may be both useful and necessary there is another quarter from which i look for succour and which i have indicated to thee alan in more than one passage of my journal twice at the early hour of daybreak i have seen the individual alluded to in the court of the farm and twice she made signs of recognition in answer to the gestures by which i endeavoured to make her comprehend my situation but on both occasions she pressed her finger on her lips as expressive of silence and secrecy  the manner in which gm entered upon the scene for the first time seems to assure me of her goodwill so far as her power may reach and i have many reasons to believe it is considerable yet she seemed hurried and frightened during the very transitory moments of our interview and i think was upon the last occasion startled by the entrance of some one into the farmyard just as she was on the point of addressing me you must not ask whether i am an early riser since such objects are only to be seen at daybreak and although i have never again seen her yet i have reason to think she is not distant it was but three nights ago that worn out by the uniformity of my confinement i had manifested more symptoms of despondence than i had before exhibited which i conceive may have attracted the attention of the domestics through whom the circumstance might transpire on the next morning the following lines lay on my table but how conveyed there i cannot tell the hand in which they were written is a beautiful italian manuscript    as lords their labourers hire delay   fate quits our toil with hopes to come   which if far short of present pay   still owns a debt and names a sum    quit not the pledge frail sufferer then   although a distant date be given   despair is treason towards man   and blasphemy to heaven  that these lines were written with the friendly purpose of inducing me to keep up my spirits i cannot doubt and i trust the manner in which i shall conduct myself may show that the pledge is accepted  the dress is arrived in which it seems to be my selfelected guardians pleasure that i shall travel and what does it prove to bea skirt or upperpetticoat of camlet like those worn by country ladies of moderate rank when on horseback with such a ridingmask as they frequently use on journeys to preserve their eyes and complexion from the sun and dust and sometimes it is suspected to enable then to play off a little coquetry from the gayer mode of employing the mask however i suspect i shall be precluded for instead of being only pasteboard covered with black velvet i observe with anxiety that mine is thickened with a plate of steel which like quixotes visor serves to render it more strong and durable  this apparatus together with a steel clasp for securing the mask behind me with a padlock gave me fearful recollections of the unfortunate being who never being permitted to lay aside such a visor acquired the wellknown historical epithet of the man in the iron mask i hesitated a moment whether i should so far submit to the acts of oppression designed against me as to assume this disguise which was of course contrived to aid their purposes but when i remembered mr herriess threat that i should be kept close prisoner in a carriage unless i assumed the dress which should be appointed for me and i considered the comparative degree of freedom which i might purchase by wearing the mask and female dress as easily and advantageously purchased here therefore i must pause for the present and await what the morning may bring forth  to carry on the story from the documents before us we think it proper here to drop the journal of the captive darsie latimer and adopt instead a narrative of the proceedings of alan fairford in pursuit of his friend which forms another series in this history     chapter x  narrative of alan fairford  the reader ought by this time to have formed some idea of the character of alan fairford he had a warmth of heart which the study of the law and of the world could not chill and talents which they had rendered unusually acute deprived of the personal patronage enjoyed by most of his contemporaries who assumed the gown under the protection of their aristocratic alliances and descents he early saw that he should have that to achieve for himself which fell to them as a right of birth he laboured hard in silence and solitude and his labours were crowned with success but alan doted on his friend darsie even more than he loved his profession and as we have seen threw everything aside when he thought latimer in danger forgetting fame and fortune and hazarding even the serious displeasure of his father to rescue him whom he loved with an elder brothers affection darsie though his parts were more quick and brilliant than those of his friend seemed always to the latter a being under his peculiar charge whom he was called upon to cherish and protect in cases where the youths own experience was unequal to the exigency and now when the fate of latimer seeming worse than doubtful alans whole prudence and energy were to be exerted in his behalf an adventure which might have seemed perilous to most youths of his age had no terrors for him he was well acquainted with the laws of his country and knew how to appeal to them and besides his professional confidence his natural disposition was steady sedate persevering and undaunted with these requisites he undertook a quest which at that time was not unattended with actual danger and had much in it to appal a more timid disposition  fairfords first inquiry concerning his friend was of the chief magistrate of dumfries provost crosbie who had sent the information of darsies disappearance on his first application he thought he discerned in the honest dignitary a desire to get rid of the subject the provost spoke of the riot at the fishing station as an outbreak among those lawless loons the fishermen which concerned the sheriff he said more than us poor town council bodies that have enough to do to keep peace within burgh amongst such a set of commoners as the town are plagued with  but this is not all provost crosbie said mr alan fairford a young gentleman of rank and fortune has disappeared amongst their handsyou know him my father gave him a letter to youmr darsie latimer  lackaday yes lackaday yes said the provost mr darsie latimerhe dined at my housei hope he is well  i hope so too said alan rather indignantly but i desire more certainty on that point you yourself wrote my father that he had disappeared  troth yes and that is true said the provost but did he not go back to his friends in scotland it was not natural to think he would stay here  not unless he is under restraint said fairford surprised at the coolness with which the provost seemed to take up the matter  rely on it sir said mr crosbie that if he has not returned to his friends in scotland he must have gone to his friends in england  i will rely on no such thing said alan if there is law or justice in scotland i will have the thing cleared to the very bottom  reasonable reasonable said the provost so far as is possible but you know i have no power beyond the ports of the burgh  but you are in the commission besides mr crosbie a justice of peace for the county  true very truethat is said the cautious magistrate i will not say but my name may stand on the list but i cannot remember that i have ever qualified by taking the oaths to government  why in that case said young fairford there are illnatured people might doubt your attachment to the protestant line mr crosbie  god forbid mr fairford i who have done and suffered in the fortyfive i reckon the highlandmen did me damage to the amount of 100l scots forby all they ate and drankno no sir i stand beyond challenge but as for plaguing myself with county business let them that aught the mare shoe the mare the commissioners of supply would see my back broken before they would help me in the burghs work and all the world kens the difference of the weight between public business in burgh and landward what are their riots to me have we not riots enough of our ownbut i must be getting ready for the council meets this forenoon i am blithe to see your fathers son on the causeway of our ancient burgh mr alan fairford were you a twelvemonth aulder we would make a burgess of you man i hope you will come and dine with me before you go away what think you of today at two oclockjust a roasted chucky and a drappit egg  alan fairford resolved that his friends hospitality should not as it seemed the inviter intended put a stop to his queries i must delay you for a moment he said mr crosbie this is a serious affair a young gentleman of high hopes my own dearest friend is missingyou cannot think it will be passed over slightly if a man of your high character and known zeal for the government do not make some active inquiry mr crosbie you are my fathers friend and i respect you as suchbut to others it will have a bad appearance  the withers of the provost were not unwrung he paced the room in much tribulation repeating but what can i do mr fairford i warrant your friend casts up againhe will come back again like the ill shillinghe is not the sort of gear that tynesa hellicat boy running through the country with a blind fiddler and playing the fiddle to a parcel of blackguards who can tell where the like of him may have scampered to  there are persons apprehended and in the jail of the town as i understand from the sheriffsubstitute said mr fairford you must call them before you and inquire what they know of this young gentleman  aye ayethe sheriffdepute did commit some poor creatures i believewretched ignorant fishermen bodies that had been quarrelling with quaker geddes and his stakenets whilk under favour of your gown be it spoken mr fairford are not over and above lawful and the town clerk thinks that they may be lawfully removed via factibut that is by the by but sir the creatures were a dismissed for want of evidence the quaker would not swear to them and what could the sheriff and me do but just let them loose come awa cheer up master alan and take a walk till dinnertimei must really go to the council  stop a moment provost said alan i lodge a complaint before you as a magistrate and you will find it serious to slight it over you must have these men apprehended again  aye ayeeasy said but catch them that can answered the provost they are ower the march by this time or by the point of cairnlord help ye they are a kind of amphibious deevils neither land nor water beasts neither english nor scotsneither county nor stewartry as we saythey are dispersed like so much quicksilver you may as well try to whistle a sealgh out of the solway as to get hold of one of them till all the fray is over  mr crosbie this will not do answered the young counsellor there is a person of more importance than such wretches as you describe concerned in this unhappy businessi must name to you a certain mr herries  he kept his eye on the provost as he uttered the name which he did rather at a venture and from the connexion which that gentleman and his real or supposed niece seemed to have with the fate of darsie latimer than from any distinct cause of suspicion which he entertained he thought the provost seemed embarrassed though he showed much desire to assume an appearance of indifference in which he partly succeeded  herries he saidwhat herriesthere are many of that namenot so many as formerly for the old stocks are wearing out but there is herries of heathgill and herries of auchintulloch and herries  to save you further trouble this persons designation is herries of birrenswork  of birrenswork said mr crosbie i have you now mr alan could you not as well have said the laird of redgauntlet  fairford was too wary to testify any surprise at this identification of names however unexpected i thought said he he was more generally known by the name of herries i have seen and been in company with him under that name i am sure  oh aye in edinburgh belike you know redgauntlet was unfortunate a great while ago and though he was maybe not deeper in the mire than other folk yet for some reason or other he did not get so easily out  he was attainted i understand and has no remission said fairford  the cautious provost only nodded and said you may guess therefore why it is so convenient he should hold his mothers name which is also partly his own when he is about edinburgh to bear his proper name might be accounted a kind of flying in the face of government ye understand but he has been long connived atthe story is an old storyand the gentleman has many excellent qualities and is of a very ancient and honourable househas cousins among the great folkcounts kin with the advocate and with the sheriffhawks you know mr alan will not pike out hawks eenhe is widely connectedmy wife is a fourth cousin of redgauntlets  hinc illae lachrymae thought alan fairford to himself but the hint presently determined him to proceed by soft means and with caution i beg you to understand said fairford that in the investigation i am about to make i design no harm to mr herries or redgauntletcall him what you will all i wish is to ascertain the safety of my friend i know that he was rather foolish in once going upon a mere frolic in disguise to the neighbourhood of this same gentlemans house in his circumstances mr redgauntlet may have misinterpreted the motives and considered darsie latimer as a spy his influence i believe is great among the disorderly people you spoke of but now  the provost answered with another sagacious shake of his head that would have done honour to lord burleigh in the critic  well then continued fairford is it not possible that in the mistaken belief that mr latimer was a spy he may upon such suspicion have caused him to be carried off and confined somewhere such things are done at elections and on occasions less pressing than when men think their lives are in danger from an informer  mr fairford said the provost very earnestly i scarce think such a mistake possible or if by any extraordinary chance it should have taken place redgauntlet whom i cannot but know well being as i have said my wifes first cousin fourth cousin i should say is altogether incapable of doing anything harsh to the young gentlemanhe might send him ower to ailsay for a night or two or maybe land him on the north coast of ireland or in islay or some of the hebrides but depend upon it he is incapable of harming a hair of his head  i am determined not to trust to that provost answered fairford firmly and i am a good deal surprised at your way of talking so lightly of such an aggression on the liberty of the subject you are to consider and mr herries or mr redgauntlets friends would do very well also to consider how it would sound in the ears of an english secretary of state that an attainted traitor for such is this gentleman has not only ventured to take up his abode in this realmagainst the king of which he has been in armsbut is suspected of having proceeded by open force and violence against the person of one of the lieges a young man who is neither without friends nor property to secure his being righted  the provost looked at the young counsellor with a face in which distrust alarm and vexation seemed mingled a fashious job he said at last a fashious job and it will be dangerous meddling with it i should like ill to see your fathers son turn informer against an unfortunate gentleman  neither do i mean it answered alan provided that unfortunate gentleman and his friends give me a quiet opportunity of securing my friends safety if i could speak with mr redgauntlet and hear his own explanation i should probably be satisfied if i am forced to denounce him to government it will be in his new capacity of a kidnapper i may not be able nor is it my business to prevent his being recognized in his former character of an attainted person excepted from the general pardon  master fairford said the provost would ye ruin the poor innocent gentleman on an idle suspicion  say no more of it mr crosbie my line of conduct is determinedunless that suspicion is removed  weel sir said the provost since so it be and since you say that you do not seek to harm redgauntlet personally ill ask a man to dine with us today that kens as much about his matters as most folk you must think mr alan fairford though redgauntlet be my wifes near relative and though doubtless i wish him weel yet i am not the person who is like to be intrusted with his incomings and outgoings i am not a man for thati keep the kirk and i abhor poperyi have stood up for the house of hanover and for liberty and propertyi carried arms sir against the pretender when three of the highlandmens baggagecarts were stopped at ecclefechan and i had an especial loss of a hundred pounds  scots interrupted fairford you forget you told me all this before  scots or english it was too much for me to lose said the provost so you see i am not a person to pack or peel with jacobites and such unfreemen as poor redgauntlet  granted granted mr crosbie and what then said alan fairford  why then it follows that if i am to help you at this pinch if cannot be by and through my ain personal knowledge but through some fitting agent or third person  granted again said fairford and pray who may this third person be  wha but pate maxwell of summertreeshim they call pateinperil  an old fortyfive man of course said fairford  ye may swear that replied the provostas black a jacobite as the auld leaven can make him but a sonsy merry companion that none of us think it worth while to break wi for all his brags and his clavers you would have thought if he had had but his own way at derby he would have marched charlie stuart through between wade and the duke as a thread goes through the needles ee and seated him in saint jamess before you could have said haud your hand but though he is a windy body when he gets on his auldwarld stories he has mair gumption in him than most peopleknows business mr alan being bred to the law but never took the gown because of the oaths which kept more folk out then than they do nowthe mores the pity  what are you sorry provost that jacobitism is upon the decline said fairford  no no answered the provosti am only sorry for folks losing the tenderness of conscience which they used to have i have a son breeding to the bar mr fairford and no doubt considering my services and sufferings i might have looked for some bit postie to him but if the muckle tykes come ini mean a these maxwells and johnstones and great lairds that the oaths used to keep out lang synethe bits o messan doggies like my son and maybe like your fathers son mr alan will be sair put to the wall  but to return to the subject mr crosbie said fairford do you really think it likely that this mr maxwell will be of service in this matter  its very like he may be for he is the tongue of the trump to the whole squad of them said the provost and redgauntlet though he will not stick at times to call him a fool takes more of his counsel than any mans else that i am aware of if fate can bring him to a communing the business is done hes a sharp chield pateinperil  pateinperil repeated alan a very singular name  aye and it was in as queer a way he got it but ill say naething about that said the provost for fear of forestalling his market for ye are sure to hear it once at least however oftener before the punchbowl gives place to the teapotand now fare ye weel for there is the councilbell clinking in earnest and if i am not there before it jows in bailie laurie will be trying some of his manoeuvres  the provost repeating his expectation of seeing mr fairford at two oclock at length effected his escape from the young counsellor and left him at a considerable loss how to proceed the sheriff it seems had returned to edinburgh and he feared to find the visible repugnance of the provost to interfere with this laird of birrenswork or redgauntlet much stronger amongst the country gentlemen many of whom were catholics as well as jacobites and most others unwilling to quarrel with kinsmen and friends by prosecuting with severity political offences which had almost run a prescription  to collect all the information in his power and not to have recourse to the higher authorities until he could give all the light of which the case was capable seemed the wiser proceeding in a choice of difficulties he had some conversation with the procuratorfiscal who as well as the provost was an old correspondent of his father alan expressed to that officer a purpose of visiting brokenburn but was assured by him that it would be a step attended with much danger to his own person and altogether fruitless that the individuals who had been ringleaders in the riot were long since safely sheltered in their various lurkingholes in the isle of man cumberland and elsewhere and that those who might remain would undoubtedly commit violence on any who visited their settlement with the purpose of inquiring into the late disturbances  there were not the same objections to his hastening to mount sharon where he expected to find the latest news of his friend and there was time enough to do so before the hour appointed for the provosts dinner upon the road he congratulated himself on having obtained one point of almost certain information the person who had in a manner forced himself upon his fathers hospitality and had appeared desirous to induce darsie latimer to visit england against whom too a sort of warning had been received from an individual connected with and residing in his own family proved to be a promoter of the disturbance in which darsie had disappeared  what could be the cause of such an attempt on the liberty of an inoffensive and amiable man it was impossible it could be merely owing to redgauntlets mistaking darsie for a spy for though that was the solution which fairford had offered to the provost he well knew that in point of fact he himself had been warned by his singular visitor of some danger to which his friend was exposed before such suspicion could have been entertained and the injunctions received by latimer from his guardian or him who acted as such mr griffiths of london pointed to the same thing he was rather glad however that he had not let provost crosbie into his secret further than was absolutely necessary since it was plain that the connexion of his wife with the suspected party was likely to affect his impartiality as a magistrate  when alan fairford arrived at mount sharon rachel geddes hastened to meet him almost before the servant could open the door she drew back in disappointment when she beheld a stranger and said to excuse her precipitation that she had thought it was her brother joshua returned from cumberland  mr geddes is then absent from home said fairford much disappointed in his turn  he hath been gone since yesterday friend answered rachel once more composed to the quietude which characterizes her sect but her pale cheek and red eye giving contradiction to her assumed equanimity  i am said fairford hastily the particular friend of a young man not unknown to you miss geddesthe friend of darsie latimerand am come hither in the utmost anxiety having understood from provost crosbie that he had disappeared in the night when a destructive attack was made upon the fishingstation of mr geddes  thou dost afflict me friend by thy inquiries said rachel more affected than before for although the youth was like those of the worldly generation wise in his own conceit and lightly to be moved by the breath of vanity yet joshua loved him and his heart clave to him as if he had been his own son and when he himself escaped from the sons of belial which was not until they had tired themselves with reviling and with idle reproach and the jests of the scoffer joshua my brother returned to them once and again to give ransom for the youth called darsie latimer with offers of money and with promise of remission but they would not hearken to him also he went before the head judge whom men call the sheriff and would have told him of the youths peril but he would in no way hearken to him unless he would swear unto the truth of his words which thing he might not do without sin seeing it is written swear not at allalso that our conversation shall be yea or nay therefore joshua returned to me disconsolate and said sister rachel this youth hath run into peril for my sake assuredly i shall not be guiltless if a hair of his head be harmed seeing i have sinned in permitting him to go with me to the fishing station when such evil was to be feared therefore i will take my horse even solomon and ride swiftly into cumberland and i will make myself friends with mammon of unrighteousness among the magistrates of the gentiles and among their mighty men and it shall come to pass that darsie latimer shall be delivered even if it were at the expense of half my substance and i said nay my brother go not for they will but scoff at and revile thee but hire with thy silver one of the scribes who are eager as hunters in pursuing their prey and he shall free darsie latimer from the men of violence by his cunning and thy soul shall be guiltless of evil towards the lad but he answered and said i will not be controlled in this matter and he is gone forth and hath not returned and i fear me that he may never return for though he be peaceful as becometh one who holds all violence as offence against his own soul yet neither the floods of water nor the fear of the snare nor the drawn sword of the adversary brandished in the path will overcome his purpose wherefore the solway may swallow him up or the sword of the enemy may devour himnevertheless my hope is better in him who directeth all things and ruleth over the waves of the sea and overruleth the devices of the wicked and who can redeem us even as a bird from the fowlers net  this was all that fairford could learn from miss geddes but he heard with pleasure that the good quaker her brother had many friends among those of his own profession in cumberland and without exposing himself to so much danger as his sister seemed to apprehend he trusted he might be able to discover some traces of darsie latimer he himself rode back to dumfries having left with miss geddes his direction in that place and an earnest request that she would forward thither whatever information she might obtain from her brother  on fairfords return to dumfries he employed the brief interval which remained before dinnertime in writing an account of what had befallen latimer and of the present uncertainty of his condition to mr samuel griffiths through whose hands the remittances for his friends service had been regularly made desiring he would instantly acquaint him with such parts of his history as might direct him in the search which he was about to institute through the border counties and which he pledged himself not to give up until he had obtained news of his friend alive or dead the young lawyers mind felt easier when he had dispatched this letter he could not conceive any reason why his friends life should be aimed at he knew darsie had done nothing by which his liberty could be legally affected and although even of late years there had been singular histories of men and women also who had been trepanned and concealed in solitudes and distant islands in order to serve some temporary purpose such violences had been chiefly practised by the rich on the poor and by the strong on the feeble whereas in the present case this mr herries or redgauntlet being amenable for more reasons than one to the censure of the law must be the weakest in any struggle in which it could be appealed to it is true that his friendly anxiety whispered that the very cause which rendered this oppressor less formidable might make him more desperate still recalling his language so strikingly that of the gentleman and even of the man of honour alan fairford concluded that though in his feudal pride redgauntlet might venture on the deeds of violence exercised by the aristocracy in other times he could not be capable of any action of deliberate atrocity and in these convictions he went to dine with provost crosbie with a heart more at ease than might have been expected see note 7     chapter xi  narrative of alan fairford continued  five minutes had elapsed after the town clock struck two before alan fairford who had made a small detour to put his letter into the posthouse reached the mansion of mr provost crosbie and was at once greeted by the voice of that civic dignitary and the rural dignitary his visitor as by the voices of men impatient for their dinner  come away mr fairfordthe edinburgh time is later than ours said the provost  and come away young gentleman said the laird i remember your father weel at the cross thirty years agoi reckon you are as late in edinburgh as at london four oclock hourseh  not quite so degenerate replied fairford but certainly many edinburgh people are so illadvised as to postpone their dinner till three that they may have full time to answer their london correspondents  london correspondents said mr maxwell and pray what the devil have the people of auld reekie to do with london correspondents not much in those days for within my recollection the london post was brought north in a small mailcart and men are yet as live who recollect when it came down with only one single letter for edinburgh addressed to the manager of the british linen company  the tradesmen must have their goods said fairford  can they not buy our own scottish manufactures and pick their customers pockets in a more patriotic manner  then the ladies must have fashions said fairford  can they not busk the plaid over their heads as their mothers did a tartan screen and once a year a new cockernony from paris should serve a countess but ye have not many of them left i thinkmareschal airley winton vemyss balmerino all passed and goneaye aye the countesses and ladies of quality will scarce take up too much of your ballroom floor with their quality hoops nowadays  there is no want of crowding however sir said fairford they begin to talk of a new assembly room  a new assembly room said the old jacobite lairdumphi mind quartering three hundred men in the old assembly room i remember hearing this identical answer given by an old highland gentleman of the fortyfive when he heard of the opening of the new assembly rooms in george streetbut come comeill ask no more questionsthe answers all smell of new lords new lands and do but spoil my appetite which were a pity since here comes mrs crosbie to say our muttons ready  it was even so mrs crosbie had been absent like eve on hospitable cares intent a duty which she did not conceive herself exempted from either by the dignity of her husbands rank in the municipality or the splendour of her brussels silk gown or even by the more highly prized lustre of her birth for she was born a maxwell and allied as her husband often informed his friends to several of the first families in the county she had been handsome and was still a portly goodlooking woman of her years and though her peep into the kitchen had somewhat heightened her complexion it was no more than a modest touch of rouge might have done  the provost was certainly proud of his lady nay some said he was afraid of her for of the females of the redgauntlet family there went a rumour that ally where they would there was a grey mare as surely in the stables of their husbands as there is a white horse in wouvermans pictures the good dame too was supposed to have brought a spice of politics into mr crosbies household along with her and the provosts enemies at the counciltable of the burgh used to observe that he uttered there many a bold harangue against the pretender and in favour of king george and government of which he dared not have pronounced a syllable in his own bedchamber and that in fact his wifes predominating influence had now and then occasioned his acting or forbearing to act in a manner very different from his general professions of zeal for revolution principles if this was in any respect true it was certain on the other hand that mrs crosbie in all external points seemed to acknowledge the lawful sway and right supremacy of the head of the house and if she did not in truth reverence her husband she at least seemed to do so  this stately dame received mr maxwell a cousin of course with cordiality and fairford with civility answering at the same time with respect to the magisterial complaints of the provost that dinner was just coming up but since you changed poor peter macalpin that used to take care of the townclock my dear it has never gone well a single day  peter macalpin my dear said the provost made himself too busy for a person in office and drunk healths and so forth which it became no man to drink or to pledge far less one that is in point of office a servant of the public i understand that he lost the music bells in edinburgh for playing ower the water to charlie upon the tenth of june he is a black sheep and deserves no encouragement  not a bad tune though after all said summertrees and turning to the window he half hummed half whistled the air in question then sang the last verse aloud    oh i loe weel my charlies name     though some there be that abhor him    but oh to see the deil gang hame     wi a the whigs before him    over the water and over the sea     and over the water to charlie    come weal come woe well gather and go     and live or die with charlie  mrs crosbie smiled furtively on the laird wearing an aspect at the same time of deep submission while the provost not choosing to hear his visitors ditty took a turn through the room in unquestioned dignity and independence of authority  aweel aweel my dear said the lady with a quiet smile of submission ye ken these matters best and you will do your pleasurethey are far above my handonly i doubt if ever the townclock will go right or your meals be got up so regular as i should wish till peter macalpin gets his office back again the bodys auld and can neither work nor want but he is the only hand to set a clock  it may be noticed in passing that notwithstanding this prediction which probably the fair cassandra had the full means of accomplishing it was not till the second council day thereafter that the misdemeanours of the jacobite clockkeeper were passed over and he was once more restored to his occupation of fixing the towns time and the provosts dinnerhour  upon the present occasion the dinner passed pleasantly away summertrees talked and jested with the easy indifference of a man who holds himself superior to his company he was indeed an important person as was testified by his portly appearance his hat laced with point despagne his coat and waistcoat once richly embroidered though now almost threadbare the splendour of his solitaire and laced ruffles though the first was sorely creased and the other sullied not to forget the length of his silverhilted rapier his wit or rather humour bordered on the sarcastic and intimated a discontented man and although he showed no displeasure when the provost attempted a repartee yet it seemed that he permitted it upon mere sufferance as a fencingmaster engaged with a pupil will sometimes permit the tyro to hit him solely by way of encouragement the lairds own jests in the meanwhile were eminently successful not only with the provost and his lady but with the redcheeked and redribboned servantmaid who waited at table and who could scarce perform her duty with propriety so effectual were the explosions of summertrees alan fairford alone was unmoved among all this mirth which was the less wonderful that besides the important subject which occupied his thoughts most of the lairds good things consisted in sly allusions to little parochial or family incidents with which the edinburgh visitor was totally unacquainted so that the laughter of the party sounded in his ear like the idle crackling of thorns under the pot with this difference that they did not accompany or second any such useful operation as the boiling thereof  fairford was glad when the cloth was withdrawn and when provost crosbie not without some points of advice from his lady touching the precise mixture of the ingredients had accomplished the compounding of a noble bowl of punch at which the old jacobites eyes seemed to glisten the glasses were pushed round it filled and withdrawn each by its owner when the provost emphatically named the toast the king with an important look to fairford which seemed to say you can have no doubt whom i mean and therefore there is no occasion to particularize the individual  summertrees repeated the toast with a sly wink to the lady while fairford drank his glass in silence  well young advocate said the landed proprietor i am glad to see there is some shame if there is little honesty left in the faculty some of your black gowns nowadays have as little of the one as of the other  at least sir replied mr fairford i am so much of a lawyer as not willingly to enter into disputes which i am not retained to supportit would be but throwing away both time and argument  come come said the lady we will have no argument in this house about whig or torythe provost kens what he maun say and i ken what he should think and for a that has come and gane yet there may be a time coming when honest men may say what they think whether they be provosts or not  dye hear that provost said summertrees your wifes a witch man you should nail a horseshoe on your chamber doorha ha ha  this sally did not take quite so well as former efforts of the lairds wit the lady drew up and the provost said half aside the sooth bourd is nae bourd the true joke is no joke you will find the horseshoe hissing hot summertrees  you can speak from experience doubtless provost answered the laird but i crave pardoni need not tell mrs crosbie that i have all respect for the auld and honourable house of redgauntlet  and good reason ye have that are sae sib to them quoth the lady and kend weel baith them that are here and them that are gane  in troth and ye may say sae madam answered the laird for poor harry redgauntlet that suffered at carlisle was hand and glove with me and yet we parted on short leavetaking  aye summertrees said the provost that was when you played cheatthewoodie and gat the byname of pateinperil i wish you would tell the story to my young friend here he likes weel to hear of a sharp trick as most lawyers do  i wonder at your want of circumspection provost said the lairdmuch after the manner of a singer when declining to sing the song that is quivering upon his tongues very end ye should mind there are some auld stories that cannot be ripped up again with entire safety to all concerned tace is latin for a candle  i hope said the lady you are not afraid of anything being said out of this house to your prejudice summertrees i have heard the story before but the oftener i hear it the more wonderful i think it  yes madam but it has been now a wonder of more than nine days and it is time it should be ended answered maxwell  fairford now thought it civil to say that he had often heard of mr maxwells wonderful escape and that nothing could be more agreeable to him than to hear the right version of it  but summertrees was obdurate and refused to take up the time of the company with such auldwarld nonsense  weel weel said the provost a wilful man maun hae his way what do your folk in the country think about the disturbances that are beginning to spunk out in the colonies  excellent sir excellent when things come to the worst they will mend and to the worst they are coming but as to that nonsense ploy of mine if ye insist on hearing the particularssaid the laird who began to be sensible that the period of telling his story gracefully was gliding fast away  nay said the provost it was not for myself but this young gentlemen  aweel what for should i not pleasure the young gentlemen ill just drink to honest folk at hame and abroad and deil ane else and thenbut you have heard it before mrs crosbie  not so often as to think it tiresome i assure ye said the lady and without further preliminaries the laird addressed alan fairford  ye have heard of a year they call the fortyfive young gentleman when the southrons heads made their last acquaintance with scottish claymores there was a set of rampauging chields in the country then that they called rebelsi never could find out what forsome men should have been wi them that never came provostskye and the bush aboon traquair for that ye kenweel the job was settled at last cloured crowns were plenty and raxed necks came into fashion i dinna mind very weel what i was doing swaggering about the country with dirk and pistol at my belt for five or six months or thereaway but i had a weary waking out of a wild dream when did i find myself on foot in a misty morning with my hand just for fear of going astray linked into a handcuff as they call it with poor harry redgauntlets fastened into the other and there we were trudging along with about a score more that had thrust their horns ower deep in the bog just like ourselves and a sergeants guard of redcoats with twa file of dragoons to keep all quiet and give us heart to the road now if this mode of travelling was not very pleasant the object did not particularly recommend it for you understand young man that they did not trust these poor rebel bodies to be tried by juries of their ain kindly countrymen though ane would have thought they would have found whigs enough in scotland to hang us all but they behoved to trounce us away to be tried at carlisle where the folk had been so frightened that had you brought a whole highland clan at once into the court they would have put their hands upon their een and cried hang them a just to be quit of them  aye aye said the provost that was a snell law i grant ye  snell said the wife snell i wish they that passed it had the jury i would recommend them to  i suppose the young lawyer thinks it all very right said summertrees looking at fairfordan old lawyer might have thought otherwise however the cudgel was to be found to beat the dog and they chose a heavy one well i kept my spirits better than my companion poor fellow for i had the luck to have neither wife nor child to think about and harry redgauntlet had both one and totheryou have seen harry mrs crosbie  in troth have i said she with the sigh which we give to early recollections of which the object is no more he was not so tall as his brother and a gentler lad every way after he married the great english fortune folk called him less of a scottishman than edward  folk leed then said summertrees poor harry was none of your boldspeaking ranting reivers that talk about what they did yesterday or what they will do tomorrow it was when something was to do at the moment that you should have looked at harry redgauntlet i saw him at culloden when all was lost doing more than twenty of these bleezing braggarts till the very soldiers that took him cried not to hurt himfor all somebodys orders provostfor he was the bravest fellow of them all weel as i went by the side of harry and felt him raise my hand up in the mist of the morning as if he wished to wipe his eyefor he had not that freedom without my leavemy very heart was like to break for him poor fellow in the meanwhile i had been trying and trying to make my hand as fine as a ladys to see if i could slip it out of my iron wristband you may think he said laying his broad bony hand on the table i had work enough with such a shoulderofmutton fist but if you observe the shacklebones are of the largest and so they were obliged to keep the handcuff wide at length i got my hand slipped out and slipped in again and poor harry was sae deep in his ain thoughts i could not make him sensible what i was doing  why not said alan fairford for whom the tale began to have some interest  because there was an unchancy beast of a dragoon riding close beside us on the other side and if i had let him into my confidence as well as harry it would not have been long before a pistolball slapped through my bonnetwell i had little for it but to do the best i could for myself and by my conscience it was time when the gallows was staring me in the face we were to halt for breakfast at moffat well did i know the moors we were marching over having hunted and hawked on every acre of ground in very different times so i waited you see till i was on the edge of errickstanebraeye ken the place they call the marquiss beefstand because the annandale loons used to put their stolen cattle in there  fairford intimated his ignorance  ye must have seen it as ye came this way it looks as if four hills were laying their heads together to shut out daylight from the dark hollow space between them a dd deep black blackguardlooking abyss of a hole it is and goes straight down from the roadside as perpendicular as it can do to be a heathery brae at the bottom there is a small bit of a brook that you would think could hardly find its way out from the hills that are so closely jammed round it  a bad pass indeed said alan  you may say that continued the laird bad as it was sir it was my only chance and though my very flesh creeped when i thought what a rumble i was going to get yet i kept my heart up all the same and so just when we came on the edge of this beefstand of the johnstones i slipped out my hand from the handcuff cried to harry gauntlet follow mewhisked under the belly of the dragoon horseflung my plaid round me with the speed of lightningthrew myself on my side for there was no keeping my feet and down the brae hurled i over heather and fern and blackberries like a barrel down chalmers close in auld reekie g sir i never could help laughing when i think how the scoundrel redcoats must have been bumbazed for the mist being as i said thick they had little notion i take it that they were on the verge of such a dilemma i was half way downfor rowing is faster wark than rinningere they could get at their arms and then it was flash flash flashrap rap rapfrom the edge of the road but my head was too jumbled to think anything either of that or the hard knocks i got among the stones i kept my senses thegither whilk has been thought wonderful by all that ever saw the place and i helped myself with my hands as gallantly as i could and to the bottom i came there i lay for half a moment but the thoughts of a gallows is worth all the salts and scentbottles in the world for bringing a man to himself up i sprang like a fouryearauld colt all the hills were spinning round with me like so many great big hummingtops but there was nae time to think of that neither more especially as the mist had risen a little with the firing i could see the villains like sae mony craws on the edge of the brae and i reckon that they saw me for some of the loons were beginning to crawl down the hill but liker auld wives in their red cloaks coming frae a field preaching than such a souple lad as i was accordingly they soon began to stop and load their pieces goodeen to you gentlemen thought i if that is to be the gate of it if you have any further word with me you maun come as far as carriefrawgauns and so off i set and never buck went faster ower the braes than i did and i never stopped till i had put three waters reasonably deep as the season was rainy half a dozen mountains and a few thousand acres of the worst moss and ling in scotland betwixt me and my friends the redcoats  it was that job which got you the name of pateinperil said the provost filling the glasses and exclaiming with great emphasis while his guest much animated with the recollections which the exploit excited looked round with an air of triumph for sympathy and applausehere is to your good health and may you never put your neck in such a venture again the escape of a jacobite gentleman while on the road to carlisle to take his trial for his share in the affair of 1745 took place at errickstanebrae in the singular manner ascribed to the laird of summertrees in the text the author has seen in his youth the gentleman to whom the adventure actually happened the distance of time makes some indistinctness of recollection but it is believed the real name was macewen or macmillan  humphi do not know answered summertrees i am not like to be tempted with another opportunityan old gentleman of the authors name was engaged in the affair of 1715 and with some difficulty was saved from the gallows by the intercession of the duchess of buccleugh and monmouth her grace who maintained a good deal of authority over her clan sent for the object of her intercession and warning him of the risk which he had run and the trouble she had taken on his account wound up her lecture by intimating that in case of such disloyalty again he was not to expect her interest in his favour an it please your grace said the stout old tory i fear i am too old to see another opportunity yet who knows and then he made a deep pause  may i ask what became of your friend sir said alan fairford  ah poor harry said summertrees ill tell you what sir it takes time to make up ones mind to such a venture as my friend the provost calls it and i was told by neil macleanwho was next file to us but had the luck to escape the gallows by some sleightofhand trick or otherthat upon my breaking off poor harry stood like one motionless although all our brethren in captivity made as much tumult as they could to distract the attention of the soldiers and run he did at last but he did not know the ground and either from confusion or because he judged the descent altogether perpendicular he fled up the hill to the left instead of going down at once and so was easily pursued and taken if he had followed my example he would have found enough among the shepherds to hide him and feed him as they did me on bearmeal scenes and braxy mutton till better days came round again braxy muttonthe flesh of sheep that has died of disease not by the hand of the butcher in pastoral countries it is used as food with little scruple  he suffered then for his share in the insurrection said alan  you may swear that said summertrees his blood was too red to be spared when that sort of paint was in request he suffered sir as you call itthat is he was murdered in cold blood with many a pretty fellow besides well we may have our day nextwhat is fristed is not forgiventhey think us all dead and buriedbuthere he filled his glass and muttering some indistinct denunciations drank it off and assumed his usual manner which had been a little disturbed towards the end of the narrative  what became of mr redgauntlets child said fairford  mister redgauntlet he was sir henry redgauntlet as his son if the child now lives will be sir arthuri called him harry from intimacy and redgauntlet as the chief of his namehis proper style was sir henry redgauntlet  his son therefore is dead said alan fairford it is a pity so brave a line should draw to a close  he has left a brother said summertrees edward hugh redgauntlet who has now the representation of the family and well it is for though he be unfortunate in many respects he will keep up the honour of the house better than a boy bred up amongst these bitter whigs the relations of his elder brother sir henrys lady then they are on no good terms with the redgauntlet linebitter whigs they are in every sense it was a runaway match betwixt sir henry and his lady poor thing they would not allow her to see him when in confinementthey had even the meanness to leave him without pecuniary assistance and as all his own property was seized upon and plundered he would have wanted common necessaries but for the attachment of a fellow who was a famous fiddlera blind mani have seen him with sir henry myself both before the affair broke out and while it was going on i have heard that he fiddled in the streets of carlisle and carried what money he got to his master while he was confined in the castle  i do not believe a word of it said mrs crosbie kindling with indignation a redgauntlet would have died twenty times before he had touched a fiddlers wages  hout fyehout fyeall nonsense and pride said the laird of summertrees scornful dogs will eat dirty puddings cousin crosbieye little ken what some of your friends were obliged to do yon time for a sowp of brose or a bit of bannock gd i carried a cutlers wheel for several weeks partly for need and partly for disguisethere i went bizzbizzwhizzzizz at every auld wifes door and if ever you want your shears sharpened mrs crosbie i am the lad to do it for you if my wheel was but in order  you must ask my leave first said the provost for i have been told you had some queer fashions of taking a kiss instead of a penny if you liked your customer  come come provost said the lady rising if the maut gets abune the meal with you it is time for me to take myself awayand you will come to my room gentlemen when you want a cup of tea  alan fairford was not sorry for the ladys departure she seemed too much alive to the honour of the house of redgauntlet though only a fourth cousin not to be alarmed by the inquiries which he proposed to make after the whereabout of its present head strange confused suspicions arose in his mind from his imperfect recollection of the tale of wandering willie and the idea forced itself upon him that his friend darsie latimer might be the son of the unfortunate sir henry but before indulging in such speculations the point was to discover what had actually become of him if he were in the hands of his uncle might there not exist some rivalry in fortune or rank which might induce so stern a man as redgauntlet to use unfair measures towards a youth whom he would find himself unable to mould to his purpose he considered these points in silence during several revolutions of the glasses as they wheeled in galaxy round the bowl waiting until the provost agreeably to his own proposal should mention the subject for which he had expressly introduced him to mr maxwell of summertrees  apparently the provost had forgot his promise or at least was in no great haste to fulfil it he debated with great earnestness upon the stamp act which was then impending over the american colonies and upon other political subjects of the day but said not a word of redgauntlet alan soon saw that the investigation he meditated must advance if at all on his own special motion and determined to proceed accordingly  acting upon this resolution he took the first opportunity afforded by a pause in the discussion of colonial politics to say i must remind you provost crosbie of your kind promise to procure some intelligence upon the subject i am so anxious about  gadso said the provost after a moments hesitation it is very truemr maxwell we wish to consult you on a piece of important business you must know indeed i think you must have heard that the fishermen at brokenburn and higher up the solway have made a raid upon quaker geddess stakenets and levelled all with the sands  in troth i heard it provost and i was glad to hear the scoundrels had so much pluck left as to right themselves against a fashion which would make the upper heritors a sort of clockinghens to hatch the fish that folk below them were to catch and eat  well sir said alan that is not the present point but a young friend of mine was with mr geddes at the time this violent procedure took place and he has not since been heard of now our friend the provost thinks that you may be able to advise  here he was interrupted by the provost and summertrees speaking out both at once the first endeavouring to disclaim all interest in the question and the last to evade giving an answer  me think said the provost i never thought twice about it mr fairford it was neither fish nor flesh nor salt herring of mine  and i able to advise said mr maxwell of summertrees what the devil can i advise you to do excepting to send the bellman through the town to cry your lost sheep as they do spaniel dogs or stray ponies  with your pardon said alan calmly but resolutely i must ask a more serious answer  why mr advocate answered summertrees i thought it was your business to give advice to the lieges and not to take it from poor stupid country gentlemen  if not exactly advice it is sometimes our duty to ask questions mr maxwell  aye sir when you have your bagwig and your gown on we must allow you the usual privilege of both gown and petticoat to ask what questions you please but when you are out of your canonicals the case is altered how come you sir to suppose that i have any business with this riotous proceeding or should know more than you do what happened there the question proceeds on an uncivil supposition  i will explain said alan determined to give mr maxwell no opportunity of breaking off the conversation you are an intimate of mr redgauntlethe is accused of having been engaged in this affray and of having placed under forcible restraint the person of my friend darsie latimer a young man of property and consequence whose fate i am here for the express purpose of investigating this is the plain state of the case and all parties concernedyour friend in particularwill have reason to be thankful for the temperate manner in which it is my purpose to conduct the matter if i am treated with proportionate frankness  you have misunderstood me said maxwell with a tone changed to more composure i told you i was the friend of the late sir henry redgauntlet who was executed in 1745 at hairibie near carlisle but i know no one who at present bears the name of redgauntlet  you know mr herries of birrenswork said alan smiling to whom the name of redgauntlet belongs  maxwell darted a keen reproachful look towards the provost but instantly smoothed his brow and changed his tone to that of confidence and candour  you must not be angry mr fairford that the poor persecuted nonjurors are a little upon the qui vive when such clever young men as you are making inquiries after us i myself now though i am quite out of the scrape and may cock my hat at the cross as i best like sunshine or moonshine have been yet so much accustomed to walk with the lap of my cloak cast over my face that faith if a redcoat walk suddenly up to me i wish for my wheel and whetstone again for a moment now redgauntlet poor fellow is far worse offhe is you may have heard still under the lash of the lawthe mark of the beast is still on his forehead poor gentlemanand that makes us cautiousvery cautious which i am sure there is no occasion to be towards you as no one of your appearance and manners would wish to trepan a gentleman under misfortune  on the contrary sir said fairford i wish to afford mr redgauntlets friends an opportunity to get him out of the scrape by procuring the instant liberation of my friend darsie latimer i will engage that if he has sustained no greater bodily harm than a short confinement the matter may be passed over quietly without inquiry but to attain this end so desirable for the man who has committed a great and recent infraction of the laws which he had before grievously offended very speedy reparation of the wrong must be rendered  maxwell seemed lost in reflection and exchanged a glance or two not of the most comfortable or congratulatory kind with his host the provost fairford rose and walked about the room to allow them an opportunity of conversing together for he was in hopes that the impression he had visibly made upon summertrees was likely to ripen into something favourable to his purpose they took the opportunity and engaged in whispers to each other eagerly and reproachfully on the part of the laird while the provost answered in an embarrassed and apologetical tone some broken words of the conversation reached fairford whose presence they seemed to forget as he stood at the bottom of the room apparently intent upon examining the figures upon a fine indian screen a present to the provost from his brother captain of a vessel in the companys service what he overheard made it evident that his errand and the obstinacy with which he pursued it occasioned altercation between the whisperers  maxwell at length let out the words a good fright and so send him home with his tail scalded like a dog that has come aprivateering on strange premises  the provosts negative was strongly interposednot to be thought ofmaking bad worsemy situationmy utilityyou cannot conceive how obstinatejust like his father  they then whispered more closely and at length the provost raised his drooping crest and spoke in a cheerful tone come sit down to your glass mr fairford we have laid our heads thegither and you shall see it will not be our fault if you are not quite pleased and mr darsie latimer let loose to take his fiddle under his neck again but summertrees thinks it will require you to put yourself into some bodily risk which maybe you may not be so keen of  gentlemen said fairford i will not certainly shun any risk by which my object may be accomplished but i bind it on your conscienceson yours mr maxwell as a man of honour and a gentleman and on yours provost as a magistrate and a loyal subject that you do not mislead me in this matter  nay as for me said summertrees i will tell you the truth at once and fairly own that i can certainly find you the means of seeing redgauntlet poor man and that i will do if you require it and conjure him also to treat you as your errand requires but poor redgauntlet is much changedindeed to say truth his temper never was the best in the world however i will warrant you from any very great danger  i will warrant myself from such said fairford by carrying a proper force with me  indeed said summertrees you will do no such thing for in the first place do you think that we will deliver up the poor fellow into the hands of the philistines when on the contrary my only reason for furnishing you with the clue i am to put into your hands is to settle the matter amicably on all sides and secondly his intelligence is so good that were you coming near him with soldiers or constables or the like i shall answer for it you will never lay salt on his tail  fairford mused for a moment he considered that to gain sight of this man and knowledge of his friends condition were advantages to be purchased at every personal risk and he saw plainly that were he to take the course most safe for himself and call in the assistance of the law it was clear he would either be deprived of the intelligence necessary to guide him or that redgauntlet would be apprised of his danger and might probably leave the country carrying his captive along with him he therefore repeated i put myself on your honour mr maxwell and i will go alone to visit your friend i have little doubt i shall find him amenable to reason and that i shall receive from him a satisfactory account of mr latimer  i have little doubt that you will said mr maxwell of summertrees but still i think it will be only in the long run and after having sustained some delay and inconvenience my warrandice goes no further  i will take it as it is given said alan fairford but let me ask would it not be better since you value your friends safety so highly and surely would not willingly compromise mine that the provost or you should go with me to this man if he is within any reasonable distance and try to make him hear reason  mei will not go my foots length said the provost and that mr alan you may be well assured of mr redgauntlet is my wifes fourth cousin that is undeniable but were he the last of her kin and mine both it would ill befit my office to be communing with rebels  aye or drinking with nonjurors said maxwell filling his glass i would as soon expect to have met claverhouse at a fieldpreaching and as for myself mr fairford i cannot go for just the opposite reason it would be infra dig in the provost of this most flourishing and loyal town to associate with redgauntlet and for me it would be noscitur a socio there would be post to london with the tidings that two such jacobites as redgauntlet and i had met on a braesidethe habeas corpus would be suspendedfame would sound a charge from carlisle to the lands endand who knows but the very wind of the rumour might blow my estate from between my fingers and my body over errickstanebrae again no no bide a gliffi will go into the provosts closet and write a letter to redgauntlet and direct you how to deliver it  there is pen and ink in the office said the provost pointing to the door of an inner apartment in which he had his walnuttree desk and eastcountry cabinet  a pen that can write i hope said the old laird  it can write and spell baith in right hands answered the provost as the laird retired and shut the door behind him     chapter xii  narrative of alan fairford continued  the room was no sooner deprived of mr maxwell of summertreess presence than the provost looked very warily above beneath and around the apartment hitched his chair towards that of his remaining guest and began to speak in a whisper which could not have startled the smallest mouse that creeps on floor  mr fairford said he you are a good lad and what is more you are my auld friend your fathers son your father has been agent for this burgh for years and has a good deal to say with the council so there have been a sort of obligations between him and me it may have been now on this side and now on that but obligations there have been i am but a plain man mr fairford but i hope you understand me  i believe you mean me well provost and i am sure replied fairford you can never better show your kindness than on this occasion  thats itthats the very point i would be at mr alan replied the provost besides i am as becomes well my situation a stanch friend to kirk and king meaning this present establishment in church and state and so as i was saying you may command my bestadvice  i hope for your assistance and cooperation also said the youth  certainly certainly said the wary magistrate well now you see one may love the kirk and yet not ride on the rigging of it and one may love the king and yet not be cramming him eternally down the throat of the unhappy folk that may chance to like another king better i have friends and connexions among them mr fairford as your father may have clientsthey are flesh and blood like ourselves these poor jacobite bodiessons of adam and eve after all and thereforei hope you understand mei am a plainspoken man  i am afraid i do not quite understand you said fairford and if you have anything to say to me in private my dear provost you had better come quickly out with it for the laird of summertrees must finish his letter in a minute or two  not a bit manpate is a langheaded fellow but his pen does not clear the paper as his greyhound does the tinwaldfurs i gave him a wipe about that if you noticed i can say anything to pateinperilindeed he is my wifes near kinsman  but your advice provost said alan who perceived that like a shy horse the worthy magistrate always started off from his own purpose just when he seemed approaching to it  weel you shall have it in plain terms for i am a plain man ye see we will suppose that any friend like yourself were in the deepest hole of the nith sand making a sprattle for your life now you see such being the case i have little chance of helping you being a fat shortarmed man and no swimmer and what would be the use of my jumping in after you  i understand you i think said alan fairford you think that darsie latimer is in danger of his life  mei think nothing about it mr alan but if he were as i trust he is not he is nae draps blood akin to you mr alan  but here your friend summertrees said the young lawyer offers me a letter to this redgauntlet of yourswhat say you to that  me ejaculated the provost me mr alan i say neither buff nor stye to itbut ye dinna ken what it is to look a redgauntlet in the facebetter try my wife who is but a fourth cousin before ye venture on the laird himselfjust say something about the revolution and see what a look she can gie you  i shall leave you to stand all the shots from that battery provost replied fairford but speak out like a mando you think summertrees means fairly by me  fairlyhe is just comingfairly i am a plain man mr fairfordbut ye said fairly  i do so replied alan and it is of importance to me to know and to you to tell me if such is the case for if you do not you may be an accomplice to murder before the fact and that under circumstances which may bring it near to murder under trust  murderwho spoke of murder said the provost no danger of that mr alanonly if i were youto speak my plain mindhere he approached his mouth to the ear of the young lawyer and after another acute pang of travail was safely delivered of his advice in the following abrupt wordstake a keek into pates letter before ye deliver it  fairford started looked the provost hard in the face and was silent while mr crosbie with the selfapprobation of one who has at length brought himself to the discharge of a great duty at the expense of a considerable sacrifice nodded and winked to alan as if enforcing his advice and then swallowing a large glass of punch concluded with the sigh of a man released from a heavy burden i am a plain man mr fairford  a plain man said maxwell who entered the room at that moment with the letter in his handprovost i never heard you make use of the word but when you had some sly turn of your own to work out  the provost looked silly enough and the laird of summertrees directed a keen and suspicious glance upon alan fairford who sustained it with professional intrepiditythere was a moments pause  i was trying said the provost to dissuade our young friend from his wildgoose expedition  and i said fairford am determined to go through with it trusting myself to you mr maxwell i conceive that i rely as i before said on the word of a gentleman  i will warrant you said maxwell from all serious consequencessome inconveniences you must look to suffer  to these i shall be resigned said fairford and stand prepared to run my risk  well then said summertrees you must go  i will leave you to yourselves gentlemen said the provost rising when you have done with your crack you will find me at my wifes teatable  and a more accomplished old woman never drank catlap said maxwell as he shut the door the last word has him speak it who willand yet because he is a whillywhaw body and has a plausible tongue of his own and is well enough connected and especially because nobody could ever find out whether he is whig or tory this is the third time they have made him provostbut to the matter in hand this letter mr fairford putting a sealed one into his hand is addressed you observe to mr hof b and contains your credentials for that gentlemen who is also known by his family name of redgauntlet but less frequently addressed by it because it is mentioned something invidiously in a certain act of parliament i have little doubt he will assure you of your friends safety and in a short time place him at freedomthat is supposing him under present restraint but the point is to discover where he isand before you are made acquainted with this necessary part of the business you must give me your assurance of honour that you will acquaint no one either by word or letter with the expedition which you now propose to yourself  how sir answered alan can you expect that i will not take the precaution of informing some person of the route i am about to take that in case of accident it may be known where i am and with what purpose i have gone thither  and can you expect answered maxwell in the same tone that i am to place my friends safety not merely in your hands but in those of any person you may choose to confide in and who may use the knowledge to his destruction nanai have pledged my word for your safety and you must give me yours to be private in the mattergiffgaff you know  alan fairford could not help thinking that this obligation to secrecy gave a new and suspicious colouring to the whole transaction but considering that his friends release might depend upon his accepting the condition he gave it in the terms proposed and with the purpose of abiding by it  and now sir he said whither am i to proceed with this letter is mr herries at brokenburn  he is not i do not think he will come thither again until the business of the stakenets be hushed up nor would i advise him to do sothe quakers with all their demureness can bear malice as long as other folk and though i have not the prudence of mr provost who refuses to ken where his friends are concealed during adversity lest perchance he should be asked to contribute to their relief yet i do not think it necessary or prudent to inquire into redgauntlets wanderings poor man but wish to remain at perfect freedom to answer if asked at that i ken nothing of the matter you must then go to old tom trumbulls at annantam turnpenny as they call himand he is sure either to know where redgauntlet is himself or to find some one who can give a shrewd guess but you must attend that old turnpenny will answer no question on such a subject without you give him the passport which at present you must do by asking him the age of the moon if he answers not light enough to land a cargo you are to answer then plague on aberdeen almanacks and upon that he will hold free intercourse with you and now i would advise you to lose no time for the parole is often changedand take care of yourself among these moonlight lads for laws and lawyers do not stand very high in their favour  i will set out this instant said the young barrister i will but bid the provost and mrs crosbie farewell and then get on horseback so soon as the ostler of the george inn can saddle himas for the smugglers i am neither gauger nor supervisor and like the man who met the devil if they have nothing to say to me i have nothing to say to them  you are a mettled young man said summertrees evidently with increasing goodwill on observing an alertness and contempt of danger which perhaps he did not expect from alans appearance and professiona very mettled young fellow indeed and it is almost a pityhere he stopped abort  what is a pity said fairford  it is almost a pity that i cannot go with you myself or at least send a trusty guide  they walked together to the bedchamber of mrs crosbie for it was in that asylum that the ladies of the period dispensed their tea when the parlour was occupied by the punchbowl  you have been good bairns tonight gentlemen said mrs crosbie i am afraid summertrees that the provost has given you a bad browst you are not used to quit the leeside of the punchbowl in such a hurry i say nothing to you mr fairford for you are too young a man yet for stoup and bicker but i hope you will not tell the edinburgh fine folk that the provost has scrimped you of your cogie as the sang says  i am much obliged for the provosts kindness and yours madam replied alan but the truth is i have still a long ride before me this evening and the sooner i am on horseback the better  this evening said the provost anxiously had you not better take daylight with you tomorrow morning  mr fairford will ride as well in the cool of the evening said summertrees taking the word out of alans mouth  the provost said no more nor did his wife ask any questions nor testify any surprise at the suddenness of their guests departure  having drunk tea alan fairford took leave with the usual ceremony the laird of summertrees seemed studious to prevent any further communication between him and the provost and remained lounging on the landingplace of the stair while they made their adieusheard the provost ask if alan proposed a speedy return and the latter reply that his stay was uncertain and witnessed the parting shake of the hand which with a pressure more warm than usual and a tremulous god bless and prosper you mr crosbie bestowed on his young friend maxwell even strolled with fairford as far as the george although resisting all his attempts at further inquiry into the affairs of redgauntlet and referring him to tom trumbull alias turnpenny for the particulars which he might find it necessary to inquire into  at length alans hack was producedan animal long in neck and high in bone accoutred with a pair of saddlebags containing the riders travelling wardrobe proudly surmounting his small stock of necessaries and no way ashamed of a mode of travelling which a modern mr silvertongue would consider as the last of degradations alan fairford took leave of the old jacobite pateinperil and set forward on the road to the loyal burgh of annan his reflections during his ride were none of the most pleasant he could not disguise from himself that he was venturing rather too rashly into the power of outlawed and desperate persons for with such only a man in the situation of redgauntlet could be supposed to associate there were other grounds for apprehension several marks of intelligence betwixt mrs crosbie and the laird of summertrees had not escaped alans acute observation and it was plain that the provosts inclinations towards him which he believed to be sincere and good were not firm enough to withstand the influence of this league between his wife and friend the provosts adieus like macbeths amen had stuck in his throat and seemed to intimate that he apprehended more than he dared give utterance to  laying all these matters together alan thought with no little anxiety on the celebrated lines of shakespeare                                     a drop   that in the ocean seeks another drop c  but pertinacity was a strong feature in the young lawyers character he was and always had been totally unlike the horse hot at hand who tires before noon through his own over eager exertions in the beginning of the day on the contrary his first efforts seemed frequently inadequate to accomplishing his purpose whatever that for the time might be and it was only as the difficulties of the task increased that his mind seemed to acquire the energy necessary to combat and subdue them if therefore he went anxiously forward upon his uncertain and perilous expedition the reader must acquit him of all idea even in a passing thought of the possibility of abandoning his search and resigning darsie latimer to his destiny  a couple of hours riding brought him to the little town of annan situated on the shores of the solway between eight and nine oclock the sun had set but the day was not yet ended and when he had alighted and seen his horse properly cared for at the principal inn of the place he was readily directed to mr maxwells friend old tom trumbull with whom everybody seemed well acquainted he endeavoured to fish out from the lad that acted as a guide something of this mans situation and profession but the general expressions of a very decent mana very honest bodyweel to pass in the world and such like were all that could be extracted from him and while fairford was following up the investigation with closer interrogatories the lad put an end to them by knocking at the door of mr trumbull whose decent dwelling was a little distance from the town and considerably nearer to the sea it was one of a little row of houses running down to the waterside and having gardens and other accommodations behind there was heard within the uplifting of a scottish psalm and the boy saying they are at exercise sir gave intimation they might not be admitted till prayers were over  when however fairford repeated the summons with the end of his whip the singing ceased and mr trumbull himself with his psalmbook in his hand kept open by the insertion of his forefinger between the leaves came to demand the meaning of this unseasonable interruption  nothing could be more different than his whole appearance seemed to be from the confidant of a desperate man and the associate of outlaws in their unlawful enterprises he was a tall thin bony figure with white hair combed straight down on each side of his face and an irongrey hue of complexion where the lines or rather as quin said of macklin the cordage of his countenance were so sternly adapted to a devotional and even ascetic expression that they left no room for any indication of reckless daring or sly dissimulation in short trumbull appeared a perfect specimen of the rigid old covenanter who said only what he thought right acted on no other principle but that of duty and if he committed errors did so under the full impression that he was serving god rather than man  do you want me sir he said to fairford whose guide had slunk to the rear as if to escape the rebuke of the severe old manwe were engaged and it is the saturday night  alan fairfords preconceptions were so much deranged by this mans appearance and manner that he stood for a moment bewildered and would as soon have thought of giving a cant password to a clergyman descending from the pulpit as to the respectable father of a family just interrupted in his prayers for and with the objects of his care hastily concluding mr maxwell had passed some idle jest on him or rather that he had mistaken the person to whom he was directed he asked if he spoke to mr trumbull  to thomas trumbull answered the old manwhat may be your business sir and he glanced his eye to the book he held in his hand with a sigh like that of a saint desirous of dissolution  do you know mr maxwell of summertrees said fairford  i have heard of such a gentleman in the countryside but have no acquaintance with him answered mr trumbull he is as i have heard a papist for the whore that sitteth on the seven hills ceaseth not yet to pour forth the cup of her abomination on these parts  yet he directed me hither my good friend said alan is there another of your name in this town of annan  none replied mr trumbull since my worthy father was removed he was indeed a shining lighti wish you good even sir  stay one single instant said fairford this is a matter of life and death  not more than the casting the burden of our sins where they should be laid said thomas trumbull about to shut the door in the inquirers face  do you know said alan fairford the laird of redgauntlet  now heaven defend me from treason and rebellion exclaimed trumbull young gentleman you are importunate i live here among my own people and do not consort with jacobites and massmongers  he seemed about to shut the door but did not shut it a circumstance which did not escape alans notice  mr redgauntlet is sometimes he said called herries of birrenswork perhaps you may know him under that name  friend you are uncivil answered mr trumbull honest men have enough to do to keep one name undefiled i ken nothing about those who have two good even to you friend  he was now about to slam the door in his visitors face without further ceremony when alan who had observed symptoms that the name of redgauntlet did not seem altogether so indifferent to him as he pretended arrested his purpose by saying in a low voice at least you can tell me what age the moon is  the old man started as if from a trance and before answering surveyed the querist with a keen penetrating glance which seemed to say are you really in possession of this key to my confidence or do you speak from mere accident  to this keen look of scrutiny fairford replied by a smile of intelligence  the iron muscles of the old mans face did not however relax as he dropped in a careless manner the countersign not light enough to land a cargo  then plague of all aberdeen almanacks  and plague of all fools that waste time said thomas trumbull could you not have said as much at first and standing wasting time and encouraging lookerson in the open street too come in byin by  he drew his visitor into the dark entrance of the house and shut the door carefully then putting his head into an apartment which the murmurs within announced to be filled with the family he said aloud a work of necessity and mercymalachi take the bookyou will sing six double verses of the hundred and nineteenand you may lecture out of the lamentations and malachithis he said in an undertonesee you give them a a creed of doctrine that will last them till i come back or else these inconsiderate lads will be out of the house and away to the publics wasting their precious time and it may be putting themselves in the way of missing the morning tide  an inarticulate answer from within intimated malachis acquiescence in the commands imposed and mr trumbull shutting the door muttered something about fast bind fast find turned the key and put it into his pocket and then bidding his visitor have a care of his steps and make no noise he led him through the house and out at a backdoor into a little garden here a plaited alley conducted them without the possibility of their being seen by any neighbour to a door in the gardenwall which being opened proved to be a private entrance into a threestalled stable in one of which was a horse that whinnied on their entrance hush hush cried the old man and presently seconded his exhortations to silence by throwing a handful of corn into the manger and the horse soon converted his acknowledgement of their presence into the usual sound of munching and grinding his provender  as the light was now failing fast the old man with much more alertness than might have been expected from the rigidity of his figure closed the windowshutters in an instant produced phosphorus and matches and lighted a stablelantern which he placed on the cornbin and then addressed fairford we are private here young man and as some time has been wasted already you will be so kind as to tell me what is your errand is it about the way of business or the other job  my business with you mr trumbull is to request you will find me the means of delivering this letter from mr maxwell of summertrees to the laird of redgauntlet  humphfashious job pate maxwell will still be the auld manalways pateinperilcraiginperil for what i know let me see the letter from him  he examined it with much care turning it up and down and looking at the seal very attentively alls right i see it has the private mark for haste and speed i bless my maker that i am no great man or great mans fellow and so i think no more of these passages than just to help them forward in the way of business you are an utter stranger in these parts i warrant  fairford answered in the affirmative  ayei never saw them make a wiser choicei must call some one to direct you what to dostay we must go to him i believe you are well recommended to me friend and doubtless trusty otherwise you may see more than i would like to show or am in the use of showing in the common line of business  saying this he placed his lantern on the ground beside the post of one of the empty stalls drew up a small spring bolt which secured it to the floor and then forcing the post to one side discovered a small trapdoor follow me he said and dived into the subterranean descent to which this secret aperture gave access  fairford plunged after him not without apprehensions of more kinds than one but still resolved to prosecute the adventure  the descent which was not above six feet led to a very narrow passage which seemed to have been constructed for the precise purpose of excluding every one who chanced to be an inch more in girth than was his conductor a small vaulted room of about eight feet square received them at the end of this lane here mr trumbull left fairford alone and returned for an instant as he said to shut his concealed trapdoor  fairford liked not his departure as it left him in utter darkness besides that his breathing was much affected by a strong and stifling smell of spirits and other articles of a savour more powerful than agreeable to the lungs he was very glad therefore when he heard the returning steps of mr trumbull who when once more by his side opened a strong though narrow door in the wall and conveyed fairford into an immense magazine of spiritcasks and other articles of contraband trade  there was a small light at the end of this range of wellstocked subterranean vaults which upon a low whistle began to flicker and move towards them an undefined figure holding a dark lantern with the light averted approached them whom mr trumbull thus addressedwhy were you not at worship job and this saturday at een  swanston was loading the jenny sir and i stayed to serve out the article  truea work of necessity and in the way of business does the jumping jenny sail this tide  aye aye sir she sails for  i did not ask you where she sailed for job said the old gentleman interrupting him i thank my maker i know nothing of their incomings or outgoings i sell my article fairly and in the ordinary way of business and i wash my hands of everything else but what i wished to know is whether the gentleman called the laird of the solway lakes is on the other side of the border even now  aye aye said job the laird is something in my own line you knowa little contraband or so there is a statute for himbut no matter he took the sands after the splore at the quakers fishtraps yonder for he has a leal heart the laird and is always true to the countryside but avastis all snug here  so saying he suddenly turned on alan fairford the light side of the lantern he carried who by the transient gleam which it threw in passing on the man who bore it saw a huge figure upwards of six feet high with a rough hairy cap on his head and a set of features corresponding to his bulky frame he thought also he observed pistols at his belt  i will answer for this gentleman said mr trumbull he must be brought to speech of the laird  that will be kittle steering said the subordinate personage for i understood that the laird and his folk were no sooner on the other side than the landsharks were on them and some mounted lobsters from carlisle and so they were obliged to split and squander there are new brooms out to sweep the country of them they say for the brush was a hard one and they say there was a lad drownedhe was not one of the lairds gang so there was the less matter  peace prithee peace job rutledge said honest pacific mr trumbull i wish thou couldst remember man that i desire to know nothing of your roars and splores your brooms and brushes i dwell here among my own people and i sell my commodity to him who comes in the way of business and so wash my hands of all consequences as becomes a quiet subject and an honest man i never take payment save in ready money  aye aye muttered he with the lantern your worship mr trumbull understands that in the way of business  well i hope you will one day know job answered mr trumbullthe comfort of a conscience void of offence and that fears neither gauger nor collector neither excise nor customs the business is to pass this gentleman to cumberland upon earnest business and to procure him speech with the laird of the solway lakesi suppose that can be done now i think nanty ewart if he sails with the brig this morning tide is the man to set him forward  aye aye truly is he said job never man knew the border dale and fell pasture and ploughland better than nanty and he can always bring him to the laird too if you are sure the gentlemans right but indeed thats his own lookout for were he the best man in scotland and the chairman of the dd board to boot and had fifty men at his back he were as well not visit the laird for anything but good as for nanty he is word and blow a dd deal fiercer than cristie nixon that they keep such a din about i have seen them both tried by  fairford now found himself called upon to say something yet his feelings upon finding himself thus completely in the power of a canting hypocrite and of his retainer who had so much the air of a determined ruffian joined to the strong and abominable fume which they snuffed up with indifference while it almost deprived him of respiration combined to render utterance difficult he stated however that he had no evil intentions towards the laird as they called him but was only the bearer of a letter to him on particular business from mr maxwell of summertrees  aye aye said job that may be well enough and if mr trumbull is satisfied that the service is right why we will give you a cast in the jumping jenny this tide and nanty ewart will put you on a way of finding the laird i warrant you  i may for the present return i presume to the inn where i left my horse said fairford  with pardon replied mr trumbull you have been ower far ben with us for that but job will take you to a place where you may sleep rough till he calls you i will bring you what little baggage you can needfor those who go on such errands must not be dainty i will myself see after your horse for a merciful man is merciful to his beasta matter too often forgotten in our way of business  why master trumbull replied job you know that when we are chased its no time to shorten sail and so the boys do ride whip and spur he stopped in his speech observing the old man had vanished through the door by which he had enteredthats always the way with old turnpenny he said to fairford he cares for nothing of the trade but the profitnow dme if i dont think the fun of it is better worth while but come along my fine chap i must stow you away in safety until it is time to go aboard    chapter xiii  narrative of alan fairford continued  fairford followed his gruff guide among a labyrinth of barrels and puncheons on which he had more than once like to have broken his nose and from thence into what by the glimpse of the passing lantern upon a desk and writing materials seemed to be a small office for the dispatch of business here there appeared no exit but the smuggler or smugglers ally availing himself of a ladder removed an old picture which showed a door about seven feet from the ground and fairford still following job was involved in another tortuous and dark passage which involuntarily reminded him of peter peebless lawsuit at the end of this labyrinth when he had little guess where he had been conducted and was according to the french phrase totally desoriente job suddenly set down the lantern and availing himself of the flame to light two candles which stood on the table asked if alan would choose anything to eat recommending at all events a slug of brandy to keep out the night air fairford declined both but inquired after his baggage  the old master will take care of that himself said job rutledge and drawing back in the direction in which he had entered he vanished from the farther end of the apartment by a mode which the candles still shedding an imperfect light gave alan no means of ascertaining thus the adventurous young lawyer was left alone in the apartment to which he had been conducted by so singular a passage  in this condition it was alans first employment to survey with some accuracy the place where he was and accordingly having trimmed the lights he walked slowly round the apartment examining its appearance and dimensions it seemed to be such a small diningparlour as is usually found in the house of the better class of artisans shopkeepers and such persons having a recess at the upper end and the usual furniture of an ordinary description he found a door which he endeavoured to open but it was locked on the outside a corresponding door on the same side of the apartment admitted him into a closet upon the front shelves of which were punchbowls glasses teacups and the like while on one side was hung a horsemans greatcoat of the coarsest materials with two great horsepistols peeping out of the pocket and on the floor stood a pair of wellspattered jackboots the usual equipment of the time at least for long journeys  not greatly liking the contents of the closet alan fairford shut the door and resumed his scrutiny round the walls of the apartment in order to discover the mode of job rutledges retreat the secret passage was however too artificially concealed and the young lawyer had nothing better to do than to meditate on the singularity of his present situation he had long known that the excise laws had occasioned an active contraband trade betwixt scotland and england which then as now existed and will continue to exist until the utter abolition of the wretched system which establishes an inequality of duties betwixt the different parts of the same kingdom a system be it said in passing mightily resembling the conduct of a pugilist who should tie up one arm that he might fight the better with the other but fairford was unprepared for the expensive and regular establishments by which the illicit traffic was carried on and could not have conceived that the capital employed in it should have been adequate to the erection of these extensive buildings with all their contrivances for secrecy of communication he was musing on these circumstances not without some anxiety for the progress of his own journey when suddenly as he lifted his eyes he discovered old mr trumbull at the upper end of the apartment bearing in one hand a small bundle in the other his dark lantern the light of which as he advanced he directed full upon fairfords countenance  though such an apparition was exactly what he expected yet he did not see the grim stern old man present himself thus suddenly without emotion especially when he recollected what to a youth of his pious education was peculiarly shocking that the grizzled hypocrite was probably that instant arisen from his knees to heaven for the purpose of engaging in the mysterious transactions of a desperate and illegal trade  the old man accustomed to judge with ready sharpness of the physiognomy of those with whom he had business did not fail to remark something like agitation in fairfords demeanour have ye taken the rue said he will ye take the sheaf from the mare and give up the venture  never said fairford firmly stimulated at once by his natural spirit and the recollection of his friend never while i have life and strength to follow it out  i have brought you said trumbull a clean shirt and some stockings which is all the baggage you can conveniently carry and i will cause one of the lads lend you a horsemans coat for it is ill sailing or riding without one and touching your valise it will be as safe in my poor house were it full of the gold of ophir as if it were in the depth of the mine i have no doubt of it said fairford  and now said trumbull again i pray you to tell me by what name i am to name you to nanty which is antony ewart  by the name of alan fairford answered the young lawyer  but that said mr trumbull in reply is your own proper name and surname  and what other should i give said the young man do you think i have any occasion for an alias and besides mr trumbull added alan thinking a little raillery might intimate confidence of spirit you blessed yourself but a little while since that you had no acquaintance with those who defiled their names so far as to be obliged to change them  true very true said mr trumbull nevertheless young man my grey hairs stand unreproved in this matter for in my line of business when i sit under my vine and my figtree exchanging the strong waters of the north for the gold which is the price thereof i have i thank heaven no disguises to keep with any man and wear my own name of thomas trumbull without any chance that the same may be polluted whereas thou who art to journey in miry ways and amongst a strange people mayst do well to have two names as thou hast two shirts the one to keep the other clean  here he emitted a chuckling grunt which lasted for two vibrations of the pendulum exactly and was the only approach towards laughter in which old turnpenny as he was nicknamed was ever known to indulge  you are witty mr trumbull said fairford but jests are no argumentsi shall keep my own name  at your own pleasure said the merchant there is but one name which c c c  we will not follow the hypocrite through the impious cant which he added in order to close the subject  alan followed him in silent abhorrence to the recess in which the beaufet was placed and which was so artificially made as to conceal another of those traps with which the whole building abounded this concealment admitted them to the same winding passage by which the young lawyer had been brought thither the path which they now took amid these mazes differed from the direction in which he had been guided by rutledge it led upwards and terminated beneath a garret window trumbull opened it and with more agility than his age promised clambered out upon the leads if fairfords journey had been hitherto in a stifled and subterranean atmosphere it was now open lofty and airy enough for he had to follow his guide over leads and slates which the old smuggler traversed with the dexterity of a cat it is true his course was facilitated by knowing exactly where certain steppingplaces and holdfasts were placed of which fairford could not so readily avail himself but after a difficult and somewhat perilous progress along the roofs of two or three houses they at length descended by a skylight into a garret room and from thence by the stairs into a publichouse for such it appeared by the ringing of bells whistling for waiters and attendance bawling of house house here chorus of sea songs and the like noises  having descended to the second story and entered a room there in which there was a light old mr trumbull rang the bell of the apartment thrice with an interval betwixt each during which he told deliberately the number twenty immediately after the third ringing the landlord appeared with stealthy step and an appearance of mystery on his buxom visage he greeted mr trumbull who was his landlord as it proved with great respect and expressed some surprise at seeing him so late as he termed it on saturday een  and i robin hastie said the landlord to the tenant am more surprised than pleased to hear sae muckle din in your house robie so near the honourable sabbath and i must mind you that it is contravening the terms of your tack whilk stipulates that you should shut your public on saturday at nine oclock at latest  yes sir said robin hastie no way alarmed at the gravity of the rebuke but you must take tent that i have admitted naebody but you mr trumbull who by the way admitted yoursell since nine oclock for the most of the folk have been here for several hours about the lading and so on of the brig it is not full tide yet and i cannot put the men out into the street if i did they would go to some other public and their souls would be nane the better and my purse muckle the waur for how am i to pay the rent if i do not sell the liquor  nay then said thomas trumbull if it is a work of necessity and in the honest independent way of business no doubt there is balm in gilead but prithee robin wilt thou see if nanty ewart be as is most likely amongst these unhappy topers and if so let him step this way cannily and speak to me and this young gentleman and its dry talking robinyou must minister to us a bowl of punchye ken my gage  from a mutchkin to a gallon i ken your honours taste mr thomas trumbull said mine host and ye shall hang me over the signpost if there be a drap mair lemon or a curn less sugar than just suits you there are three of youyou will be for the auld scots peremptory pintstoup for the success of the voyage the scottish pint of liquid measure comprehends four english measures of the same denomination the jest is well known of my poor countryman who driven to extremity by the raillery of the southern on the small denomination of the scottish coin at length answered aye aye but the deil tak them that has the least pintstoup  better pray for it than drink for it robin said mr trumbull yours is a dangerous trade robin it hurts mony a anebaith host and guest but ye will get the blue bowl robinthe blue bowlthat will sloken all their drouth and prevent the sinful repetition of whipping for an eke of a saturday at een aye robin it is a pity of nanty ewartnanty likes the turning up of his little finger unco weel and we maunna stint him robin so as we leave him sense to steer by  nanty ewart could steer through the pentland firth though he were as drunk as the baltic ocean said robin hastie and instantly tripping downstairs he speedily returned with the materials for what he called his browst which consisted of two english quarts of spirits in a huge blue bowl with all the ingredients for punch in the same formidable proportion at the same time he introduced mr antony or nanty ewart whose person although he was a good deal flustered with liquor was different from what fairford expected his dress was what is emphatically termed the shabby genteela frock with tarnished lacea small cocked hat ornamented in a similar waya scarlet waistcoat with faded embroidery breeches of the same with silver kneebands and he wore a smart hanger and a pair of pistols in a sullied swordbelt  here i come patron he said shaking hands with mr trumbull well i see you have got some grog aboard  it is not my custom mr ewart said the old gentleman as you well know to become a chamberer or carouser thus late on saturday at een but i wanted to recommend to your attention a young friend of ours that is going upon a something particular journey with a letter to our friend the laird from pateinperil as they call him  ayeindeedhe must be in high trust for so young a gentleman i wish you joy sir bowing to fairford byr lady as shakespeare says you are bringing up a neck for a fair end come patron we will drink to mr whatshallcallum what is his name did you tell me and have i forgot it already  mr alan fairford said trumbull  aye mr alan fairforda good name for a fair tradermr alan fairford and may he be long withheld from the topmost round of ambition which i take to be the highest round of a certain ladder  while he spoke he seized the punchladle and began to fill the glasses but mr trumbull arrested his hand until he had as he expressed himself sanctified the liquor by a long grace during the pronunciation of which he shut indeed his eyes but his nostrils became dilated as if he were snuffing up the fragrant beverage with peculiar complacency  when the grace was at length over the three friends sat down to their beverage and invited alan fairford to partake anxious about his situation and disgusted as he was with his company he craved and with difficulty obtained permission under the allegation of being fatigued heated and the like to stretch himself on a couch which was in the apartment and attempted at least to procure some rest before highwater when the vessel was to sail  he was at length permitted to use his freedom and stretched himself on the couch having his eyes for some time fixed on the jovial party he had left and straining his ears to catch if possible a little of their conversation this he soon found was to no purpose for what did actually reach his ears was disguised so completely by the use of cant words and the thieveslatin called slang that even when he caught the words he found himself as far as ever from the sense of their conversation at length he fell asleep  it was after alan had slumbered for three or four hours that he was wakened by voices bidding him rise up and prepare to be jogging he started up accordingly and found himself in presence of the same party of boon companions who had just dispatched their huge bowl of punch to alans surprise the liquor had made but little innovation on the brains of men who were accustomed to drink at all hours and in the most inordinate quantities the landlord indeed spoke a little thick and the texts of mr thomas trumbull stumbled on his tongue but nanty was one of those topers who becoming early what bon vivants term flustered remain whole nights and days at the same point of intoxication and in fact as they are seldom entirely sober can be as rarely seen absolutely drunk indeed fairford had he not known how ewart had been engaged whilst he himself was asleep would almost have sworn when he awoke that the man was more sober than when he first entered the room  he was confirmed in this opinion when they descended below where two or three sailors and ruffianlooking fellows awaited their commands ewart took the whole direction upon himself gave his orders with briefness and precision and looked to their being executed with the silence and celerity which that peculiar crisis required all were now dismissed for the brig which lay as fairford was given to understand a little farther down the river which is navigable for vessels of light burden till almost within a mile of the town  when they issued from the inn the landlord bid them goodbye old trumbull walked a little way with them but the air had probably considerable effect on the state of his brain for after reminding alan fairford that the next day was the honourable sabbath he became extremely excursive in an attempt to exhort him to keep it holy at length being perhaps sensible that he was becoming unintelligible he thrust a volume into fairfords handhiccuping at the same timegood bookgood bookfine hymnbookfit for the honourable sabbath whilk awaits us tomorrow morning here the iron tongue of time told five from the town steeple of annan to the further confusion of mr trumbulls already disordered ideas aye is sunday come and gone already heaven be praised only it is a marvel the afternoon is sae dark for the time of the yearsabbath has slipped ower quietly but we have reason to bless oursells it has not been altogether misemployed i heard little of the preachinga cauld moralist i doubt served that outbut ehthe prayeri mind it as if i had said the words mysell here he repeated one or two petitions which were probably a part of his family devotions before he was summoned forth to what he called the way of business i never remember a sabbath pass so cannily off in my life then he recollected himself a little and said to alan you may read that book mr fairford tomorrow all the same though it be monday for you see it was saturday when we were thegither and now its sunday and its dark nightso the sabbath has slipped clean away through our fingers like water through a sieve which abideth not and we have to begin again tomorrow morning in the weariful base mean earthly employments whilk are unworthy of an immortal spiritalways excepting the way of business  three of the fellows were now returning to the town and at ewarts command they cut short the patriarchs exhortation by leading him back to his own residence the rest of the party then proceeded to the brig which only waited their arrival to get under weigh and drop down the river nanty ewart betook himself to steering the brig and the very touch of the helm seemed to dispel the remaining influence of the liquor which he had drunk since through a troublesome and intricate channel he was able to direct the course of his little vessel with the most perfect accuracy and safety  alan fairford for some time availed himself of the clearness of the summer morning to gaze on the dimly seen shores betwixt which they glided becoming less and less distinct as they receded from each other until at length having adjusted his little bundle by way of pillow and wrapped around him the greatcoat with which old trumbull had equipped him he stretched himself on the deck to try to recover the slumber out of which he had been awakened sleep had scarce begun to settle on his eyes ere he found something stirring about his person with ready presence of mind he recollected his situation and resolved to show no alarm until the purpose of this became obvious but he was soon relieved from his anxiety by finding it was only the result of nantys attention to his comfort who was wrapping around him as softly as he could a great boatcloak in order to defend him from the morning air  thou art but a cockerel he muttered but twere pity thou wert knocked off the perch before seeing a little more of the sweet and sour of this worldthough faith if thou hast the usual luck of it the best way were to leave thee to the chance of a seasoning fever  these words and the awkward courtesy with which the skipper of the little brig tucked the seacoat round fairford gave him a confidence of safety which he had not yet thoroughly possessed he stretched himself in more security on the hard planks and was speedily asleep though his slumbers were feverish and unrefreshing  it has been elsewhere intimated that alan fairford inherited from his mother a delicate constitution with a tendency to consumption and being an only child with such a cause for apprehension care to the verge of effeminacy was taken to preserve him from damp beds wet feet and those various emergencies to which the caledonian boys of much higher birth but more active habits are generally accustomed in man the spirit sustains the constitutional weakness as in the winged tribes the feathers bear aloft the body but there is a bound to these supporting qualities and as the pinions of the bird must at length grow weary so the vis animi of the human struggler becomes broken down by continued fatigue  when the voyager was awakened by the light of the sun now riding high in heaven he found himself under the influence of an almost intolerable headache with heat thirst shooting across the back and loins and other symptoms intimating violent cold accompanied with fever the manner in which he had passed the preceding day and night though perhaps it might have been of little consequence to most young men was to him delicate in constitution and nurture attended with bad and even perilous consequences he felt this was the case yet would fain have combated the symptoms of indisposition which indeed he imputed chiefly to seasickness he sat up on deck and looked on the scene around as the little vessel having borne down the solway firth was beginning with a favourable northerly breeze to bear away to the southward crossing the entrance of the wampool river and preparing to double the most northerly point of cumberland  but fairford felt annoyed with deadly sickness as well as by pain of a distressing and oppressive character and neither criffel rising in majesty on the one hand nor the distant yet more picturesque outline of skiddaw and glaramara upon the other could attract his attention in the manner in which it was usually fixed by beautiful scenery and especially that which had in it something new as well as striking yet it was not in alan fairfords nature to give way to despondence even when seconded by pain he had recourse in the first place to his pocket but instead of the little sallust he had brought with him that the perusal of a classical author might help to pass away a heavy hour he pulled out the supposed hymnbook with which he had been presented a few hours before by that temperate and scrupulous person mr thomas trumbull alias turnpenny the volume was bound in sable and its exterior might have become a psalter but what was alans astonishment to read on the title page the following wordsmerry thoughts for merry men or mother midnights miscellany for the small hours and turning over the leaves he was disgusted with profligate tales and more profligate songs ornamented with figures corresponding in infamy with the letterpress  good god he thought and did this hoary reprobate summon his family together and with such a disgraceful pledge of infamy in his bosom venture to approach the throne of his creator it must be so the book is bound after the manner of those dedicated to devotional subjects and doubtless the wretch in his intoxication confounded the books he carried with him as he did the days of the week seized with the disgust with which the young and generous usually regard the vices of advanced life alan having turned the leaves of the book over in hasty disdain flung it from him as far as he could into the sea he then had recourse to the sallust which he had at first sought for in vain as he opened the book nanty ewart who had been looking over his shoulder made his own opinion heard  i think now brother if you are so much scandalized at a little piece of sculduddery which after all does nobody any harm you had better have given it to me than have flung it into the solway  i hope sir answered fairford civilly you are in the habit of reading better books  faith answered nanty with help of a little geneva text i could read my sallust as well as you can and snatching the book from alans hand he began to read in the scottish accentigitur ex divitiis juventutem luxuria atque avaritia cum superbili invasere rapere consumere sua parvi pendere aliena cupere pudorem amicitiam pudicitiam divina atque humana promiscua nihil pensi neque moderati habere the translation of the passage is thus given by sir henry steuart of allantonthe youth taught to look up to riches as the sovereign good became apt pupils in the school of luxury rapacity and profusion went hand in hand careless of their own fortunes and eager to possess those of others shame and remorse modesty and moderation every principle gave wayworks of sallust with original essays vol ii p17there is a slap in the face now for an honest fellow that has been buccaneering never could keep a groat of what he got or hold his fingers from what belonged to another said you fie fie friend crispus thy morals are as crabbed and austere as thy stylethe one has as little mercy as the other has grace by my soul it is unhandsome to make personal reflections on an old acquaintance who seeks a little civil intercourse with you after nigh twenty years separation on my soul master sallust deserves to float on the solway better than mother midnight herself  perhaps in some respects he may merit better usage at our hands said alan for if he has described vice plainly it seems to have been for the purpose of rendering it generally abhorred  well said the seaman i have heard of the sortes virgilianae and i dare say the sortes sallustianae are as true every tittle i have consulted honest crispus on my own account and have had a cuff for my pains but now see i open the book on your behalf and behold what occurs first to my eyelo you therecatilina  omnium flagitiosorum atque facinorosorum circum se habebat and then againetiam si quis a culpa vacuus in amicitiam ejus incididerat quotidiano usu par similisque caeteris efficiebatur after enumerating the evil qualities of catilines associates the author adds if it happened that any as yet uncontaminated by vice were fatally drawn into his friendship the effects of intercourse and snares artfully spread subdued every scruple and early assimilated them to their conductorsibidem p 19 that is what i call plain speaking on the part of the old roman mr fairford by the way that is a capital name for a lawyer  lawyer as i am said fairford i do not understand your innuendo  nay then said ewart i can try it another way as well as the hypocritical old rascal turnpenny himself could do i would have you to know that i am well acquainted with my biblebook as well as with my friend sallust he then in a snuffling and canting tone began to repeat the scriptural textdavid therefore departed thence and went to the cave of adullam and every one that was in distress and every one that was in debt and every one that was discontented gathered themselves together unto him and he became a captain over them what think you of that he said suddenly changing his manner have i touched you now sir  you are as far off as ever replied fairford  what the devil and you a repeating frigate between summertrees and the laird tell that to the marinesthe sailors wont believe it but you are right to be cautious since you cant say who are right who not but you look ill its but the cold morning air will you have a can of flip or a jorum of hot rumbo or will you splice the mainbrace showing a spiritflask will you have a quidor a pipeor a cigara pinch of snuff at least to clear your brains and sharpen your apprehension  fairford rejected all these friendly propositions  why then continued ewart if you will do nothing for the free trade i must patronize it myself  so saying he took a large glass of brandy  a hair of the dog that bit me he continuedof the dog that will worry me one day soon and yet and be dd to me for an idiot i must always have hint at my throat but says the old catchhere he sang and sang well    lets drinklets drinkwhile life we have    well find but cold drinking cold drinking in the grave  all this he continued is no charm against the headache i wish i had anything that could do you good faith and we have tea and coffee aboard ill open a chest or a bag and let you have some in an instant you are at the age to like such catlap better than better stuff  fairford thanked him and accepted his offer of tea  nanty ewart was soon heard calling about break open yon chesttake out your capful you bastard of a powdermonkey we may want it again no sugar all used up for grog say you knock another loaf to pieces cant ye and get the kettle boiling ye hells baby in no time at all  by dint of these energetic proceedings he was in a short time able to return to the place where his passenger lay sick and exhausted with a cup or rather a canful of tea for everything was on a large scale on board of the jumping jenny alan drank it eagerly and with so much appearance of being refreshed that nanty ewart swore he would have some too and only laced it as his phrase went with a single glass of brandy see note 8     chapter xiv  narrative of alan fairford continued  we left alan fairford on the deck of the little smuggling brig in that disconsolate situation when sickness and nausea attack a heated and fevered frame and an anxious mind his share of seasickness however was not so great as to engross his sensations entirely or altogether to divert his attention from what was passing around if he could not delight in the swiftness and agility with which the little frigate walked the waves or amuse himself by noticing the beauty of the seaviews around him where the distant skiddaw raised his brow as if in defiance of the clouded eminence of criffel which lorded it over the scottish side of the estuary he had spirits and composure enough to pay particular attention to the master of the vessel on whose character his own safety in all probability was dependent  nanty ewart had now given the helm to one of his people a baldpated grizzled old fellow whose whole life had been spent in evading the revenue laws with now and then the relaxation of a few months imprisonment for deforcing officers resisting seizures and the like offences  nanty himself sat down by fairford helped him to his tea with such other refreshments as he could think of and seemed in his way sincerely desirous to make his situation as comfortable as things admitted fairford had thus an opportunity to study his countenance and manners more closely  it was plain ewart though a good seaman had not been bred upon that element he was a reasonably good scholar and seemed fond of showing it by recurring to the subject of sallust and juvenal while on the other hand seaphrases seldom chequered his conversation he had been in person what is called a smart little man but the tropical sun had burnt his originally fair complexion to a dusty red and the bile which was diffused through his system had stained it with a yellowish blackwhat ought to have been the white part of his eyes in particular had a hue as deep as the topaz he was very thin or rather emaciated and his countenance though still indicating alertness and activity showed a constitution exhausted with excessive use of his favourite stimulus  i see you look at me hard said he to fairford had you been an officer of the dd customs my terriers backs would have been up he opened his breast and showed alan a pair of pistols disposed between his waistcoat and jacket placing his finger at the same time upon the cock of one of them but come you are an honest fellow though youre a close one i dare say you think me a queer customer but i can tell you they that see the ship leave harbour know little of the seas she is to sail through my father honest old gentleman never would have thought to see me master of the jumping jenny  fairford said it seemed very clear indeed that mr ewarts education was far superior to the line he at present occupied  oh criffel to solway moss said the other why man i should have been an expounder of the word with a wig like a snowwreath and a stipend likelikelike a hundred pounds a year i suppose i can spend thrice as much as that though being such as i am here he sang a scrap of an old northumbrian ditty mimicking the burr of the natives of that county    willy fosters gone to sea    siller buckles at his knee    hell come back and marry me               canny willy foster  i have no doubt said fairford your present occupation is more lucrative but i should have thought the church might have been more  he stopped recollecting that it was not his business to say anything disagreeable  more respectable you mean i suppose said ewart with a sneer and squirting the tobaccojuice through his front teeth then was silent for a moment and proceeded in a tone of candour which some internal touch of conscience dictated and so it would mr fairfordand happier too by a thousand degreesthough i have had my pleasures too but there was my father god bless the old man a true chip of the old presbyterian block walked his parish like a captain on the quarterdeck and was always ready to do good to rich and pooroff went the lairds hat to the minister as fast as the poor mans bonnet when the eye saw himpshaw what have i to do with that nowyes he was as virgil hath it vir sapientia et pietate gravis but he might have been the wiser man had he kept me at home when he sent me at nineteen to study divinity at the head of the highest stair in the covenant close it was a cursed mistake in the old gentleman what though mrs cantrips of kittlebasket for she wrote herself no less was our cousin five times removed and took me on that account to board and lodging at six shillings instead of seven shillings a week it was a dd bad saving as the case proved yet her very dignity might have kept me in order for she never read a chapter excepting out of a cambridge bible printed by daniel and bound in embroidered velvet i think i see it at this moment and on sundays when we had a quart of twopenny ale instead of buttermilk to our porridge it was always served up in a silver possetdish also she used silvermounted spectacles whereas even my fathers were cased in mere horn these things had their impression at first but we get used to grandeur by degrees well sirgad i can scarce get on with my storyit sticks in my throatmust take a trifle to wash it down well this dame had a daughterjess cantrips a blackeyed bouncing wenchand as the devil would have it there was the dd fivestory stairher foot was never from it whether i went out or came home from the divinity hall i would have eschewed her siri would on my soul for i was as innocent a lad as ever came from lammermuir but there was no possibility of escape retreat or flight unless i could have got a pair of wings or made use of a ladder seven stories high to scale the window of my attic it signifies little talkingyou may suppose how all this was to endi would have married the girl and taken my chancei would by heaven for she was a pretty girl and a good girl till she and i met but you know the old song kirk would not let us be a gentleman in my case would have settled the matter with the kirktreasurer for a small sum of money but the poor stibbler the penniless dominie having married his cousin of kittlebasket must next have proclaimed her frailty to the whole parish by mounting the throne of presbyterian penance and proving as othello says his love a whore in face of the whole congregation  in this extremity i dared not stay where i was and so thought to go home to my father but first i got jack radaway a lad from the same parish and who lived in the same infernal stair to make some inquiries how the old gentleman had taken the matter i soon by way of answer learned to the great increase of my comfortable reflections that the good old man made as much clamour as if such a thing as a mans eating his wedding dinner without saying grace had never happened since adams time he did nothing for six days but cry out ichabod ichabod the glory is departed from my house and on the seventh he preached a sermon in which he enlarged on this incident as illustrative of one of the great occasions for humiliation and causes of national defection i hope the course he took comforted himselfi am sure it made me ashamed to show my nose at home so i went down to leith and exchanging my hoddin grey coat of my mothers spinning for such a jacket as this i entered my name at the rendezvous as an ablebodied landsman and sailed with the tender round to plymouth where they were fitting out a squadron for the west indies there i was put aboard the fearnought captain daredevilamong whose crew i soon learned to fear satan the terror of my early youth as little as the toughest jack on board i had some qualms at first but i took the remedy tapping the casebottle which i recommend to you being as good for sickness of the soul as for sickness of the stomachwhat you wontvery well i must thenhere is to ye  you would i am afraid find your education of little use in your new condition said fairford  pardon me sir resumed the captain of the jumping jenny my handful of latin and small pinch of greek were as useless as old junk to be sure but my reading writing and accompting stood me in good stead and brought me forward i might have been schoolmasteraye and master in time but that valiant liquor rum made a conquest of me rather too often and so make what sail i could i always went to leeward we were four years broiling in that blasted climate and i came back at last with a little prizemoney i always had thoughts of putting things to rights in the covenant close and reconciling myself to my father i found out jack hadaway who was tuptowing away with a dozen of wretched boys and a fine string of stories he had ready to regale my ears withal my father had lectured on what he called my falling away for seven sabbaths when just as his parishioners began to hope that the course was at an end he was found dead in his bed on the eighth sunday morning jack hadaway assured me that if i wished to atone for my errors by undergoing the fate of the first martyr i had only to go to my native village where the very stones of the street would rise up against me as my fathers murderer here was a pretty itemwell my tongue clove to my mouth for an hour and was only able at last to utter the name of mrs cantrips oh this was a new theme for my jobs comforter my sudden departuremy fathers no less sudden deathhad prevented the payment of the arrears of my board and lodgingthe landlord was a haberdasher with a heart as rotten as the muslin wares he dealt in without respect to her age or gentle kin my lady kittlebasket was ejected from her airy habitationher porridgepot silver possetdish silvermounted spectacles and daniels cambridge bible sold at the cross of edinburgh to the caddie who would bid highest for them and she herself driven to the workhouse where she got in with difficulty but was easily enough lifted out at the end of the month as dead as her friends could desire merry tidings this to me who had been the dd he paused a moment origo maligad i think my confession would sound better in latin than in english  but the best jest was behindi had just power to stammer out something about jessby my faith he had an answer i had taught jess one trade and like a prudent girl she had found out another for herself unluckily they were both contraband and jess cantrips daughter of the lady kittlebasket had the honour to be transported to the plantations for streetwalking and pocketpicking about six months before i touched shore  he changed the bitter tone of affected pleasantry into an attempt to laugh then drew his swarthy hand across his swarthy eyes and said in a more natural accent poor jess  there was a pauseuntil fairford pitying the poor mans state of mind and believing he saw something in him that but for early error and subsequent profligacy might have been excellent and noble helped on the conversation by asking in a tone of commiseration how he had been able to endure such a load of calamity  why very well answered the seaman exceedingly welllike a tight ship in a brisk gale let me recollect i remember thanking jack very composedly for the interesting and agreeable communication i then pulled out my canvas pouch with my hoard of moidores and taking out two pieces i bid jack keep the rest till i came back as i was for a cruise about auld reekie the poor devil looked anxiously but i shook him by the hand and ran downstairs in such confusion of mind that notwithstanding what i had heard i expected to meet jess at every turning  it was marketday and the usual number of rogues and fools were assembled at the cross i observed everybody looked strange on me and i thought some laughed i fancy i had been making queer faces enough and perhaps talking to myself when i saw myself used in this manner i held out my clenched fists straight before me stooped my head and like a ram when he makes his race darted off right down the street scattering groups of weatherbeaten lairds and periwigged burgesses and bearing down all before me i heard the cry of seize the madman echoed in celtic sounds from the city guard with ceaze ta matmanbut pursuit and opposition were in vain i pursued my career the smell of the sea i suppose led me to leith where soon after i found myself walking very quietly on the shore admiring the tough round and sound cordage of the vessels and thinking how a loop with a man at the end of one of them would look by way of tassel  i was opposite to the rendezvous formerly my place of refugein i boltedfound one or two old acquaintances made half a dozen new onesdrank for two dayswas put aboard the tenderoff to portsmouththen landed at the haslar hospital in a fine hissinghot fever never mindi got betternothing can kill methe west indies were my lot again for since i did not go where i deserved in the next world i had something as like such quarters as can be had in thisblack devils for inhabitantsflames and earthquakes and so forth for your element well brother something or other i did or saidi cant tell whathow the devil should i when i was as drunk as davids sow you know but i was punished my ladmade to kiss the wench that never speaks but when she scolds and thats the gunners daughter comrade yes the ministers son of no matter wherehas the cats scratch on his back this roused me and when we were ashore with the boat i gave three inches of the dirk after a stout tussle to the fellow i blamed most and took the bush for it there were plenty of wild lads then along shoreand i dont care who knowsi went on the account look yousailed under the black flag and marrowboneswas a good friend to the sea and an enemy to all that sailed on it  fairford though uneasy in his mind at finding himself a lawyer so close to a character so lawless thought it best nevertheless to put a good face on the matter and asked mr ewart with as much unconcern as he could assume whether he was fortunate as a rover  no nodn it no replied nanty the devil a crumb of butter was ever churned that would stick upon my bread there was no order among ushe that was captain today was swabber tomorrow and as for plunderthey say old avery and one or two close hunks made money but in my time all went as it came and reason good for if a fellow had saved five dollars his throat would have been cut in his hammock and then it was a cruel bloody workpahwell say no more about it i broke with them at last for what they did on board of a bit of a snowno matter what it was bad enough since it frightened mei took french leave and came in upon the proclamation so i am free of all that business and here i sit the skipper of the jumping jennya nutshell of a thing but goes through the water like a dolphin if it were not for yon hypocritical scoundrel at annan who has the best end of the profit and takes none of the risk i should be well enoughas well as i want to be here is no lack of my best friendtouching his casebottlebut to tell you a secret he and i have got so used to each other i begin to think he is like a professed joker that makes your sides sore with laughing if you see him but now and then but if you take up house with him he can only make your head stupid but i warrant the old fellow is doing the best he can for me after all  and what may that be said fairford  he is killing me replied nanty ewart and i am only sorry he is so long about it  so saying he jumped on his feet and tripping up and down the deck gave his orders with his usual clearness and decision notwithstanding the considerable quantity of spirits which he had contrived to swallow while recounting his history  although far from feeling well fairford endeavoured to rouse himself and walk to the head of the brig to enjoy the beautiful prospect as well as to take some note of the course which the vessel held to his great surprise instead of standing across to the opposite shore from which she had departed the brig was going down the firth and apparently steering into the irish sea he called to nanty ewart and expressed his surprise at the course they were pursuing and asked why they did not stand straight across the firth for some port in cumberland  why this is what i call a reasonable question now answered nanty as if a ship could go as straight to its port as a horse to the stable or a freetrader could sail the solway as securely as a kings cutter why ill tell ye brotherif i do not see a smoke on bowness that is the village upon the headland yonder i must stand out to sea for twentyfour hours at least for we must keep the weathergage if there are hawks abroad  and if you do see the signal of safety master ewart what is to be done then  why then and in that case i must keep off till night and then run you with the kegs and the rest of the lumber ashore at skinburness  and then i am to meet with this same laird whom i have the letter for continued fairford  that said ewart is thereafter as it may be the ship has its coursethe fair trader has his portbut it is not easy to say where the laird may be found but he will be within twenty miles of us off or onand it will be my business to guide you to him  fairford could not withstand the passing impulse of terror which crossed him when thus reminded that he was so absolutely in the power of a man who by his own account had been a pirate and who was at present in all probability an outlaw as well as a contraband trader nanty ewart guessed the cause of his involuntary shuddering  what the devil should i gain he said by passing so poor a card as you are have i not had ace of trumps in my hand and did i not play it fairly aye i say the jumping jenny can run in other ware as well as kegs put sigma and tau to ewart and see how that will spelldye take me now  no indeed said fairford i am utterly ignorant of what you allude to  now by jove said nanty ewart thou art either the deepest or the shallowest fellow i ever met withor you are not right after all i wonder where summertrees could pick up such a tender alongshore will you let me see his letter  fairford did not hesitate to gratify his wish which he was aware he could not easily resist the master of the jumping jenny looked at the direction very attentively then turned the letter to and fro and examined each flourish of the pen as if he were judging of a piece of ornamented manuscript then handled it back to fairford without a single word of remark  am i right now said the young lawyer  why for that matter answered nanty the letter is right sure enough but whether you are right or not is your own business rather than mine and striking upon a flint with the back of a knife he kindled a cigar as thick as his finger and began to smoke away with great perseverance  alan fairford continued to regard him with a melancholy feeling divided betwixt the interest he took in the unhappy man and a not unnatural apprehension for the issue of his own adventure  ewart notwithstanding the stupefying nature of his pastime seemed to guess what was working in his passengers mind for after they had remained some time engaged in silently observing each other he suddenly dashed his cigar on the deck and said to him well then if you are sorry for me i am sorry for you dn me if i have cared a button for man or mothers son since two years since when i had another peep of jack hadaway the fellow was got as fat as a norway whalemarried to a great dutchbuilt quean that had brought him six children i believe he did not know me and thought i was come to rob his house however i made up a poor face and told him who i was poor jack would have given me shelter and clothes and began to tell me of the moidores that were in bank when i wanted them egad he changed his note when i told him what my life had been and only wanted to pay me my cash and get rid of me i never saw so terrified a visage i burst out alaughing in his face told him it was all a humbug and that the moidores were all his own henceforth and for ever and so ran off i caused one of our people send him a bag of tea and a keg of brandy before i leftpoor jack i think you are the second person these ten years that has cared a tobaccostopper for nanty ewart  perhaps mr ewart said fairford you live chiefly with men too deeply interested for their own immediate safety to think much upon the distress of others  and with whom do you yourself consort i pray replied nanty smartly why with plotters that can make no plot to better purpose than their own hanging and incendiaries that are snapping the flint upon wet tinder youll as soon raise the dead as raise the highlandsyoull as soon get a grunt from a dead sow as any comfort from wales or cheshire you think because the pot is boiling that no scum but yours can come uppermosti know better by all these rackets and riots that you think are trending your way have no relation at all to your interest and the best way to make the whole kingdom friends again at once would be the alarm of such an undertaking as these mad old fellows are trying to launch into  i really am not in such secrets as you seem to allude to said fairford and determined at the same time to avail himself as far as possible of nantys communicative disposition he added with a smile and if i were i should not hold it prudent to make them much the subject of conversation but i am sure so sensible a man as summertrees and the laird may correspond together without offence to the state  i take you friendi take you said nanty ewart upon whom at length the liquor and tobaccosmoke began to make considerable innovation as to what gentlemen may or may not correspond about why we may pretermit the question as the old professor used to say at the hall and as to summertrees i will say nothing knowing him to be an old fox but i say that this fellow the laird is a firebrand in the country that he is stirring up all the honest fellows who should be drinking their brandy quietly by telling them stories about their ancestors and the fortyfive and that he is trying to turn all waters into his own milldam and to set his sails to all winds and because the london people are roaring about for some pinches of their own he thinks to win them to his turn with a wet finger and he gets encouragement from some because they want a spell of money from him and from others because they fought for the cause once and are ashamed to go back and others because they have nothing to lose and others because they are discontented fools but if he has brought you or any one i say not whom into this scrape with the hope of doing any good hes a dd decoyduck and thats all i can say for him and you are geese which is worse than being decoyducks or lameducks either and so here is to the prosperity of king george the third and the true presbyterian religion and confusion to the pope the devil and the pretender ill tell you what mr fairbairn i am but tenth owner of this bit of a craft the jumping jennybut tenth owner and must sail her by my owners directions but if i were whole owner i would not have the brig be made a ferryboat for your jacobitical oldfashioned popish riffraff mr fairporti would not by my soul they should walk the plank by the gods as i have seen better men do when i sailed under the whatdyecallum colours but being contraband goods and on board my vessel and i with my sailing orders in my hand why i am to forward them as directedi say john roberts keep her up a bit with the helmand so mr fairweather what i do isas the dd villain turnpenny saysall in the way of business  he had been speaking with difficulty for the last five minutes and now at length dropped on the deck fairly silenced by the quantity of spirits which he had swallowed but without having showed any glimpse of the gaiety or even of the extravagance of intoxication  the old sailor stepped forward and flung a seacloak over the slumberers shoulders and added looking at fairford pity of him he should have this fault for without it he would have been as clever a fellow as ever trod a plank with ox leather  and what are we to do now said fairford  stand off and on to be sure till we see the signal and then obey orders  so saying the old man turned to his duty and left the passenger to amuse himself with his own meditations presently afterward a light column of smoke was seen rising from the little headland  i can tell you what we are to do now master said the sailor well stand out to sea and then run in again with the evening tide and make skinburness or if theres not light we can run into the wampool river and put you ashore about kirkbride or leaths with the longboat  fairford unwell before felt this destination condemned him to an agony of many hours which his disordered stomach and aching head were ill able to endure there was no remedy however but patience and the recollection that he was suffering in the cause of friendship as the sun rose high he became worse his sense of smell appeared to acquire a morbid degree of acuteness for the mere purpose of inhaling and distinguishing all the various odours with which he was surrounded from that of pitch to all the complicated smells of the hold his heart too throbbed under the heat and he felt as if in full progress towards a high fever  the seamen who were civil and attentive considering their calling observed his distress and one contrived to make an awning out of an old sail while another compounded some lemonade the only liquor which their passenger could be prevailed upon to touch after drinking it off he obtained but could not be said to enjoy a few hours of troubled slumber     chapter xv  narrative of alan fairford continued  alan fairfords spirit was more ready to encounter labour than his frame was adequate to support it in spite of his exertions when he awoke after five or six hours slumber he found that he was so much disabled by dizziness in his head and pains in his limbs that he could not raise himself without assistance he heard with some pleasure that they were now running right for the wampool river and that he would be put on shore in a very short time the vessel accordingly lay to and presently showed a weft in her ensign which was hastily answered by signals from on shore men and horses were seen to come down the broken path which leads to the shore the latter all properly tackled for carrying their loading twenty fishing barks were pushed afloat at once and crowded round the brig with much clamour laughter cursing and jesting amidst all this apparent confusion there was the essential regularity nanty ewart again walked his quarterdeck as if he had never tasted spirits in his life issued the necessary orders with precision and saw them executed with punctuality in half an hour the loading of the brig was in a great measure disposed in the boats in a quarter of an hour more it was landed on the beach and another interval of about the same duration was sufficient to distribute it on the various strings of packhorses which waited for that purpose and which instantly dispersed each on its own proper adventure more mystery was observed in loading the ships boat with a quantity of small barrels which seemed to contain ammunition this was not done until the commercial customers had been dismissed and it was not until this was performed that ewart proposed to alan as he lay stunned with pain and noise to accompany him ashore  it was with difficulty that fairford could get over the side of the vessel and he could not seat himself on the stern of the boat without assistance from the captain and his people nanty ewart who saw nothing in this worse than an ordinary fit of seasickness applied the usual topics of consolation he assured his passenger that he would be quite well by and by when he had been half an hour on terra firma and that he hoped to drink a can and smoke a pipe with him at father crackenthorps for all that he felt a little out of the way for riding the wooden horse  who is father crackenthorp said fairford though scarcely able to articulate the question  as honest a fellow as is of a thousand answered nanty  ah how much good brandy he and i have made little of in our day by my soul mr fairbird he is the prince of skinkers and the father of the free tradenot a stingy hypocritical devil like old turnpenny skinflint that drinks drunk on other folks cost and thinks it sin when he has to pay for itbut a real hearty old cockthe sharks have been at and about him this many a day but father crackenthorp knows how to trim his sailsnever a warrant but he hears of it before the inks dry he is bonus socius with headborough and constable the kings exchequer could not bribe a man to inform against him if any such rascal were to cast up why he would miss his ears next morning or be sent to seek them in the solway he is a statesman a small landed proprietor though he keeps a public but indeed that is only for convenience and to excuse his having cellarage and folk about him his wifes a canny womanand his daughter doll too gad youll be in port there till you get round again and ill keep my word with you and bring you to speech of the laird  gad the only trouble i shall have is to get you out of the house for doll is a rare wench and my dame a funny old one and father crackenthorp the rarest companion hell drink you a bottle of rum or brandy without starting but never wet his lips with the nasty scottish stuff that the canting old scoundrel turnpenny has brought into fashion he is a gentleman every inch of him old crackenthorp in his own way that is and besides he has a share in the jumping jenny and many a moonlight outfit besides he can give doll a pretty penny if he likes the tight fellow that would turn in with her for life  in the midst of this prolonged panegyric on father crackenthorp the boat touched the beach the rowers backed their oars to keep her afloat whilst the other fellows lumped into the surf and with the most rapid dexterity began to hand the barrels ashore  up with them higher on the beach my hearties exclaimed nanty ewarthigh and dryhigh and drythis gear will not stand wetting now out with our spare hand herehigh and dry with him too whats thatthe galloping of horse oh i hear the jingle of the packsaddlesthey are our own folk  by this time all the boats load was ashore consisting of the little barrels and the boats crew standing to their arms ranged themselves in front waiting the advance of the horses which came clattering along the beach a man overgrown with corpulence who might be distinguished in the moonlight panting with his own exertions appeared at the head of the cavalcade which consisted of horses linked together and accommodated with packsaddles and chains for securing the kegs which made a dreadful clattering  how now father crackenthorp said ewartwhy this hurry with your horses we mean to stay a night with you and taste your old brandy and my dames homebrewed the signal is up man and all is right  all is wrong captain nanty cried the man to whom he spoke and you are the lad that is like to find it so unless you bundle offthere are new brooms bought at carlisle yesterday to sweep the country of you and the like of youso you were better be jogging inland  how many rogues are the officers if not more than ten i will make fight  the devil you will answered crackenthorp you were better not for they have the bloodybacked dragoons from carlisle with them  nay then said nanty we must make sail come master fairlord you must mount and ride he does not hear mehe has fainted i believewhat the devil shall i do father crackenthorp i must leave this young fellow with you till the gale blows outhark yegoes between the laird and the tother old one he can neither ride nor walki must send him up to you  send him up to the gallows said crackenthorp there is quartermaster thwacker with twenty men up yonder an he had not some kindness for doll i had never got hither for a startbut you must get off or they will be here to seek us for his orders are woundy particular and these kegs contain worse than whiskya hanging matter i take it  i wish they were at the bottom of wampool river with them they belong to said nanty ewart but they are part of cargo and what to do with the poor young fellow  why many a better fellow has roughed it on the grass with a cloak oer him said crackenthorp if he hath a fever nothing is so cooling as the night air  yes he would be cold enough in the morning no doubt but its a kind heart and shall not cool so soon if i can help it answered the captain of the jumping jenny  well captain an ye will risk your own neck for another mans why not take him to the old girls at fairladies  what the miss arthurets the papist jades but never mind it will doi have known them take in a whole sloops crew that were stranded on the sands  you may run some risk though by turning up to fairladies for i tell you they are all up through the country  never mindi may chance to put some of them down again said nanty cheerfully come lads bustle to your tackle are you all loaded  aye aye captain we will be ready in a jiffy answered the gang  dn your captains have you a mind to have me hanged if i am taken alls hailfellow here  a sup at parting said father crackenthorp extending a flask to nanty ewart  not the twentieth part of a drop said nanty no dutch courage for memy heart is always high enough when theres a chance of fighting besides if i live drunk i should like to die sober here old jephsonyou are the bestnatured brute amongst themget the lad between us on a quiet horse and we will keep him upright i warrant  as they raised fairford from the ground he groaned heavily and asked faintly where they were taking him to  to a place where you will be as snug and quiet as a mouse in his hole said nanty if so be that we can get you there safely goodbye father crackenthorppoison the quartermaster if you can  the loaded horses then sprang forward at a hard trot following each other in a line and every second horse being mounted by a stout fellow in a smock frock which served to conceal the arms with which most of these desperate men were provided ewart followed in the rear of the line and with the occasional assistance of old jephson kept his young charge erect in the saddle he groaned heavily from time to time and ewart more moved with compassion for his situation than might have been expected from his own habits endeavoured to amuse him and comfort him by some account of the place to which they were conveying himhis words of consolation being however frequently interrupted by the necessity of calling to his people and many of them being lost amongst the rattling of the barrels and clinking of the tackle and small chains by which they are secured on such occasions  and you see brother you will be in safe quarters at fairladiesgood old scrambling housegood old maids enough if they were not papistshollo you jack lowther keep the line cant ye and shut your rattletrap you broth of a and so being of a good family and having enough the old lasses have turned a kind of saints and nuns and so forth the place they live in was some sort of nunshop long ago as they have them still in flanders so folk call them the vestals of fairladiesthat may be or may not be and i care not whether it be or noblinkinsop hold your tongue and be ddand so betwixt great alms and good dinners they are well thought of by rich and poor and their trucking with papists is looked over there are plenty of priests and stout young scholars and suchlike about the house its a hive of them more shame that government send dragoons out aftera few honest fellows that bring the old women of england a drop of brandy and let these ragamuffins smuggle in as much papistry andharkwas that a whistle no its only a plover you jem collier keep a lookout aheadwell meet them at the high whins or brotthole bottom or nowhere go a furlong ahead i say and look sharpthese misses arthurets feed the hungry and clothe the naked and suchlike actswhich my poor father used to say were filthy rags but he dressed himself out with as many of them as most folkdn that stumbling horse father crackenthorp should be dd himself for putting an honest fellows neck in such jeopardy  thus and with much more to the same purpose nanty ran on increasing by his wellintended annoyance the agony of alan fairford who tormented by a racking pain along the back and loins which made the rough trot of the horse torture to him had his aching head still further rended and split by the hoarse voice of the sailor close to his ear perfectly passive however he did not even essay to give any answer and indeed his own bodily distress was now so great and engrossing that to think of his situation was impossible even if he could have mended it by doing so  their course was inland but in what direction alan had no means of ascertaining they passed at first over heaths and sandy downs they crossed more than one brook or beck as they are called in that countrysome of them of considerable depthand at length reached a cultivated country divided according to the english fashion of agriculture into very small fields or closes by high banks overgrown with underwood and surmounted by hedgerow trees amongst which winded a number of impracticable and complicated lanes where the boughs projecting from the embankments on each side intercepted the light of the moon and endangered the safety of the horsemen but through this labyrinth the experience of the guides conducted them without a blunder and without even the slackening of their pace in many places however it was impossible for three men to ride abreast and therefore the burden of supporting alan fairford fell alternately to old jephson and to nanty and it was with much difficulty that they could keep him upright in his saddle  at length when his powers of sufferance were quite worn out and he was about to implore them to leave him to his fate in the first cottage or shedor under a haystack or a hedgeor anywhere so he was left at ease collier who rode ahead passed back the word that they were at the avenue to fairladieswas he to turn up  committing the charge of fairford to jephson nanty dashed up to the head of the troop and gave his orderswho knows the house best  sam skeltons a catholic said lowther  a dd bad religion said nanty of whose presbyterian education a hatred of popery seemed to be the only remnant but i am glad there is one amongst us anyhow you sam being a papist know fairladies and the old maidens i dare say so do you fall out of the line and wait here with me and do you collier carry on to walinford bottom then turn down the beck till you come to the old mill and goodman grist the miller or old peelthecauseway will tell you where to stow but i will be up with you before that  the string of loaded horses then struck forward at their former pace while nanty with sam skelton waited by the roadside till the rear came up when jephson and fairford joined them and to the great relief of the latter they began to proceed at an easier pace than formerly suffering the gang to precede them till the clatter and clang attending their progress began to die away in the distance they had not proceeded a pistolshot from the place where they parted when a short turning brought them in front of an old mouldering gateway whose heavy pinnacles were decorated in the style of the seventeenth century with clumsy architectural ornaments several of which had fallen down from decay and lay scattered about no further care having been taken than just to remove them out of the direct approach to the avenue the great stone pillars glimmering white in the moonlight had some fanciful resemblance to supernatural apparitions and the air of neglect all around gave an uncomfortable idea of the habitation to those who passed its avenue  there used to be no gate here said skelton finding their way unexpectedly stopped  but there is a gate now and a porter too said a rough voice from within who be you and what do you want at this time of night  we want to come to speech of the ladiesof the misses arthuret said nanty and to ask lodging for a sick man  there is no speech to be had of the miss arthurets at this time of night and you may carry your sick man to the doctor answered the fellow from within gruffly for as sure as there is savour in salt and scent in rosemary you will get no entranceput your pipes up and be jogging on  why dick gardener said skelton be thou then turned porter  what do you know who i am said the domestic sharply  i know you by your byword answered the other what have you forgot little sam skelton and the brock in the barrel  no i have not forgotten you answered the acquaintance of sam skelton but my orders are peremptory to let no one up the avenue this night and therefore  but we are armed and will not be kept back said nanty hark ye fellow were it not better for you to take a guinea and let us in than to have us break the door first and thy pate afterwards for i wont see my comrade die at your door be assured of that  why i dunna know said the fellow but what cattle were those that rode by in such hurry  why some of our folk from bowness stoniecultrum and thereby answered skelton jack lowther and old jephson and broad will lamplugh and such like  well said dick gardener as sure as there is savour in salt and scent in rosemary i thought it had been the troopers from carlisle and wigton and the sound brought my heart to my mouth  had thought thou wouldst have known the clatter of a cask from the clash of a broadsword as well as eer a quaffer in cumberland said skelton  come brother less of your jaw and more of your legs if you please said nanty every moment we stay is a moment lost go to the ladies and tell them that nanty ewart of the jumping jenny has brought a young gentleman charged with letters from scotland to a certain gentleman of consequence in cumberlandthat the soldiers are out and the gentleman is very ill and if he is not received at fairladies he must be left either to die at the gate or to be taken with all his papers about him by the redcoats  away ran dick gardener with this message and in a few minutes lights were seen to flit about which convinced fairford who was now in consequence of the halt a little restored to selfpossession that they were traversing the front of a tolerably large mansionhouse  what if thy friend dick gardener comes not back again said jephson to skelton  why then said the person addressed i shall owe him just such a licking as thou old jephson had from dan cooke and will pay as duly and truly as he did  the old man was about to make an angry reply when his doubts were silenced by the return of dick gardener who announced that miss arthuret was coming herself as far as the gateway to speak with them  nanty ewart cursed in a low tone the suspicions of old maids and the churlish scruples of catholics that made so many obstacles to helping a fellow creature and wished miss arthuret a hearty rheumatism or toothache as the reward of her excursion but the lady presently appeared to cut short further grumbling she was attended by a waitingmaid with a lantern by means of which she examined the party on the outside as closely as the imperfect light and the spars of the newlyerected gate would permit  i am sorry we have disturbed you so late madam arthuret said nanty but the case is this  holy virgin said she why do you speak so loud pray are you not the captain of the sainte genevieve  why aye maam answered ewart they call the brig so at dunkirk sure enough but along shore here they call her the jumping jenny  you brought over the holy father buonaventure did you not  aye aye madam i have brought over enough of them black cattle answered nanty fie fie friend said miss arthuret it is a pity that the saints should commit these good men to a heretics care  why no more they would maam answered nanty could they find a papist lubber that knew the coast as i do then i am trusty as steel to owners and always look after cargolive lumber or dead flesh or spirits all is one to me and your catholics have such dd large hoods with pardon maam that they can sometimes hide two faces under them but here is a gentleman dying with letters about him from the laird of summertrees to the laird of the lochs as they call him along solway and every minute he lies here is a nail in his coffin  saint mary what shall we do said miss arthuret we must admit him i think at all risks you richard gardener help one of these men to carry the gentleman up to the place and you selby see him lodged at the end of the long gallery you are a heretic captain but i think you are trusty and i know you have been trustedbut if you are imposing on me  not i madamnever attempt to impose on ladies of your experiencemy practice that way has been all among the young ones come cheerly mr fairfordyou will be taken good care oftry to walk  alan did so and refreshed by his halt declared himself able to walk to the house with the sole assistance of the gardener  why thats hearty thank thee dick for lending him thine armand nanty slipped into his hand the guinea he had promisedfarewell then mr fairford and farewell madam arthuret for i have been too long here  so saying he and his two companions threw themselves on horseback and went off at a gallop yet even above the clatter of their hoofs did the incorrigible nanty hollo out the old ballad    a lovely lass to a friar came   to confession amorning early   in what my dear are you to blame   come tell me most sincerely   alas  my fault i dare not name   but my lad he loved me dearly  holy virgin exclaimed miss seraphina as the unhallowed sounds reached her ears what profane heathens be these men and what frights and pinches we be put to among them the saints be good to us what a night has this beenthe like never seen at fairladies help me to make fast the gate richard and thou shalt come down again to wait on it lest there come more unwelcome visitorsnot that you are unwelcome young gentleman for it is sufficient that you need such assistance as we can give you to make you welcome to fairladiesonly another time would have done as wellbut hem i dare say it is all for the best the avenue is none of the smoothest sir look to your feet richard gardener should have had it mown and levelled but he was obliged to go on a pilgrimage to saint winifreds well in wales here dick gave a short dry cough which as if he had found it betrayed some internal feeling a little at variance with what the lady said he converted into a muttered sancta winifreda ora pro nobis miss arthuret meantime proceeded we never interfere with our servants vows or penances master fairfordi know a very worthy father of your name perhaps a relationi say we never interfere with our servants vows our lady forbid they should not know some difference between our service and a hereticstake care sir you will fall if you have not a care alas by night and day there are many stumblingblocks in our paths  with more talk to the same purpose all of which tended to show a charitable and somewhat silly woman with a strong inclination to her superstitious devotion miss arthuret entertained her new guest as stumbling at every obstacle which the devotion of his guide richard had left in the path he at last by ascending some stone steps decorated on the side with griffins or some such heraldic anomalies attained a terrace extending in front of the place of fairladies an oldfashioned gentlemans house of some consequence with its range of notched gableends and narrow windows relieved by here and there an old turret about the size of a pepperbox the door was locked during the brief absence of the mistress a dim light glimmered through the sashed door of the hall which opened beneath a huge stone porch loaded with jessamine and other creepers all the windows were dark as pitch  miss arthuret tapped at the door sister sister angelica who is there was answered from within is it you sister seraphina  yes yes undo the door do you not know my voice  no doubt sister said angelica undoing bolt and bar but you know our charge and the enemy is watchful to surprise usincedit sicut leo vorans saith the breviary whom have you brought here oh sister what have you done  it is a young man said seraphina hastening to interrupt her sisters remonstrance a relation i believe of our worthy father fairford left at the gate by the captain of that blessed vessel the sainte genevievealmost deadand charged with dispatches to   she lowered her voice as she mumbled over the last words  nay then there is no help said angelica but it is unlucky  during this dialogue between the vestals of fairladies dick gardener deposited his burden in a chair where the young lady after a moment of hesitation expressing a becoming reluctance to touch the hand of a stranger put her finger and thumb upon fairfords wrist and counted his pulse  there is fever here sister she said richard must call ambrose and we must send some of the febrifuge  ambrose arrived presently a plausible and respectablelooking old servant bred in the family and who had risen from rank to rank in the arthuret service till he was become halfphysician halfalmoner halfbutler and entire governor that is when the father confessor who frequently eased him of the toils of government chanced to be abroad under the direction and with the assistance of this venerable personage the unlucky alan fairford was conveyed to a decent apartment at the end of a long gallery and to his inexpressible relief consigned to a comfortable bed he did not attempt to resist the prescription of mr ambrose who not only presented him with the proposed draught but proceeded so far as to take a considerable quantity of blood from him by which last operation he probably did his patient much service     chapter xvi  narrative of alan fairford continued  on the next morning when fairford awoke after no very refreshing slumbers in which were mingled many wild dreams of his father and of darsie latimerof the damsel in the green mantle and the vestals of fairladiesof drinking small beer with nanty ewart and being immersed in the solway with the jumping jennyhe found himself in no condition to dispute the order of mr ambrose that he should keep his bed from which indeed he could not have raised himself without assistance he became sensible that his anxiety and his constant efforts for some days past had been too much for his health and that whatever might be his impatience he could not proceed in his undertaking until his strength was reestablished  in the meanwhile no better quarters could have been found for an invalid the attendants spoke under their breath and moved only on tiptoenothing was done unless par ordonnance du medecin aesculapius reigned paramount in the premises at fairladies once a day the ladies came in great state to wait upon him and inquire after his health and it was then that alans natural civility and the thankfulness which he expressed for their timely and charitable assistance raised him considerably in their esteem he was on the third day removed to a better apartment than that in which he had been at first accommodated when he was permitted to drink a glass of wine it was of the first quality one of those curious oldfashioned cobwebbed bottles being produced on the occasion which are only to be found in the crypts of old countryseats where they may have lurked undisturbed for more than half a century  but however delightful a residence for an invalid fairladies as its present inmate became soon aware was not so agreeable to a convalescent when he dragged himself to the window so soon as he could crawl from bed behold it was closely grated and commanded no view except of a little paved court this was nothing remarkable most old border houses having their windows so secured but then fairford observed that whosoever entered or left the room always locked the door with great care and circumspection and some proposals which he made to take a walk in the gallery or even in the garden were so coldly received both by the ladies and their prime minister mr ambrose that he saw plainly such an extension of his privileges as a guest would not be permitted  anxious to ascertain whether this excessive hospitality would permit him his proper privilege of free agency he announced to this important functionary with grateful thanks for the care with which he had been attended his purpose to leave fairladies next morning requesting only as a continuance of the favours with which he had been loaded the loan of a horse to the next town and assuring mr ambrose that his gratitude would not be limited by such a trifle he slipped three guineas into his hand by way of seconding his proposal the fingers of that worthy domestic closed as naturally upon the honorarium as if a degree in the learned faculty had given him a right to clutch it but his answer concerning alans proposed departure was at first evasive and when he was pushed it amounted to a peremptory assurance that he could not be permitted to depart tomorrow it was as much as his life was worth and his ladies would not authorize it  i know best what my own life is worth said alan and i do not value it in comparison to the business which requires my instant attention  receiving still no satisfactory answer from mr ambrose fairford thought it best to state his resolution to the ladies themselves in the most measured respectful and grateful terms but still such as expressed a firm determination to depart on the morrow or next day at farthest after some attempts to induce him to stay on the alleged score of health which were so expressed that he was convinced they were only used to delay his departure fairford plainly told them that he was entrusted with dispatches of consequence to the gentleman known by the name of herries redgauntlet and the laird of the lochs and that it was matter of life and death to deliver them early  i dare say sister angelica said the elder miss arthuret that the gentleman is honest and if he is really a relation of father fairford we can run no risk  jesu maria exclaimed the younger oh fie sister seraphina fie fievade retroget thee behind me  well well but sistersister angelicalet me speak with you in the gallery  so out the ladies rustled in their silks and tissues and it was a good halfhour ere they rustled in again with importance and awe on their countenances  to tell you the truth mr fairford the cause of our desire to delay you isthere is a religious gentleman in this house at present  a most excellent person indeedsaid the sister angelica  an anointed of his master echoed seraphinaand we should be glad that for conscience sake you would hold some discourse with him before your departure  oho thought fairford the murder is outhere is a design of conversion i must not affront the good ladies but i shall soon send off the priest i think he then answered aloud that he should be happy to converse with any friend of theirsthat in religious matters he had the greatest respect for every modification of christianity though he must say his belief was made up to that in which he had been educated nevertheless if his seeing the religious person they recommended could in the least show his respect  it is not quite that said sister seraphina although i am sure the day is too short to hear himfather buonaventure i meanspeak upon the concerns of our souls but  come come sister seraphina said the younger it is needless to talk so much about it hishis eminencei mean father buonaventurewill himself explain what he wants this gentleman to know  his eminence said fairford surprisedis this gentleman so high in the catholic church the title is given only to cardinals i think  he is not a cardinal as yet answered seraphina but i assure you mr fairford he is as high in rank as he is eminently endowed with good gifts and  come away said sister angelica holy virgin how you do talk what has mr fairford to do with father buonaventures rank only sir you will remember that the father has been always accustomed to be treated with the most profound deference indeed  come away sister said sister seraphina in her turn who talks now i pray you mr fairford will know how to comport himself  and we had best both leave the room said the younger lady for here his eminence comes  she lowered her voice to a whisper as she pronounced the last words and as fairford was about to reply by assuring her that any friend of hers should be treated by him with all the ceremony he could expect she imposed silence on him by holding up her finger  a solemn and stately step was now heard in the gallery it might have proclaimed the approach not merely of a bishop or cardinal but of the sovereign pontiff himself nor could the sound have been more respectfully listened to by the two ladies had it announced that the head of the church was approaching in person they drew themselves like sentinels on duty one on each side of the door by which the long gallery communicated with fairfords apartment and stood there immovable and with countenances expressive of the deepest reverence  the approach of father buonaventure was so slow that fairford had time to notice all this and to marvel in his mind what wily and ambitious priest could have contrived to subject his worthy but simpleminded hostesses to such superstitious trammels father buonaventures entrance and appearance in some degree accounted for the whole  he was a man of middle life about forty or upwards but either care or fatigue or indulgence had brought on the appearance of premature old age and given to his fine features a cast of seriousness or even sadness a noble countenance however still remained and though his complexion was altered and wrinkles stamped upon his brow in many a melancholy fold still the lofty forehead the full and wellopened eye and the wellformed nose showed how handsome in better days he must have been he was tall but lost the advantage of his height by stooping and the cane which he wore always in his hand and occasionally used as well as his slow though majestic gait seemed to intimate that his form and limbs felt already some touch of infirmity the colour of his hair could not be discovered as according to the fashion he wore a periwig he was handsomely though gravely dressed in a secular habit and had a cockade in his hat circumstances which did not surprise fairford who knew that a military disguise was very often assumed by the seminary priests whose visits to england or residence there subjected them to legal penalties  as this stately person entered the apartment the two ladies facing inward like soldiers on their post when about to salute a superior officer dropped on either hand of the father a curtsy so profound that the hoop petticoats which performed the feat seemed to sink down to the very floor nay through it as if a trapdoor had opened for the descent of the dames who performed this act of reverence  the father seemed accustomed to such homage profound as it was he turned his person a little way first towards one sister and then towards the other while with a gracious inclination of his person which certainly did not amount to a bow he acknowledged their curtsy but he passed forward without addressing them and seemed by doing so to intimate that their presence in the apartment was unnecessary  they accordingly glided out of the room retreating backwards with hands clasped and eyes cast upwards as if imploring blessings on the religious man whom they venerated so highly the door of the apartment was shut after them but not before fairford had perceived that there were one or two men in the gallery and that contrary to what he had before observed the door though shut was not locked on the outside  can the good souls apprehend danger from me to this god of their idolatry thought fairford but he had no time to make further observations for the stranger had already reached the middle of his apartment  fairford rose to receive him respectfully but as he fixed his eyes on the visitor he thought that the father avoided his looks his reasons for remaining incognito were cogent enough to account for this and fairford hastened to relieve him by looking downwards in his turn but when again he raised his face he found the broad light eye of the stranger so fixed on him that he was almost put out of countenance by the steadiness of his gaze during this time they remained standing  take your seat sir said the father you have been an invalid  he spoke with the tone of one who desires an inferior to be seated in his presence and his voice was full and melodious  fairford somewhat surprised to find himself overawed by the airs of superiority which could be only properly exercised towards one over whom religion gave the speaker influence sat down at his bidding as if moved by springs and was at a loss how to assert the footing of equality on which he felt that they ought to stand the stranger kept the advantage which he had obtained  your name sir i am informed is fairford said the father  alan answered by a bow  called to the scottish bar continued his visitor there is i believe in the west a family of birth and rank called fairford of fairford  alan thought this a strange observation from a foreign ecclesiastic as his name intimated father buonaventure to be but only answered he believed there was such a family  do you count kindred with them mr fairford continued the inquirer  i have not the honour to lay such a claim said fairford  my fathers industry has raised his family from a low and obscure situationi have no hereditary claim to distinction of any kind may i ask the cause of these inquiries  you will learn it presently said father buonaventure who had given a dry and dissatisfied hem at the young mans acknowledging a plebeian descent he then motioned to him to be silent and proceeded with his queries  although not of condition you are doubtless by sentiments and education a man of honour and a gentleman  i hope so sir said alan colouring with displeasure i have not been accustomed to have it questioned  patience young man said the unperturbed queristwe are on serious business and no idle etiquette must prevent its being discussed seriously you are probably aware that you speak to a person proscribed by the severe and unjust laws of the present government  i am aware of the statute 1700 chapter 3 said alan banishing from the realm priests and trafficking papists and punishing by death on summary conviction any such person who being so banished may return but i have no means of knowing you sir to be one of those persons and i think your prudence may recommend to you to keep your own counsel  it is sufficient sir and i have no apprehensions of disagreeable consequences from your having seen me in this house said the priest  assuredly no said alan i consider myself as indebted for my life to the mistresses of fairladies and it would be a vile requital on my part to pry into or make known what i may have seen or heard under this hospitable roof if i were to meet the pretender himself in such a situation he should even at the risk of a little stretch to my loyalty be free from any danger from my indiscretion  the pretender said the priest with some angry emphasis but immediately softened his tone and added no doubt however that person is a pretender and some people think his pretensions are not ill founded but before running into politics give me leave to say that i am surprised to find a gentleman of your opinions in habits of intimacy with mr maxwell of summertrees and mr redgauntlet and the medium of conducting the intercourse betwixt them  pardon me sir replied alan fairford i do not aspire to the honour of being reputed their confidant or gobetween my concern with those gentlemen is limited to one matter of business dearly interesting to me because it concerns the safetyperhaps the lifeof my dearest friend  would you have any objection to entrust me with the cause of your journey said father buonaventure my advice may be of service to you and my influence with one or both these gentlemen is considerable  fairford hesitated a moment and hastily revolving all circumstances concluded that he might perhaps receive some advantage from propitiating this personage while on the other hand he endangered nothing by communicating to him the occasion of his journey he therefore after stating shortly that he hoped mr buonaventure would render him the same confidence which he required on his part gave a short account of darsie latimerof the mystery which hung over his familyand of the disaster which had befallen him finally of his own resolution to seek for his friend and to deliver him at the peril of his own life  the catholic priest whose manner it seemed to be to avoid all conversation which did not arise from his own express motion made no remarks upon what he had heard but only asked one or two abrupt questions where alans narrative appeared less clear to him then rising from his seat he took two turns through the apartment muttering between his teeth with emphasis the word madman but apparently he was in the habit of keeping all violent emotions under restraint for he presently addressed fairford with the most perfect indifference  if said he you thought you could do so without breach of confidence i wish you would have the goodness to show me the letter of mr maxwell of summertrees i desire to look particularly at the address  seeing no cause to decline this extension of his confidence alan without hesitation put the letter into his hand having turned it round as old trumbull and nanty ewart had formerly done and like them having examined the address with much minuteness he asked whether he had observed these words pointing to a pencilwriting upon the under side of the letter fairford answered in the negative and looking at the letter read with surprise cave ne literas bellerophontis adferres a caution which coincided so exactly with the provosts admonition that he would do well to inspect the letter of which he was bearer that he was about to spring up and attempt an escape he knew not wherefore or from whom  sit still young man said the father with the same tone of authority which reigned in his whole manner although mingled with stately courtesy you are in no dangermy character shall be a pledge for your safety by whom do you suppose these words have been written  fairford could have answered by nanty ewart for he remembered seeing that person scribble something with a pencil although he was not well enough to observe with accuracy where or upon what but not knowing what suspicions or what worse consequences the seamens interest in his affairs might draw upon him he judged it best to answer that he knew not the hand  father buonaventure was again silent for a moment or two which he employed in surveying the letter with the strictest attention then stepped to the window as if to examine the address and writing of the envelope with the assistance of a stronger light and alan fairford beheld him with no less amazement than high displeasure coolly and deliberately break the seal open the letter and peruse the contents  stop sir hold he exclaimed so soon as his astonishment permitted him to express his resentment in words by what right do you dare  peace young gentleman said the father repelling him with a wave of his hand be assured i do not act without warrantnothing can pass betwixt mr maxwell and mr redgauntlet that i am not fully entitled to know  it may be so said alan extremely angry but though you may be these gentlemens father confessor you are not mine and in breaking the seal of a letter entrusted to my care you have done me  no injury i assure you answered the unperturbed priest on the contrary it may be a service  i desire no advantage at such a rate or to be obtained in such a manner answered fairford restore me the letter instantly or  as you regard your own safety said the priest forbear all injurious expressions and all menacing gestures i am not one who can be threatened or insulted with impunity and there are enough within hearing to chastise any injury or affront offered to me in case i may think it unbecoming to protect or avenge myself with my own hand  in saying this the father assumed an air of such fearlessness and calm authority that the young lawyer surprised and overawed forbore as he had intended to snatch the letter from his hand and confined himself to bitter complaints of the impropriety of his conduct and of the light in which he himself must be placed to redgauntlet should he present him a letter with a broken seal  that said father buonaventure shall be fully cared for i will myself write to redgauntlet and enclose maxwells letter provided always you continue to desire to deliver it after perusing the contents  he then restored the letter to fairford and observing that he hesitated to peruse it said emphatically read it for it concerns you  this recommendation joined to what provost crosbie had formerly recommended and to the warning which he doubted not that nanty intended to convey by his classical allusion decided fairfords resolution if these correspondents he thought are conspiring against my person i have a right to counterplot them selfpreservation as well as my friends safety require that i should not be too scrupulous  so thinking he read the letter which was in the following words  dear rugged and dangerous will you never cease meriting your old nickname you have springed your dottrel i find and what is the consequencewhy that there will be hue and cry after you presently the bearer is a pert young lawyer who has brought a formal complaint against you which luckily he has preferred in a friendly court yet favourable as the judge was disposed to be it was with the utmost difficulty that cousin jenny and i could keep him to his tackle he begins to be timid suspicious and untractable and i fear jenny will soon bend her brows on him in vain i know not what to advisethe lad who carries this is a good ladactive for his friendand i have pledged my honour he shall have no personal illusage pledged my honour remark these words and remember i can be rugged and dangerous as well as my neighbours but i have not ensured him against a short captivity and as he is a stirring active fellow i see no remedy but keeping him out of the way till this business of the good father b is safely blown over which god send it werealways thine even should i be once more craiginperil  what think you young man of the danger you have been about to encounter so willingly  as strangely replied alan fairford as of the extraordinary means which you have been at present pleased to use for the discovery of mr maxwells purpose  trouble not yourself to account for my conduct said the father i have a warrant for what i do and fear no responsibility but tell me what is your present purpose  i should not perhaps name it to you whose own safety may be implicated  i understand you answered the father you would appeal to the existing government that can at no rate be permittedwe will rather detain you at fairladies by compulsion  you will probably said fairford first weigh the risk of such a proceeding in a free country  i have incurred more formidable hazard said the priest smiling yet i am willing to find a milder expedient come let us bring the matter to a compromise and he assumed a conciliating graciousness of manner which struck fairford as being rather too condescending for the occasion i presume you will be satisfied to remain here in seclusion for a day or two longer provided i pass my solemn word to you that you shall meet with the person whom you seek aftermeet with him in perfect safety and i trust in good health and be afterwards both at liberty to return to scotland or dispose of yourselves as each of you may be minded  i respect the verbum sacerdotis as much as can reasonably be expected from a protestant answered fairford but methinks you can scarce expect me to repose so much confidence in the word of an unknown person as is implied in the guarantee which you offer me  i am not accustomed sir said the father in a very haughty tone to have my word disputed but he added while the angry hue passed from his cheek after a moments reflection you know me not and ought to be excused i will repose more confidence in your honour than you seem willing to rest upon mine and since we are so situated that one must rely upon the others faith i will cause you to be set presently at liberty and furnished with the means of delivering your letter as addressed provided that now knowing the contents you think it safe for yourself to execute the commission  alan fairford paused i cannot see he at length replied how i can proceed with respect to the accomplishment of my sole purpose which is the liberation of my friend without appealing to the law and obtaining the assistance of a magistrate if i present this singular letter of mr maxwell with the contents of which i have become so unexpectedly acquainted i shall only share his captivity  and if you apply to a magistrate young man you will bring ruin on these hospitable ladies to whom in all human probability you owe your life you cannot obtain a warrant for your purpose without giving a clear detail of all the late scenes through which you have passed a magistrate would oblige you to give a complete account of yourself before arming you with his authority against a third party and in giving such an account the safety of these ladies will necessarily be compromised a hundred spies have had and still have their eyes upon this mansion but god will protect his ownhe crossed himself devoutly and then proceededyou can take an hour to think of your best plan and i will pledge myself to forward it thus far provided it be not asking you to rely more on my word than your prudence can warrant you shall go to redgauntleti name him plainly to show my confidence in youand you shall deliver him this letter of mr maxwells with one from me in which i will enjoin him to set your friend at liberty or at least to make no attempts upon your own person either by detention or otherwise if you can trust me thus far he said with a proud emphasis on the words i will on my side see you depart from this place with the most perfect confidence that you will not return armed with powers to drag its inmates to destruction you are young and inexperiencedbred to a profession also which sharpens suspicion and gives false views of human nature i have seen much of the world and have known better than most men how far mutual confidence is requisite in managing affairs of consequence  he spoke with an air of superiority even of authority by which fairford notwithstanding his own internal struggles was silenced and overawed so much that it was not till the father had turned to leave the apartment that he found words to ask him what the consequences would be should he decline to depart on the terms proposed  you must then for the safety of all parties remain for some days an inhabitant of fairladies where we have the means of detaining you which selfpreservation will in that case compel us to make use of your captivity will be short for matters cannot long remain as they are the cloud must soon rise or it must sink upon us for ever benedicite  with these words he left the apartment  fairford upon his departure felt himself much at a loss what course to pursue his line of education as well as his fathers tenets in matters of church and state had taught him a holy horror for papists and a devout belief in whatever had been said of the punic faith of jesuits and of the expedients of mental reservation by which the catholic priests in general were supposed to evade keeping faith with heretics yet there was something of majesty depressed indeed and overclouded but still grand and imposing in the manner and words of father buonaventure which it was difficult to reconcile with those preconceived opinions which imputed subtlety and fraud to his sect and order above all alan was aware that if he accepted not his freedom upon the terms offered him he was likely to be detained by force so that in every point of view he was a gainer by accepting them  a qualm indeed came across him when he considered as a lawyer that this father was probably in the eye of law a traitor and that there was an ugly crime on the statute book called misprision of treason on the other hand whatever he might think or suspect he could not take upon him to say that the man was a priest whom he had never seen in the dress of his order or in the act of celebrating mass so that he felt himself at liberty to doubt of that respecting which he possessed no legal proof he therefore arrived at the conclusion that he would do well to accept his liberty and proceed to redgauntlet under the guarantee of father buonaventure which he scarce doubted would be sufficient to save him from personal inconvenience should he once obtain speech of that gentleman he felt the same confidence as formerly that he might be able to convince him of the rashness of his conduct should he not consent to liberate darsie latimer at all events he should learn where his friend was and how circumstanced  having thus made up his mind alan waited anxiously for the expiration of the hour which had been allowed him for deliberation he was not kept on the tenterhooks of impatience an instant longer than the appointed moment arrived for even as the clock struck ambrose appeared at the door of the gallery and made a sign that alan should follow him he did so and after passing through some of the intricate avenues common in old houses was ushered into a small apartment commodiously fitted up in which he found father buonaventure reclining on a couch in the attitude of a man exhausted by fatigue or indisposition on a small table beside him a silver embossed salver sustained a catholic book of prayer a small flask of medicine a cordial and a little teacup of old china ambrose did not enter the roomhe only bowed profoundly and closed the door with the least possible noise so soon as fairford had entered  sit down young man said the father with the same air of condescension which had before surprised and rather offended fairford you have been ill and i know too well by my own case that indisposition requires indulgence have you he continued so soon as he saw him seated resolved to remain or to depart  to depart said alan under the agreement that you will guarantee my safety with the extraordinary person who has conducted himself in such a lawless manner toward my friend darsie latimer  do not judge hastily young man replied the father redgauntlet has the claims of a guardian over his ward in respect to the young gentleman and a right to dictate his place of residence although he may have been injudicious in selecting the means by which he thinks to enforce his authority  his situation as an attainted person abrogates such rights said fairford hastily  surely replied the priest smiling at the young lawyers readiness in the eye of those who acknowledge the justice of the attainderbut that do not i however sir here is the guaranteelook at its contents and do not again carry the letters of uriah  fairford read these words  good friend we send you hither a young man desirous to know the situation of your ward since he came under your paternal authority and hopeful of dealing with you for having your relative put at large this we recommend to your prudence highly disapproving at the same time of any force or coercion when such can be avoided and wishing therefore that the bearers negotiation may be successful at all rates however the bearer hath our pledged word for his safety and freedom which therefore you are to see strictly observed as you value our honour and your own we further wish to converse with you with as small loss of time as may be having matters of the utmost confidence to impart for this purpose we desire you to repair hither with all haste and thereupon we bid you heartily farewell p b  you will understand sir said the father when he saw that alan had perused his letter that by accepting charge of this missive you bind yourself to try the effect of it before having recourse to any legal means as you term them for your friends release  there are a few ciphers added to this letter said fairford when he had perused the paper attentivelymay i inquire what their import is  they respect my own affairs answered the father briefly and have no concern whatever with yours  it seems to me however replied alan natural to suppose  nothing must be supposed incompatible with my honour replied the priest interrupting him when such as i am confer favours we expect that they shall be accepted with gratitude or declined with thankful respectnot questioned or discussed  i will accept your letter then said fairford after a minutes consideration and the thanks you expect shall be most liberally paid if the result answer what you teach me to expect  god only commands the issue said father buonaventure man uses means you understand that by accepting this commission you engage yourself in honour to try the effect of my letter upon mr redgauntlet before you have recourse to informations or legal warrants  i hold myself bound as a man of good faith and honour to do so said fairford  well i trust you said the father i will now tell you that an express dispatched by me last night has i hear brought redgauntlet to a spot many miles nearer this place where he will not find it safe to attempt any violence on your friend should he be rash enough to follow the advice of mr maxwell of summertrees rather than my commands we now understand each other  he extended his hand towards alan who was about to pledge his faith in the usual form by grasping it with his own when the father drew back hastily ere alan had time to comment upon this repulse a small sidedoor covered with tapestry was opened the hangings were drawn aside and a lady as if by sudden apparition glided into the apartment it was neither of the misses arthuret but a woman in the prime of life and in the fullblown expansion of female beauty tall fair and commanding in her aspect her locks of paly gold were taught to fall over a brow which with the stately glance of the large open blue eyes might have become juno herself her neck and bosom were admirably formed and of a dazzling whiteness she was rather inclined to embonpoint but not more than became her age of apparently thirty years her step was that of a queen but it was of queen vashti not queen estherthe bold and commanding not the retiring beauty  father buonaventure raised himself on the couch angrily as if displeased by this intrusion how now madam he said with some sternness why have we the honour of your company  because it is my pleasure answered the lady composedly  your pleasure madam he repeated in the same angry tone  my pleasure sir she continued which always keeps exact pace with my duty i had heard you were unwelllet me hope it is only business which produces this seclusion  i am well he replied perfectly well and i thank you for your carebut we are not alone and this young man  that young man she said bending her large and serious eye on alan fairford as if she had been for the first time aware of his presencemay i ask who he is  another time madam you shall learn his history after he is gone his presence renders it impossible for me to explain further  after he is gone may be too late said the lady and what is his presence to me when your safety is at stake he is the heretic lawyer whom those silly fools the arthurets admitted into this house at a time when they should have let their own father knock at the door in vain though the night had been a wild one you will not surely dismiss him  your own impatience can alone make that step perilous said the father i have resolved to take itdo not let your indiscreet zeal however excellent its motive add any unnecessary risk to the transaction  even so said the lady in a tone of reproach yet mingled with respect and apprehension and thus you will still go forward like a stag upon the hunters snares with undoubting confidence after all that has happened  peace madam said father buonaventure rising up be silent or quit the apartment my designs do not admit of female criticism  to this peremptory command the lady seemed about to make a sharp reply but she checked herself and pressing her lips strongly together as if to secure the words from bursting from them which were already formed upon her tongue she made a deep reverence partly as it seemed in reproach partly in respect and left the room as suddenly as she had entered it  the father looked disturbed at this incident which he seemed sensible could not but fill fairfords imagination with an additional throng of bewildering suspicions he bit his lip and muttered something to himself as he walked through the apartment then suddenly turned to his visitor with a smile of much sweetness and a countenance in which every rougher expression was exchanged for those of courtesy and kindness  the visit we have been just honoured with my young friend has given you he said more secrets to keep than i would have wished you burdened with the lady is a person of conditionof rank and fortunebut nevertheless is so circumstanced that the mere fact of her being known to be in this country would occasion many evils i should wish you to observe secrecy on this subject even to redgauntlet or maxwell however much i trust them in all that concerns my own affairs  i can have no occasion replied fairford for holding any discussion with these gentlemen or with any others on the circumstance which i have just witnessedit could only have become the subject of my conversation by mere accident and i will now take care to avoid the subject entirely  you will do well sir and i thank you said the father throwing much dignity into the expression of obligation which he meant to convey the time may perhaps come when you will learn what it is to have obliged one of my condition as to the lady she has the highest merit and nothing can be said of her justly which would not redound to her praise neverthelessin short sir we wander at present as in a morning mistthe sun will i trust soon rise and dispel it when all that now seems mysterious will be fully revealedor it will sink into rain he added in a solemn tone and then explanation will be of little consequenceadieu sir i wish you well  he made a graceful obeisance and vanished through the same sidedoor by which the lady had entered and alan thought he heard their voices high in dispute in the adjoining apartment  presently afterwards ambrose entered and told him that a horse and guide waited him beneath the terrace  the good father buonaventure added the butler has been graciously pleased to consider your situation and desired me to inquire whether you have any occasion for a supply of money  make my respects to his reverence answered fairford and assure him i am provided in that particular i beg you also to make my acknowledgements to the misses arthuret and assure them that their kind hospitality to which i probably owe my life shall be remembered with gratitude as long as that life lasts you yourself mr ambrose must accept of my kindest thanks for your skill and attention  mid these acknowledgements they left the house descended the terrace and reached the spot where the gardener fairfords old acquaintance waited for him mounted upon one horse and leading another  bidding adieu to ambrose our young lawyer mounted and rode down the avenue often looking back to the melancholy and neglected dwelling in which he had witnessed such strange scenes and musing upon the character of its mysterious inmates especially the noble and almost regalseeming priest and the beautiful but capricious dame who if she was really father buonaventures penitent seemed less docile to the authority of the church than as alan conceived the catholic discipline permitted he could not indeed help being sensible that the whole deportment of these persons differed much from his preconceived notions of a priest and devotee father buonaventure in particular had more natural dignify and less art and affectation in his manner than accorded with the idea which calvinists were taught to entertain of that wily and formidable person a jesuitical missionary  while reflecting on these things he looked back so frequently at the house that dick gardener a forward talkative fellow who began to tire of silence at length said to him i think you will know fairladies when you see it again sir  i dare say i shall richard answered fairford goodhumouredly i wish i knew as well where i am to go next but you can tell me perhaps  your worship should know better than i said dick gardener nevertheless i have a notion you are going where all you scotsmen should be sent whether you will or no  not to the devil i hope good dick said fairford  why no that is a road which you may travel as heretics but as scotsmen i would only send you threefourths of the wayand that is back to scotland againalways craving your honours pardon  does our journey lie that way said fairford  as far as the waterside said richard i am to carry you to old father crackenthorps and then you are within a spit and a stride of scotland as the saying is but mayhap you may think twice of going thither for all that for old england is fat feedingground for northcountry cattle     chapter xvii  narrative of darsie latimer  our history must now as the old romancers wont to say leave to tell of the quest of alan fairford and instruct our readers of the adventures which befell darsie latimer left as he was in the precarious custody of his selfnamed tutor the laird of the lochs of solway to whose arbitrary pleasure he found it necessary for the present to conform himself  in consequence of this prudent resolution and although he did not assume such a disguise without some sensations of shame and degradation darsie permitted cristal nixon to place over his face and secure by a string one of those silk masks which ladies frequently wore to preserve their complexions when exposed to the air during long journeys on horseback he remonstrated somewhat more vehemently against the long ridingskirt which converted his person from the waist into the female guise but was obliged to concede this point also  the metamorphosis was then complete for the fair reader must be informed that in those rude times the ladies when they honoured the masculine dress by assuming any part of it wore just such hats coats and waistcoats as the male animals themselves made use of and had no notion of the elegant compromise betwixt male and female attire which has now acquired par excellence the name of a habit trolloping things our mothers must have looked with long squarecut coats lacking collars and with waistcoats plentifully supplied with a length of pocket which hung far downwards from the middle but then they had some advantage from the splendid colours lace and gay embroidery which masculine attire then exhibited and as happens in many similar instances the finery of the materials made amends for the want of symmetry and grace of form in the garments themselves but this is a digression  in the court of the old mansion half manorplace half farmhouse or rather a decayed manorhouse converted into an abode for a cumberland tenant stood several saddled horses four or five of them were mounted by servants or inferior retainers all of whom were well armed with sword pistol and carabine but two had riding furniture for the use of femalesthe one being accoutred with a sidesaddle the other with a pillion attached to the saddle  darsies heart beat quicker within him he easily comprehended that one of these was intended for his own use and his hopes suggested that the other was designed for that of the fair green mantle whom according to his established practice he had adopted for the queen of his affections although his opportunities of holding communication with her had not exceeded the length of a silent supper on one occasion and the going down a countrydance on another this however was no unwonted mood of passion with darsie latimer upon whom cupid was used to triumph only in the degree of a mahratta conqueror who overruns a province with the rapidity of lightning but finds it impossible to retain it beyond a very brief space yet this new love was rather more serious than the scarce skinnedup wounds which his friend fairford used to ridicule the damsel had shown a sincere interest in his behalf and the air of mystery with which that interest was veiled gave her to his lively imagination the character of a benevolent and protecting spirit as much as that of a beautiful female  at former times the romance attending his shortlived attachments had been of his own creating and had disappeared as soon as ever he approached more closely to the object with which he had invested it on the present occasion it really flowed from external circumstances which might have interested less susceptible feelings and an imagination less lively than that of darsie latimer young inexperienced and enthusiastic as he was  he watched therefore anxiously to whose service the palfrey bearing the ladys saddle was destined but ere any female appeared to occupy it he was himself summoned to take his seat on the pillion behind cristal nixon amid the grins of his old acquaintance jan who helped him to horse and the unrestrained laughter of cicely who displayed on the occasion a case of teeth which might have rivalled ivory  latimer was at an age when being an object of general ridicule even to clowns and milkmaids was not a matter of indifference and he longed heartily to have laid his horsewhip across jans shoulders that however was a solacement of his feelings which was not at the moment to be thought of and cristal nixon presently put an end to his unpleasant situation by ordering the riders to go on he himself kept the centre of the troop two men riding before and two behind him always as it seemed to darsie having their eye upon him to prevent any attempt to escape he could see from time to time when the straight line of the road or the advantage of an ascent permitted him that another troop of three or four riders followed them at about a quarter of a miles distance amongst whom he could discover the tall form of redgauntlet and the powerful action of his gallant black horse he had little doubt that green mantle made one of the party though he was unable to distinguish her from the others  in this manner they travelled from six in the morning until nearly ten of the clock without darsie exchanging a word with any one for he loathed the very idea of entering into conversation with cristal nixon against whom he seemed to feel an instinctive aversion nor was that domestics saturnine and sullen disposition such as to have encouraged advances had he thought of making them  at length the party halted for the purpose of refreshment but as they had hitherto avoided all villages and inhabited places upon their route so they now stopped at one of those large ruinous dutch barns which are sometimes found in the fields at a distance from the farmhouses to which they belong yet in this desolate place some preparations had been made for their reception there were in the end of the barn racks filled with provender for the horses and plenty of provisions for the party were drawn from the trusses of straw under which the baskets that contained them had been deposited the choicest of these were selected and arranged apart by cristal nixon while the men of the party threw themselves upon the rest which he abandoned to their discretion in a few minutes afterwards the rearward party arrived and dismounted and redgauntlet himself entered the barn with the greenmantled maiden by his side he presented her to darsie with these words  it is time you two should know each other better i promised you my confidence darsie and the time is come for reposing it but first we will have our breakfast and then when once more in the saddle i will tell you that which it is necessary that you should know salute lilias darsie  the command was sudden and surprised latimer whose confusion was increased by the perfect ease and frankness with which lilias offered at once her cheek and her hand and pressing his as she rather took it than gave her own said very frankly dearest darsie how rejoiced i am that our uncle has at last permitted us to become acquainted  darsies head turned round and it was perhaps well that redgauntlet called on him to sit down as even that movement served to hide his confusion there is an old song which says    when ladies are willing   a man can but look like a fool  and on the same principle darsie latimers looks at this unexpected frankness of reception would have formed an admirable vignette for illustrating the passage dearest darsie and such a ready nay eager salute of lip and hand it was all very gracious no doubtand ought to have been received with much gratitude but constituted as our friends temper was nothing could be more inconsistent with his tone of feeling if a hermit had proposed to him to club for a pot of beer the illusion of his reverend sanctity could not have been dispelled more effectually than the divine qualities of green mantle faded upon the illimagined frankheartedness of poor lilias vexed with her forwardness and affronted at having once more cheated himself darsie could hardly help muttering two lines of the song we have already quoted    the fruit that must fall without shaking   is rather too mellow for me  and yet it was pity for her tooshe was a very pretty young womanhis fancy had scarcely overrated her in that respectand the slight derangement of the beautiful brown locks which escaped in natural ringlets from under her ridinghat with the bloom which exercise had brought into her cheek made her even more than usually fascinating redgauntlet modified the sternness of his look when it was turned towards her and in addressing her used a softer tone than his usual deep bass even the grim features of cristal nixon relaxed when he attended on her and it was then if ever that his misanthropical visage expressed some sympathy with the rest of humanity  how can she thought latimer look so like an angel yet be so mere a mortal after all how could so much seeming modesty have so much forwardness of manner when she ought to have been most reserved how can her conduct be reconciled to the grace and ease of her general deportment  the confusion of thoughts which occupied darsies imagination gave to his looks a disordered appearance and his inattention to the food which was placed before him together with his silence and absence of mind induced lilias solicitously to inquire whether he did not feel some return of the disorder under which he had suffered so lately this led mr redgauntlet who seemed also lost in his own contemplations to raise his eyes and join in the same inquiry with some appearance of interest latimer explained to both that he was perfectly well  it is well it is so answered redgauntlet for we have that before us which will brook no delay from indispositionwe have not as hotspur says leisure to be sick  lilias on her part endeavoured to prevail upon darsie to partake of the food which she offered him with a kindly and affectionate courtesy corresponding to the warmth of the interest she had displayed at their meeting but so very natural innocent and pure in its character that it would have been impossible for the vainest coxcomb to have mistaken it for coquetry or a desire of captivating a prize so valuable as his affection darsie with no more than the reasonable share of selfopinion common to most youths when they approach twentyone knew not how to explain her conduct  sometimes he was tempted to think that his own merits had even during the short intervals when they had seen each other secured such a hold of the affections of a young person who had probably been bred up in ignorance of the world and its forms that she was unable to conceal her partiality sometimes he suspected that she acted by her guardians order who aware that he darsie was entitled to a considerable fortune might have taken this bold stroke to bring about a marriage betwixt him and so near a relative  but neither of these suppositions was applicable to the character of the parties miss liliass manners however soft and natural displayed in their ease and versatility considerable acquaintance with the habits of the world and in the few words she said during the morning repast there were mingled a shrewdness and good sense which could scarce belong to a miss capable of playing the silly part of a lovesmitten maiden so broadly as for redgauntlet with his stately bearing his fatal frown his eye of threat and of command it was impossible darsie thought to suspect him of a scheme having private advantage for its object he could as soon have imagined cassius picking caesars pocket instead of drawing his poniard on the dictator  while he thus mused unable either to eat drink or answer to the courtesy of lilias she soon ceased to speak to him and sat silent as himself  they had remained nearly an hour in their haltingplace when redgauntlet said aloud look out cristal nixon if we hear nothing from fairladies we must continue our journey  cristal went to the door and presently returned and said to his master in a voice as harsh as his features gilbert gregson is coming his horse as white with foam as if a fiend had ridden him  redgauntlet threw from him the plate on which he had been eating and hastened towards the door of the barn which the courier at that moment entered a smart jockey with a black velvet huntingcap and a broad belt drawn tight round his waist to which was secured his expressbag the variety of mud with which he was splashed from cap to spur showed he had had a rough and rapid ride he delivered a letter to mr redgauntlet with an obeisance and then retired to the end of the barn where the other attendants were sitting or lying upon the straw in order to get some refreshment  redgauntlet broke the letter open with haste and read it with anxious and discomposed looks on a second perusal his displeasure seemed to increase his brow darkened and was distinctly marked with the fatal sign peculiar to his family and house darsie had never before observed his frown bear such a close resemblance to the shape which tradition assigned it  redgauntlet held out the open letter with one hand and struck it with the forefinger of the other as in a suppressed and displeased tone he said to cristal nixon countermandedordered northward once more northward when all our hopes lie to the southa second derby direction when we turned our back on glory and marched in quest of ruin  cristal nixon took the letter and ran it over then returned it to his master with the cold observation a female influence predominates  but it shall predominate no longer said redgauntlet it shall wane as ours rises in the horizon meanwhile i will on beforeand you cristal will bring the party to the place assigned in the letter you may now permit the young persons to have unreserved communication together only mark that you watch the young man closely enough to prevent his escape if he should be idiot enough to attempt it but not approaching so close as to watch their free conversation  i care naught about their conversation said nixon surlily  you hear my commands lilias said the laird turning to the young lady you may use my permission and authority to explain so much of our family matters as you yourself know at our next meeting i will complete the task of disclosure and i trust i shall restore one redgauntlet more to the bosom of our ancient family let latimer as he calls himself have a horse to himself he must for some time retain his disguisemy horsemy horse  in two minutes they heard him ride off from the door of the barn followed at speed by two of the armed men of his party  the commands of cristal nixon in the meanwhile put all the remainder of the party in motion but the laird himself was long out of sight ere they were in readiness to resume their journey when at length they set out darsie was accommodated with a horse and sidesaddle instead of being obliged to resume his place on the pillion behind the detestable nixon he was obliged however to retain his ridingskirt and to reassume his mask yet notwithstanding this disagreeable circumstance and although he observed that they gave him the heaviest and slowest horse of the party and that as a further precaution against escape he was closely watched on every side yet riding in company with the pretty lilias was an advantage which overbalanced these inconveniences  it is true that this society to which that very morning he would have looked forward as a glimpse of heaven had now that it was thus unexpectedly indulged something much less rapturous than he had expected  it was in vain that in order to avail himself of a situation so favourable for indulging his romantic disposition he endeavoured to coax back if i may so express myself that delightful dream of ardent and tender passion he felt only such a confusion of ideas at the difference between the being whom he had imagined and her with whom he was now in contact that it seemed to him like the effect of witchcraft what most surprised him was that this sudden flame should have died away so rapidly notwithstanding that the maidens personal beauty was even greater than he had expectedher demeanour unless it should be deemed over kind towards himself as graceful and becoming as he could have fancied if even in his gayest dreams it were judging hardly of him to suppose that the mere belief of his having attracted her affections more easily than he expected was the cause of his ungratefully undervaluing a prize too lightly won or that his transient passion played around his heart with the hitting radiance of a wintry sunbeam flashing against an icicle which may brighten it for a moment but cannot melt it neither of these was precisely the ease though such fickleness of disposition might also have some influence in the change  the truth is perhaps the lovers pleasure like that of the hunter is in the chase and that the brightest beauty loses half its merit as the fairest flower its perfume when the willing hand can reach it too easily there must be doubtthere must be dangerthere must be difficulty and if as the poet says the course of ardent affection never does run smooth it is perhaps because without some intervening obstacle that which is called the romantic passion of love in its high poetical character and colouring can hardly have an existenceany more than there can be a current in a river without the stream being narrowed by steep banks or checked by opposing rocks  let not those however who enter into a union for life without those embarrassments which delight a darsie latimer or a lydia languish and which are perhaps necessary to excite an enthusiastic passion in breasts more firm than theirs augur worse of their future happiness because their own alliance is formed under calmer auspices mutual esteem an intimate knowledge of each others character seen as in their case undisguised by the mists of too partial passiona suitable proportion of parties in rank and fortune in taste and pursuitsare more frequently found in a marriage of reason than in a union of romantic attachment where the imagination which probably created the virtues and accomplishments with which it invested the beloved object is frequently afterwards employed in magnifying the mortifying consequences of its own delusion and exasperating all the stings of disappointment those who follow the banners of reason are like the welldisciplined battalion which wearing a more sober uniform and making a less dazzling show than the light troops commanded by imagination enjoy more safety and even more honour in the conflicts of human life all this however is foreign to our present purpose  uncertain in what manner to address her whom he had been lately so anxious to meet with and embarrassed by a teteatete to which his own timid inexperience gave some awkwardness the party had proceeded more than a hundred yards before darsie assumed courage to accost or even to look at his companion sensible however of the impropriety of his silence he turned to speak to her and observing that although she wore her mask there was something like disappointment and dejection in her manner he was moved by selfreproach for his own coldness and hastened to address her in the kindest tone he could assume  you must think me cruelly deficient in gratitude miss lilias that i have been thus long in your company without thanking you for the interest which you have deigned to take in my unfortunate affairs  i am glad you have at length spoken she said though i owe it is more coldly than i expected miss lilias deign to take interest in whom dear darsie can i take interest but in you and why do you put this barrier of ceremony betwixt us whom adverse circumstances have already separated for such a length of time  darsie was again confounded at the extra candour if we may use the term of this frank avowal one must love partridge very well thought he to accept it when thrown in ones faceif this is not plain speaking there is no such place as downright dunstable in being  embarrassed with these reflections and himself of a nature fancifully almost fastidiously delicate he could only in reply stammer forth an acknowledgement of his companions goodness and his own gratitude she answered in a tone partly sorrowful and partly impatient repeating with displeased emphasis the only distinct words he had been able to bring forthgoodnessgratitudeo darsie should these be the phrases between you and me alas i am too sure you are displeased with me though i cannot even guess on what account perhaps you think i have been too free in venturing upon my visit to your friend but then remember it was in your behalf and that i knew no better way to put you on your guard against the misfortunes and restraint which you have been subjected to and are still enduring  dear ladysaid darsie rallying his recollection and suspicious of some error in apprehensiona suspicion which his mode of address seemed at once to communicate to lilias for she interrupted him  lady dear lady for whom or for what in heavens name do you take me that you address me so formally  had the question been asked in that enchanted hall in fairyland where all interrogations must be answered with absolute sincerity darsie had certainly replied that he took her for the most frankhearted and ultraliberal lass that had ever lived since mother eve eat the pippin without paring but as he was still on middleearth and free to avail himself of a little polite deceit he barely answered that he believed he had the honour of speaking to the niece of mr redgauntlet  surely she replied but were it not as easy for you to have said to your own only sister  darsie started in his saddle as if he had received a pistolshot  my sister he exclaimed  and you did not know it then said she i thought your reception of me was cold and indifferent  a kind and cordial embrace took place betwixt the relatives and so light was darsies spirit that he really felt himself more relieved by getting quit of the embarrassments of the last halfhour during which he conceived himself in danger of being persecuted by the attachment of a forward girl than disappointed by the vanishing of so many daydreams as he had been in the habit of encouraging during the time when the greenmantled maiden was goddess of his idolatry he had been already flung from his romantic pegasus and was too happy at length to find himself with bones unbroken though with his back on the ground he was besides with all his whims and follies a generous kindhearted youth and was delighted to acknowledge so beautiful and amiable a relative and to assure her in the warmest terms of his immediate affection and future protection so soon as they should be extricated from their present situation smiles and tears mingled on liliass cheeks like showers and sunshine in april weather  out on me she said that i should be so childish as to cry at what makes me so sincerely happy since god knows familylove is what my heart has most longed after and to which it has been most a stranger my uncle says that you and i darsie are but half redgauntlets and that the metal of which our fathers family was made has been softened to effeminacy in our mothers offspring  alas said darsie i know so little of our family story that i almost doubted that i belonged to the house of redgauntlet although the chief of the family himself intimated so much to me  the chief of the family said lilias you must know little of your own descent indeed if you mean my uncle by that expression you yourself my dear darsie are the heir and representative of our ancient house for our father was the elder brotherthat brave and unhappy sir henry darsie redgauntlet who suffered at carlisle in the year 1746 he took the name of darsie in conjunction with his own from our mother heiress to a cumberland family of great wealth and antiquity of whose large estates you are the undeniable heir although those of your father have been involved in the general doom of forfeiture but all this must be necessarily unknown to you  indeed i hear it for the first time in my life answered darsie  and you knew not that i was your sister said lilias no wonder you received me so coldly what a strange wild forward young person you must have thought memixing myself in the fortunes of a stranger whom i had only once spoken tocorresponding with him by signsgood heaven what can you have supposed me  and how should i have come to the knowledge of our connexion said darsie you are aware i was not acquainted with it when we danced together at brokenburn  i saw that with concern and fain i would have warned you answered lilias but i was closely watched and before i could find or make an opportunity of coming to a full explanation with you on a subject so agitating i was forced to leave the room what i did say was you may remember a caution to leave the southern border for i foresaw what has since happened but since my uncle has had you in his power i never doubted he had communicated to you our whole family history  he has left me to learn it from you lilias and assure yourself that i will hear it with more pleasure from your lips than from his i have no reason to be pleased with his conduct towards me  of that said lilias you will judge better when you have heard what i have to tell you and she began her communication in the following manner     chapter xviii  narrative of darsie latimer continued  the house of redgauntlet said the young lady has for centuries been supposed to lie under a doom which has rendered vain their courage their talents their ambition and their wisdom often making a figure in history they have been ever in the situation of men striving against both wind and tide who distinguish themselves by their desperate exertions of strength and their persevering endurance of toil but without being able to advance themselves upon their course by either vigour or resolution they pretend to trace this fatality to a legendary history which i may tell you at a less busy moment  darsie intimated that he had already heard the tragic story of sir alberick redgauntlet  i need only say then proceeded lilias that our father and uncle felt the family doom in its full extent they were both possessed of considerable property which was largely increased by our fathers marriage and were both devoted to the service of the unhappy house of stuart but as our mother at least supposed family considerations might have withheld her husband from joining openly in the affair of 1745 had not the high influence which the younger brother possessed over the elder from his more decided energy of character hurried him along with himself into that undertaking  when therefore the enterprise came to the fatal conclusion which bereaved our father of his life and consigned his brother to exile lady redgauntlet fled from the north of england determined to break off all communication with her late husbands family particularly his brother whom she regarded as having by their insane political enthusiasm been the means of his untimely death and determined that you my brother an infant and that i to whom she had just given birth should be brought up as adherents of the present dynasty perhaps she was too hasty in this determinationtoo timidly anxious to exclude if possible from the knowledge of the very spot where we existed a relation so nearly connected with us as our fathers only brother but you must make allowance for what she had suffered see brother she said pulling her glove off these five bloodspecks on my arm are a mark by which mysterious nature has impressed on an unborn infant a record of its fathers violent death and its mothers miseries several persons have brought down to these days the impressions which nature had thus recorded when they were yet babes unborn one lady of quality whose father was long under sentence of death previous to the rebellion was marked on the back of the neck by the sign of a broad axe another whose kinsmen had been slain in battle and died on the scaffold to the number of seven bore a child spattered on the right shoulder and down the arm with scarlet drops as if of blood many other instances might be quoted  you were not then born when my father suffered said darsie  alas no she replied nor were you a twelvemonth old it was no wonder that my mother after going through such scenes of agony became irresistibly anxious for the sake of her childrenof her son in particular the more especially as the late sir henry her husband had by a settlement of his affairs confided the custody of the persons of her children as well as the estates which descended to them independently of those which fell under his forfeiture to his brother hugh in whom he placed unlimited confidence  but my mother had no reason to fear the operation of such a deed conceived in favour of an attainted man said darsie  true replied lilias but our uncles attainder might have been reversed like that of so many other persons and our mother who both feared and hated him lived in continual terror that this would be the case and that she should see the author as she thought him of her husbands death come armed with legal powers and in a capacity to use them for the purpose of tearing her children from her protection besides she feared even in his incapacitated condition the adventurous and pertinacious spirit of her brotherinlaw hugh redgauntlet and felt assured that he would make some attempt to possess himself of the persons of the children on the other hand our uncle whose proud disposition might perhaps have been soothed by the offer of her confidence revolted against the distrustful and suspicious manner in which lady darsie redgauntlet acted towards him she basely abused he said the unhappy circumstances in which he was placed in order to deprive him of his natural privilege of protecting and educating the infants whom nature and law and the will of their father had committed to his charge and he swore solemnly he would not submit to such an injury report of his threats was made to lady redgauntlet and tended to increase those fears which proved but too well founded while you and i children at that time of two or three years old were playing together in a walled orchard adjacent to our mothers residence which she had fixed somewhere in devonshire my uncle suddenly scaled the wall with several men and i was snatched up and carried off to a boat which waited for them my mother however flew to your rescue and as she seized on and held you fast my uncle could not as he has since told me possess himself of your person without using unmanly violence to his brothers widow of this he was incapable and as people began to assemble upon my mothers screaming he withdrew after darting upon you and her one of those fearful looks which it is said remain with our family as a fatal bequest of sir alberick our ancestor  i have some recollection of the scuffle which you mention said darsie and i think it was my uncle himself since my uncle he is who recalled the circumstance to my mind on a late occasion i can now account for the guarded seclusion under which my poor mother livedfor her frequent tears her starts of hysterical alarm and her constant and deep melancholy poor lady what a lot was hers and what must have been her feelings when it approached to a close  it was then that she adopted said lilias every precaution her ingenuity could suggest to keep your very existence concealed from the person whom she fearednay from yourself for she dreaded as she is said often to have expressed herself that the wildfire blood of redgauntlet would urge you to unite your fortunes to those of your uncle who was well known still to carry on political intrigues which most other persons had considered as desperate it was also possible that he as well as others might get his pardon as government showed every year more lenity towards the remnant of the jacobites and then he might claim the custody of your person as your legal guardian either of these events she considered as the direct road to your destruction  i wonder she had not claimed the protection of chancery for me said darsie or confided me to the care of some powerful friend  she was on indifferent terms with her relations on account of her marriage with our father said lilias and trusted more to secreting you from your uncles attempts than to any protection which law might afford against them perhaps she judged unwisely but surely not unnaturally for one rendered irritable by so many misfortunes and so many alarms samuel griffiths an eminent banker and a worthy clergyman now dead were i believe the only persons whom she intrusted with the execution of her last will and my uncle believes that she made them both swear to observe profound secrecy concerning your birth and pretensions until you should come to the age of majority and in the meantime to breed you up in the most private way possible and that which was most likely to withdraw you from my uncles observation  and i have no doubt said darsie that betwixt change of name and habitation they might have succeeded perfectly but for the accidentlucky or unlucky i know not which to term itwhich brought me to brokenburn and into contact with mr redgauntlet i see also why i was warned against england for in england  in england alone if i understand rightly said miss redgauntlet the claims of your uncle to the custody of your person could have been enforced in case of his being replaced in the ordinary rights of citizenship either by the lenity of the government or by some change in it in scotland where you possess no property i understand his authority might have been resisted and measures taken to put you under the protection of the law but pray think it not unlucky that you have taken the step of visiting brokenburni feel confident that the consequences must be ultimately fortunate for have they not already brought us into contact with each other  so saying she held out her hand to her brother who grasped it with a fondness of pressure very different from the manner in which they first clasped hands that morning there was a moments pause while the hearts of both were overflowing with a feeling of natural affection to which circumstances had hitherto rendered them strangers  at length darsie broke silence i am ashamed he said my dearest lilias that i have suffered you to talk so long about matters concerning myself only while i remain ignorant of your story and your present situation  the former is none of the most interesting nor the latter the most safe or agreeable answered lilias but now my dearest brother i shall have the inestimable support of your countenance and affection and were i but sure that we could weather the formidable crisis which i find so close at hand i should have little apprehensions for the future  let me know said darsie what our present situation is and rely upon my utmost exertions both in your defence and my own for what reason can my uncle desire to detain me a prisoner if in mere opposition to the will of my mother she has long been no more and i see not why he should wish at so much trouble and risk to interfere with the free will of one to whom a few months will give a privilege of acting for himself with which he will have no longer any pretence to interfere  my dearest arthur answered liliasfor that name as well as darsie properly belongs to youit is the leading feature in my uncles character that he has applied every energy of his powerful mind to the service of the exiled family of stuart the death of his brother the dilapidation of his own fortunes have only added to his hereditary zeal for the house of stuart a deep and almost personal hatred against the present reigning family he is in short a political enthusiast of the most dangerous character and proceeds in his agency with as much confidence as if he felt himself the very atlas who is alone capable of supporting a sinking cause  and where or how did you my lilias educated doubtless under his auspices learn to have a different view of such subjects  by a singular chance replied lilias in the nunnery where my uncle placed me although the abbess was a person exactly after his own heart my education as a pensioner devolved much on an excellent old mother who had adopted the tenets of the jansenists with perhaps a still further tendency towards the reformed doctrines than those of port royal the mysterious secrecy with which she inculcated these tenets gave them charms to my young mind and i embraced them the rather that they were in direct opposition to the doctrines of the abbess whom i hated so much for her severity that i felt a childish delight in setting her control at defiance and contradicting in my secret soul all that i was openly obliged to listen to with reverence freedom of religious opinion brings on i suppose freedom of political creed for i had no sooner renounced the popes infallibility than i began to question the doctrine of hereditary and indefeasible right in short strange as it may seem i came out of a parisian convent not indeed an instructed whig and protestant but with as much inclination to be so as if i had been bred up like you within the presbyterian sound of saint giless chimes  more so perhaps replied darsie for the nearer the churchthe proverb is somewhat musty but how did these liberal opinions of yours agree with the very opposite prejudices of my uncle  they would have agreed like fire and water answered lilias had i suffered mine to become visible but as that would have subjected me to constant reproach and upbraiding or worse i took great care to keep my own secret so that occasional censures for coldness and lack of zeal for the good cause were the worst i had to undergo and these were bad enough  i applaud your caution said darsie  you have reason replied his sister but i got so terrible a specimen of my uncles determination of character before i had been acquainted with him for much more than a week that it taught me at what risk i should contradict his humour i will tell you the circumstances for it will better teach you to appreciate the romantic and resolved nature of his character than anything which i could state of his rashness and enthusiasm  after i had been many a long year at the convent i was removed from thence and placed with a meagre old scottish lady of high rank the daughter of an unfortunate person whose head had in the year 1715 been placed on temple bar she subsisted on a small pension from the french court aided by an occasional gratuity from the stuarts to which the annuity paid for my board formed a desirable addition she was not illtempered nor very covetousneither beat me nor starved mebut she was so completely trammelled by rank and prejudices so awfully profound in genealogy and so bitterly keen poor lady in british politics that i sometimes thought it pity that the hanoverians who murdered as she used to tell me her poor dear father had left his dear daughter in the land of the living delighted therefore was i when my uncle made his appearance and abruptly announced his purpose of conveying me to england my extravagant joy at the idea of leaving lady rachel rougedragon was somewhat qualified by observing the melancholy look lofty demeanour and commanding tone of my near relative he held more communication with me on the journey however than consisted with his taciturn demeanour in general and seemed anxious to ascertain my tone of character and particularly in point of courage now though i am a tamed redgauntlet yet i have still so much of our family spirit as enables me to be as composed in danger as most of my sex and upon two occasions in the course of our journeya threatened attack by banditti and the overturn of our carriagei had the fortune so to conduct myself as to convey to my uncle a very favourable idea of my intrepidity probably this encouraged him to put in execution the singular scheme which he had in agitation  ere we reached london we changed our means of conveyance and altered the route by which we approached the city more than once then like a hare which doubles repeatedly at some distance from the seat she means to occupy and at last leaps into her form from a distance so great as she can clear by a spring we made a forced march and landed in private and obscure lodgings in a little old street in westminster not far from the cloisters  on the morning of the day on which we arrived my uncle went abroad and did not return for some hours meantime i had no other amusement than to listen to the tumult of noises which succeeded each other or reigned in confusion together during the whole morning paris i had thought the most noisy capital in the world but paris seemed midnight silence compared to london cannon thundered near and at a distancedrums trumpets and military music of every kind rolled flourished and pierced the clouds almost without intermission to fill up the concert bells pealed incessantly from a hundred steeples the acclamations of an immense multitude were heard from time to time like the roaring of a mighty ocean and all this without my being able to glean the least idea of what was going on for the windows of our apartment looked upon a waste backyard which seemed totally deserted my curiosity became extreme for i was satisfied at length that it must be some festival of the highest order which called forth these incessant sounds  my uncle at length returned and with him a man of an exterior singularly unprepossessing i need not describe him to you fordo not look roundhe rides behind us at this moment  that respectable person mr cristal nixon i suppose said darsie  the same answered lilias make no gesture that may intimate we are speaking of him  darsie signified that he understood her and she pursued her relation  they were both in full dress and my uncle taking a bundle from nixon said to me lilias i am come to carry you to see a grand ceremonyput on as hastily as you can the dress you will find in that parcel and prepare to attend me i found a female dress splendid and elegant but somewhat bordering upon the antique fashion it might be that of england i thought and i went to my apartment full of curiosity and dressed myself with all speed  my uncle surveyed me with attentionshe may pass for one of the flowergirls he said to nixon who only answered with a nod  we left the house together and such was their knowledge of the lanes courts and bypaths that though there was the roar of a multitude in the broad streets those which we traversed were silent and deserted and the strollers whom we met tired of gazing upon gayer figures scarcely honoured us with a passing look although at any other time we should among these vulgar suburbs have attracted a troublesome share of observation we crossed at length a broad street where many soldiers were on guard while others exhausted with previous duty were eating drinking smoking and sleeping beside their piled arms  one day nixon whispered my uncle we will make these redcoated gentry stand to their muskets more watchfully  or it will be the worse for them answered his attendant in a voice as unpleasant as his physiognomy  unquestioned and unchallenged by any one we crossed among the guards and nixon tapped thrice at a small postern door in a huge ancient building which was straight before us it opened and we entered without my perceiving by whom we were admitted a few dark and narrow passages at length conveyed us into an immense gothic hall the magnificence of which baffles my powers of description  it was illuminated by ten thousand wax lights whose splendour at first dazzled my eyes coming as we did from these dark and secret avenues but when my sight began to become steady how shall i describe what i beheld beneath were huge ranges of tables occupied by princes and nobles in their robes of statehigh officers of the crown wearing their dresses and badges of authorityreverend prelates and judges the sages of the church and law in their more sombre yet not less awful robeswith others whose antique and striking costume announced their importance though i could not even guess who they might be but at length the truth burst on me at onceit was and the murmurs around confirmed it the coronation feast at a table above the rest and extending across the upper end of the hall sat enthroned the youthful sovereign himself surrounded by the princes of the blood and other dignitaries and receiving the suit and homage of his subjects heralds and pursuivants blazing in their fantastic yet splendid armorial habits and pages of honour gorgeously arrayed in the garb of other days waited upon the princely banqueters in the galleries with which this spacious hall was surrounded shone all and more than all that my poor imagination could conceive of what was brilliant in riches or captivating in beauty countless rows of ladies whose diamonds jewels and splendid attire were their least powerful charms looked down from their lofty seats on the rich scene beneath themselves forming a show as dazzling and as beautiful as that of which they were spectators under these galleries and behind the banqueting tables were a multitude of gentlemen dressed as if to attend a court but whose garb although rich enough to have adorned a royal drawing room could not distinguish them in such a high scene as this amongst these we wandered for a few minutes undistinguished and unregarded i saw several young persons dressed as i was so was under no embarrassment from the singularity of my habit and only rejoiced as i hung on my uncles arm at the magical splendour of such a scene and at his goodness for procuring me the pleasure of beholding it  by and by i perceived that my uncle had acquaintances among those who were under the galleries and seemed like ourselves to be mere spectators of the solemnity they recognized each other with a single word sometimes only with a grip of the handexchanged some private signs doubtlessand gradually formed a little group in the centre of which we were placed  is it not a grand sight lilias said my uncle all the noble and all the wise and all the wealthy of britain are there assembled  it is indeed said i all that my mind could have fancied of regal power and splendour  girl he whisperedand my uncle can make his whispers as terribly emphatic as his thundering voice or his blighting lookall that is noble and worthy in this fair land are there assembledbut it is to bend like slaves and sycophants before the throne of a new usurper  i looked at him and the dark hereditary frown of our unhappy ancestor was black upon his brow  for gods sake i whispered consider where we are  fear nothing he said we are surrounded by friends as he proceeded his strong and muscular frame shook with suppressed agitation see he said yonder bends norfolk renegade to his catholicfaith there stoops the bishop of  traitor to the church of england andshame of shames yonder the gigantic form of errol bows his head before the grandson of his fathers murderer but a sign shall be seen this night amongst themmene mene tekel upharsin shall be read on these walls as distinctly as the spectral handwriting made them visible on those of belshazzar  for gods sake said i dreadfully alarmed it is impossible you can meditate violence in such a presence  none is intended fool he answered nor can the slightest mischance happen provided you will rally your boasted courage and obey my directions but do it coolly and quickly for there are a hundred lives at stake  alas whatcan i do i asked in the utmost terror  only be prompt to execute my bidding said he it is but to lift a glovehere hold this in your handthrow the train of your dress over it be firm composed and readyor at all events i step forward myself  if there is no violence designed i said taking mechanically the iron glove he put into my hand  i could not conceive his meaning but in the excited state of mind in which i beheld him i was convinced that disobedience on my part would lead to some wild explosion i felt from the emergency of the occasion a sudden presence of mind and resolved to do anything that might avert violence and bloodshed i was not long held in suspense a loud flourish of trumpets and the voice of heralds were mixed with the clatter of horses hoofs while a champion armed at all points like those i had read of in romances attended by squires pages and the whole retinue of chivalry pranced forward mounted upon a barbed steed his challenge in defiance of all who dared impeach the title of the new sovereign was recited aloudonce and again  rush in at the third sounding said my uncle to me bring me the paraders gage and leave mine in lieu of it  i could not see how this was to be done as we were surrounded by people on all sides but at the third sounding of the trumpets a lane opened as if by word of command betwixt me and the champion and my uncles voice said now lilias now  with a swift and yet steady step and with a presence of mind for which i have never since been able to account i discharged the perilous commission i was hardly seen i believe as i exchanged the pledges of battle and in an instant retired nobly done my girl said my uncle at whose side i found myself shrouded as i was before by the interposition of the bystanders cover our retreat gentlemen he whispered to those around him  room was made for us to approach the wall which seemed to open and we were again involved in the dark passages through which we had formerly passed in a small anteroom my uncle stopped and hastily muffling me in a mantle which was lying there we passed the guardsthreaded the labyrinth of empty streets and courts and reached our retired lodgings without attracting the least attention  i have often heard said darsie that a female supposed to be a man in disguiseand yet lilias you do not look very masculinehad taken up the champions gauntlet at the present kings coronation and left in its place a gage of battle with a paper offering to accept the combat provided a fair field should be allowed for it i have hitherto considered it as an idle tale i little thought how nearly i was interested in the actors of a scene so daring how could you have courage to go through with it see note 9  had i had leisure for reflection answered his sister i should have refused from a mixture of principle and of fear but like many people who do daring actions i went on because i had not time to think of retreating the matter was little known and it is said the king had commanded that it should not be further inquired intofrom prudence as i suppose and lenity though my uncle chooses to ascribe the forbearance of the elector of hanover as he calls him sometimes to pusillanimity and sometimes to a presumptuous scorn of the faction who opposes his title  and have your subsequent agencies under this frantic enthusiast said darsie equalled this in danger  nonor in importance replied lilias though i have witnessed much of the strange and desperate machinations by which in spite of every obstacle and in contempt of every danger he endeavours to awaken the courage of a broken party i have traversed in his company all england and scotland and have visited the most extraordinary and contrasted scenes now lodging at the castles of the proud gentry of cheshire and wales where the retired aristocrats with opinions as antiquated as their dwellings and their manners still continue to nourish jacobitical principles and the next week perhaps spent among outlawed smugglers or highland banditti i have known my uncle often act the part of a hero and sometimes that of a mere vulgar conspirator and turn himself with the most surprising flexibility into all sorts of shapes to attract proselytes to his cause  which in the present day said darsie he finds i presume no easy task  so difficult said lilias that i believe he has at different times disgusted with the total falling away of some friends and the coldness of others been almost on the point of resigning his undertaking how often i have i known him affect an open brow and a jovial manner joining in the games of the gentry and even in the sports of the common people in order to invest himself with a temporary degree of popularity while in fact his heart was bursting to witness what he called the degeneracy of the times the decay of activity among the aged and the want of zeal in the rising generation after the day has been spent in the hardest exercise he has spent the night in pacing his solitary chamber bewailing the downfall of the cause and wishing for the bullet of dundee or the axe of balmerino  a strange delusion said darsie and it is wonderful that it does not yield to the force of reality  ah but replied lilias realities of late have seemed to flatter his hopes the general dissatisfaction with the peacethe unpopularity of the minister which has extended itself even to the person of his masterthe various uproars which have disturbed the peace of the metropolis and a general state of disgust and disaffection which seems to affect the body of the nation have given unwonted encouragement to the expiring hopes of the jacobites and induced many both at the court of rome and if it can be called so of the pretender to lend a more favourable ear than they had hitherto done to the insinuations of those who like my uncle hope when hope is lost to all but themselves nay i really believe that at this moment they meditate some desperate effort my uncle has been doing all in his power of late to conciliate the affections of those wild communities that dwell on the solway over whom our family possessed a seignorial interest before the forfeiture and amongst whom on the occasion of 1745 our unhappy fathers interest with his own raised a considerable body of men but they are no longer willing to obey his summons and as one apology among others they allege your absence as their natural head and leader this has increased his desire to obtain possession of your person and if he possibly can to influence your mind so as to obtain your authority to his proceedings  that he shall never obtain answered darsie my principles and my prudence alike forbid such a step besides it would be totally unavailing to his purpose whatever these people may pretend to evade your uncles importunities they cannot at this time of day think of subjecting their necks again to the feudal yoke which was effectually broken by the act of 1748 abolishing vassalage and hereditary jurisdictions  aye but that my uncle considers as the act of a usurping government said lilias  like enough he may think so answered her brother for he is a superior and loses his authority by the enactment but the question is what the vassals will think of it who have gained their freedom from feudal slavery and have now enjoyed that freedom for many years however to cut the matter short if five hundred men would rise at the wagging of my finger that finger shall not be raised in a cause which i disapprove of and upon that my uncle may reckon  but you may temporize said lilias upon whom the idea of her uncles displeasure made evidently a strong impressionyou may temporize as most of the gentry in this country do and let the bubble burst of itself for it is singular how few of them venture to oppose my uncle directly i entreat you to avoid direct collision with him to hear you the head of the house of redgauntlet declare against the family of stuart would either break his heart or drive him to some act of desperation  yes but lilias you forget that the consequences of such an act of complaisance might be that the house of redgauntlet and i might lose both our heads at one blow  alas said she i had forgotten that danger i have grown familiar with perilous intrigues as the nurses in a pesthouse are said to become accustomed to the air around them till they forget even that it is noisome  and yet said darsie if i could free myself from him without coming to an open rupture tell me lilias do you think it possible that he can have any immediate attempt in view  to confess the truth answered lilias i cannot doubt that he has there has been an unusual bustle among the jacobites of late they have hopes as i told you from circumstances unconnected with their own strength just before you came to the country my uncles desire to find you out became if possible more eager than everhe talked of men to be presently brought together and of your name and influence for raising them at this very time your first visit to brokenburn took place a suspicion arose in my uncles mind that you might be the youth he sought and it was strengthened by papers and letters which the rascal nixon did not hesitate to take from your pocket yet a mistake might have occasioned a fatal explosion and my uncle therefore posted to edinburgh to follow out the clue he had obtained and fished enough of information from old mr fairford to make him certain that you were the person he sought meanwhile and at the expense of some personal and perhaps too bold exertion i endeavoured through your friend young fairford to put you on your guard  without success said darsie blushing under his mask when he recollected how he had mistaken his sisters meaning  i do not wonder that my warning was fruitless said she the thing was doomed to be besides your escape would have been difficult you were dogged the whole time you were at the shepherds bush and at mount sharon by a spy who scarcely ever left you  the wretch little benjie exclaimed darsie i will wring the monkeys neck round the first time we meet  it was he indeed who gave constant information of your motions to cristal nixon said lilias  and cristal nixoni owe him too a days work in harvest said darsie for i am mistaken if he was not the person that struck me down when i was made prisoner among the rioters  like enough for he has a head and hand for any villany my uncle was very angry about it for though the riot was made to have an opportunity of carrying you off in the confusion as well as to put the fishermen at variance with the public law it would have been his last thought to have injured a hair of your head but nixon has insinuated himself into all my uncles secrets and some of these are so dark and dangerous that though there are few things he would not dare i doubt if he dare quarrel with him and yet i know that of cristal would move my uncle to pass his sword through his body  what is it for heavens sake said darsie i have a particular desire for wishing to know  the old brutal desperado whose face and mind are a libel upon human nature has had the insolence to speak to his masters niece as one whom he was at liberty to admire and when i turned on him with the anger and contempt he merited the wretch grumbled out something as if he held the destiny of our family in his hand  i thank you lilias said darsie eagerlyi thank you with all my heart for this communication i have blamed myself as a christian man for the indescribable longing i felt from the first moment i saw that rascal to send a bullet through his head and now you have perfectly accounted for and justified this very laudable wish i wonder my uncle with the powerful sense you describe him to be possessed of does not see through such a villain  i believe he knows him to be capable of much evil answered liliasselfish obdurate brutal and a manhater but then he conceives him to possess the qualities most requisite for a conspiratorundaunted courage imperturbable coolness and address and inviolable fidelity in the last particular he may be mistaken i have heard nixon blamed for the manner in which our poor father was taken after culloden  another reason for my innate aversion said darsie but i will be on my guard with him  see he observes us closely said lilias what a thing is conscience he knows we are now speaking of him though he cannot have heard a word that we have said  it seemed as if she had guessed truly for cristal nixon at that moment rode up to them and said with an affectation of jocularity which sat very ill on his sullen features come young ladies you have had time enough for your chat this morning and your tongues i think must be tired we are going to pass a village and i must beg you to separateyou miss lilias to ride a little behindand you mrs or miss or master whichever you choose to be called to be jogging a little before  lilias checked her horse without speaking but not until she had given her brother an expressive look recommending caution to which he replied by a signal indicating that he understood and would comply with her request     chapter xix  narrattve of darsie latimer continued  left to his solitary meditations darsie for we will still term sir arthur darsie redgauntlet of that ilk by the name to which the reader is habituated was surprised not only at the alteration of his own state and condition but at the equanimity with which he felt himself disposed to view all these vicissitudes  his feverfit of love had departed like a mornings dream and left nothing behind but a painful sense of shame and a resolution to be more cautious ere he again indulged in such romantic visions his station in society was changed from that of a wandering unowned youth in whom none appeared to take an interest excepting the strangers by whom he had been educated to the heir of a noble house possessed of such influence and such property that it seemed as if the progress or arrest of important political events were likely to depend upon his resolution even this sudden elevation the more than fulfilment of those wishes which had haunted him ever since he was able to form a wish on the subject was contemplated by darsie volatile as his disposition was without more than a few thrills of gratified vanity  it is true there were circumstances in his present situation to counterbalance such high advantages to be a prisoner in the hands of a man so determined as his uncle was no agreeable consideration when he was calculating how he might best dispute his pleasure and refuse to join him in the perilous enterprise which he seemed to meditate outlawed and desperate himself darsie could not doubt that his uncle was surrounded by men capable of anythingthat he was restrained by no personal considerationsand therefore what degree of compulsion he might apply to his brothers son or in what manner he might feel at liberty to punish his contumacy should he disavow the jacobite cause must depend entirely upon the limits of his own conscience and who was to answer for the conscience of a heated enthusiast who considers opposition to the party he has espoused as treason to the welfare of his country after a short interval cristal nixon was pleased to throw some light upon the subject which agitated him  when that grim satellite rode up without ceremony close to darsies side the latter felt his very flesh creep with abhorrence so little was he able to endure his presence since the story of lilias had added to his instinctive hatred of the man  his voice too sounded like that of a screechowl as he said so my young cock of the north you now know it all and no doubt are blessing your uncle for stirring you up to such an honourable action  i will acquaint my uncle with my sentiments on the subject before i make them known to any one else said darsie scarcely prevailing on his tongue to utter even these few words in a civil manner  umph murmured cristal betwixt his teeth close as wax i see and perhaps not quite so pliable but take care my pretty youth he added scornfully hugh redgauntlet will prove a rough coltbreakerhe will neither spare whipcord nor spurrowel i promise you  i have already said mr nixon answered darsie that i will canvass those matters of which my sister has informed me with my uncle himself and with no other person  nay but a word of friendly advice would do you no harm young master replied nixon old redgauntlet is apter at a blow than a wordlikely to bite before he barksthe true man for giving scarborough warning first knock you down then bid you stand so methinks a little kind warning as to consequences were not amiss lest they come upon you unawares  if the warning is really kind mr nixon said the young man i will hear it thankfully and indeed if otherwise i must listen to it whether i will or no since i have at present no choice of company or of conversation  nay i have but little to say said nixon affecting to give to his sullen and dogged manner the appearance of an honest bluntness i am as little apt to throw away words as any one but here is the questionwill you join heart and hand with your uncle or no  what if i should say aye said darsie determined if possible to conceal his resolution from this man  why then said nixon somewhat surprised at the readiness of his answer all will go smooth of courseyou will take share in this noble undertaking and when it succeeds you will exchange your open helmet for an earls coronet perhaps  and how if it fails said darsie  thereafter as it may be said nixon they who play at bowls must meet with rubbers  well but suppose then i have some foolish tenderness for my windpipe and that when my uncle proposes the adventure to me i should say nohow then mr nixon  why then i would have you look to yourself young master there are sharp laws in france against refractory pupilslettres de cachet are easily come by when such men as we are concerned with interest themselves in the matter  but we are not in france said poor darsie through whose blood ran a cold shivering at the idea of a french prison  a fastsailing lugger will soon bring you there though snug stowed under hatches like a cask of moonlight  but the french are at peace with us said darsie and would not dare  why who would ever hear of you interrupted nixon do you imagine that a foreign court would call you up for judgement and put the sentence of imprisonment in the courrier de leurope as they do at the old bailey no no young gentlemanthe gates of the bastille and of mont saint michel and the castle of vincennes move on dd easy hinges when they let folk innot the least jar is heard there are cool cells there for hot headsas calm and quiet and dark as you could wish in bedlamand the dismissal comes when the carpenter brings the prisoners coffin and not sooner  well mr nixon said darsie affecting a cheerfulness which he was far from feeling mine is a hard casea sort of hanging choice you will allowsince i must either offend our own government here and run the risk of my life for doing so or be doomed to the dungeons of another country whose laws i have never offended since i have never trod its soiltell me what you would do if you were in my place  ill tell you that when i am there said nixon and checking his horse fell back to the rear of the little party  it is evident thought the young man that the villain believes me completely noosed and perhaps has the ineffable impudence to suppose that my sister must eventually succeed to the possessions which have occasioned my loss of freedom and that his own influence over the destinies of our unhappy family may secure him possession of the heiress but he shall perish by my hand firsti must now be on the alert to make my escape if possible before i am forced on shipboard blind willie will not i think desert me without an effort on my behalf especially if he has learned that i am the son of his late unhappy patron what a change is mine whilst i possessed neither rank nor fortune i lived safely and unknown under the protection of the kind and respectable friends whose hearts heaven had moved towards me now that i am the head of an honourable house and that enterprises of the most daring character await my decision and retainers and vassals seem ready to rise at my beck my safety consists chiefly in the attachment of a blind stroller  while he was revolving these things in his mind and preparing himself for the interview with his uncle which could not but be a stormy one he saw hugh redgauntlet come riding slowly back to meet them without any attendants cristal nixon rode up as he approached and as they met fixed on him a look of inquiry  the fool crackenthorp said redgauntlet has let strangers into his house some of his smuggling comrades i believe we must ride slowly to give him time to send them packing  did you see any of your friends said cristal  three and have letters from many more they are unanimous on the subject you wot ofand the point must be conceded to them or far as the matter has gone it will go no further  you will hardly bring the father to stoop to his flock said cristal with a sneer  he must and shall answered redgauntlet briefly go to the front cristali would speak with my nephew i trust sir arthur redgauntlet you are satisfied with the manner in which i have discharged my duty to your sister  there can be no fault found to her manners or sentiments answered darsie i am happy in knowing a relative so amiable  i am glad of it answered mr redgauntlet i am no nice judge of womens qualifications and my life has been dedicated to one great object so that since she left france she has had but little opportunity of improvement i have subjected her however as little as possible to the inconveniences and privations of my wandering and dangerous life from time to time she has resided for weeks and months with families of honour and respectability and i am glad that she has in your opinion the manners and behaviour which become her birth  darsie expressed himself perfectly satisfied and there was a little pause which redgauntlet broke by solemnly addressing his nephew  for you my nephew i also hoped to have done much the weakness and timidity of your mother sequestered you from my care or it would have been my pride and happiness to have trained up the son of my unhappy brother in those paths of honour in which our ancestors have always trod  now comes the storm thought darsie to himself and began to collect his thoughts as the cautious master of a vessel furls his sails and makes his ship snug when he discerns the approaching squall  my mothers conduct in respect to me might be misjudged he said but it was founded on the most anxious affection  assuredly said his uncle and i have no wish to reflect on her memory though her mistrust has done so much injury i will not say to me but to the cause of my unhappy country her scheme was i think to have made you that wretched pettifogging being which they still continue to call in derision by the once respectable name of a scottish advocate one of those mongrel things that must creep to learn the ultimate decision of his causes to the bar of a foreign court instead of pleading before the independent and august parliament of his own native kingdom  i did prosecute the study of law for a year or two said darsie but i found i had neither taste nor talents for the science  and left it with scorn doubtless said mr redgauntlet well i now hold up to you my dearest nephew a more worthy object of ambition look eastwarddo you see a monument standing on yonder plain near a hamlet  darsie replied that he did  the hamlet is called burghuponsands and yonder monument is erected to the memory of the tyrant edward i the just hand of providence overtook him on that spot as he was leading his bands to complete the subjugation of scotland whose civil dissensions began under his accursed policy the glorious career of bruce might have been stopped in its outset the field of bannockburn might have remained a bloodless turf if god had not removed in the very crisis the crafty and bold tyrant who had so long been scotlands scourge edwards grave is the cradle of our national freedom it is within sight of that great landmark of our liberty that i have to propose to you an undertaking second in honour and importance to none since the immortal bruce stabbed the red comyn and grasped with his yet bloody hand the independent crown of scotland  he paused for an answer but darsie overawed by the energy of his manner and unwilling to commit himself by a hasty explanation remained silent  i will not suppose said hugh redgauntlet after a pause that you are either so dull as not to comprehend the import of my wordsor so dastardly as to be dismayed by my proposalor so utterly degenerate from the blood and sentiments of your ancestors as not to feel my summons as the horse hears the wartrumpet  i will not pretend to misunderstand you sir said darsie but an enterprise directed against a dynasty now established for three reigns requires strong arguments both in point of justice and of expediency to recommend it to men of conscience and prudence  i will not said redgauntlet while his eyes sparkled with angeri will not hear you speak a word against the justice of that enterprise for which your oppressed country calls with the voice of a parent entreating her children for aidor against that noble revenge which your fathers blood demands from his dishonoured grave his skull is yet standing over the rikargate the northern gate of carlisle was long garnished with the heads of the scottish rebels executed in 1746 and even its bleak and mouldered jaws command you to be a man i ask you in the name of god and of your country will you draw your sword and go with me to carlisle were it but to lay your fathers head now the perch of the obscene owl and carrion crow and the scoff of every ribald clown in consecrated earth as befits his long ancestry  darsie unprepared to answer an appeal urged with so much passion and not doubting a direct refusal would cost him his liberty or life was again silent  i see said his uncle in a more composed tone that it is not deficiency of spirit but the grovelling habits of a confined education among the poorspirited class you were condemned to herd with that keeps you silent you scarce yet believe yourself a redgauntlet your pulse has not yet learned the genuine throb that answers to the summons of honour and of patriotism  i trust replied darsie at last that i shall never be found indifferent to the call of either but to answer them with effecteven were i convinced that they now sounded in my eari must see some reasonable hope of success in the desperate enterprise in which you would involve me i look around me and i see a settled governmentan established authoritya born briton on the thronethe very highland mountaineers upon whom alone the trust of the exiled family reposed assembled into regiments which act under the orders of the existing dynasty the highland regiments were first employed by the celebrated earl of chatham who assumed to himself no small degree of praise for having called forth to the support of the country and the government the valour which had been too often directed against both france has been utterly dismayed by the tremendous lessons of the last war and will hardly provoke another all without and within the kingdom is adverse to encountering a hopeless struggle and you alone sir seem willing to undertake a desperate enterprise  and would undertake it were it ten times more desperate and have agitated it when ten times the obstacles were interposed have i forgot my brothers blood can idare i even now repeat the pater noster since my enemies and the murderers remain unforgiven is there an art i have not practiseda privation to which i have not submitted to bring on the crisis which i now behold arrived have i not been a vowed and a devoted man forgoing every comfort of social life renouncing even the exercise of devotion unless when i might name in prayer my prince and country submitting to everything to make converts to this noble cause have i done all this and shall i now stop short darsie was about to interrupt him but he pressed his hand affectionately upon his shoulder and enjoining or rather imploring silence peace he said heir of my ancestors fameheir of all my hopes and wishes peace son of my slaughtered brother i have sought for thee and mourned for thee as a mother for an only child do not let me again lose you in the moment when you are restored to my hopes believe me i distrust so much my own impatient temper that i entreat you as the dearest boon do naught to awaken it at this crisis  darsie was not sorry to reply that his respect for the person of his relation would induce him to listen to all which he had to apprise him of before he formed any definite resolution upon the weighty subjects of deliberation which he proposed to him  deliberation repeated redgauntlet impatiently and yet it is not ill said i wish there had been more warmth in thy reply arthur but i must recollect were an eagle bred in a falcons mew and hooded like a reclaimed hawk he could not at first gaze steadily on the sun listen to me my dearest arthur the state of this nation no more implies prosperity than the florid colour of a feverish patient is a symptom of health all is false and hollow the apparent success of chathams administration has plunged the country deeper in debt than all the barren acres of canada are worth were they as fertile as yorkshirethe dazzling lustre of the victories of minden and quebec have been dimmed by the disgrace of the hasty peaceby the war england at immense expense gained nothing but honour and that she has gratuitously resigned many eyes formerly cold and indifferent are now looking towards the line of our ancient and rightful monarchs as the only refuge in the approaching stormthe rich are alarmedthe nobles are disgustedthe populace are inflamedand a band of patriots whose measures are more safe than their numbers are few have resolved to set up king charless standard  but the military said darsiehow can you with a body of unarmed and disorderly insurgents propose to encounter a regular army the highlanders are now totally disarmed  in a great measure perhaps answered redgauntlet but the policy which raised the highland regiments has provided for that we have already friends in these corps nor can we doubt for a moment what their conduct will be when the white cockade is once more mounted the rest of the standing army has been greatly reduced since the peace and we reckon confidently on our standard being joined by thousands of the disbanded troops  alas said darsie and is it upon such vague hopes as these the inconstant humour of a crowd or of a disbanded soldiery that men of honour are invited to risk their families their property their life  men of honour boy said redgauntlet his eyes glancing with impatience set life property family and all at stake when that honour commands it we are not now weaker than when seven men landing in the wilds of moidart shook the throne of the usurper till it totteredwon two pitched fields besides overrunning one kingdom and the half of another and but for treachery would have achieved what their venturous successors are now to attempt in their turn  and will such an attempt be made in serious earnest said darsie excuse me my uncle if i can scarce believe a fact so extraordinary will there really be found men of rank and consequence sufficient to renew the adventure of 1745  i will not give you my confidence by halves sir arthur replied his unclelook at that scrollwhat say you to these namesare they not the flower of the western shiresof wales of scotland  the paper contains indeed the names of many that are great and noble replied darsie after perusing it but  but what asked his uncle impatiently do you doubt the ability of those nobles and gentlemen to furnish the aid in men and money at which they are rated  not their ability certainly said darsie for of that i am no competent judge but i see in this scroll the name of sir arthur darsie redgauntlet of that ilk rated at a hundred men and upwardsi certainly am ignorant how he is to redeem that pledge  i will be responsible for the men replied hugh redgauntlet  but my dear uncle added darsie i hope for your sake that the other individuals whose names are here written have had more acquaintance with your plan than i have been indulged with  for thee and thine i can be myself responsible said redgauntlet for if thou hast not the courage to head the force of thy house the leading shall pass to other hands and thy inheritance shall depart from thee like vigour and verdure from a rotten branch for these honourable persons a slight condition there is which they annex to their friendshipsomething so trifling that it is scarce worthy of mention this boon granted to them by him who is most interested there is no question they will take the field in the manner there stated  again darsie perused the paper and felt himself still less inclined to believe that so many men of family and fortune were likely to embark in an enterprise so fatal it seemed as if some rash plotter had put down at a venture the names of all whom common report tainted with jacobitism or if it was really the act of the individuals named he suspected that they must be aware of some mode of excusing themselves from compliance with its purport it was impossible he thought that englishmen of large fortune who had failed to join charles when he broke into england at the head of a victorious army should have the least thoughts of encouraging a descent when circumstances were so much less propitious he therefore concluded the enterprise would fall to pieces of itself and that his best way was in the meantime to remain silent unless the actual approach of a crisis which might however never arrive should compel him to give a downright refusal to his uncles proposition and if in the interim some door for escape should be opened he resolved within himself not to omit availing himself of it  hugh redgauntlet watched his nephews looks for some time and then as if arriving from some other process of reasoning at the same conclusion he said i have told you sir arthur that i do not urge your immediate accession to my proposal indeed the consequences of a refusal would be so dreadful to yourself so destructive to all the hopes which i have nursed that i would not risk by a moments impatience the object of my whole life yes arthur i have been a selfdenying hermit at one timeat another the apparent associate of outlaws and desperadoesat another the subordinate agent of men whom i felt in every way my inferiorsnot for any selfish purpose of my own no not even to win for myself the renown of being the principal instrument in restoring my king and freeing my country my first wish on earth is for that restoration and that freedommy next that my nephew the representative of my house and of the brother of my love may have the advantage and the credit of all my efforts in the good cause but he added darting on darsie one of his withering frowns if scotland and my fathers house cannot stand and flourish together then perish the very name of redgauntlet perish the son of my brother with every recollection of the glories of my family of the affections of my youth rather than my countrys cause should be injured in the tithing of a barleycorn the spirit of sir alberick is alive within me at this moment he continued drawing up his stately form and sitting erect in his saddle while he pressed his finger against his forehead and if you yourself crossed my path in opposition i swear by the mark that darkens my brow that a new deed should be donea new doom should be deserved  he was silent and his threats were uttered in a tone of voice so deeply resolute that darsies heart sank within him when he reflected on the storm of passion which he must encounter if he declined to join his uncle in a project to which prudence and principle made him equally adverse he had scarce any hope left but in temporizing until he could make his escape and resolved to avail himself for that purpose of the delay which his uncle seemed not unwilling to grant the stern gloomy look of his companion became relaxed by degrees and presently afterwards he made a sign to miss redgauntlet to join the party and began a forced conversation on ordinary topics in the course of which darsie observed that his sister seemed to speak under the most cautious restraint weighing every word before she uttered it and always permitting her uncle to give the tone to the conversation though of the most trifling kind this seemed to him such an opinion had he already entertained of his sisters good sense and firmness the strongest proof he had yet received of his uncles peremptory character since he saw it observed with so much deference by a young person whose sex might have given her privileges and who seemed by no means deficient either in spirit or firmness  the little cavalcade was now approaching the house of father crackenthorp situated as the reader knows by the side of the solway and not far distant front a rude pier near which lay several fishingboats which frequently acted in a different capacity the house of the worthy publican was also adapted to the various occupations which he carried on being a large scrambling assemblage of cottages attached to a house of two stories roofed with flags of sandstonethe original mansion to which the extensions of mr crackenthorps trade had occasioned his making many additions instead of the single long wateringtrough which usually distinguishes the front of the english publichouse of the second class there were three conveniences of that kind for the use as the landlord used to say of the troophorses when the soldiers came to search his house while a knowing leer and a nod let you understand what species of troops he was thinking of a huge ashtree before the door which had reared itself to a great size and height in spite of the blasts from the neighbouring solway overshadowed as usual the alebench as our ancestors called it where though it was still early in the day several fellows who seemed to be gentlemens servants were drinking beer and smoking one or two of them wore liveries which seemed known to mr redgauntlet for he muttered between his teeth fools fools were they on a march to hell they must have their rascals in livery with them that the whole world might know who were going to be damned  as he thus muttered he drew bridle before the door of the place from which several other lounging guests began to issue to look with indolent curiosity as usual upon an arrival  redgauntlet sprang from his horse and assisted his niece to dismount but forgetting perhaps his nephews disguise he did not pay him the attention which his female dress demanded  the situation of darsie was indeed something awkward for cristal nixon out of caution perhaps to prevent escape had muffled the extreme folds of the ridingskirt with which he was accoutred around his ankles and under his feet and there secured it with large corkingpins we presume that gentlemencavaliers may sometimes cast their eyes to that part of the person of the fair equestrians whom they chance occasionally to escort and if they will conceive their own feet like darsies muffled in such a labyrinth of folds and amplitude of robe as modesty doubtless induces the fair creatures to assume upon such occasions they will allow that on a first attempt they might find some awkwardness in dismounting darsie at least was in such a predicament for not receiving adroit assistance from the attendant of mr redgauntlet he stumbled as he dismounted from the horse and might have had a bad fall had it not been broken by the gallant interposition of a gentleman who probably was on his part a little surprised at the solid weight of the distressed fair one whom he had the honour to receive in his embrace but what was his surprise to that of darsie when the hurry of the moment and of the accident permitted him to see that it was his friend alan fairford in whose arms he found himself a thousand apprehensions rushed on him mingled with the full career of hope and joy inspired by the unexpected appearance of his beloved friend at the very crisis it seemed of his fate  he was about to whisper in his ear cautioning him at the same time to be silent yet he hesitated for a second or two to effect his purpose since should redgauntlet take the alarm from any sudden exclamation on the part of alan there was no saying what consequences might ensue  ere he could decide what was to be done redgauntlet who had entered the house returned hastily followed by cristal nixon ill release you of the charge of this young lady sir he said haughtily to alan fairford whom he probably did not recognize  i had no desire to intrude sir replied alan the ladys situation seemed to require assistanceandbut have i not the honour to speak to mr herries of birrenswork  you are mistaken sir said redgauntlet turning short off and making a sign with his hand to cristal who hurried darsie however unwillingly into the house whispering in his ear come miss let us have no making of acquaintance from the windows ladies of fashion must be private show us a room father crackenthorp  so saying he conducted darsie into the house interposing at the same time his person betwixt the supposed young lady and the stranger of whom he was suspicious so as to make communication by signs impossible as they entered they heard the sound of a fiddle in the stonefloored and wellsanded kitchen through which they were about to follow their corpulent host and where several people seemed engaged in dancing to its strains  dn thee said nixon to crackenthorp would you have the lady go through all the mob of the parish hast thou no more private way to our sittingroom  none that is fit for my travelling answered the landlord laying his hand on his portly stomach i am not tom turnpenny to creep like a lizard through keyholes  so saying he kept moving on through the revellers in the kitchen and nixon holding darsie by his arm as if to offer the lady support but in all probability to frustrate any effort at escape moved through the crowd which presented a very motley appearance consisting of domestic servants country fellows seamen and other idlers whom wandering willie was regaling with his music  to pass another friend without intimation of his presence would have been actual pusillanimity and just when they were passing the blind mans elevated seat darsie asked him with some emphasis whether he could not play a scottish air the mans face had been the instant before devoid of all sort of expression going through his performance like a clown through a beautiful country too much accustomed to consider it as a task to take any interest in the performance and in fact scarce seeming to hear the noise that he was creating in a word he might at the time have made a companion to my friend wilkies inimitable blind crowder but with wandering willie this was only an occasional and a rare fit of dullness such as will at times creep over all the professors of the fine arts arising either from fatigue or contempt of the present audience or that caprice which so often tempts painters and musicians and great actors in the phrase of the latter to walk through their part instead of exerting themselves with the energy which acquired their fame but when the performer heard the voice of darsie his countenance became at once illuminated and showed the complete mistake of those who suppose that the principal point of expression depends upon the eyes with his face turned to the point from which the sound came his upper lip a little curved and quivering with agitation and with a colour which surprise and pleasure had brought at once into his faded cheek he exchanged the humdrum hornpipe which he had been sawing out with reluctant and lazy bow for the fine scottish air    youre welcome charlie stuart  which flew from his strings as if by inspiration and after a breathless pause of admiration among the audience was received with a clamour of applause which seemed to show that the name and tendency as well as the execution of the tune was in the highest degree acceptable to all the party assembled  in the meantime cristal nixon still keeping hold of darsie and following the landlord forced his way with some difficulty through the crowded kitchen and entered a small apartment on the other side of it where they found lilias redgauntlet already seated here nixon gave way to his suppressed resentment and turning sternly on crackenthorp threatened him with his masters severest displeasure because things were in such bad order to receive his family when he had given such special advice that he desired to be private but father crackenthorp was not a man to be browbeaten  why brother nixon thou art angry this morning he replied hast risen from thy wrong side i think you know as well as i that most of this mob is of the squires own makinggentlemen that come with their servants and so forth to meet him in the way of business as old tom turnpenny saysthe very last that came was sent down with dick gardener from fairladies  but the blind scraping scoundrel yonder said nixon how dared you take such a rascal as that across your threshold at such a time as this if the squire should dream you have a thought of peachingi am only speaking for your good father crackenthorp  why look ye brother nixon said crackenthorp turning his quid with great composure the squire is a very worthy gentleman and ill never deny it but i am neither his servant nor his tenant and so he need send me none of his orders till he hears i have put on his livery as for turning away folk from my door i might as well plug up the aletap and pull down the signand as for peaching and such like the squire will find the folk here are as honest to the full as those he brings with him  how you impudent lump of tallow said nixon what do you mean by that  nothing said crackenthorp but that i can tour out as well as anotheryou understand mekeep good lights in my upper storyknow a thing or two more than most folk in this country if folk will come to my house on dangerous errands egad they shall not find joe crackenthorp a catspaw ill keep myself clear you may depend on it and let every man answer for his own actionsthats my way anything wanted master nixon  noyesbegone said nixon who seemed embarrassed with the landlords contumacy yet desirous to conceal the effect it produced on him  the door was no sooner closed on crackenthorp than miss redgauntlet addressing nixon commanded him to leave the room and go to his proper place  how madam said the fellow sullenly yet with an air of respect would you have your uncle pistol me for disobeying his orders  he may perhaps pistol you for some other reason if you do not obey mine said lilias composedly  you abuse your advantage over me madami really dare not goi am on guard over this other miss here and if i should desert my post my life were not worth five minutes purchase  then know your post sir said lilias and watch on the outside of the door you have no commission to listen to our private conversation i suppose begone sir without further speech or remonstrance or i will tell my uncle that which you would have reason to repent be should know  the fellow looked at her with a singular expression of spite mixed with deference you abuse your advantages madam he said and act as foolishly in doing so as i did in affording you such a hank over me but you are a tyrant and tyrants have commonly short reigns  so saying he left the apartment  the wretchs unparalleled insolence said lilias to her brother has given me one great advantage over him for knowing that my uncle would shoot him with as little remorse as a woodcock if he but guessed at his brazenfaced assurance towards me he dares not since that time assume so far as i am concerned the air of insolent domination which the possession of my uncles secrets and the knowledge of his most secret plans have led him to exert over others of his family  in the meantime said darsie i am happy to see that the landlord of the house does not seem so devoted to him as i apprehended and this aids the hope of escape which i am nourishing for you and for myself o lilias the truest of friends alan fairford is in pursuit of me and is here at this moment another humble but i think faithful friend is also within these dangerous walls  lilias laid her finger on her lips and pointed to the door darsie took the hint lowered his voice and informed her in whispers of the arrival of fairford and that he believed he had opened a communication with wandering willie she listened with the utmost interest and had just begun to reply when a loud noise was heard in the kitchen caused by several contending voices amongst which darsie thought he could distinguish that of alan fairford  forgetting how little his own condition permitted him to become the assistant of another darsie flew to the door of the room and finding it locked and bolted on the outside rushed against it with all his force and made the most desperate efforts to burst it open notwithstanding the entreaties of his sister that he would compose himself and recollect the condition in which he was placed but the door framed to withstand attacks from excisemen constables and other personages considered as worthy to use what are called the kings keys in common parlance a crowbar and hatchet and therewith to make lockfast places open and patent set his efforts at defiance meantime the noise continued without and we are to give an account of its origin in our next chapter     chapter xx  narrative of darsie latimer continued  joe crackenthorps publichouse had never since it first reared its chimneys on the banks of the solway been frequented by such a miscellaneous group of visitors as had that morning become its guests several of them were persons whose quality seemed much superior to their dresses and modes of travelling the servants who attended them contradicted the inferences to be drawn from the garb of their masters and according to the custom of the knights of the rainbow gave many hints that they were not people to serve any but men of firstrate consequence these gentlemen who had come thither chiefly for the purpose of meeting with mr redgauntlet seemed moody and anxious conversed and walked together apparently in deep conversation and avoided any communication with the chance travellers whom accident brought that morning to the same place of resort  as if fate had set herself to confound the plans of the jacobite conspirators the number of travellers was unusually great their appearance respectable and they filled the public taproom of the inn where the political guests had already occupied most of the private apartments  amongst others honest joshua geddes had arrived travelling as he said in the sorrow of the soul and mourning for the fate of darsie latimer as he would for his firstborn child he had skirted the whole coast of the solway besides making various trips into the interior not shunning on such occasions to expose himself to the laugh of the scorner nay even to serious personal risk by frequenting the haunts of smugglers horsejockeys and other irregular persons who looked on his intrusion with jealous eyes and were apt to consider him as an exciseman in the disguise of a quaker all this labour and peril however had been undergone in vain no search he could make obtained the least intelligence of latimer so that he began to fear the poor lad had been spirited abroadfor the practice of kidnapping was then not infrequent especially on the western coasts of britainif indeed he had escaped a briefer and more bloody fate  with a heavy heart he delivered his horse even solomon into the hands of the ostler and walking into the inn demanded from the landlord breakfast and a private room quakers and such hosts as old father crackenthorp are no congenial spirits the latter looked askew over his shoulder and replied if you would have breakfast here friend you are like to eat it where other folk eat theirs  and wherefore can i not said the quaker have an apartment to myself for my money  because master jonathan you must wait till your betters be served or else eat with your equals  joshua geddes argued the point no further but sitting quietly down on the seat which crackenthorp indicated to him and calling for a pint of ale with some bread butter and dutch cheese began to satisfy the appetite which the morning air had rendered unusually alert  while the honest quaker was thus employed another stranger entered the apartment and sat down near to the table on which his victuals were placed he looked repeatedly at joshua licked his parched and chopped lips as he saw the good quaker masticate his bread and cheese and sucked up his thin chops when mr geddes applied the tankard to his mouth as if the discharge of these bodily functions by another had awakened his sympathies in an uncontrollable degree at last being apparently unable to withstand his longings he asked in a faltering tone the huge landlord who was tramping through the room in all corpulent impatience whether he could have a plackpie  never heard of such a thing master said the landlord and was about to trudge onward when the guest detaining him said in a strong scottish tone ya will maybe have nae whey then nor buttermilk nor ye couldna exhibit a souters clod  cant tell what ye are talking about master said crackenthorp  then ye will have nae breakfast that will come within the compass of a shilling scots  which is a penny sterling answered crackenthorp with a sneer why no sawney i cant say as we havewe cant afford it but you shall have a bellyful for love as we say in the bullring  i shall never refuse a fair offer said the povertystricken guest and i will say that for the english if they were deils that they are a ceeveleesed people to gentlemen that are under a cloud  gentlemenhumph said crackenthorpnot a bluecap among them but halts upon that foot then seizing on a dish which still contained a huge cantle of what had been once a princely mutton pasty he placed it on the table before the stranger saying there master gentleman there is what is worth all the black pies as you call them that were ever made of sheeps head  sheeps head is a gude thing for a that replied the guest but not being spoken so loud as to offend his hospitable entertainer the interjection might pass for a private protest against the scandal thrown out against the standing dish of caledonia  this premised he immediately began to transfer the mutton and piecrust from his plate to his lips in such huge gobbets as if he was refreshing after a three days fast and laying in provisions against a whole lent to come  joshua geddes in his turn gazed on him with surprise having never he thought beheld such a gaunt expression of hunger in the act of eating friend he said after watching him for some minutes if thou gorgest thyself in this fashion thou wilt assuredly choke wilt thou not take a draught out of my cup to help down all that dry meat  troth said the stranger stopping and looking at the friendly propounder thats nae bad overture as they say in the general assembly i have heard waur motions than that frae wiser counsel  mr geddes ordered a quart of homebrewed to be placed before our friend peter peebles for the reader must have already conceived that this unfortunate litigant was the wanderer in question  the victim of themis had no sooner seen the flagon than he seized it with the same energy which he had displayed in operating upon the piepuffed off the froth with such emphasis that some of it lighted on mr geddess headand then said as if with it sudden recollection of what was due to civility heres to ye friend what are ye ower grand to give me an answer or are ye dull o hearing  i prithee drink thy liquor friend said the good quaker thou meanest it in civility but we care not for these idle fashions  what ye are a quaker are ye said peter and without further ceremony reared the flagon to his head from which he withdrew it not while a single drop of barleybroo remained thats done you and me muckle gude he said sighing as he set down his pot but twa mutchkins o yill between twa folk is a drappie ower little measure what say ye to anither pot or shall we cry in a blithe scots pint at ance the yill is no amiss  thou mayst call for what thou wilt on thine own charges friend said geddes for myself i willingly contribute to the quenching of thy natural thirst but i fear it were no such easy matter to relieve thy acquired and artificial drought  that is to say in plain terms ye are for withdrawing your caution with the folk of the house you quaker folk are but fause comforters but since ye have garred me drink sae muckle cauld yillme that am no used to the like of it in the forenooni think ye might as weel have offered me a glass of brandy or usquabaeim nae nice bodyi can drink onything thats wet and toothsome  not a drop at my cost friend quoth geddes thou art an old man and hast perchance a heavy and long journey before thee thou art moreover my countryman as i judge from thy tongue and i will not give thee the means of dishonouring thy grey hairs in a strange land  grey hairs neighbour said peter with a wink to the bystanders whom this dialogue began to interest and who were in hopes of seeing the quaker played off by the crazed beggar for such peter peebles appeared to be grey hairs the lord mend your eyesight neighbour that disna ken grey hairs frae a tow wig  this jest procured a shout of laughter and what was still more acceptable than dry applause a man who stood beside called out father crackenthorp bring a nipperkin of brandy ill bestow a dram on this fellow were it but for that very word  the brandy was immediately brought by a wench who acted as barmaid and peter with a grin of delight filled a glass quaffed it off and then saying god bless me i was so unmannerly as not to drink to yei think the quaker has smitten me wi his illbred havingshe was about to fill another when his hand was arrested by his new friend who said at the same time no no friendfair plays a jeweltime about if you please and filling a glass for himself emptied it as gallantly as peter could have done what say you to that friend he continued addressing the quaker  nay friend answered joshua it went down thy throat not mine and i have nothing to say about what concerns me not but if thou art a man of humanity thou wilt not give this poor creature the means of debauchery bethink thee that they will spurn him from the door as they would do a houseless and masterless dog and that he may die on the sands or on the common and if he has through thy means been rendered incapable of helping himself thou shalt not be innocent of his blood  faith broadbrim i believe thou art right and the old gentleman in the flaxen jazy shall have no more of the comforter besides we have business in hand today and this fellow for as mad as he looks may have a nose on his face after all hark ye fatherwhat is your name and what brings you into such an outoftheway corner  i am not just free to condescend on my name said peter and as for my businessthere is a wee dribble of brandy in the stoupit would be wrang to leave it to the lassit is learning her bad usages  well thou shalt have the brandy and be dd to thee if thou wilt tell me what you are making here  seeking a young advocate chap that they ca alan fairford that has played me a slippery trick and ye maun ken a about the cause said peter  an advocate man answered the captain of the jumping jennyfor it was he and no other who had taken compassion on peters drought why lord help thee thou art on the wrong side of the firth to seek advocates whom i take to be scottish lawyers not english  english lawyers man exclaimed peter the deil a lawyers in a england  i wish from my soul it were true said ewart but what the devil put that in your head  lord man i got a grip of ane of their attorneys in carlisle and he tauld me that there wasna a lawyer in england ony mair than himsell that kend the nature of a multiplepoinding and when i told him how this loopy lad alan fairford had served me he said i might bring an action on the casejust as if the case hadna as mony actions already as one case can weel carry by my word it is a gude case and muckle has it borne in its day of various procedurebut its the barleypickle breaks the naigs back and wi my consent it shall not hae ony mair burden laid upon it  but this alan fairford said nantycomesip up the drop of brandy man and tell me some more about him and whether you are seeking him for good or for harm  for my ain gude and for his harm to be sure said peter think of his having left my cause in the deadthraw between the tyneing and the winning and capering off into cumberland here after a wild loupthetether lad they ca darsie latimer  darsie latimer said mr geddes hastily do you know anything of darsie latimer  maybe i do and maybe i do not answered peter i am no free to answer every bodys interrogatory unless it is put judicially and by form of lawspecially where folk think so much of a caup of sour yill or a thimblefu of brandy but as for this gentleman that has shown himself a gentleman at breakfast and will show himself a gentleman at the meridian i am free to condescend upon any points in the cause that may appear to bear upon the question at issue  why all i want to know from you my friend is whether you are seeking to do this mr alan fairford good or harm because if you come to do him good i think you could maybe get speech of himand if to do him harm i will take the liberty to give you a cast across the firth with fair warning not to come back on such an errand lest worse come of it  the manner and language of ewart were such that joshua geddes resolved to keep cautious silence till he could more plainly discover whether he was likely to aid or impede him in his researches after darsie latimer he therefore determined to listen attentively to what should pass between peter and the seaman and to watch for an opportunity of questioning the former so soon as he should be separated from his new acquaintance  i wad by no means said peter peebles do any substantial harm to the poor lad fairford who has had mony a gowd guinea of mine as weel as his father before him but i wad hae him brought back to the minding of my business and his ain and maybe i wadna insist further in my action of damages against him than for refunding the fees and for some annual rent on the principal sum due frae the day on which he should have recovered it for me plack and bawbee at the great advising for ye are aware that is the least that i can ask nomine damni and i have nae thought to break down the lad bodily athegitherwe maun live and let liveforgie and forget  the deuce take me friend broadbrim said nanty ewart looking to the quaker if i can make out what this old scarecrow means if i thought it was fitting that master fairford should see him why perhaps it is a matter that could be managed do you know anything about the old fellowyou seemed to take some charge of him just now  no more than i should have done by any one in distress said geddes not sorry to be appealed to but i will try what i can do to find out who he is and what he is about in this country but are we not a little too public in this open room  its well thought of said nanty and at his command the barmaid ushered the party into a sidebooth peter attending them in the instinctive hope that there would be more liquor drunk among them before parting they had scarce sat down in their new apartment when the sound of a violin was heard in the room which they had just left  ill awa back yonder said peter rising up again yons the sound of a fiddle and when there is music theres ay something ganging to eat or drink  i am just going to order something here said the quaker but in the meantime have you any objection my good friend to tell us your name  none in the world if you are wanting to drink to me by name and surname answered peebles but otherwise i would rather evite your interrogatories  friend said the quaker it is not for thine own health seeing thou hast drunk enough alreadyhoweverhere handmaidenbring me a gill of sherry  sherrys but shilpit drink and a gills a sma measure for twa gentlemen to crack ower at their first acquaintance but let us see your sneaking gill of sherry said poor peter thrusting forth his huge hand to seize on the diminutive pewter measure which according to the fashion of the time contained the generous liquor freshly drawn from the butt  nay hold friend said joshua thou hast not yet told me what name and surname i am to call thee by  dd sly in the quaker said nanty apart to make him pay for his liquor before he gives it him now i am such a fool that i should have let him get too drunk to open his mouth before i thought of asking him a question  my name is peter peebles then said the litigant rather sulkily as one who thought his liquor too sparingly meted out to him and what have you to say to that  peter peebles repeated nanty ewart and seemed to muse upon something which the words brought to his remembrance while the quaker pursued his examination  but i prithee peter peebles what is thy further designation thou knowest in our country that some men are distinguished by their craft and calling as cordwainers fishers weavers or the like and some by their titles as proprietors of land which savours of vanitynow how may you be distinguished from others of the same name  as peter peebles of the great plea of poor peter peebles against plainstanes et per contraif i am laird of naething else i am ay a dominus litis  its but a poor lairdship i doubt said joshua  pray mr peebles said nanty interrupting the conversation abruptly were not you once a burgess of edinburgh  was i a burgess said peter indignantly and am i not a burgess even now i have done nothing to forfeit my right i trowonce provost and ay my lord  well mr burgess tell me further have you not some property in the gude town continued ewart  troth have ithat is before my misfortunes i had twa or three bonny bits of mailings amang the closes and wynds forby the shop and the story abune it but plainstanes has put me to the causeway now never mind though i will be upsides with him yet  had not you once a tenement in the covenant close again demanded nanty  you have hit it lad though ye look not like a covenanter said peter well drink to its memoryhout the hearts at the mouth o that illfaurd bit stoup alreadyit brought a rent reckoning from the crawstep to the groundsill that ye might ca fourteen punds a year forby the laigh cellar that was let to lucky littleworth  and do you not remember that you had a poor old lady for your tenant mrs cantrips of kittlebasket said nanty suppressing his emotion with difficulty  remember gd i have gude cause to remember her said peter for she turned a dyvour on my hands the auld besom and after a that the law could do to make me satisfied and paid in the way of poinding and distrenzieing and sae forth as the law will she ran awa to the charity workhouse a matter of twenty punds scots in my debtits a great shame and oppression that charity workhouse taking in bankrupt dyvours that canna pay their honest creditors  methinks friend said the quaker thine own rags might teach thee compassion for other peoples nakedness  rags said peter taking joshuas words literally does ony wise body put on their best coat when they are travelling and keeping company with quakers and such other cattle as the road affords  the old lady died i have heard said nanty affecting a moderation which was belied by accents that faltered with passion  she might live or die for what i care answered peter the cruel what business have folk to do to live that canna live as law will and satisfy their just and lawful creditors  and youyou that are now yourself trodden down in the very kennel are you not sorry for what you have done do you not repent having occasioned the poor widow womans death  what for should i repent said peter the law was on my sidea decreet of the bailies followed by poinding and an act of wardinga suspension intented and the letters found orderly proceeded i followed the auld rudas through twa courtsshe cost me mair money than her lugs were worth  now by heaven said nanty i would give a thousand guineas if i had them to have you worth my beating had you said you repented it had been between god and your conscience but to hear you boast of your villanydo you think it little to have reduced the aged to famine and the young to infamyto have caused the death of one woman the ruin of another and to have driven a man to exile and despair by him that made me i can scarce keep hands off you  off me i defy ye said peter i take this honest man to witness that if ye stir the neck of my collar i will have my action for stouthreif spulzie oppression assault and battery heres a bra din indeed about an auld wife gaun to the grave a young limmer to the closeheads and causeway and a sticket stibbler a student of divinity who has not been able to complete his studies on theology to the sea instead of the gallows  now by my soul said nanty this is too much and since you can feel no otherwise i will try if i cannot beat some humanity into your head and shoulders  he drew his hanger as he spoke and although joshua who had in vain endeavoured to interrupt the dialogue to which he foresaw a violent termination now threw himself between nanty and the old litigant he could not prevent the latter from receiving two or three sound slaps over the shoulder with the flat side of the weapon  poor peter peebles as inglorious in his extremity as he had been presumptuous in bringing it on now ran and roared and bolted out of the apartment and house itself pursued by nanty whose passion became high in proportion to his giving way to its dictates and by joshua who still interfered at every risk calling upon nanty to reflect on the age and miserable circumstances of the offender and upon poor peter to stand and place himself under his protection in front of the house however peter peebles found a more efficient protector than the worthy quaker     chapter xxi  narrative of alan fairford  our readers may recollect that fairford had been conducted by dick gardener from the house of fairladies to the inn of old father crackenthorp in order as he had been informed by the mysterious father buonaventure that he might have the meeting which he desired with mr redgauntlet to treat with him for the liberty of his friend darsie his guide by the special direction of mr ambrose had introduced him into the publichouse by a backdoor and recommended to the landlord to accommodate him with a private apartment and to treat him with all civility but in other respects to keep his eye on him and even to secure his person if he saw any reason to suspect him to be a spy he was not however subjected to any direct restraint but was ushered into an apartment where he was requested to await the arrival of the gentleman with whom he wished to have an interview and who as crackenthorp assured him with a significant nod would be certainly there in the course of an hour in the meanwhile he recommended to him with another significant sign to keep his apartment as there were people in the house who were apt to busy themselves about other folks matters  alan fairford complied with the recommendation so long as he thought it reasonable but when among a large party riding up to the house he discerned redgauntlet whom he had seen under the name of mr herries of birrenswork and whom by his height and strength he easily distinguished from the rest he thought it proper to go down to the front of the house in hopes that by more closely reconnoitring the party he might discover if his friend darsie was among them  the reader is aware that by doing so he had an opportunity of breaking darsies fall from his sidesaddle although his disguise and mask prevented his recognizing his friend it may be also recollected that while nixon hurried miss redgauntlet and her brother into the house their uncle somewhat chafed at an unexpected and inconvenient interruption remained himself in parley with fairford who had already successively addressed him by the names of herries and redgauntlet neither of which any more than the acquaintance of the young lawyer he seemed at the moment willing to acknowledge though an air of haughty indifference which he assumed could not conceal his vexation and embarrassment  if we must needs be acquainted sir he said at lastfor which i am unable to see any necessity especially as i am now particularly disposed to be privatei must entreat you will tell me at once what you have to say and permit me to attend to matters of more importance  my introduction said fairford is contained in this letterdelivering that of maxwelli am convinced that under whatever name it may be your pleasure for the present to be known it is into your hands and yours only that it should be delivered  redgauntlet turned the letter in his handthen read the contents then again looked upon the letter and sternly observed the seal of the letter has been broken was this the case sir when it was delivered into your hand  fairford despised a falsehood as much as any manunless perhaps as tom turnpenny might have said in the way of business he answered readily and firmly the seal was whole when the letter was delivered to me by mr maxwell of summertrees  and did you dare sir to break the seal of a letter addressed to me said redgauntlet not sorry perhaps to pick a quarrel upon a point foreign to the tenor of the epistle  i have never broken the seal of any letter committed to my charge said alan not from fear of those to whom such letter might be addressed but from respect to myself  that is well worded said redgauntlet and yet young mr counsellor i doubt whether your delicacy prevented your reading my letter or listening to the contents as read by some other person after it was opened  i certainly did hear the contents read over said fairford and they were such as to surprise me a good deal  now that said redgauntlet i hold to be pretty much the same in foro conscientiae as if you had broken the seal yourself i shall hold myself excused from entering upon further discourse with a messenger so faithless and you may thank yourself if your journey has been fruitless  stay sir said fairford and know that i became acquainted with the contents of the paper without my consenti may even say against my will for mr buonaventure  who demanded redgauntlet in a wild and alarmed mannerwhom was it you named  father buonaventure said alana catholic priest as i apprehend whom i saw at the misses arthurets house called fairladies  misses arthuretfairladiesa catholic priestfather buonaventure said redgauntlet repeating the words of alan with astonishmentis it possible that human rashness can reach such a point of infatuation tell me the truth i conjure you sir i have the deepest interest to know whether this is more than an idle legend picked up from hearsay about the country you are a lawyer and know the risk incurred by the catholic clergy whom the discharge of their duty sends to these bloody shores  i am a lawyer certainly said fairford but my holding such a respectable condition in life warrants that i am neither an informer nor a spy here is sufficient evidence that i have seen father buonaventure  he put buonaventures letter into redgauntlets hand and watched his looks closely while he read it doubledyed infatuation he muttered with looks in which sorrow displeasure and anxiety were mingled save me from the indiscretion of my friends says the spaniard i can save myself from the hostility of my enemies  he then read the letter attentively and for two or three minutes was lost in thought while some purpose of importance seemed to have gathered and sit brooding upon his countenance he held up his finger towards his satellite cristal nixon who replied to his signal with a prompt nod and with one or two of the attendants approached fairford in such a manner as to make him apprehensive they were about to lay hold of him  at this moment a noise was heard from withinside of the house and presently rushed forth peter peebles pursued by nanty ewart with his drawn hanger and the worthy quaker who was endeavouring to prevent mischief to others at some risk of bringing it on himself  a wilder and yet a more absurd figure can hardly be imagined than that of poor peter clattering along as fast as his huge boots would permit him and resembling nothing so much as a flying scarecrow while the thin emaciated form of nanty ewart with the hue of death on his cheek and the fire of vengeance glancing from his eye formed a ghastly contrast with the ridiculous object of his pursuit  redgauntlet threw himself between them what extravagant folly is this he said put up your weapon captain is this a time to indulge in drunken brawls or is such a miserable object as that a fitting antagonist for a man of courage  i beg pardon said the captain sheathing his weaponi was a little bit out of the way to be sure but to know the provocation a man must read my heart and that i hardly dare to do myself but the wretch is safe from me heaven has done its own vengeance on us both  while he spoke in this manner peter peebles who had at first crept behind redgauntlet in bodily fear began now to reassume his spirits pulling his protector by the sleeve mr herriesmr herries he whispered eagerly ye have done me mair than ae gude turn and if ye will but do me anither at this dead pinch ill forgie the girded keg of brandy that you and captain sir harry redgimlet drank out yon time ye sall hae an ample discharge and renunciation and though i should see you walking at the cross of edinburgh or standing at the bar of the court of justiciary no the very thumbikins themselves should bring to my memory that ever i saw you in arms yon day  he accompanied this promise by pulling so hard at redgauntlets cloak that he at last turned round idiot speak in a word what you want  aweel aweel in a word then said peter peebles i have a warrant on me to apprehend that man that stands there alan fairford by name and advocate by calling i bought it from maister justice foxleys clerk maister nicholas faggot wi the guinea that you gied me  ha said redgauntlet hast thou really such a warrant let me see it look sharp that no one escape cristal nixon  peter produced a huge greasy leathern pocketbook too dirty to permit its original colour to be visible filled with scrolls of notes memorials to counsel and heaven knows what besides from amongst this precious mass he culled forth a paper and placed it in the hands of redgauntlet or herries as he continued to call him saying at the same time its a formal and binding warrant proceeding on my affidavy made that the said alan fairford being lawfully engaged in my service had slipped the tether and fled over the border and was now lurking there and thereabouts to elude and evite the discharge of his bounden duty to me and therefore granting warrant to constables and others to seek for take and apprehend him that he may be brought before the honourable justice foxley for examination and if necessary for commitment now though a this be fairly set down as i tell ye yet where am i to get an officer to execute this warrant in sic a country as this where swords and pistols flee out at a words speaking and folk care as little for the peace of king george as the peace of auld king coul theres that drunken skipper and that wet quaker enticed me into the public this morning and because i wadna gie them as much brandy as wad have made them blinddrunk they baith fell on me and were in the way of guiding me very ill  while peter went on in this manner redgauntlet glanced his eye over the warrant and immediately saw that it must be a trick passed by nicholas faggot to cheat the poor insane wretch out of his solitary guinea but the justice had actually subscribed it as he did whatever his clerk presented to him and redgauntlet resolved to use it for his own purposes  without making any direct answer therefore to peter peebles he walked up gravely to fairford who had waited quietly for the termination of a scene in which he was not a little surprised to find his client mr peebles a conspicuous actor  mr fairford said redgauntlet there are many reasons which might induce me to comply with the request or rather the injunctions of the excellent father buonaventure that i should communicate with you upon the present condition of my ward whom you know under the name of darsie latimer but no man is better aware than you that the law must be obeyed even in contradiction to our own feelings now this poor man has obtained a warrant for carrying you before a magistrate and i am afraid there is a necessity of your yielding to it although to the postponement of the business which you may have with me  a warrant against me said alan indignantly and at that poor miserable wretchs instancewhy this is a trick a mere and most palpable trick  it may be so replied redgauntlet with great equanimity doubtless you know best only the writ appears regular and with that respect for the law which has been he said with hypocritical formality a leading feature of my character through life i cannot dispense with giving my poor aid to the support of a legal warrant look at it yourself and be satisfied it is no trick of mine  fairford ran over the affidavit and the warrant and then exclaimed once more that it was an impudent imposition and that he would hold those who acted upon such a warrant liable in the highest damages i guess at your motive mr redgauntlet he said for acquiescing in so ridiculous a proceeding but be assured you will find that in this country one act of illegal violence will not be covered or atoned for by practising another you cannot as a man of sense and honour pretend to say you regard this as a legal warrant  i am no lawyer sir said redgauntlet and pretend not to know what is or is not lawthe warrant is quite formal and that is enough for me  did ever any one hear said fairford of an advocate being compelled to return to his task like a collier or a salter see note 10 who has deserted his master  i see no reason why he should not said redgauntlet dryly unless on the ground that the services of the lawyer are the most expensive and least useful of the two  you cannot mean this in earnest said fairford you cannot really mean to avail yourself of so poor a contrivance to evade the word pledged by your friend your ghostly father in my behalf i may have been a fool for trusting it too easily but think what you must be if you can abuse my confidence in this manner i entreat you to reflect that this usage releases me from all promises of secrecy or connivance at what i am apt to think are very dangerous practices and that  hark ye mr fairford said redgauntlet i must here interrupt you for your own sake one word of betraying what you may have seen or what you may have suspected and your seclusion is like to have either a very distant or a very brief termination in either case a most undesirable one at present you are sure of being at liberty in a very few daysperhaps much sooner  and my friend said alan fairford for whose sake i have run myself into this danger what is to become of him dark and dangerous man he exclaimed raising his voice i will not be again cajoled by deceitful promises  i give you my honour that your friend is well interrupted redgauntlet perhaps i may permit you to see him if you will but submit with patience to a fate which is inevitable  but alan fairford considering his confidence as having been abused first by maxwell and next by the priest raised his voice and appealed to all the kings lieges within hearing against the violence with which he was threatened he was instantly seized on by nixon and two assistants who holding down his arms and endeavouring to stop his mouth were about to hurry him away  the honest quaker who had kept out of redgauntlets presence now came boldly forward  friend said he thou dost more than thou canst answer thou knowest me well and thou art aware that in me thou hast a deeply injured neighbour who was dwelling beside thee in the honesty and simplicity of his heart  tush jonathan said redgauntlet talk not to me man it is neither the craft of a young lawyer nor the simplicity of an old hypocrite can drive me from my purpose  by my faith said the captain coming forward in his turn this is hardly fair general and i doubt he added whether the will of my owners can make me a party to such proceedings nay never fumble with your swordhilt but out with it like a man if you are for a tilting he unsheathed his hanger and continuedi will neither see my comrade fairford nor the old quaker abused dn all warrants false or truecurse the justiceconfound the constableand here stands little nanty ewart to make good what he says against gentle and simple in spite of horseshoe or horseradish either  the cry of down with all warrants was popular in the ears of the militia of the inn and nanty ewart was no less so fishers ostlers seamen smugglers began to crowd to the spot crackenthorp endeavoured in vain to mediate the attendants of redgauntlet began to handle their firearms but their master shouted to them to forbear and unsheathing his sword as quick as lightning he rushed on ewart in the midst of his bravado and struck his weapon from his hand with such address and force that it flew three yards from him closing with him at the same moment he gave him a severe fall and waved his sword over his head to show he was absolutely at his mercy  there you drunken vagabond he said i give you your lifeyou are no bad fellow if you could keep from brawling among your friends but we all know nanty ewart he said to the crowd around with a forgiving laugh which joined to the awe his prowess had inspired entirely confirmed their wavering allegiance  they shouted the laird for ever while poor nanty rising from the earth on whose lap he had been stretched so rudely went in quest of his hanger lifted it wiped it and as he returned the weapon to the scabbard muttered between his teeth it is true they say of him and the devil will stand his friend till his hour come i will cross him no more  so saying he slunk from the crowd cowed and disheartened by his defeat  for you joshua geddes said redgauntlet approaching the quaker who with lifted hands and eyes had beheld the scene of violence l shall take the liberty to arrest thee for a breach of the peace altogether unbecoming thy pretended principles and i believe it will go hard with thee both in a court of justice and among thine own society of friends as they call themselves who will be but indifferently pleased to see the quiet tenor of their hypocrisy insulted by such violent proceedings  i violent said joshua i do aught unbecoming the principles of the friends i defy thee man and i charge thee as a christian to forbear vexing my soul with such charges it is grievous enough to me to have seen violences which i was unable to prevent  o joshua joshua said redgauntlet with a sardonic smile thou light of the faithful in the town of dumfries and the places adjacent wilt thou thus fall away from the truth hast thou not before us all attempted to rescue a man from the warrant of law didst thou not encourage that drunken fellow to draw his weaponand didst thou not thyself flourish thy cudgel in the cause thinkst thou that the oaths of the injured peter peebles and the conscientious cristal nixon besides those of such gentlemen as look on this strange scene who not only put on swearing as a garment but to whom in custom house matters oaths are literally meat and drinkdost thou not think i say that these mens oaths will go further than thy yea and nay in this matter  i will swear to anything said peter all is fair when it comes to an oath ad litem  you do me foul wrong said the quaker undismayed by the general laugh i encouraged no drawing of weapons though i attempted to move an unjust man by some use of argumenti brandished no cudgel although it may be that the ancient adam struggled within me and caused my hand to grasp mine oaken staff firmer than usual when i saw innocence borne down with violence but why talk i what is true and just to thee who hast been a man of violence from thy youth upwards let me rather speak to thee such language as thou canst comprehend deliver these young men up to me he said when he had led redgauntlet a little apart from the crowd and i will not only free thee from the heavy charge of damages which thou hast incurred by thine outrage upon my property but i will add ransom for them and for myself what would it profit thee to do the youths wrong by detaining them in captivity  mr geddes said redgauntlet in a tone more respectful than he had hitherto used to the quaker your language is disinterested and i respect the fidelity of your friendship perhaps we have mistaken each others principles and motives but if so we have not at present time for explanation make yourself easy i hope to raise your friend darsie latimer to a pitch of eminence which you will witness with pleasurenay do not attempt to answer me the other young man shall suffer restraint a few days probably only a few hoursit is not more than due for his pragmatical interference in what concerned him not do you mr geddes be so prudent as to take your horse and leave this place which is growing every moment more unfit for the abode of a man of peace you may wait the event in safety at mount sharon  friend replied joshua i cannot comply with thy advice i will remain here even as thy prisoner as thou didst but now threaten rather than leave the youth who hath suffered by and through me and my misfortunes in his present state of doubtful safety wherefore i will not mount my steed solomon neither will i turn his head towards mount sharon until i see an end of this matter  a prisoner then you must be said redgauntlet i have no time to dispute the matter further with you but tell me for what you fix your eyes so attentively on yonder people of mine  to speak the truth said the quaker i admire to behold among them a little wretch of a boy called benjie to whom i think satan has given the power of transporting himself wheresoever mischief is going forward so that it may be truly said there is no evil in this land wherein he hath not a finger if not a whole hand  the boy who saw their eyes fixed on him as they spoke seemed embarrassed slid rather desirous of making his escape but at a signal from redgauntlet he advanced assuming the sheepish look and rustic manner with which the jackanapes covered much acuteness and roguery  how long have you been with the party sirrah said redgauntlet  since the raid on the stakenets said benjie with his finger in his mouth  and what made you follow us  i dauredna stay at hame for the constables replied the boy  and what have you been doing all this time  doing sir i dinna ken what ye ca doingi have been doing naething said benjie then seeing something in redgauntlets eye which was not to be trifled with he added naething but waiting on maister cristal nixon  humayeindeed muttered redgauntlet must master nixon bring his own retinue into the field this must be seen to  he was about to pursue his inquiry when nixon himself came to him with looks of anxious haste the father is come he whispered and the gentlemen are getting together in the largest room of the house and they desire to see you yonder is your nephew too making a noise like a man in bedlam  i will look to it all instantly said redgauntlet is the father lodged as i directed  cristal nodded  now then for the final trial said redgauntlet he folded his handslooked upwardscrossed himselfand after this act of devotion almost the first which any one had observed him make use of he commanded nixon to keep good watchhave his horses and men ready for every emergencelook after the safe custody of the prisonersbut treat them at the same time well and civilly and these orders given he darted hastily into the house     chapter xxii  narrative continued  redgauntlets first course was to the chamber of his nephew he unlocked the door entered the apartment and asked what he wanted that he made so much noise  i want my liberty said darsie who had wrought himself up to a pitch of passion in which his uncles wrath had lost its terrors i desire my liberty and to be assured of the safety of my beloved friend alan fairford whose voice i heard but now  your liberty shall be your own within half an hour from this periodyour friend shall be also set at freedom in due timeand you yourself be permitted to have access to his place of confinement  this does not satisfy me said darsie i must see my friend instantly he is here and he is here endangered on my account onlyi have heard violent exclamationsthe clash of swords you will gain no point with me unless i have ocular demonstration of his safety  arthurdearest nephew answered redgauntlet drive me not mad thine own fatethat of thy housethat of thousandsthat of britain herself are at this moment in the scales and you are only occupied about the safety of a poor insignificant pettifogger  he has sustained injury at your hands then said darsie fiercely i know he has but if so not even our relationship shall protect you  peace ungrateful and obstinate fool said redgauntlet yet staywill you be satisfied if you see this alan fairford the bundle of bombazinethis precious friend of yourswell and sound will you i say be satisfied with seeing him in perfect safety without attempting to speak to or converse with him darsie signified his assent take hold of my arm then said redgauntlet and do you niece lilias take the other and beware sir arthur how you bear yourself  darsie was compelled to acquiesce sufficiently aware that his uncle would permit him no interview with a friend whose influence would certainly be used against his present earnest wishes and in some measure contented with the assurance of fairfords personal safety  redgauntlet led them through one or two passages for the house as we have before said was very irregular and built at different times until they entered an apartment where a man with shouldered carabine kept watch at the door but readily turned the key for their reception in this room they found alan fairford and the quaker apparently in deep conversation with each other they looked up as redgauntlet and his party entered and alan pulled off his hat and made a profound reverence which the young lady who recognized himthough masked as she was he could not know herreturned with some embarrassment arising probably from the recollection of the bold step she had taken in visiting him  darsie longed to speak but dared not his uncle only said gentlemen i know you are as anxious on mr darsie latimers account as he is upon yours i am commissioned by him to inform you that he is as well as you arei trust you will all meet soon meantime although i cannot suffer you to be at large you shall be as well treated as is possible under your temporary confinement  he passed on without pausing to hear the answers which the lawyer and the quaker were hastening to prefer and only waving his hand by way of adieu made his exit with the real and the seeming lady whom he had under his charge through a door at the upper end of the apartment which was fastened and guarded like that by which they entered  redgauntlet next led the way into a very small room adjoining which but divided by a partition was one of apparently larger dimensions for they heard the trampling of the heavy boots of the period as if several persons were walking to and fro and conversing in low and anxious whispers  here said redgauntlet to his nephew as he disencumbered him from the ridingskirt and the mask i restore you to yourself and trust you will lay aside all effeminate thoughts with this feminine dress do not blush at having worn a disguise to which kings and heroes have been reduced it is when female craft or female cowardice find their way into a manly bosom that he who entertains these sentiments should take eternal shame to himself for thus having resembled womankind follow me while lilias remains here i will introduce you to those whom i hope to see associated with you in the most glorious cause that hand ever drew sword in  darsie paused uncle he said my person is in your hands but remember my will is my own i will not be hurried into any resolution of importance remember what i have already saidwhat i now repeatthat i will take no step of importance but upon conviction  but canst thou be convinced thou foolish boy without hearing and understanding the grounds on which we act  so saying he took darsie by the arm and walked with him to the next rooma large apartment partly filled with miscellaneous articles of commerce chiefly connected with contraband trade where among bales and barrels sat or walked to and fro several gentlemen whose manners and looks seemed superior to the plain riding dresses which they wore  there was a grave and stern anxiety upon their countenances when on redgauntlets entrance they drew from their separate coteries into one group around him and saluted him with a formality which had something in it of ominous melancholy as darsie looked around the circle he thought he could discern in it few traces of that adventurous hope which urges men upon desperate enterprises and began to believe that the conspiracy would dissolve of itself without the necessity of his placing himself in direct opposition to so violent a character as his uncle and incurring the hazard with which such opposition must be attended  mr redgauntlet however did not or would not see any such marks of depression of spirit amongst his coadjutors but met them with cheerful countenance and a warm greeting of welcome happy to meet you here my lord he said bowing low to a slender young man i trust you come with the pledges of your noble father of b and all that loyal housesir richard what news in the west i am told you had two hundred men on foot to have joined when the fatal retreat from derby was commenced when the white standard is again displayed it shall not be turned back so easily either by the force of its enemies or the falsehood of its friendsdoctor grumball i bow to the representative of oxford the mother of learning and loyaltypengwinion you cornish chough has this good wind blown you northah my brave cambrobritons when was wales last in the race of honour  such and suchlike compliments he dealt around which were in general answered by silent bows but when he saluted one of his own countrymen by the name of mackellar and greeted maxwell of summertrees by that of pateinperil the latter replied that if pate were not a fool he would be pateinsafety and the former a thin old gentleman in tarnished embroidery said bluntly aye troth redgauntlet i am here just like yourself i have little to losethey that took my land the last time may take my life this and that is all i care about it  the english gentlemen who were still in possession of their paternal estates looked doubtfully on each other and there was something whispered among them of the fox which had lost his tail  redgauntlet hastened to address them i think my lords and gentlemen he said that i can account for something like sadness which has crept upon an assembly gathered together for so noble a purpose our numbers seem when thus assembled too small and inconsiderable to shake the firmseated usurpation of a halfcentury but do not count us by what we are in thew and muscle but by what our summons can do among our countrymen in this small party are those who have power to raise battalions and those who have wealth to pay them and do not believe our friends who are absent are cold or indifferent to the cause let us once light the signal and it will be hailed by all who retain love for the stuart and by alla more numerous bodywho hate the elector here i have letters from  sir richard glendale interrupted the speaker we all confide redgauntlet in your valour and skillwe admire your perseverance and probably nothing short of your strenuous exertions and the emulation awakened by your noble and disinterested conduct could have brought so many of us the scattered remnant of a disheartened party to meet together once again in solemn consultation for i take it gentlemen he said looking round this is only a consultation  nothing more said the young lord  nothing more said doctor grumball shaking his large academical peruke  and only a consultation was echoed by the others  redgauntlet bit his lip i had hopes he said that the discourses i have held with most of you from time to time had ripened into more maturity than your words imply and that we were here to execute as well as to deliberate and for this we stand prepared i can raise five hundred men with my whistle  five hundred men said one of the welsh squires cot bless us and pray you what cood could five hundred men do  all that the priming does for the cannon mr meredith answered redgauntlet it will enable us to seize carlisle and you know what our friends have engaged for in that case  yesbut said the young nobleman you must not hurry us on too fast mr redgauntlet we are all i believe as sincere and truehearted in this business as you are but we will not be driven forward blindfold we owe caution to ourselves and our families as well as to those whom we are empowered to represent on this occasion  who hurries you my lord who is it that would drive this meeting forward blindfold i do not understand your lordship said redgauntlet  nay said sir richard glendale at least do not let us fall under our old reproach of disagreeing among ourselves what my lord means redgauntlet is that we have this morning heard it is uncertain whether you could even bring that body of men whom you count upon your countryman mr mackellar seemed just before you came in to doubt whether your people would rise in any force unless you could produce the authority of your nephew  i might ask said redgauntlet what right mackellar or any one has to doubt my being able to accomplish what i stand pledged for but our hopes consist in our unity here stands my nephew gentlemen i present to you my kinsman sir arthur darsie redgauntlet of that ilk  gentlemen said darsie with a throbbing bosom for he felt the crisis a very painful one allow me to say that i suspend expressing my sentiments on the important subject under discussion until i have heard those of the present meeting  proceed in your deliberations gentlemen said redgauntlet i will show my nephew such reasons for acquiescing in the result as will entirely remove any scruples which may hang around his mind  dr grumball now coughed shook his ambrosial curls and addressed the assembly  the principles of oxford he said are well understood since she was the last to resign herself to the archusurpersince she has condemned by her sovereign authority the blasphemous atheistical and anarchical tenets of locke and other deluders of the public mind oxford will give men money and countenance to the cause of the rightful monarch but we have been often deluded by foreign powers who have availed themselves of our zeal to stir up civil dissensions in britain not for the advantage of our blessed though banished monarch but to stir up disturbances by which they might profit while we their tools are sure to be ruined oxford therefore will not rise unless our sovereign comes in person to claim our allegiance in which case god forbid we should refuse him our best obedience  it is a very cood advice said mr meredith  in troth said sir richard glendale it is the very keystone of our enterprise and the only condition upon which i myself and others could ever have dreamt of taking up arms no insurrection which has not charles edward himself at its head will ever last longer than till a single foot company of redcoats march to disperse it  this is my own opinion and that of all my family said the young nobleman already mentioned and i own i am somewhat surprised at being summoned to attend a dangerous rendezvous such as this before something certain could have been stated to us on this most important preliminary point  pardon me my lord said redgauntlet i have not been so unjust either to myself or my friendsi had no means of communicating to our distant confederates without the greatest risk of discovery what is known to some of my honourable friends as courageous and as resolved as when twenty years since he threw himself into the wilds of moidart charles edward has instantly complied with the wishes of his faithful subjects charles edward is in this countrycharles edward is in this housecharles edward waits but your present decision to receive the homage of those who have ever called themselves his loyal liegemen he that would now turn his coat and change his note must do so under the eye of his sovereign  there was a deep pause those among the conspirators whom mere habit or a desire of preserving consistency had engaged in the affair now saw with terror their retreat cut off and others who at a distance had regarded the proposed enterprise as hopeful trembled when the moment of actually embarking in it was thus unexpectedly and almost inevitably precipitated  how now my lords and gentlemen said redgauntlet is it delight and rapture that keep you thus silent where are the eager welcomes that should be paid to your rightful king who a second time confides his person to the care of his subjects undeterred by the hairbreadth escapes and severe privations of his former expedition i hope there is no gentleman here that is not ready to redeem in his princes presence the pledge of fidelity which he offered in his absence  i at least said the young nobleman resolutely and laying his hand on his sword will not be that coward if charles is come to these shores i will be the first to give him welcome and to devote my life and fortune to his service  before cot said mr meredith i do not see that mr redgauntlet has left us anything else to do  stay said summertrees there is yet one other question has he brought any of those irish rapparees with him who broke the neck of our last glorious affair  not a man of them said redgauntlet  i trust said dr grumball that there are no catholic priests in his company i would not intrude on the private conscience of my sovereign but as an unworthy son of the church of england it is my duty to consider her security  not a popish dog or cat is there to bark or mew about his majesty said redgauntlet old shaftesbury himself could not wish a princes person more secure from poperywhich may not be the worst religion in the world notwithstanding any more doubts gentlemen can no more plausible reasons be discovered for postponing the payment of our duty and discharge of our oaths and engagements meantime your king waits your declarationby my faith he hath but a frozen reception  redgauntlet said sir richard glendale calmly your reproaches shall not goad me into anything of which my reason disapproves that i respect my engagement as much as you do is evident since i am here ready to support it with the best blood in my veins but has the king really come hither entirely unattended  he has no man with him but young  as aide de camp and a single valet de chambre  no manbut redgauntlet as you are a gentleman has he no woman with him  redgauntlet cast his eyes on the ground and replied i am sorry to sayhe has  the company looked at each other and remained silent for a moment at length sir richard proceeded i need not repeat to you mr redgauntlet what is the wellgrounded opinion of his majestys friends concerning that most unhappy connexion there is but one sense and feeling amongst us upon the subject i must conclude that our humble remonstrances were communicated by you sir to the king  in the same strong terms in which they were couched replied redgauntlet i love his majestys cause more than i fear his displeasure  but apparently our humble expostulation has produced no effect this lady who has crept into his bosom has a sister in the elector of hanovers court and yet we are well assured that our most private communication is placed in her keeping  varium et mutabile semper femina said dr grumball  she puts his secrets into her workbag said maxwell and out they fly whenever she opens it if i must hang i would wish it to be in somewhat a better rope than the string of a ladys hussey  are you too turning dastard maxwell said redgauntlet in a whisper  not i said maxwell let us fight for it and let them win and wear us but to be betrayed by a brimstone like that  be temperate gentlemen said redgauntlet the foible of which you complain so heavily has always been that of kings and heroes which i feel strongly confident the king will surmount upon the humble entreaty of his best servants and when he sees them ready to peril their all in his cause upon the slight condition of his resigning the society of a female favourite of whom i have seen reason to think he hath been himself for some time wearied but let us not press upon him rashly with our wellmeant zeal he has a princely will as becomes his princely birth and we gentlemen who are royalists should be the last to take advantage of circumstances to limit its exercise i am as much surprised and hurt as you can be to find that he has made her the companion of this journey increasing every chance of treachery and detection but do not let us insist upon a sacrifice so humiliating while he has scarce placed a foot upon the beach of his kingdom let us act generously by our sovereign and when we have shown what we will do for him we shall be able with better face to state what it is we expect him to concede  indeed i think it is but a pity said mackellar when so many pretty gentlemen are got together that they should part without the flash of a sword among them  i should be of that gentlemans opinion said lord  had i nothing to lose but my life but i frankly own that the conditions on which our family agreed to join having been in this instance left unfulfilled i will not peril the whole fortunes of our house on the doubtful fidelity of an artful woman  i am sorry to see your lordship said redgauntlet take a course which is more likely to secure your houses wealth than to augment its honours  how am i to understand your language sir said the young nobleman haughtily  nay gentlemen said dr grumball interposing do not let friends quarrel we are all zealous for the causebut truly although i know the license claimed by the great in such matters and can i hope make due allowance there is i may say an indecorum in a prince who comes to claim the allegiance of the church of england arriving on such an errand with such a companionsi non caste caute tamen  i wonder how the church of england came to be so heartily attached to his merry old namesake said redgauntlet  sir richard glendale then took up the question as one whose authority and experience gave him right to speak with much weight  we have no leisure for hesitation he said it is full time that we decide what course we are to hold i feel as much as you mr redgauntlet the delicacy of capitulating with our sovereign in his present condition but i must also think of the total ruin of the cause the confiscation and bloodshed which will take place among his adherents and all through the infatuation with which he adheres to a woman who is the pensionary of the present minister as she was for years sir robert walpoles let his majesty send her back to the continent and the sword on which i now lay my hand shall instantly be unsheathed and i trust many hundred others at the same moment  the other persons present testified their unanimous acquiescence in what sir richard glendale had said  i see you have taken your resolutions gentlemen said redgauntlet unwisely i think because i believe that by softer and more generous proceedings you would have been more likely to carry a point which i think as desirable as you do but what is to be done if charles should refuse with the inflexibility of his grandfather to comply with this request of yours do you mean to abandon him to his fate  god forbid said sir richard hastily and god forgive you mr redgauntlet for breathing such a thought no i for one will with all duty and humility see him safe back to his vessel and defend him with my life against whosoever shall assail him but when i have seen his sails spread my next act will be to secure if i can my own safety by retiring to my house or if i find our engagement as is too probable has taken wind by surrendering myself to the next justice of peace and giving security that hereafter i shall live quiet and submit to the ruling powers  again the rest of the persons present intimated their agreement in opinion with the speaker  well gentlemen said redgauntlet it is not for me to oppose the opinion of every one and i must do you the justice to say that the king has in the present instance neglected a condition of your agreement which was laid before him in very distinct terms the question now is who is to acquaint him with the result of this conference for i presume you would not wait on him in a body to make the proposal that he should dismiss a person from his family as the price of your allegiance  i think mr redgauntlet should make the explanation said lord as he has doubtless done justice to our remonstrances by communicating them to the king no one can with such propriety and force state the natural and inevitable consequence of their being neglected  now i think said redgauntlet that those who make the objection should state it for i am confident the king will hardly believe on less authority than that of the heir of the loyal house of b that he is the first to seek an evasion of his pledge to join him  an evasion sir repeated lord  fiercely i have borne too much from you already and this i will not endure favour me with your company to the downs  redgauntlet laughed scornfully and was about to follow the fiery young man when sir richard again interposed are we to exhibit he said the last symptoms of the dissolution of our party by turning our swords against each other be patient lord  in such conferences as this much must pass unquestioned which might brook challenge elsewhere there is a privilege of party as of parliamentmen cannot in emergency stand upon picking phrases gentlemen if you will extend your confidence in me so far i will wait upon his majesty and i hope my lord  and mr redgauntlet will accompany me i trust the explanation of this unpleasant matter will prove entirely satisfactory and that we shall find ourselves at liberty to render our homage to our sovereign without reserve when i for one will be the first to peril all in his just quarrel  redgauntlet at once stepped forward my lord he said if my zeal made me say anything in the slightest degree offensive i wish it unsaid and ask your pardon a gentleman can do no more  i could not have asked mr redgauntlet to do so much said the young nobleman willingly accepting the hand which redgauntlet offered i know no man living from whom i could take so much reproof without a sense of degradation as from himself  let me then hope my lord that you will go with sir richard and me to the presence your warm blood will heat our zealour colder resolves will temper yours  the young lord smiled and shook his head alas mr redgauntlet he said i am ashamed to say that in zeal you surpass us all but i will not refuse this mission provided you will permit sir arthur your nephew also to accompany us  my nephew said redgauntlet and seemed to hesitate then added most certainly i trust he said looking at darsie he will bring to his princes presence such sentiments as fit the occasion  it seemed however to darsie that his uncle would rather have left him behind had he not feared that he might in that case have been influenced by or might perhaps himself influence the unresolved confederates with whom he must have associated during his absence  i will go said redgauntlet and request admission  in a moment after he returned and without speaking motioned for the young nobleman to advance he did so followed by sir richard glendale and darsie redgauntlet himself bringing up the rear a short passage and a few steps brought them to the door of the temporary presencechamber in which the royal wanderer was to receive their homage it was the upper loft of one of those cottages which made additions to the old inn poorly furnished dusty and in disorder for rash as the enterprise might be considered they had been still careful not to draw the attention of strangers by any particular attentions to the personal accommodation of the prince he was seated when the deputies as they might be termed of his remaining adherents entered and as he rose and came forward and bowed in acceptance of their salutation it was with a dignified courtesy which at once supplied whatever was deficient in external pomp and converted the wretched garret into a saloon worthy of the occasion  it is needless to add that he was the same personage already introduced in the character of father buonaventure by which name he was distinguished at fairladies his dress was not different from what he then wore excepting that he had a loose ridingcoat of camlet under which he carried an efficient cutandthrust sword instead of his walking rapier and also a pair of pistols  redgauntlet presented to him successively the young lord  and his kinsman sir arthur darsie redgauntlet who trembled as bowing and kissing his hand he found himself surprised into what might be construed an act of high treason which yet he saw no safe means to avoid  sir richard glendale seemed personally known to charles edward who received him with a mixture of dignity and affection and seemed to sympathize with the tears which rushed into that gentlemans eyes as he bade his majesty welcome to his native kingdom  yes my good sir richard said the unfortunate prince in a tone melancholy yet resolved charles edward is with his faithful friends once morenot perhaps with his former gay hopes which undervalued danger but with the same determined contempt of the worst which can befall him in claiming his own rights and those of his country  i rejoice sireand yet alas i must also grieve to see you once more on the british shores said sir richard glendale and stopped shorta tumult of contradictory feelings preventing his further utterance  it is the call of my faithful and suffering people which alone could have induced me to take once more the sword in my hand for my own part sir richard when i have reflected how many of my loyal and devoted friends perished by the sword and by proscription or died indigent and neglected in a foreign land i have often sworn that no view to my personal aggrandizement should again induce me to agitate a title which has cost my followers so dear but since so many men of worth and honour conceive the cause of england and scotland to be linked with that of charles stuart i must follow their brave example and laying aside all other considerations once more stand forward as their deliverer i am however come hither upon your invitation and as you are so completely acquainted with circumstances to which my absence must necessarily have rendered me a stranger i must be a mere tool in the hands of my friends i know well i never can refer myself implicitly to more loyal hearts or wiser heads than herries redgauntlet and sir richard glendale give me your advice then how we are to proceed and decide upon the fate of charles edward  redgauntlet looked at sir richard as if to say can you press any additional or unpleasant condition at a moment like this and the other shook his head and looked down as if his resolution was unaltered and yet as feeling all the delicacy of the situation  there was a silence which was broken by the unfortunate representative of an unhappy dynasty with some appearance of irritation this is strange gentlemen he said you have sent for me from the bosom of my family to head an adventure of doubt and danger and when i come your own minds seem to be still irresolute i had not expected this on the part of two such men  for me sire said redgauntlet the steel of my sword is not truer than the temper of my mind  my lord s and mine are equally so said sir richard but you had in charge mr redgauntlet to convey our request to his majesty coupled with certain conditions  and i discharged my duty to his majesty and to you said redgauntlet  i looked at no condition gentlemen said their king with dignity save that which called me here to assert my rights in person that i have fulfilled at no common risk here i stand to keep my word and i expect of you to be true to yours  there was or should have been something more than that in our proposal please your majesty said sir richard there was a condition annexed to it  i saw it not said charles interrupting him out of tenderness towards the noble hearts of whom i think so highly i would neither see nor read anything which could lessen them in my love and my esteem conditions can have no part betwixt prince and subject  sire said redgauntlet kneeling on one knee i see from sir richards countenance he deems it my fault that your majesty seems ignorant of what your subjects desired that i should communicate to your majesty for heavens sake for the sake of all my past services and sufferings leave not such a stain upon my honour the note number d of which this is a copy referred to the painful subject to which sir richard again directs your attention  you press upon me gentlemen said the prince colouring highly recollections which as i hold them most alien to your character i would willingly have banished from my memory i did not suppose that my loyal subjects would think so poorly of me as to use my depressed circumstances as a reason for forcing themselves into my domestic privacies and stipulating arrangements with their king regarding matters in which the meanest minds claim the privilege of thinking for themselves in affairs of state and public policy i will ever be guided as becomes a prince by the advice of my wisest counsellors in those which regard my private affections and my domestic arrangements i claim the same freedom of will which i allow to all my subjects and without which a crown were less worth wearing than a beggars bonnet  may it please your majesty said sir richard glendale i see it must be my lot to speak unwilling truths but believe me i do so with as much profound respect as deep regret it is true we have called you to head a mighty undertaking and that your majesty preferring honour to safety and the love of your country to your own ease has condescended to become our leader but we also pointed out as a necessary and indispensable preparatory step to the achievement of our purposeand i must say as a positive condition of our engaging in itthat an individual supposedi presume not to guess how trulyto have your majestys more intimate confidence and believed i will not say on absolute proof but upon the most pregnant suspicion to be capable of betraying that confidence to the elector of hanover should be removed from your royal household and society  this is too insolent sir richard said charles edward have you inveigled me into your power to bait me in this unseemly manner and you redgauntlet why did you suffer matters to come to such a point as this without making me more distinctly aware what insults were to be practised on me  my gracious prince said redgauntlet i am so far to blame in this that i did not think so slight an impediment as that of a womans society could have really interrupted an undertaking of this magnitude i am a plain man sire and speak but bluntly i could not have dreamt but what within the first five minutes of this interview either sir richard and his friends would have ceased to insist upon a condition so ungrateful to your majesty or that your majesty would have sacrificed this unhappy attachment to the sound advice or even to the overanxious suspicions of so many faithful subjects i saw no entanglement in such a difficulty which on either side might not have been broken through like a cobweb  you were mistaken sir said charles edward entirely mistakenas much so as you are at this moment when you think in your heart my refusal to comply with this insolent proposition is dictated by a childish and romantic passion for an individual i tell you sir i could part with that person tomorrow without an instants regretthat i have had thoughts of dismissing her from my court for reasons known to myself but that i will never betray my rights as a sovereign and a man by taking this step to secure the favour of any one or to purchase that allegiance which if you owe it to me at all is due to me as my birthright  i am sorry for this said redgauntlet i hope both your majesty and sir richard will reconsider your resolutions or forbear this discussion in a conjuncture so pressing i trust your majesty will recollect that you are on hostile ground that our preparations cannot have so far escaped notice as to permit us now with safety to retreat from our purpose insomuch that it is with the deepest anxiety of heart i foresee even danger to your own royal person unless you can generously give your subjects the satisfaction which sir richard seems to think they are obstinate in demanding  and deep indeed your anxiety ought to be said the prince is it in these circumstances of personal danger in which you expect to overcome a resolution which is founded on a sense of what is due to me as a man or a prince if the axe and scaffold were ready before the windows of whitehall i would rather tread the same path with my greatgrandfather than concede the slightest point in which my honour is concerned  he spoke these words with a determined accent and looked around him on the company all of whom excepting darsie who saw he thought a fair period to a most perilous enterprise seemed in deep anxiety and confusion at length sir richard spoke in a solemn and melancholy tone if the safety he said of poor richard glendale were alone concerned in this matter i have never valued my life enough to weigh it against the slightest point of your majestys service but i am only a messengera commissioner who must execute my trust and upon whom a thousand voices will cry curse and woe if i do it not with fidelity all of your adherents even redgauntlet himself see certain ruin to this enterprisethe greatest danger to your majestys personthe utter destruction of all your party and friends if they insist not on the point which unfortunately your majesty is so unwilling to concede i speak it with a heart full of anguishwith a tongue unable to utter my emotionsbut it must be spokenthe fatal truththat if your royal goodness cannot yield to us a boon which we hold necessary to our security and your own your majesty with one word disarms ten thousand men ready to draw their swords in your behalf or to speak yet more plainly you annihilate even the semblance of a royal party in great britain  and why do you not add said the prince scornfully that the men who have been ready to assume arms in my behalf will atone for their treason to the elector by delivering me up to the fate for which so many proclamations have destined me carry my head to st jamess gentlemen you will do a more acceptable and a more honourable action than having inveigled me into a situation which places me so completely in your power to dishonour yourselves by propositions which dishonour me  my god sire exclaimed sir richard clasping his hands together in impatience of what great and inexpiable crime can your majestys ancestors have been guilty that they have been punished by the infliction of judicial blindness on their whole generationcome my lord  we must to our friends  by your leave sir richard said the young nobleman not till we have learned what measures can be taken for his majestys personal safety  care not for me young man said charles edward when i was in the society of highland robbers and cattledrovers i was safer than i now hold myself among the representatives of the best blood in england farewell gentlemeni will shift for myself  this must never be said redgauntlet let me that brought you to the point of danger at least provide for your safe retreat  so saying he hastily left the apartment followed by his nephew the wanderer averting his eyes from lord  and sir richard glendale threw himself into a seat at the upper end of the apartment while they in much anxiety stood together at a distance from him and conversed in whispers     chapter xxiii  narrative continued  when redgauntlet left the room in haste and discomposure the first person he met on the stair and indeed so close by the door of the apartment that darsie thought he must have been listening there was his attendant nixon  what the devil do you here he said abruptly and sternly  i wait your orders said nixon i hope alls rightexcuse my zeal  all is wrong sir where is the seafaring fellowewartwhat do you call him  nanty ewart sir i will carry your commands said nixon  i will deliver them myself to him said redgauntlet call him hither  but should your honour leave the presence said nixon still lingering  sdeath sir do you prate to me said redgauntlet bending his brows i sir transact my own business you i am told act by a ragged deputy  without further answer nixon departed rather disconcerted as it seemed to darsie  that dog turns insolent and lazy said redgauntlet but i must bear with him for a while  a moment after nixon returned with ewart  is this the smuggling fellow demanded redgauntlet nixon nodded  is he sober now he was brawling anon  sober enough for business said nixon  well then hark ye ewartman your boat with your best hands and have her by the pierget your other fellows on board the brigif you have any cargo left throw it overboard it shall be all paid five times overand be ready for a start to wales or the hebrides or perhaps for sweden or norway  ewart answered sullenly enough aye aye sir  go with him nixon said redgauntlet forcing himself to speak with some appearance of cordiality to the servant with whom he was offended see he does his duty  ewart left the house sullenly followed by nixon the sailor was just in that species of drunken humour which made him jealous passionate and troublesome without showing any other disorder than that of irritability as he walked towards the beach he kept muttering to himself but in such a tone that his companion lost not a word smuggling fellowaye smugglerand start your cargo into the seaand be ready to start for the hebrides or swedenor the devil i suppose well and what if i said in answerrebel jacobitetraitor ill make you and your dd confederates walk the planki have seen better men do ithalf a score of a morningwhen i was across the line  dd unhandsome terms those redgauntlet used to you brother said nixon  which do you mean said ewart starting and recollecting himself i have been at my old trade of thinking aloud have i  no matter answered nixon none but a friend heard you you cannot have forgotten how redgauntlet disarmed you this morning  why i would bear no malice about thatonly he is so cursedly high and saucy said ewart  and then said nixoni know you for a truehearted protestant  that i am by g said ewart no the spaniards could never get my religion from me  and a friend to king george and the hanover line of succession said nixon still walking and speaking very slow  you may swear i am excepting in the way of business as turnpenny says i like king george but i cant afford to pay duties  you are outlawed i believe said nixon  am ifaith i believe i am said ewart i wish i were inlawed again with all my heart but come along we must get all ready for our peremptory gentleman i suppose  i will teach you a better trick said nixon there is a bloody pack of rebels yonder  aye we all know that said the smuggler but the snowballs melting i think  there is some one yonder whose head is worththirty thousandpoundsof sterling money said nixon pausing between each word as if to enforce the magnificence of the sum  and what of that said ewart quickly  only that instead of lying by the pier with your men on their oars if you will just carry your boat on board just now and take no notice of any signal from the shore by gd nanty ewart i will make a man of you for life  oh ho then the jacobite gentry are not so safe as they think themselves said nanty  in an hour or two replied nixon they will be made safer in carlisle castle  the devil they will said ewart and you have been the informer i suppose  yes i have been ill paid for my service among the redgauntletshave scarce got dogs wagesand been treated worse than ever dog was used i have the old fox and his cubs in the same trap now nanty and well see how a certain young lady will look then you see i am frank with you nanty  and i will be as frank with you said the smuggler you are a dd old scoundreltraitor to the man whose bread you eat me help to betray poor devils that have been so often betrayed myself not if they were a hundred popes devils and pretenders i will back and tell them their dangerthey are part of cargoregularly invoicedput under my charge by the ownersill back  you are not stark mad said nixon who now saw he had miscalculated in supposing nantys wild ideas of honour and fidelity could be shaken even by resentment or by his protestant partialities you shall not go backit is all a joke  ill back to redgauntlet and see whether it is a joke he will laugh at  my life is lost if you do said nixonhear reason  they were in a clump or cluster of tall furze at the moment they were speaking about halfway between the pier and the house but not in a direct line from which nixon whose object it was to gain time had induced ewart to diverge insensibly  he now saw the necessity of taking a desperate resolution hear reason he said and added as nanty still endeavoured to pass him or else hear this discharging a pocketpistol into the unfortunate mans body  nanty staggered but kept his feet it has cut my backbone asunder he said you have done me the last good office and i will not die ungrateful  as he uttered the last words he collected his remaining strength stood firm for an instant drew his hanger and fetching a stroke with both hands cut cristal nixon down the blow struck with all the energy of a desperate and dying man exhibited a force to which ewarts exhausted frame might have seemed inadequateit cleft the hat which the wretch wore though secured by a plate of iron within the lining bit deep into his skull and there left a fragment of the weapon which was broke by the fury of the blow  one of the seamen of the lugger who strolled up attracted by the firing of the pistol though being a small one the report was very trifling found both the unfortunate men stark dead alarmed at what he saw which he conceived to have been the consequence of some unsuccessful engagement betwixt his late commander and a revenue officer for nixon chanced not to be personally known to him the sailor hastened back to the boat in order to apprise his comrades of nantys fate and to advise them to take off themselves and the vessel  meantime redgauntlet having as we have seen dispatched nixon for the purpose of securing a retreat for the unfortunate charles in case of extremity returned to the apartment where he had left the wanderer he now found him alone  sir richard glendale said the unfortunate prince with his young friend has gone to consult their adherents now in the house redgauntlet my friend i will not blame you for the circumstances in which i find myself though i am at once placed in danger and rendered contemptible but you ought to have stated to me more strongly the weight which these gentlemen attached to their insolent proposition you should have told me that no compromise would have any effectthat they desire not a prince to govern them but one on the contrary over whom they were to exercise restraint on all occasions from the highest affairs of the state down to the most intimate and private concerns of his own privacy which the most ordinary men desire to keep secret and sacred from interference  god knows said redgauntlet in much agitation i acted for the best when i pressed your majesty to come hitheri never thought that your majesty at such a crisis would have scrupled when a kingdom was in view to sacrifice an attachment which  peace sir said charles it is not for you to estimate my feelings upon such a subject  redgauntlet coloured high and bowed profoundly at least he resumed i hoped that some middle way might be found and it shalland mustcome with me nephew we will to these gentlemen and i am confident i will bring back heartstirring tidings  i will do much to comply with them redgauntlet i am loath having again set my foot on british land to quit it without a blow for my right but this which they demand of me is a degradation and compliance is impossible  redgauntlet followed by his nephew the unwilling spectator of this extraordinary scene left once more the apartment of the adventurous wanderer and was met on the top of the stairs by joe crackenthorp where are the other gentlemen he said  yonder in the west barrack answered joe but master ingoldsbythat was the name by which redgauntlet was most generally known in cumberlandi wish to say to you that i must put yonder folk together in one room  what folk said redgauntlet impatiently  why them prisoner stranger folk as you bid cristal nixon look after lord love you this is a large house enow but we cannot have separate lockups for folk as they have in newgate or in bedlam yonders a mad beggar that is to be a great man when he wins a lawsuit lord help himyonders a quaker and a lawyer charged with a riot and ecod i must make one key and one lock keep them for we are chokeful and you have sent off old nixon that could have given one some help in this confusion besides they take up every one a room and call for naughts on earthexcepting the old man who calls lustily enoughbut he has not a penny to pay shot  do as thou wilt with them said redgauntlet who had listened impatiently to his statement so thou dost but keep them from getting out and making some alarm in the country i care not  a quaker and a lawyer said darsie this must be fairford and geddesuncle i must request of you  nay nephew interrupted redgauntlet this is no time for asking questions you shall yourself decide upon their fate in the course of an hourno harm whatever is designed them  so saying he hurried towards the place where the jacobite gentlemen were holding their council and darsie followed him in the hope that the obstacle which had arisen to the prosecution of their desperate adventure would prove insurmountable and spare him the necessity of a dangerous and violent rupture with his uncle the discussions among them were very eager the more daring part of the conspirators who had little but life to lose being desirous to proceed at all hazards while the others whom a sense of honour and a hesitation to disavow longcherished principles had brought forward were perhaps not ill satisfied to have a fair apology for declining an adventure into which they had entered with more of reluctance than zeal  meanwhile joe crackenthorp availing himself of the hasty permission attained from redgauntlet proceeded to assemble in one apartment those whose safe custody had been thought necessary and without much considering the propriety of the matter he selected for the common place of confinement the room which lilias had since her brothers departure occupied alone it had a strong lock and was doublehinged which probably led to the preference assigned to it as a place of security  into this joe with little ceremony and a good deal of noise introduced the quaker and fairford the first descanting on the immorality the other on the illegality of his proceedings and he turned a deaf ear both to the one and the other next he pushed in almost in headlong fashion the unfortunate litigant who having made some resistance at the threshold had received a violent thrust in consequence and came rushing forward like a ram in the act of charging with such impetus as must have carried him to the top of the room and struck the cocked hat which sat perched on the top of his tow wig against miss redgauntlets person had not the honest quaker interrupted his career by seizing him by the collar and bringing him to a stand friend said he with the real goodbreeding which so often subsists independently of ceremony thou art no company for that young person she is thou seest frightened at our being so suddenly thrust in hither and although that be no fault of ours yet it will become us to behave civilly towards her wherefore come thou with me to this window and i will tell thee what it concerns thee to know  and what for should i no speak to the leddy friend said peter who was now about half seas over i have spoke to leddies before now man what for should she be frightened at me i am nae bogle i ween what are ye pooin me that gate for ye will rive my coat and i will have a good action for having myself made sartum atque tectum at your expenses  notwithstanding this threat mr geddes whose muscles were as strong as his judgement was sound and his temper sedate led poor peter under the sense of a control against which he could not struggle to the farther corner of the apartment where placing him whether he would or no in a chair he sat down beside him and effectually prevented his annoying the young lady upon whom he had seemed bent upon conferring the delights of his society  if peter had immediately recognized his counsel learned in the law it is probable that not even the benevolent efforts of the quaker could have kept him in a state of restraint but fairfords back was turned towards his client whose optics besides being somewhat dazzled with ale and brandy were speedily engaged in contemplating a halfcrown which joshua held between his finger and his thumb saying at the same time friend thou art indigent and improvident this will well employed procure thee sustentation of nature for more than a single day and i will bestow it on thee if thou wilt sit here and keep me company for neither thou nor i friend are fit company for ladies  speak for yourself friend said peter scornfully i was ay kend to be agreeable to the fair sex and when i was in business i served the ladies wi anither sort of decorum than plainstanes the dd awkward scoundrel it was one of the articles of dittay between us  well but friend said the quaker who observed that the young lady still seemed to fear peters intrusion i wish to hear thee speak about this great lawsuit of thine which has been matter of such celebrity  celebrity ye may swear that said peter for the string was touched to which his crazy imagination always vibrated and i dinna wonder that folk that judge things by their outward grandeur should think me something worth their envying its very true that it is grandeur upon earth to hear anes name thunnered out along the longarched roof of the outer housepoor peter peebles against plainstanes et per contra a the best lawyers in the house fleeing like eagles to the prey some because they are in the cause and some because they want to be thought engaged for there are tricks in other trades by selling muslinsto see the reporters mending their pens to take down the debatethe lords themselves pooin in their chairs like folk sitting down to a gude dinner and crying on the clerks for parts and pendicles of the process who puir bodies can do little mair than cry on their closetkeepers to help them to see a this continued peter in a tone of sustained rapture and to ken that naething will be said or dune amang a thae grand folk for maybe the feck of three hours saving what concerns you and your businessoh man nae wonder that ye judge this to be earthly glory and yet neighbour as i was saying there be unco drawbacksi whiles think of my bit house where dinner and supper and breakfast used to come without the crying for just as if fairies had brought itand the gude bed at eenand the needfu penny in the pouch and then to see a anes warldly substance capering in the air in a pair of weighbauks now up now down as the breath of judge or counsel inclines it for pursuer or defendertroth man there are times i rue having ever begun the plea wark though maybe when ye consider the renown and credit i have by it ye will hardly believe what i am saying  indeed friend said joshua with a sigh i am glad thou hast found anything in the legal contention which compensates thee for poverty and hunger but i believe were other human objects of ambition looked upon as closely their advantages would be found as chimerical as those attending thy protracted litigation  but never mind friend said peter ill tell you the exact state of the conjunct processes and make you sensible that i can bring mysell round with a wet finger now i have my finger and my thumb on this loupthedike loon the lad fairford  alan fairford was in the act of speaking to the masked lady for miss redgauntlet had retained her riding vizard endeavouring to assure her as he perceived her anxiety of such protection as he could afford when his own name pronounced in a loud tone attracted his attention he looked round and seeing peter peebles as hastily turned to avoid his notice in which he succeeded so earnest was peter upon his colloquy with one of the most respectable auditors whose attention he had ever been able to engage and by this little motion momentary as it was alan gained an unexpected advantage for while he looked round miss lilias i could never ascertain why took the moment to adjust her mask and did it so awkwardly that when her companion again turned his head he recognized as much of her features as authorized him to address her as his fair client and to press his offers of protection and assistance with the boldness of a former acquaintance  lilias redgauntlet withdrew the mask from her crimsoned cheek mr fairford she said in a voice almost inaudible you have the character of a young gentleman of sense and generosity but we have already met in one situation which you must think singular and i must be exposed to misconstruction at least for my forwardness were it not in a cause in which my dearest affections were concerned  any interest in my beloved friend darsie latimer said fairford stepping a little back and putting a marked restraint upon his former advances gives me a double right to be useful tohe stopped short  to his sister your goodness would say answered lilias  his sister madam replied alan in the extremity of astonishmentsister i presume in affection only  no sir my dear brother darsie and i are connected by the bonds of actual relationship and i am not sorry to be the first to tell this to the friend he most values  fairfords first thought was on the violent passion which darsie had expressed towards the fair unknown good god he exclaimed how did he bear the discovery  with resignation i hope said lilias smiling a more accomplished sister he might easily have come by but scarcely could have found one who could love him more than i do  i meanti only meant to say said the young counsellor his presence of mind failing him for an instantthat is i meant to ask where darsie latimer is at this moment  in this very house and under the guardianship of his uncle whom i believe you knew as a visitor of your father under the name of mr herries of birrenswork  let me hasten to him said fairford i have sought him through difficulties and dangersi must see him instantly  you forget you are a prisoner said the young lady  truetrue but i cannot be long detainedthe cause alleged is too ridiculous  alas said lilias our fatemy brothers and mine at leastmust turn on the deliberations perhaps of less than an hour for you sir i believe and apprehend nothing but some restraint my uncle is neither cruel nor unjust though few will go further in the cause which he has adopted  which is that of the pretend  for gods sake speak lower said lilias approaching her hand as if to stop him the word may cost you your life you do not knowindeed you do notthe terrors of the situation in which we at present stand and in which i fear you also are involved by your friendship for my brother  i do not indeed know the particulars of our situation said fairford but be the danger what it may i shall not grudge my share of it for the sake of my friend or he added with more timidity of my friends sister let me hope he said my dear miss latimer that my presence may be of some use to you and that it may be so let me entreat a share of your confidence which i am conscious i have otherwise no right to ask  he led her as he spoke towards the recess of the farther window of the room and observing to her that unhappily he was particularly exposed to interruption from the mad old man whose entrance had alarmed her he disposed of darsie latimers ridingskirt which had been left in the apartment over the back of two chairs forming thus a sort of screen behind which he ensconced himself with the maiden of the green mantle feeling at the moment that the danger in which he was placed was almost compensated by the intelligence which permitted those feelings towards her to revive which justice to his friend had induced him to stifle in the birth  the relative situation of adviser and advised of protector and protected is so peculiarly suited to the respective condition of man and woman that great progress towards intimacy is often made in very short space for the circumstances call for confidence on the part of the gentleman and forbid coyness on that of the lady so that the usual barriers against easy intercourse are at once thrown down  under these circumstances securing themselves as far as possible from observation conversing in whispers and seated in a corner where they were brought into so close contact that their faces nearly touched each other fairford heard from lilias redgauntlet the history of her family particularly of her uncle his views upon her brother and the agony which she felt lest at that very moment he might succeed in engaging darsie in some desperate scheme fatal to his fortune and perhaps to his life  alan fairfords acute understanding instantly connected what he had heard with the circumstances he had witnessed at fairladies his first thought was to attempt at all risks his instant escape and procure assistance powerful enough to crush in the very cradle a conspiracy of such a determined character this he did not consider as difficult for though the door was guarded on the outside the window which was not above ten feet from the ground was open for escape the common on which it looked was unenclosed and profusely covered with furze there would he thought be little difficulty in effecting his liberty and in concealing his course after he had gained it  but lilias exclaimed against this scheme her uncle she said was a man who in his moments of enthusiasm knew neither remorse nor fear he was capable of visiting upon darsie any injury which he might conceive fairford had rendered himhe was her near kinsman also and not an unkind one and she deprecated any effort even in her brothers favour by which his life must be exposed to danger fairford himself remembered father buonaventure and made little question but that he was one of the sons of the old chevalier de saint george and with feelings which although contradictory of his public duty can hardly be much censured his heart recoiled from being the agent by whom the last scion of such a long line of scottish princes should be rooted up he then thought of obtaining an audience if possible of this devoted person and explaining to him the utter hopelessness of his undertaking which he judged it likely that the ardour of his partisans might have concealed from him but he relinquished this design as soon as formed he had no doubt that any light which he could throw on the state of the country would come too late to be serviceable to one who was always reported to have his own full share of the hereditary obstinacy which had cost his ancestors so dear and who in drawing the sword must have thrown from him the scabbard  lilias suggested the advice which of all others seemed most suited to the occasion that yielding namely to the circumstances of their situation they should watch carefully when darsie should obtain any degree of freedom and endeavour to open a communication with him in which case their joint flight might be effected and without endangering the safety of any one  their youthful deliberation had nearly fixed in this point when fairford who was listening to the low sweet whispering tones of lilias redgauntlet rendered yet more interesting by some slight touch of foreign accent was startled by a heavy hand which descended with full weight on his shoulder while the discordant voice of peter peebles who had at length broke loose from the wellmeaning quaker exclaimed in the ear of his truant counselaha lad i think ye are catchedan so ye are turned chambercounsel are ye and ye have drawn up wi clients in scarfs and hoods but bide a wee billie and see if i dinna sort ye when my petition and complaint comes to be discussed with or without answers under certification  alan fairford had never more difficulty in his life to subdue a first emotion than he had to refrain from knocking down the crazy blockhead who had broken in upon him at such a moment but the length of peters address gave him time fortunately perhaps for both parties to reflect on the extreme irregularity of such a proceeding he stood silent however with vexation while peter went on  weel my bonnie man i see ye are thinking shame o yoursell and nae great wonder ye maun leave this queanthe like of her is ower light company for you i have heard honest mr pest say that the gown grees ill wi the petticoat but come awa hame to your puir father and ill take care of you the haill gate and keep you company and deil a word we will speak about but just the state of the conjoined processes of the great cause of poor peter peebles against plainstanes  if thou canst endure to hear as much of that suit friend said the quaker as i have heard out of mere compassion for thee i think verily thou wilt soon be at the bottom of the matter unless it be altogether bottomless  fairford shook off rather indignantly the large bony hand which peter had imposed upon his shoulder and was about to say something peevish upon so unpleasant and insolent a mode of interruption when the door opened a treble voice saying to the sentinel i tell you i maun be in to see if mr nixons here and little benjie thrust in his mophead and keen black eyes ere he could withdraw it peter peebles sprang to the door seized on the boy by the collar and dragged him forward into the room  let me see it he said ye neerdoweel limb of satanill gar you satisfy the production i trowill hae first and second diligence against you ye deevils buckie  what dost thou want said the quaker interfering why dost thou frighten the boy friend peebles  i gave the bastard a penny to buy me snuff said the pauper and he has rendered no account of his intromissions but ill gar him as gude  so saying he proceeded forcibly to rifle the pockets of benjies ragged jacket of one or two snares for game marbles a halfbitten apple two stolen eggs one of which peter broke in the eagerness of his research and various other unconsidered trifles which had not the air of being very honestly come by the little rascal under this discipline bit and struggled like a foxcub but like that vermin uttered neither cry nor complaint till a note which peter tore from his bosom flew as far as lilias redgauntlet and fell at her feet it was addressed to c n  it is for the villain nixon she said to alan fairford open it without scruple that boy is his emissary we shall now see what the miscreant is driving at  little benjie now gave up all further struggle and suffered peebles to take from him without resistance a shilling out of which peter declared he would pay himself principal and interest and account for the balance the boy whose attention seemed fixed on something very different only said maister nixon will murder me  alan fairford did not hesitate to read the little scrap of paper on which was written all is preparedkeep them in play until i come up you may depend on your rewardc c  alas my unclemy poor uncle said lilias this is the result of his confidence methinks to give him instant notice of his confidants treachery is now the best service we can render all concernedif they break up their undertaking as they must now do darsie will be at liberty  in the same breath they were both at the halfopened door of the room fairford entreating to speak with the father buonaventure and lilias equally vehemently requesting a moments interview with her uncle while the sentinel hesitated what to do his attention was called to a loud noise at the door where a crowd had been assembled in consequence of the appalling cry that the enemy were upon them occasioned as it afterwards proved by some stragglers having at length discovered the dead bodies of nanty ewart and of nixon  amid the confusion occasioned by this alarming incident the sentinel ceased to attend to his duty and accepting alan fairfords arm lilias found no opposition in penetrating even to the inner apartment where the principal persons in the enterprise whose conclave had been disturbed by this alarming incident were now assembled in great confusion and had been joined by the chevalier himself  only a mutiny among these smuggling scoundrels said redgauntlet  only a mutiny do you say said sir richard glendale and the lugger the last hope of escape forhe looked towards charlesstands out to sea under a press of sail  do not concern yourself about me said the unfortunate prince this is not the worst emergency in which it has been my lot to stand and if it were i fear it not shift for yourselves my lords and gentlemen  no never said the young lord  our only hope now is in an honourable resistance  most true said redgauntlet let despair renew the union amongst us which accident disturbed i give my voice for displaying the royal banner instantly andhow now he concluded sternly as lilias first soliciting his attention by pulling his cloak put into his hand the scroll and added it was designed for that of nixon  redgauntlet readand dropping it on the ground continued to stare upon the spot where it fell with raised hands and fixed eyes sir richard glendale lifted the fatal paper read it and saying now all is indeed over handed it to maxwell who said aloud black colin campbell by gd i heard he had come post from london last night  as if in echo to his thoughts the violin of the blind man was heard playing with spirit the campbells are coming a celebrated clanmarch  the campbells are coming in earnest said mackellar they are upon us with the whole battalion from carlisle  there was a silence of dismay and two or three of the company began to drop out of the room  lord  spoke with the generous spirit of a young english nobleman if we have been fools do not let us be cowards we have one here more precious than us all and come hither on our warrantylet us save him at least  true most true answered sir richard glendale let the king be first cared for  that shall be my business said redgauntlet if we have but time to bring back the brig all will be welli will instantly dispatch a party in a fishing skiff to bring her to he gave his commands to two or three of the most active among his followers let him be once on board he said and there are enough of us to stand to arms and cover his retreat  right right said sir richard and i will look to points which can be made defensible and the old powderplot boys could not have made a more desperate resistance than we shall redgauntlet continued he i see some of our friends are looking pale but methinks your nephew has more mettle in his eye now than when we were in cold deliberation with danger at a distance  it is the way of our house said redgauntlet our courage ever kindles highest on the losing side i too feel that the catastrophe i have brought on must not be survived by its author let me first he said addressing charles see your majestys sacred person in such safety as can now be provided for it and then  you may spare all considerations concerning me gentlemen again repeated charles yon mountain of criffel shall fly as soon as i will  most threw themselves at his feet with weeping and entreaty some one or two slunk in confusion from the apartment and were heard riding off unnoticed in such a scene darsie his sister and fairford drew together and held each other by the hands as those who when a vessel is about to founder in the storm determine to take their chance of life and death together  amid this scene of confusion a gentleman plainly dressed in a ridinghabit with a black cockade in his hat but without any arms except a couteaudechasse walked into the apartment without ceremony he was a tall thin gentlemanly man with a look and bearing decidedly military he had passed through their guards if in the confusion they now maintained any without stop or question and now stood almost unarmed among armed men who nevertheless gazed on him as on the angel of destruction  you look coldly on me gentlemen he said sir richard glendalemy lord  we were not always such strangers ha pateinperil how is it with you and you too ingoldsbyi must not call you by any other namewhy do you receive an old friend so coldly but you guess my errand  and are prepared for it general said redgauntlet we are not men to be penned up like sheep for the slaughter  pshaw you take it too seriouslylet me speak but one word with you  no words can shake our purpose said redgauntlet were your whole command as i suppose is the case drawn round the house  i am certainly not unsupported said the general but if you would hear me  hear me sir said the wanderer stepping forward i suppose i am the mark you aim ati surrender myself willingly to save these gentlemens dangerlet this at least avail in their favour  an exclamation of never never broke from the little body of partisans who threw themselves round the unfortunate prince and would have seized or struck down campbell had it not been that he remained with his arms folded and a look rather indicating impatience because they would not hear him than the least apprehension of violence at their hand  at length he obtained a moments silence i do not he said know this gentlemanmaking a profound bow to the unfortunate princei do not wish to know him it is a knowledge which would suit neither of us  our ancestors nevertheless have been well acquainted said charles unable to suppress even at that hour of dread and danger the painful recollections of fallen royalty  in one word general campbell said redgauntlet is it to be peace or war you are a man of honour and we can trust you  i thank you sir said the general and i reply that the answer to your question rests with yourself come do not be fools gentlemen there was perhaps no great harm meant or intended by your gathering together in this obscure corner for a bearbait or a cockfight or whatever other amusement you may have intended but it was a little imprudent considering how you stand with government and it has occasioned some anxiety exaggerated accounts of your purpose have been laid before government by the information of a traitor in your own counsels and i was sent down post to take the command of a sufficient number of troops in case these calumnies should be found to have any real foundation i have come here of course sufficiently supported both with cavalry and infantry to do whatever might be necessary but my commands areand i am sure they agree with my inclinationto make no arrests nay to make no further inquiries of any kind if this good assembly will consider their own interest so far as to give up their immediate purpose and return quietly home to their own houses  whatall exclaimed sir richard glendaleall without exception  all without one single exception said the general such are my orders if you accept my terms say so and make haste for things may happen to interfere with his majestys kind purposes towards you all  majestys kind purposes said the wanderer do i hear you aright sir  i speak the kings very words from his very lips replied the general i will said his majesty deserve the confidence of my subjects by reposing my security in the fidelity of the millions who acknowledge my titlein the good sense and prudence of the few who continue from the errors of education to disown it his majesty will not even believe that the most zealous jacobites who yet remain can nourish a thought of exciting a civil war which must be fatal to their families and themselves besides spreading bloodshed and ruin through a peaceful land he cannot even believe of his kinsman that he would engage brave and generous though mistaken men in an attempt which must ruin all who have escaped former calamities and he is convinced that did curiosity or any other motive lead that person to visit this country he would soon see it was his wisest course to return to the continent and his majesty compassionates his situation too much to offer any obstacle to his doing so  is this real said redgauntlet can you mean this am iare all are any of these gentlemen at liberty without interruption to embark in yonder brig which i see is now again approaching the shore  you sirallany of the gentlemen present said the generalall whom the vessel can contain are at liberty to embark uninterrupted by me but i advise none to go off who have not powerful reasons unconnected with the present meeting for this will be remembered against no one  then gentlemen said redgauntlet clasping his hands together as the words burst from him the cause is lost for ever  general campbell turned away to the window as if to avoid hearing what they said their consultation was but momentary for the door of escape which thus opened was as unexpected as the exigence was threatening  we have your word of honour for our protection said sir richard glendale if we dissolve our meeting in obedience to your summons  you have sir richard answered the general  and i also have your promise said redgauntlet that i may go on board yonder vessel with any friend whom i may choose to accompany me  not only that mr ingoldsbyor i will call you mr redgauntlet once moreyou may stay in the offing for a tide until you are joined by any person who may remain at fairladies after that there will be a sloop of war on the station and i need not say your condition will then become perilous  perilous it should not be general campbell said redgauntlet or more perilous to others than to us if others thought as i do even in this extremity  you forget yourself my friend said the unhappy adventurer you forget that the arrival of this gentleman only puts the copestone on our already adopted resolution to abandon our bullfight or by whatever other wild name this headlong enterprise may be termed i bid you farewell unfriendly friendsi bid you farewell bowing to the general my friendly foei leave this strand as i landed upon it alone and to return no more  not alone said redgauntlet while there is blood in the veins of my fathers son  not alone said the other gentlemen present stung with feelings which almost overpowered the better reasons under which they had acted we will not disown our principles or see your person endangered  if it be only your purpose to see the gentleman to the beach said general campbell i will myself go with you my presence among you unarmed and in your power will be a pledge of my friendly intentions and will overawe should such be offered any interruption on the part of officious persons  be it so said the adventurer with the air of a prince to a subject not of one who complied with the request of an enemy too powerful to be resisted  they left the apartmentthey left the housean unauthenticated and dubious but appalling sensation of terror had already spread itself among the inferior retainers who had so short time before strutted and bustled and thronged the doorway and the passages a report had arisen of which the origin could not be traced of troops advancing towards the spot in considerable numbers and men who for one reason or other were most of them amenable to the arm of power had either shrunk into stables or corners or fled the place entirely there was solitude on the landscape excepting the small party which now moved towards the rude pier where a boat lay manned agreeably to redgauntlets orders previously given  the last heir of the stuarts leant on redgauntlets arm as they walked towards the beach for the ground was rough and he no longer possessed the elasticity of limb and of spirit which had twenty years before carried him over many a highland hill as light as one of their native deer his adherents followed looking on the ground their feelings struggling against the dictates of their reason  general campbell accompanied them with an air of apparent ease and indifference but watching at the same time and no doubt with some anxiety the changing features of those who acted in this extraordinary scene  darsie and his sister naturally followed their uncle whose violence they no longer feared while his character attracted their respect and alan fairford attended them from interest in their fate unnoticed in a party where all were too much occupied with their own thoughts and feelings as well as with the impending crisis to attend to his presence  halfway betwixt the house and the beach they saw the bodies of nanty ewart and cristal nixon blackening in the sun  that was your informer said redgauntlet looking back to general campbell who only nodded his assent  caitiff wretch exclaimed redgauntletand yet the name were better bestowed on the fool who could be misled by thee  that sound broadsword cut said the general has saved us the shame of rewarding a traitor  they arrived at the place of embarkation the prince stood a moment with folded arms and looked around him in deep silence a paper was then slipped into his handshe looked at it and said i find the two friends i have left at fairladies are apprised of my destination and propose to embark from bowness i presume this will not be an infringement of the conditions under which you have acted  certainly not answered general campbell they shall have all facility to join you  i wish then said charles only another companion redgauntlet the air of this country is as hostile to you as it is to me these gentlemen have made their peace or rather they have done nothing to break it but youcome you and share my home where chance shall cast it we shall never see these shores again but we will talk of them and of our disconcerted bullfight  i follow you sire through life said redgauntlet as i would have followed you to death permit me one moment  the prince then looked round and seeing the abashed countenances of his other adherents bent upon the ground he hastened to say do not think that you gentlemen have obliged me less because your zeal was mingled with prudence entertained i am sure more on my own account and on that of your country than from selfish apprehensions  he stepped from one to another and amid sobs and bursting tears received the adieus of the last remnant which had hitherto supported his lofty pretensions and addressed them individually with accents of tenderness and affection  the general drew a little aloof and signed to redgauntlet to speak with him while this scene proceeded it is now all over he said and jacobite will be henceforward no longer a party name when you tire of foreign parts and wish to make your peace let me know your restless zeal alone has impeded your pardon hitherto  and now i shall not need it said redgauntlet i leave england for ever but i am not displeased that you should hear my family adieusnephew come hither in presence of general campbell i tell you that though to breed you up in my own political opinions has been for many years my anxious wish i am now glad that it could not be accomplished you pass under the service of the reigning monarch without the necessity of changing your allegiancea change however he added looking around him which sits more easy on honourable men than i could have anticipated but some wear the badge of their loyalty on their sleeve and others in the heart you will from henceforth be uncontrolled master of all the property of which forfeiture could not deprive your fatherof all that belonged to himexcepting this his good sword laying his hand on the weapon he wore which shall never fight for the house of hanover and as my hand will never draw weapon more i shall sink it forty fathoms deep in the wide ocean bless you young man if i have dealt harshly with you forgive me i had set my whole desires on one pointgod knows with no selfish purpose and i am justly punished by this final termination of my views for having been too little scrupulous in the means by which i pursued themniece farewell and may god bless you also  no sir said lilias seizing his hand eagerly you have been hitherto my protectoryou are now in sorrow let me be your attendant and your comforter in exile  i thank you my girl for your unmerited affection but it cannot and must not be the curtain here falls between us i go to the house of another if i leave it before i quit the earth it shall be only for the house of god once more farewell both the fatal doom he said with a melancholy smile will i trust now depart from the house of redgauntlet since its present representative has adhered to the winning side i am convinced he will not change it should it in turn become the losing one  the unfortunate charles edward had now given his last adieus to his downcast adherents he made a sign with his hand to redgauntlet who came to assist him into the skiff general campbell also offered his assistance the rest appearing too much affected by the scene which had taken place to prevent him  you are not sorry general to do me this last act of courtesy said the chevalier and on my part i thank you for it you have taught me the principle on which men on the scaffold feel forgiveness and kindness even for their executioner farewell  they were seated in the boat which presently pulled off from the land the oxford divine broke out into a loud benediction in terms which general campbell was too generous to criticize at the time or to remember afterwardsnay it is said that whig and campbell as he was he could not help joining in the universal amen which resounded from the shore     conclusion by dr dryasdust  in a letter to the author of waverley  i am truly sorry my worthy and muchrespected sir that my anxious researches have neither in the form of letters nor of diaries or other memoranda been able to discover more than i have hitherto transmitted of the history of the redgauntlet family but i observe in an old newspaper called the whitehall gazette of which i fortunately possess a file for several years that sir arthur darsie redgauntlet was presented to his late majesty at the drawingroom by lieutgeneral campbellupon which the editor observes in the way of comment that we were going remis atque velis into the interests of the pretender since a scot had presented a jacobite at court i am sorry i have not room the frank being only uncial for his further observations tending to show the apprehensions entertained by many wellinstructed persons of the period that the young king might himself be induced to become one of the stuarts factiona catastrophe from which it has pleased heaven to preserve these kingdoms  i perceive also by a marriagecontract in the family repositories that miss lilias redgauntlet of redgauntlet about eighteen months after the transactions you have commemorated intermarried with alan fairford esq advocate of clinkdollar who i think we may not unreasonably conclude to be the same person whose name occurs so frequently in the pages of your narration in my last excursion to edinburgh i was fortunate enough to discover an old caddie from whom at the expense of a bottle of whisky and half a pound of tobacco i extracted the important information that he knew peter peebles very well and had drunk many a mutchkin with him in caddie frasers time he said that he lived ten years after king georges accession in the momentary expectation of winning his cause every day in the session time and every hour in the day and at last fell down dead in what my informer called a perplexity fit upon a proposal for a composition being made to him in the outer house i have chosen to retain my informers phrase not being able justly to determine whether it is a corruption of the word apoplexy as my friend mr oldbuck supposes or the name of some peculiar disorder incidental to those who have concern in the courts of law as many callings and conditions of men have diseases appropriate to themselves the same caddie also remembered blind willie stevenson who was called wandering willie and who ended his days unco beinly in sir arthur redgauntlets ha neuk he had done the family some good turn he said specially when ane of the argyle gentlemen was coming down on a wheen of them that had the auld leaven about them and wad hae taen every man of them and nae less nor headed and hanged them but willie and a friend they had called robin the rambler gae them warning by playing tunes such as the campbells are coming and the like whereby they got timeous warning to take the wing i need not point out to your acuteness my worthy sir that this seems to refer to some inaccurate account of the transactions in which you seem so much interested  respecting redgauntlet about whose subsequent history you are more particularly inquisitive i have learned from an excellent person who was a priest in the scottish monastery of ratisbon before its suppression that he remained for two or three years in the family of the chevalier and only left it at last in consequence of some discords in that melancholy household as he had hinted to general campbell he exchanged his residence for the cloister and displayed in the latter part of his life a strong sense of the duties of religion which in his earlier days he had too much neglected being altogether engaged in political speculations and intrigues he rose to the situation of prior in the house which he belonged to and which was of a very strict order of religion he sometimes received his countrymen whom accident brought to ratisbon and curiosity induced to visit the monastery of  but it was remarked that though he listened with interest and attention when britain or particularly scotland became the subject of conversation yet he never either introduced or prolonged the subject never used the english language never inquired about english affairs and above all never mentioned his own family his strict observation of the rules of his order gave him at the time of his death some pretensions to be chosen a saint and the brethren of the monastery of  made great efforts for that effect and brought forward some plausible proofs of miracles but there was a circumstance which threw a doubt over the subject and prevented the consistory from acceding to the wishes of the worthy brethren under his habit and secured in a small silver box he had worn perpetually around his neck a lock ofhair which the fathers avouched to be a relic but the avvocato del diabolo in combating as was his official duty the pretensions of the candidate for sanctity made it at least equally probable that the supposed relic was taken from the head of a brother of the deceased prior who had been executed for adherence to the stuart family in 17456 and the motto haud obliviscendum seemed to intimate a tone of mundane feeling and recollection of injuries which made it at least doubtful whether even in the quiet and gloom of the cloister father hugo had forgotten the sufferings and injuries of the house of redgauntlet  june 10 1824     notes  note 1the society of friends  in explanation of this circumstance i cannot help adding a note not very necessary for the reader which yet i record with pleasure from recollection of the kindness which it evinces in early youth i resided for a considerable time in the vicinity of the beautiful village of kelso where my life passed in a very solitary manner i had few acquaintances scarce any companions and books which were at the time almost essential to my happiness were difficult to come by it was then that i was particularly indebted to the liberality and friendship of an old lady of the society of friends eminent for her benevolence and charity her deceased husband had been a medical man of eminence and left her with other valuable property a small and wellselected library this the kind old lady permitted me to rummage at pleasure and carry home what volumes i chose on condition that i should take at the same time some of the tracts printed for encouraging and extending the doctrines of her own sect she did not even exact any promise that i would read these performances being too justly afraid of involving me in a breach of promise but was merely desirous that i should have the chance of instruction within my reach in case whim curiosity or accident might induce me to have recourse to it   note 2the persecutors  the personages here mentioned are most of them characters of historical fame but those less known and remembered may be found in the tract entitled the judgment and justice of god exemplified or a brief historical account of some of the wicked lives and miserable deaths of some of the most remarkable apostates and bloody persecutors from the reformation till after the revolution this constitutes a sort of postscript or appendix to john howie of lochgoins account of the lives of the most eminent scots worthies the author has with considerable ingenuity reversed his reasoning upon the inference to be drawn from the prosperity or misfortunes which befall individuals in this world either in the course of their lives or in the hour of death in the account of the martyrs sufferings such inflictions are mentioned only as trials permitted by providence for the better and brighter display of their faith and constancy of principle but when similar afflictions befell the opposite party they are imputed to the direct vengeance of heaven upon their impiety if indeed the life of any person obnoxious to the historians censures happened to have passed in unusual prosperity the mere fact of its being finally concluded by death is assumed as an undeniable token of the judgement of heaven and to render the conclusion inevitable his last scene is generally garnished with some singular circumstances thus the duke of lauderdale is said through old age but immense corpulence to have become so sunk in spirits that his heart was not the bigness of a walnut   note 3lamentation for the dead  i have heard in my youth some such wild tale as that placed in the mouth of the blind fiddler of which i think the hero was sir robert grierson of lagg the famous persecutor but the belief was general throughout scotland that the excessive lamentation over the loss of friends disturbed the repose of the dead and broke even the rest of the grave there are several instances of this in tradition but one struck me particularly as i heard it from the lips of one who professed receiving it from those of a ghostseer this was a highland lady named mrs c of b who probably believed firmly in the truth of an apparition which seems to have originated in the weakness of her nerves and strength of her imagination she had been lately left a widow by her husband with the office of guardian to their only child the young man added to the difficulties of his charge by an extreme propensity for a military life which his mother was unwilling to give way to while she found it impossible to repress it about this time the independent companies formed for the preservation of the peace of the highlands were in the course of being levied and as a gentleman named cameron nearly connected with mrs c commanded one of those companies she was at length persuaded to compromise the matter with her son by permitting him to enter this company in the capacity of a cadet thus gratifying his love of a military life without the dangers of foreign service to which no one then thought these troops were at all liable to be exposed while even their active service at home was not likely to be attended with much danger she readily obtained a promise from her relative that he would be particular in his attention to her son and therefore concluded she had accommodated matters between her sons wishes and his safety in a way sufficiently attentive to both she set off to edinburgh to get what was awanting for his outfit and shortly afterwards received melancholy news from the highlands the independent company into which her son was to enter had a skirmish with a party of caterans engaged in some act of spoil and her friend the captain being wounded and out of the reach of medical assistance died in consequence this news was a thunderbolt to the poor mother who was at once deprived of her kinsmans advice and assistance and instructed by his fate of the unexpected danger to which her sons new calling exposed him she remained also in great sorrow for her relative whom she loved with sisterly affection these conflicting causes of anxiety together with her uncertainty whether to continue or change her sons destination were terminated in the following manner  the house in which mrs c resided in the old town of edinburgh was a flat or story of a land accessible as was then universal by a common stair the family who occupied the story beneath were her acquaintances and she was in the habit of drinking tea with them every evening it was accordingly about six oclock when recovering herself from a deep fit of anxious reflection she was about to leave the parlour in which she sat in order to attend this engagement the door through which she was to pass opened as was very common in edinburgh into a dark passage in this passage and within a yard of her when she opened the door stood the apparition of her kinsman the deceased officer in his full tartans and wearing his bonnet terrified at what she saw or thought she saw she closed the door hastily and sinking on her knees by a chair prayed to be delivered from the horrors of the vision she remained in that posture till her friends below tapped on the door to intimate that tea was ready recalled to herself by the signal she arose and on opening the apartment door again was confronted by the visionary highlander whose bloody brow bore token on this second appearance to the death he had died unable to endure this repetition of her terrors mrs c sank on the door in a swoon her friends below startled with the noise came upstairs and alarmed at the situation in which they found her insisted on her going to bed and taking some medicine in order to compose what they took for a nervous attack they had no sooner left her in quiet than the apparition of the soldier was once more visible in the apartment this time she took courage and said in the name of god donald why do you haunt one who respected and loved you when living to which he answered readily in gaelic cousin why did you not speak sooner my rest is disturbed by your unnecessary lamentationyour tears scald me in my shroud i come to tell you that my untimely death ought to make no difference in your views for your son god will raise patrons to supply my place and he will live to the fullness of years and die honoured and at peace the lady of course followed her kinsmans advice and as she was accounted a person of strict veracity we may conclude the first apparition an illusion of the fancy the final one a lively dream suggested by the other two   note 4peter peebles  this unfortunate litigant for a person named peter peebles actually flourished frequented the courts of justice in scotland about the year 1792 and the sketch of his appearance is given from recollection the author is of opinion that he himself had at one time the honour to be counsel for peter peebles whose voluminous course of litigation served as a sort of assaypieces to most young men who were called to the bar the scene of the consultation is entirely imaginary   note 5johns coffeehouse  this small dark coffeehouse now burnt down was the resort of such writers and clerks belonging to the parliament house above thirty years ago as retained the ancient scottish custom of a meridian as it was called or noontide dram of spirits if their proceedings were watched they might be seen to turn fidgety about the hour of noon and exchange looks with each other from their separate desks till at length some one of formal and dignified presence assumed the honour of leading the band when away they went threading the crowd like a string of wild fowl crossed the square or close and following each other into the coffeehouse received in turn from the hand of the waiter the meridian which was placed ready at the bar this they did day by day and though they did not speak to each other they seemed to attach a certain degree of sociability to performing the ceremony in company   note 6fishing rights  it may be here mentioned that a violent and popular attack upon what the country people of this district considered as an invasion of their fishing right is by no means an improbable fiction shortly after the close of the american war sir james graham of netherby constructed a damdyke or cauld across the esk at a place where it flowed through his estate though it has its origin and the principal part of its course in scotland the new barrier at netherby was considered as an encroachment calculated to prevent the salmon from ascending into scotland and the right of erecting it being an international question of law betwixt the sister kingdoms there was no court in either competent to its decision in this dilemma the scots people assembled in numbers by signal of rocket lights and rudely armed with fowlingpieces fishspears and such rustic weapons marched to the banks of the river for the purpose of pulling down the damdyke objected to sir james graham armed many of his own people to protect his property and had some military from carlisle for the same purpose a renewal of the border wars had nearly taken place in the eighteenth century when prudence and moderation on both sides saved much tumult and perhaps some bloodshed the english proprietor consented that a breach should be made in his damdyke sufficient for the passage of the fish and thus removed the scottish grievance i believe the river has since that time taken the matter into its own disposal and entirely swept away the damdyke in question   note 7state of scotland  scotland in its halfcivilized state exhibited too many examples of the exertion of arbitrary force and violence rendered easy by the dominion which lairds exerted over their tenants and chiefs over their clans the captivity of lady grange in the desolate cliffs of saint kilda is in the recollection of every one at the supposed date of the novel also a man of the name of merrilees a tanner in leith absconded from his country to escape his creditors and after having slain his own mastiff dog and put a bit of red cloth in its mouth as if it had died in a contest with soldiers and involved his own existence in as much mystery as possible made his escape into yorkshire here he was detected by persons sent in search of him to whom he gave a portentous account of his having been carried off and concealed in various places mr merrilees was in short a kind of male elizabeth canning but did not trespass on the public credulity quite so long   note 8concealments for theft and smuggling  i am sorry to say that the modes of concealment described in the imaginary premises of mr trumbull are of a kind which have been common on the frontiers of late years the neighbourhood of two nations having different laws though united in government still leads to a multitude of transgressions on the border and extreme difficulty in apprehending delinquents about twenty years since as far as my recollection serves there was along the frontier an organized gang of coiners forgers smugglers and other malefactors whose operations were conducted on a scale not inferior to what is here described the chief of the party was one richard mendham a carpenter who rose to opulence although ignorant even of the arts of reading and writing but he had found a short road to wealth and had taken singular measures for conducting his operations amongst these he found means to build in a suburb of berwick called spittal a street of small houses as if for the investment of property he himself inhabited one of these another a species of publichouse was open to his confederates who held secret and unsuspected communication with him by crossing the roofs of the intervening houses and descending by a trapstair which admitted them into the alcove of the diningroom of dick mendhams private mansion a vault too beneath mendhams stable was accessible in the manner mentioned in the novel the post of one of the stalls turned round on a bolt being withdrawn and gave admittance to a subterranean place of concealment for contraband and stolen goods to a great extent richard mendham the head of this very formidable conspiracy which involved malefactors of every kind was tried and executed at jedburgh where the author was present as sheriff of selkirkshire mendham had previously been tried but escaped by want of proof and the ingenuity of his counsel   note 9coronation of george iii  in excuse of what may be considered as a violent infraction of probability in this chapter the author is under the necessity of quoting a tradition which many persons may recollect having heard it was always said though with very little appearance of truth that upon the coronation of the late george iii when the champion of england dymock or his representative appeared in westminster hall and in the language of chivalry solemnly wagered his body to defend in single combat the right of the young king to the crown of these realms at the moment when he flung down his gauntlet as the gage of battle an unknown female stepped from the crowd and lifted the pledge leaving another gage in room of it with a paper expressing that if a fair field of combat should be allowed a champion of rank and birth would appear with equal arms to dispute the claim of king george to the british kingdoms the story is probably one of the numerous fictions which were circulated to keep up the spirits of a sinking faction the incident was however possible if it could be supposed to be attended by any motive adequate to the risk and might be imagined to occur to a person of redgauntlets enthusiastic character george iii it is said had a police of his own whose agency was so efficient that the sovereign was able to tell his prime minister upon one occasion to his great surprise that the pretender was in london the prime minister began immediately to talk of measures to be taken warrants to be procured messengers and guards to be got in readiness pooh pooh said the goodnatured sovereign since i have found him out leave me alone to deal with himand what said the minister is your majestys purpose in so important a caseto leave the young man to himself said george iii and when he tires he will go back again the truth of this story does not depend on that of the lifting of the gauntlet and while the latter could be but an idle bravado the former expresses george ills goodness of heart and soundness of policy   note 10collier and salter  the persons engaged in these occupations were at this time bondsmen and in case they left the ground of the farm to which they belonged and as pertaining to which their services were bought or sold they were liable to be brought back by a summary process the existence of this species of slavery being thought irreconcilable with the spirit of liberty colliers and salters were declared free and put upon the same footing with other servants by the act 15 geo iii chapter 28th they were so far from desiring or prizing the blessing conferred on them that they esteemed the interest taken in their freedom to be a mere decree on the part of the proprietors to get rid of what they called head and harigald money payable to them when a female of their number by bearing a child made an addition to the live stock of their masters property     glossary     aboon above    ad litem in
