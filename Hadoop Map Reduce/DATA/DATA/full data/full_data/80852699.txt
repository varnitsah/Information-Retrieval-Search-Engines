80852699	the two sides of the shield  by  charlotte m yonge      preface    it is sometimes treated as an impertinence to revive the personages of one story in another even though it is after the example of shakespeare who revived falstaff after his death at the behest of queen elizabeth  this precedent is however a true impertinence in calling on the very great to justify the very small  yet many a letter in youthful handwriting has begged for further information on the fate of the beings that had become favourites of the schoolroom and this has induced me to believe that the following out of my own notions as to the careers of former heroes and heroines might not be unwelcome while i have tried to make the story stand independently for new readers unacquainted with the tale in which lady merrifield and her brothers and sisters first appeared  scenes and characters was however published so long ago that the young readers of this generation certainly will only know it if it has had the good fortune to have been preserved by their mothers  it was only my second book and in looking back at it so as to preserve consistency i have been astonished at its crudeness  it will explain a few illusions to state that it is the story of the motherless family of mohuns of beechcroft with a kindly deaf father at the head mr mohun whose pet name was the baron of beechcroft owing to a romantic notion of his daughters made fun of by his sons  the eldest sister a stiff sensible dry woman had just married and gone to india leaving her post to the next in age emily who was much too indolent for the charge  lilies the third in age with her head full of the kind of high romance and sentiment more prevalent thirty or forty years ago than now imagined that whereas the household had formerly been ruled by duty it now might be so by love  of course confusion dire was the consequence chiefly with the younger boys the scientific crossgrained maurice and the highspirited turbulent reginald all the mischief being fomented by janes pertness and curiosity and only mitigated by the honest simplicity and dutifulness of eight years old phyllis  the remedy was found at last in the marriage of the eldest son william with alethea weston already liliass favourite friend and model  that in a youthful composition there should be a cavalier ancestry a family much given to dying of consumption and a young marquess cousin is perhaps inevitable  lord rotherwood was mr mohuns ward and having a dull home of his own found his chief happiness as well as all the best influences of his life in the merry highlyprincipled though easygoing life at his uncles whom he revered like a father while his eager somewhat shatterbrained nature often made him a butt to his cousins  all this may account for the tone of camaraderie with which the scattered members of the family meet again especially around lilias who had with her cleverness and enthusiasm always been the leading member of the group  it should perhaps also be mentioned that lord rotherwoods greatest friend was also liliass favourite brother claude who had become a clergyman and died early  aunt adeline had been the spoilt child and beauty of the family the youngest of all  c m yonge  march 8th 1885     contents  chapter i         what will become of me chapter ii        the merrifields chapter iii

gas which showed a table of small dimensions with a vase of somewhat dirty and dilapidated grasses in the centre and at one end a soup tureen from which a gentleman had helped himself and a young girl of about thirteen without much apparent consciousness of what he was about being absorbed in a pile of papers pamphlets and letters while she on her side kept a book pinned open by a gravy spoon  the elderly maidservant who set the dishes before them handed the vegetables and changed the plates really came as near to feeding the pair as was possible with people above three years old  the one was a dark thin man with a good deal of white in his thick beard and scanty hair the absence of which made the breadth of his forehead the more remarkable  the girl would have shown an equally remarkable brow but that her dark hair was cut square over it so as to take off from its height and give a heavy overhanging look to the upper part of the face which below was tin and sallow wellfeatured but with a want of glow and colour  the thick masses of dark hair were plaited into a very long thick tail behind hanging down over a black evening frock whose white trimmings were like everything else about the place rather dingy  she was far less absorbed than her father and raised a quick wistful brown eye whenever he made the least sound or shuffled his papers  indeed it seemed that she was reading in order to distract her anxiety rather than for the sake of occupation  it was not till after the last pieces of cheese had been offered and refused and the maid had retired leaving some dull crackers and veteran biscuits with two decanters and a claretjug that he spoke  dolores  yes father  but he only cleared his throat and looked at his letter again while she fixed her eager eyes upon him so earnestly that he let his fall again and looked once more over his letters before he spoke again  dolores and the tone was dry as if all feeling were driven from it  yes father  you know that i have accepted this appointment  yes father  and that i shall be absent three years at the least  yes  then comes the question how you are to be disposed of in the meantime  could not i go with you she said under her breath  no my dear  and somehow the tone had more tenderness in it though it was so explicit  i shall have no fixed residence no one with whom to leave you and the climate is not fit for you  your aunt lilias has kindly offered to take charge of you  oh father  well  if you would only let me stay here with caroline and fraulein  i like it so much better  that cannot be dolly  i have this morning promised to let the house as it is to mr smithson  and caroline  if caroline takes my advice she will remain here as his housekeeper and i think she will  well what is it  you do not mean that you would prefer going to your aunts jane and ada  oh no no only if i might go to school  this is nonsense dolores  it will be much better for you on all accounts to be with your aunt at silverfold  i have no fear that she and her girls will not do their best to make you happy and good and to give you what you have sadly wanted my poor child  i have always wished you could have seen more of her  there could be no doubt from the tone in the mind of any one who knew mr maurine mohun that the decision was final but perhaps dolores would have asked more if the doorbell had not rung at the moment and mr smithson had not been announced  fate was closing in on her  she retired into her book and remained as long as she possibly could for the sake of seeing her father and hearing his voice but after a time she was desired to call caroline and to go to bed herself for it was a good deal past nine oclock  she had been aware she could hardly tell how that her father had been offered a government appointment connected with the fiji islands and then that glad to escape from the dreariness which had settled down on the house since his wifes death about eighteen months previously he had accepted it and she had speculated much on her probable fate but had never before been officially informed of his designs for himself or for her  he was a barrister who spent all his leisure time on scientific studies and his wife had been equally devoted to the same pursuits dolores had been her constant companion but after the mothers death from an accident on a glacier a strange barrier of throwing himself into the ways of a girl past the charms of infancy  it was as if they had lost their interpreter  the german governess chosen by mrs mohun was very german indeed and greatly occupied in her own studies  when she found that the armes liebes madchen shrank from being wept over and caressed on the mournful return she decided that the english had no feeling and acquiesced in the routine of lessons and expeditions to classes  she was never unkind but she did not try to be a companion and old caroline was excellent in the attention she paid to the comforts of her master and his daughter but had no love of children and would not have encouraged familiarities even if dolores had not been too entirely a drawingroom child to offer them  the morning came and everything went on as usual  dolores poured out the coffee mr mohun read his times fraulein ate as usual but afterwards he asked for a few minutes conversation with fraulein  all that dolores heard of the result of it was so and then lessons went on until twelve oclock when it was the custom that the girl should have an hours recreation which was in any tolerable weather spent in the gardens of the far west crescent where she lived  there she was nearly certain of meeting her one great friend maude sefton who was always sent out for her airing at the same time  they spied each other issuing from their doors met linked their arms and entered together  maude was a tall rosy girl with a great yellow bush down her back half a year older than dolores and a great deal bigger  my dearest doll  oh yes it is come  then he is really going  i heard the pater and mater talking about it yesterday and they said it would be an excellent thing for him  oh maude  then they did not say anything about what we hoped  what the maters offering for you to come and live with us darling oh no and is afraid it is of no use to ask her for she said of herself that she knew mr mohun had sisters and  and what  tell me maude  you must  well then you know you made me and i think it is a shame  she said she was glad she wasnt one of them for you were such a peculiar child  dear me maude you neednt mind telling me that  im sure i dont want to be like everybody else  and are you going to one of your aunts  yes to aunt lilias  oh maude he would not hear a word against it and i know it will be so horrid  aunts are always nasty  kate is very fond of her aunt said maude who did not happen to have any personal experiences to oppose to this sweeping assertion  oh i dont mean proper aunts but aunts that have orphans left to them  but you are not an orphan darling  i dare say i shall be  tis a horrible climate and there are no end of cannibals there so that he would not take me out for anythingand sharks and volcanoes and hurricanes  i dont think they eat people there now  its bad enough if they dont  and you know those aunts begin pretty well while they are in fear of the father but then they get worse  there was ada morton said maude in a tone of conviction and anna ross  oh yes and another book rose turquand  it was a grownup book that i read oncelong ago said dolores who had in her mothers time been allowed a pretty free range of bookbox  and theres under the shield but that was a boy  there are lots and lots said dolores  they are ever so much worse than the stepmothers  not that there is any fear of that she added quickly  but isnt this aunt lilias nice  its a pretty name  which is she you have one aunt a lady something havent you  yes it is this one lady merrifield  her husband is a general sir jasper merrifield and he is gone out to command in some place in india but she cannot stand the climate and is living at home at a place called silverfold with a whole lot of children  i think two are gone out with their father but there are a great many more  dont you know them at all  no and dont want to  i think my aunts were unkind to mother  oh exclaimed maude  i am sure of it  they were horrid stuckup fine ladies and looked down on her though she was ever so much nicer and cleverer and more intellectual than they and she looked down on them  are you sure  asked maude to whom it was as good as a story  yes indeed  she was civil of course because they were fathers sisters but i know she couldnt bear them  if any of them came to london there was a calling but all very stupid and a dining at lord rotherwoods but she never would except once when i can hardly remember go to stay at their slow places in the country  ive heard father try to persuade her when they didnt think i understood  you know we always went abroad or to the sea or something except last year when we were at beechcroft  that wasnt so bad for there were lots of books and uncle reginald was there and he is jolly  cant you get mr mohun to send you there  no i dont think they would have me for every body there is grown up and father seems to have a wish for me to be with this aunt lilias because she has a schoolroom  i wonder he should wish it if she was unkind to mrs mohun  well she was out of the way most of the time  they have lived at malta and gibraltar and belfast and all sorts of places so they will all have regular garrison frivolous manner and think of nothing but officers and balls  i know she was a beauty and wants to be one still  maude whose father was a professor looked quite appalled and said  you will be the one to infuse better things  she felt quite proud of the word  perhaps returned dolores  they always do that in time but not till theyve been awfully bullied  all the cousins are jealous and the aunt spites them because they are nicer and prettier than her own  yes said maude but then theres always some tremendously nice boy cousin or uncle or something that makes up for it all  will sir jasper merrifields eldest son be a sir  oh no hes not a baronet but a gcb knight grand cross of the bath that is  besides i dont care for love and titles and all that nonsense though father is first cousin to lord rotherwood  and you never saw any of them  yes aunt lilias was at the charing cross hotel with uncle jasper and the two eldest daughters alethea and phyllis and some more of them just before they sailed and father took me there on sunday to luncheon but there were so many people and such a talk and such a bustle that i hardly knew which was which  aunt jane and aunt ada were a talking that it made my head turn round but i saw how affected aunt lilias is and i knew that whenever they looked at me they said poor child and i always hate any one who does that  all i was afraid of then was that father would let aunt jane and aunt ada come and live with us but this is ever so much worse  you have such a lot of aunts and uncles said maude and i have not got anything but one old uncle  uncles are all very well said dolores said maude  there are the two miss mohuns  oh thats beginning at the wrong end  aunt ada is the youngest of them all and she thinks she is a young lady still and wears little curls on her forehead and a tennis pinafore and makes her waist just like a wasp  she and aunt jane live together at rockquay because she has bad healthat least she has whenever she likes and aunt jane does all sorts of charities and worries and sets everybody to rights said dolly in a very grownup voice speaking partly from her own observation and partly repeating what she had caught from her elders  oh yes i know her said maude  she asked me questions about all i did and she did bother mamma so about a maid she recommended that we are never going to take another from her  aunt phyllis comes between them i believe but she has married a sailor captain and gone to settle in new zealand and i have not seen her since i was a very little girl  then theres aunt emily who is a very great swell indeed  her husband was a canon lord henry grey but he is dead and she lives at brighton a regular fat comfortable down pillow of a woman who isnt bad to lunch with only she sends one out to the parade with her maid as if one was a baby  mother used to laugh at her  and i think there was an older one who went to india and died long ago  i have seen your two uncles  theres major mohun  oh he is fun  yes dear old uncle regie  i wish he was not in ireland  he will be so sorry to miss seeing father off but he cant get leave  and there was a clergyman who is dead and father grieved for very much  i think he did something to make them all nicer to mother for it was just after that we went to stay at beechcroft with uncle william  you know him and how mother used to call him the very model of a country squire and i like his wife aunt alethea  only it is very pokey and slow down there and they are always after flannel petticoats and soup kitchens and all the old fads that are exploded  i should get awfully tired of it before a year was out only i should not be teased with strange children and there would be no one to be jealous of me  cant you get your father to change and send you there  not a chance  you see aunt lilias had offered and they havent and i must go on with my education  i hope though i shall have no advantages i shall still be able to go up for the cambridge examination if aunt lilias has not prejudices as i dare say she has since of course none of her own will be able to try  youll come up to us for the examination dolly dear and we shall do it together and that will be nice  if they will let me but i dont expect to be allowed to do anything that i wish  only perhaps father may be come home by that time  is it three years  yes  it is a terrible time isnt it  however when im seventeen perhaps he will talk to me and i can really keep house  and then youll come back here  do you know maudielistenive another uncle belonging to mother  oh dolly  i thought she had no one  he told me he was my uncle alfred once when he met me in the park with fraulein and gave me a note for mother  he is called mr flinders  but i thought your mother was daughter to professor hay  but this is a halfbrother my grandmother was married before  uncle alfrey has an immense light beard and i think he is very poor  he came once or twice to see mother and they always sent me out of the room but i am sure she gave him moneynot fathers housekeeping money but what she got for herself by writing  once i heard father go out of the house saying well its your own to do as you please with  and then mother went to her room and i know she cried  it was the only time that ever mother cried  and as maude listened much impressedonce when she had got eleven pounds and we were going to have bought father such a binocular for a secret as a birthday present mr flinders came and she gave him ten of it and we could only buy just a few slides for father  and she told me she was grieved but she could not help it and it would be time for me to understand when i was older  i dont think this uncle alfrey can be nice said maude  tis quite disgusting if he kisses me said dolly but you see he is poor and all the mohuns are stuck up except father and they wanted mother to despise him and not help him  and you see she stuck to him  i dont like him much but you see nobody ever was like her  oh maude if she wasnt dead  and poor dolores cried as she had not done even at the time of the accident or in the terrible week that followed or at the desolate home coming     chapter ii  the merrifields    the cool twilight of a long sunny summers day was freshening the pleasant garden of a country house and three people were walking slowly along a garden path enjoying the contrast with the heat glare and noise of the day  the central one was a tall slender lady with a light shawl hung round her shoulders  on one side was a youth who had begun to overtop her on the other a girl of shorter and sturdier mould who only reached up to her shoulder  so she is coming the girl said  yes uncle maurice has answered my letter very kindly  i should think he would be very much obliged observed the boy  please mamma do tell us all about it said the girl  you know i stopped directly when you made me a sign not to go on asking questions before the little ones  and you said you should have to make us your friends while papa and the grownups are away  well gillian i know you can be discreet when you are warned and perhaps it is best that you should know how things stand  do you remember anything about it hal  only a general perception that there were tempests in the higher regions but i think that was more from hearing alley and phyl talk than from my native sagacity  so i should suppose since you were only six years old at the utmost  but uncle maurice always was under a cloud wasnt he especially at beechcroft where i never saw him or his wife in the holidays except once when i believe she was not at all liked and was thought to be very proud and stuckup and pretentious  but was she just nobody not a lady cried gillian  aunt emily always called her poor thing  perhaps she did the same by aunt emily returned hal  and i am sure i have heard aunt ada say that she wasnt a lady and aunt jane that she had all sorts of discreditable connections  come now gill if you chatter so how is mamma to get a word in between  im afraid we have all been hard on her poor thing  there now mamma has done it just like aunt emily  anybody would be poor who got killed in a glacier  no but one doesnt say poor when people arenice  when i said poor now put in lady merrifield it was not so much that i was thinking of her death as of her having come into a family where nobody welcomed her and i really do not suppose it was her fault  moreover she seemed to do very well without a welcome added hal  who is interrupting now cried gillian but was she a lady  i never saw her you know said the mother but from all i ever heard of her i should think she was and cleverer and more highly educated than any of us  yes said hal that was the kind of pretension that exasperated them all at beechcroft especially uncle william  i wonder if dolores will have it said gillian  i suppose she will know much more than we do  probably being the only child of such parents and with every advantage london can give  maurice was always much the cleverest of us all and with a very strong mechanical and scientific turn so that i now think it might have been better to have let him follow his bent but when we were young there was a good deal of mistrust of anything outside the beaten tracks of gentlemanlike professions and my dear old father did not like what he heard of the course of study for those lines  things were not as they are now  so maurice went to cambridge and was fifth wrangler of his year and then had to go to the bar  it somehow always gave him a thwarted injured feeling of working against the grain and he cultivated all these scientific pursuits to the utmost getting more and more into opinions and society that distressed grandpapa and uncle william  so he fell in with mr hay a professor at a german university  i can hear williams tone of utter contempt and disgust  i believe this poor man was exceedingly learned and had made some remarkable discoveries but he was very poor and lived in lodgings at bonn with his daughter in the small way people are content to do in germany  as to his opinions we all took it for granted that he was a freethinker but i cant tell how that might be  maurice lodged in the same house one year when he went to learn german and attend lectures and he went back again every long vacation  at last came your dear grandfathers death  maurice hurried away from beechcroft immediately after the funeral and the next thing that was heard of him was that he had married miss hay  it was no wonder that your uncle william was bitterly hurt and offended at the apparent disrespect to our father and would make no move towards maurice  it was when we were at the cape wasnt it asked hal  yes the year gillian was born  well your dear uncle claude went to see maurice in london and found there was much excuse  maurice had learnt that the old professor was dying and his daughter had nothing and would have had to be a governess so that maurice had married her in haste in order to be able to help them  then it really was very kind and noble in him exclaimed gillian  and i believe every one would have felt it so but for his unfortunately reserved way of concealing the extent of the acquaintance and showing that he would not be interfered with  claude did his best to close the breach but there had been something to forgive on both sides and perhaps she was prouder than the mohuns themselves  oh my dears i hope you will never have a family quarrel among you  it is so sad to look back upon a change after the happy years when we were all together and were laughing and making fun of one another  but you were quite out of it mamma  so i was in a way but i knew nothing of the justification till too late for any advances from us to take much effect  i am four years older than maurice we had never been a pair and had never corresponded  and when i wrote to him and to his wife i only received stiff formal answers  they were abroad when we were in london on coming home and they would not come to see us at belfast so that i could never make acquaintance with her but i believe she was an excellent wife suiting him admirably in every way and i expect to find this little daughter of theirs very well brought up and much forwarder than honest old mysie  mysie is in perfect raptures at the notion of having a cousin here exactly of her own age said gillian  what she would wish is that the two should be so much alike as to be taken for twins  i have been trying to remember dolores on that dreadful sunday at the hotel when uncle maurice came to see us just when papa was setting off for bombay but it all seems confusion  i can think of nothing but a little black shy figure  i remember phyllis telling me that she thought i ought to do something to entertain her but i could not think of a word to say to her  for which perhaps she was thankful said her brother  i am not sure  you are all too apt when you are shy to console yourself with fancying that you are doing as you would be done by  it might have worried her then perhaps but it would have made it easier for her to begin among us now  i am very glad her father consents to my having her  i do hope we may make her happy  happy said gillian  anybody must be happy with such a number to play with and with you to mother her mamma  i am afraid she will not feel me much like her own mother poor child but it will not be for want of the will  when i look back now i feel sorry for myself for the early loss of my mother for though we were all merry enough as children and young people there always seems to have been a lack of something fostering and repressing  there was a kind of desolateness in our life though we did not understand it at the time  i am thankful you have not known it my dears  there was a strange rush of tears nearly choking her voice and she shook them away with a sort of laugh  that i should cry for that at this time of day  gillian raised her face for a kiss and even harry did the same  their hearts were very full as the perception swept over them in one flash what their lives would have been without mamma  it seemed like the solid earth giving way under their feet  i am very sorry for poor dolores said gillian presently  it seems as if we could never be kind enough to her  yes  indeed i hope we may do something towards supplying her with a real home wandering sprites as we have been said lady merrifield  what a name it is  dolores  it is as bad as peter grievous  how did she get it  grumbled harry  that i cannot tell but i think we must call her dora or dolly as i fancy your aunt jane told me she was called at home  i hope wilfred will not get hold of it and tease her about it  you must defend her from that  if we can said gillian but wilfred is rather an imp  yes said harry  i found primrose reduced to the verge of distraction yesterday because willie would call her leg of mutton  i hope you boxed his ears cried gillian  i did give it to him well said hal laughing  thank you said his mother  a big brother is more effective in such cases than any one else can be  wilfred is the only one of you all who ever seemed to take pleasure in causing painand i hardly know how to meet the propensity  he is the only one who is not quite certain to be nice with dolores said gillian  and i really dont quite see how to manage said the mother  if we show him our anxiety to shield her it is very likely to direct his attention that way  she must take her chance said hal and if she is any way rational she can soon put a stop to it  but oh dear  i wish he could go to school said gillian  so do i my dear returned her mother but you know the doctors say we must not risk it for another year and i can only hope that as he grows stronger he may become more manly  meantime we must be patient with him and hal can help more than any one else  therewhats that striking  three quarters  then we must make haste in or we shall not have finished supper before ten  lilias mohun had married a soldier and after many wanderings through military stations the health and education of a large proportion of her family had necessitated her remaining at home with them while her husband held a command in india taking out with him the two grownup daughters and the second son who was on his staff  she was established in a large house not far from a country town for the convenience of daily governess tutor and masters  she herself had grown up on the old system which made education depend more on the family than on the governess and she preferred honestly the company and training of her children to going into society in her husbands absence  therefore she arranged her habits with a view to being constantly with them and though exchanging calls and occasionally accepting invitations in the neighbourhood it was an understood thing that she went out very little  the chief exceptions were when her eldest son harry was at home from oxford  he was devotedly fond of her and all the more pleased and proud to take her about with him because it had not always been possible that his holidays in his school life should be spent at home and thus the privilege was doubly prized  the two sisters above and one brother below him were in india with their father and gillian was not yet out of the schoolroom though this did not cut her off from being her mothers prime companion  then followed a schoolboy at wellington named jasper two more girls a brace of boys and the fiveyearold baby of the establishment sufficient reasons to detain lady merrifield in england after more than twenty years of travels as a soldiers wife so that scarcely three of her children had the same birthplace  she had been able to see very little of her english relations being much tied by the number of her children while all were very young and the expense of journeys but she was now within easy reach of her two unmarried sisters and after the cape gibraltar malta and dublin the homes of her eldest sister and of her eldest brother did not seem very far off  indeed beechcroft the home of her childhood had always been the headquarters of herself and her children on their rare visits to england  her elder boys had been sure of a welcome there in the holidays and loved it scarcely less than she did herself and when looking for her present abode the whole family had stayed there for three months  her brother maurice however she had scarcely seen and she had been much pained at being included in his persistent avoidance of the whole family who felt that he resented their displeasure at his marriage even more since his wifes death than he had done during her lifetime as if he felt doubly bound for her sake not to forgive and forget  at least so said some of the family while others hoped that his distaste to all intercourse with them only arose from the apathy succeeding a great blow     chapter iii  goodbye    a passage was offered to mr mohun in a queens ship and this hurried the preparations so much that to dolores it appeared that there was nothing but bustle and confusion from the day of her conversation with maude until she found herself in the railway carriage returning from plymouth with her eldest uncle  her father had intended to take her himself to silverfold but detentions at the office in london and then a telegram from plymouth had disconcerted his plans and when he found that his eldest brother would come and meet him at the last he was glad to yield to his little daughters earnest desire to be with him as long as possible  shy and reserved as both were and almost incapable of finding expression for their feelings they still clung closely together though the only tears the girl was seen to shed came in church on the last sunday evening blinding and choking and she could barely restrain her sobs  her father would have taken her out but she resisted and leant against him while he put his arm round her  after this whenever it was possible she crept up to him and he held her close  there had been no further discussion on her home lady merrifield had written kindly to her as well as to her father but that was small consolation to one so well instructed by story books in the hypocrisy of aunts until fathers were at a distance and her father was so manifestly gratified by the letter that it would be of no use to say a word to him now her fate was determined and as she heroically told maude in their last interview she was determined to make the best of it she would endure the unjust aunt and jealous silly cousins and be so clever and wise and superior that she would force them to admire and respect her and byandby follow her example and be good and sensible so that when father came home he would find them acknowledging that they owed everything to her she had saved two or three of their lives nursed half of them when the other half were helpless fainting and hysterical and in short been the providence of the household then father would look at her and say my mary again and he would take her home and talk to her with the free confidence he had shown her mother and would be comforted  this was the hope that had carried her through the last parting when she went on board with her uncle and saw her fathers cabin and looked with a dull kind of entertainment at all the curious arrangements of the big ship it seemed more like sightseeing than goodbye when at last they were sent on shore and hurried up to the station just in time for the train  uncle william was a very unapproachable person he did not profess to understand little girls he looked at dolores rather anxiously afraid perhaps that she was crying and put her into the carriage then rushed out and brought back a handful of newspapers giving her the graphic and hiding himself in the times  she felt too dull and stunned to read or to look at the pictures though she held the paper in her hands and she gazed out dreamily at the tons and rocks and woody ravines of dartmoor as they flew past her the leaves and ferns all golden brown with autumn colouring she had had little sleep that night her little legs had all the morning been keeping up with the two mens hasty steps and though an excellent meal had been set before her in the ship she had not been able to swallow much and she was a good deal worn out so when at last they reached exeter and finding there would be two hours to wait her uncle asked whether she would come down into the town with him and see the cathedral she much preferred to stay where she was he put her under the care of the woman in the waitingroom who gave her some tea took off her hat and made her lie down on a couch where she slept quite sound for more than an hour until she was roused by some ladies coming in with a crying baby  it was she thought nearly time to go on for the gas was being lighted she put on her hat and went out to look for her uncle on the platform so as to get into a better light to see the face of her mothers little swiss watch which her father had just made over to her she had just made out that there was not more than a quarter of an hour to spare when she heard an exclamation  by jove if that aint marys little girl and looking up she saw mr flinders huge bushy lightcoloured beard is your father here he asked  no he sailed this afternoon  always my luck  ticket wasted  sailedreally  oh yes  we did not come back till the ship was out of harbour  he muttered some exclamation and asked  whom are you with  uncle william  mr mohunmy eldest uncle  he will be back directly  mr flinders whistled a note of discontent  going to rusticate with him poor little mite he asked  no im to live with my aunt liliaslady merrifield  where  at silverfold grange near silverfold  well youll get among the swells  theyll make you cut all your poor mothers connections  so theres an end of it  she was a good creatureshe was  ill never forget any one that belongs to her said dolores  oh theres uncle william as on the top of the stairs she spied the welcome sight of his grey locks and burly figure  before he had descended her other uncle had vanished and she fancied she had heard something about mum about our meeting  ta ta  uncle williams eyes being less sharp than hers he was on his way to the waitingroom before she joined him and as he had not seen her encounter she would not tell him they were settled in the carriage again and she was tolerably refreshed mr mohun fell asleep and she after reading by the lamplight as long as she could find anything to read gazed at the odd reflections in the windows till she too nodded and dozed half waking at every station  at last she was aware of a stop in earnest voices and being called there was her uncle saying well hal here we are and she was lifted out and set on the platform with gas all round her uncle was saying we didnt get away in time for the express and a young man was answering wed better put dolly into the waggonette at once then ill see to the luggage  very like a parcel so stiff were her legs she was bundled into the dark cavern of a closed waggonette and after a little lumbering her uncle and the young man got in after her saying something about eleven oclock  she was more awake now and knew that they were driving through lighted streets and then after an interval turned into darkness upon gravel and stopped at last before a door full of light with figures standing up dark in it  she heard a well william well lily here we are at last then there were arms embracing her and a kiss on each cheek as a soft voice said my poor little girl  they wanted to sit up for you but it was too late and i dare say you had rather be quiet  she was led into a lamplit room which dazzled her  it was spread with food but she was too much tired to eat and her aunt saw how it was and telling harry to take care of his uncle she took the hand though it did not close on hersand climbing up what seemed to dolores an endless number of stairs she said  you are up high my dear but i thought you would like a room to yourself  poked away in an attic was doloress dreamy thought while her aunt added to a tall thin woman who came out with a lamp in her hand  she is so tired that she had better go to bed directly mrs halfpenny  you will make her comfortable and dont let her be disturbed in the morning till she has had her sleep out  dolly found herself undressed without many words till it came to your prayers miss dora  i am sure youve need not to miss them  she did not like to be told besides poor child prayers were not much more than a form to her  she did not contest the point but knelt down and muttered something then laid her weary head on the pillow was tucked up by mrs halfpenny and left in the dark  it was a dreary half sleep into which she fell  the noise of the train seemed to be still in her ears and at the same time she was always being driven up upup endless stairs by tall cruel aunts or they were shutting her up to do all their childrens work and keeping away fathers letters from her  then she awoke and told herself it was a dream but she missed the noises of the street and the patch of light on the wall from the gas lamps and recollected that father was gone and she was really in the power of one of these cruel aunts and she felt like screaming only then she might have been heard and a great horrid clock went on making a noise like a church bell and striking so many odd quarters that there was no guessing when morning was coming  and after all why should she wish it to come  oh if she could but sleep the three years while father was away  at last however she fell into a really calm sleep and when she awoke the room was full of light but her watch had stopped she had been too much tired to remember to wind it and she lay a little while hearing sounds that made it clear that the world was astir and she could see that preparations had been made for her getting up  they shant begin by scolding me for being late she thought and she began her toilette  just as she came to her hair the old nurse knocked and asked whether she wanted help  thank you ive been used to dress myself said dolores rather proudly  ill help you now missy for prayers are over and they are all gone to breakfast only my lady said you were not to be disturbed and miss mysie will be up presently again to bring you down  she spoke low and in an accent that dolores afterwards learnt was scotch and she was a tall thin bony woman with sandy hair who looked as if she had never been young  she brushed and plaited the dark hair in a manner that seemed to the owner more wearisome and less tender than carolines fashion and did not talk more than to inquire into the fashion of wearing it and to say that miss mohuns boxes had been sent from london demanding the keys that they might be unpacked  i can do that myself said dolores who did not like any stranger to meddle with her things  ye could tak them oot nae doubt but i must sort them  its my ladys orders said mrs halfpenny with all the determination of the sergeant her husband and dolores with a sense of despair and a sort of expectation that she should be deprived of all her treasures on one plea or another gave up the keys  mrs halfpenny then observed that the frock which had been worn for the last two days on the railway and evening and morning needed a better brushing and setting to rights than she had had time to give it  she had better take out another which box were her frocks in  dolores expected her heartless relations to insist on her leaving off her mourning and she knew she ought to struggle and shed tears over it but to tell the truth she was a good deal tired of her hot and fusty black and when she had followed mrs halfpenny into a passage where the boxes stood uncorded and the first dress that came to light was a pretty freshlooking holland that had been sent home just before the accident she exclaimed  oh let me put that on  bless me miss it has blue braid and you in mourning for your poor mamma  dolores stood abashed but a grey alpaca which she had always much disliked came out next and mrs halfpenny decided that with her black ribbons that would do though it turned out to be rather shockingly short and to show a great display of black legs but as the box containing the clothes in present wear had not come to hand this must stand for the presentand besides a voice was heard saying is dora ready and a young person darted up put her arms round her neck and kissed her before she knew what she was about  mamma said i should come because i am just your age thirteen and a half she said  im mysie though my proper name is maria millicent  dolores looked her over  she was a good deal taller than herself and had richlooking shining brown hair dark brown eyes full of merriment and a bright rosy colour and she danced on her active feet as if she were full of perpetual life  all happy and not caring thought dolores  now dont fash miss mohun with your tricks  she has stood like a lamb said mrs halfpenny reprovingly  there well not keep her to find an apron  i dont wear pinafores said mysie but i dont mind pretty aprons like this  why my sisters had them for tennis before they went out to india  come along dora grasping her hand  my name isnt dora said the newcomer as they went down the passage  no said mysie in a low voice but mamma told gillthats gillian and me that we had better not tell anybody because if the boys heard they might tease you so about it for wilfred is a tease and theres no stopping him when mamma isnt there so she said she would call you dora or dolly whichever you liked and you are not a bit like a dolly  they always called me dolly said dolores and if i am not to have my name i like that best but i had rather have my proper name  oh very well said mysie it is more out of the way only it is very long  by this time they had descended a long narrow flight of uncarpeted stairs the back ones as mysie explained and had reached a slippery oak hall with highbacked chairs and all the odds and ends of a familygarden hats waterproofs galoshes bats rackets umbrellas etc ranged round and a great white cockatoo upon a stand who observedmysie cockie wants his breakfast as they went by towards the door whence proceeded a hubbub of voices and a clatter of knives and jingle of teaspoons and cups a room that as mysie threw open the door seemed a blaze of sunshine pouring in at the large window and reflected in the glass and silver  yes and in the bright eyes and glossy hair of the party who sat round the breakfasttable further brightened by the fire pleasant in the early autumn  eyes as it seemed to dolores eyes without number were levelled on her as mysie led her in saying  heres a place by mamma she kept it for you between her and uncle william  no dont all jump up at once and rush at her said lady merrifield give her a little time  here my dear and she held out her hand and drew in the stranger to her kissing her kindly and placing her in a chair close to herself as she presided over the teacupsnot at the end but at the middle of the tablewhile all that could be desired to eat and drink found its way at once to dolores who had arrived at being hungry now and was glad to have the employment for hands and eyes instead of feeling herself gazed at  she was not so much occupied however as not to perceive that uncle williams voice had a free merry ring in it such as she had never heard in his visits to her father and that there was a great deal of fun and laughter going on over the thin sheets of an indian letter which aunt lily was reading aloud  no one seemed to be attending to anything else when dolores ventured to cast a glance around and endeavour to count heads as she sat between her uncle and aunt  two boys and a girl were opposite  harry who had come to meet them last night was at one end of the table a tall girl but still a schoolroom girl was at the other and mysie had been lost sights of on her own side of the table also there was a very tiny girl on a high chair on the other side of her mamma  seven thought dolores with sinking heart  eight oppressors  they were mostly browneyed wellgrown creatures  one boy at the further corner had a cast in his eye and was thin and wizenlooking and when he saw her eyes on him he made up an ugly face which he got rid of like a flash of lightning  before any one else could see it but her heart sank all the more for it  he must be wilfred the teaser  aunt lilias was a tall slender woman dressed in some kind of soft grey with a little carnation colour at her throat and a pretty lace cap on her still rich abundant dark brown hair where diligent search could only detect a very few white threads  her complexion was always of a soft paly brunette tint and though her cheeks showed signs that she was not young her dark soft longlashed eyes and sweetlooking lips made her face full of life and freshness and the figure and long slender hands had the kind of grace that some people call willowy but which is perhaps more like the general air of a young birch tree or as hal had once said early pointed architecture reminded him of his mother  the little one was getting restless and two of the boys began filliping crumbs at one another  wilfred fergus said the mother quite low and gently but they stopped directly  we will say grace she said lifting the little one down  now primrose  every one stood up to dolores surprise a pair of little fat hands were put together a little clear voice said a few words of thanksgiving perfectly pronounced  you may go if you like she said  hal take care of prim  up jumped the two boys and a sprite of a girl who took the hand of little primrose a beautiful little maiden with rich chestnut wavy curls  they all paused at the door the boys making a salute the girls a little curtsey  primroses was as pretty a little bob as ever was seen  i am glad you keep that custom up said mr mohun  jasper had been brought up to it and wished it to be the habit among us and i find it a great protection against bouncing and rudeness  but dollys blood boiled at such stupid antiquated military nonsense she would never give in to it if they made her live on bread and water  the uncle and aunt who perhaps had lengthened out their breakfast from politeness to her had finished when she had and the ponychaise came to the door in which hal was to drive uncle william to the station everybody flocked to the door to bid him goodbye and then aunt lilias stooped down to ask dolores if she were quite rested and felt quite well mysie standing anxiously by as if she felt her a great charge  quite well quite rested thank you the girl answered in her stiff shy way  there is half an hour to spare before miss vincent comes  the children generally spend it in feeding the creatures  i am not going to give a holiday because i think people get more pleasantly acquainted over something than over nothing to do but you need not begin lessons today if you had rather settle your thoughts and write your letters  i had rather begin at once said dolores who thought she would now establish her preeminence at the cost of any amount of jealousy  very well then when you hear the gong  mamma said mysie solemnly after long waiting she says she had rather not be called out of her name  i thought you had been called dolly my dear  yes at home with a strong emphasis  well my dear i dare say it may be better to keep to your proper name at once  we wont take liberties with it till you feel as if you could call this home said lady merrifield looking as if she would have kissed her niece on the slightest encouragement but no one ever looked less kissable than dolores mohun at that moment  was it not cruel and hypocritical to talk of this tiresome multitude as ever making home     chapter iv  turned in among them    do you like pets asked mysie eagerly as her mother left the two girls together  i never had any said dolores  oh how dreadful  why old cockie and aga and begum the two oldest pussies have been everywhere with us  and besides theres basto the big pyrenean dog andoh here comes little quiz mammas little maltesequiz quiz  dolores started she did not like either dogs or cats and the little spunglass looking dog smelt about her  i must go and feed my guineapig said mysie wont you come  here are some over shoes and poncho  dolores was afraid poncho was another beast but it turned out to be a sort of cape and she discovered that all the cloaks and most of the sticks had names of their own  she was afraid to be left standing on the steps alone lest any amount of animals or boys should fall on her there so she consented to accompany mysie who shuffled along in a pair of overshoes vastly too big for her since she had put her cousin into the wellfitting ones  she chattered all the way  we do like this place so  it is the nicest we have ever been in  all that is wanting is that papa will buy it and then we shall never go away again  it was a pleasant place though not grand a homelylooking roomy redbrick house covered with creepersthe virginian one with its leaves just beginning to be painted  there was a bright sunny garden full of flowers in front and then a paddock with cows belonging to a farmer mysie said  it was her ambition to have them of their own when papa came home when all good things were to happen  behind there were large stableyards and offices too large for lady merrifields one horse and one pony and thus available for the childrens menagerie of rabbits guineapigs magpie and the like  on the way mysie was only too happy to explain the family as she called it when she had recovered from her astonishment that dolores always living in england could not count up her cousins  why they always had been shown their photographs on a sunday evening after the bible pictures and even little primrose knew all the likeness even of those she had never seen  the catalogue of names and ages followed  dolores heard it with a feeling of bewilderment and a sense that one maude was worth all the eight put together with whom she was called on to be familiar  she found herself standing in a court rather grass grown where gillian with little primrose by her side was flinging peas to a number of pigeons grey white and brown who fluttered round her  valetta and fergus were on the granary steps throwing meal and sop mixed together to a host of cackling struggling fowls who tried to leap over each others backs  wilfred seemed busy at some hutches where some rabbits twitched their noses at cabbage leaves mysie proceeded to minister to some black and rustcoloured guinea pigs which dolores thought very ugly uninteresting and odorous  then there were dogs jumping about everywhere and cats and kittens parading before peoples feet so that dolores felt as if she had been turned into a den of wild beasts and resolved against ever again venturing into the court at feedingtime  a big bell gathered all the children up together into a race to the house  there was another scurry to change shoes and wash hands and then  mysie conducted her cousin into a large cheerful wainscoted room on the ground floor with deep windows and numerous little solidlooking deal tables there were lady merrifield and a young lady in spectacles to whom dolores was presented as your new pupil and every one sat down at one of the little tables on which there were bibles and prayerbooks  lady merrifield took the two youngest on each side of her  dolores found a table ready for her with the books  a passage in the new testament was given out and read verse by verse to the end of the subject which was the parable of the tares and then lady merrifield gave a short lesson on it asking questions and causing references to be found according to a book of notes she had ready at hand  just like a charity school thought dolores when she was able to glance at the timetable and saw that two days in the week there was old testament two days new one day catechism one day prayerbook only half an hour was thus appropriated but to her mind it was an old fashioned waste of time and very tiresome  then came a ring at the doorbell  mr poulter she heard and to her amazement she found that gillian and mysie as well as their brothers had latin lessons in the diningroom with the curate  the two girls and fergus only went to him every other day wilfred every day as gillian was learning greek and mathematics  what was dolores to do  have you done any latin my dear  asked her aunt  not yet  father wished to be quite convinced that the professor was a good scholar said dolores  very well  we will wait a little said aunt lilias and dolores indignantly thought that she was amused  mysie was sent off to her music in the drawingroom whither her mother followed with primroses little lessons leaving the schoolroom piano to valetta and fergus to write copies and to do sums while miss vincent examined the newcomer which she did by giving her some questions to answer in writing and some french and german to translate and parse also in writing  the music was inconvenient to a girl who had always prepared her work alone  she could do the language work easily but the questions teased her  they seemed to her of no use and quite out of her beat  no dates none of the subject she had specially got up  why if miss vincent did not know that people were not to be expected to answer stupid questions about history quite out of their own line that was her fault  she did what she knew and then sat biting the top of her pen till her aunt came back and there was a change in occupations all round resulting in her having to read french aloud which she knew she did well but it was provoking to find that gillian read quite as well and knew a word at which she had made a shot and a wrong one  she heard the observation pass between her aunt and the governess languages fair but she seems to have very little general information  general information indeed  just as if she who had lived in london gone to lectures and travelled on the continent must not know more than these children cast up and down in a soldiers life and as if her fraulein with all her diplomas must not be far superior to a mere little daily governess and a mother  it was all for the sake of depreciating her  at twelve oclock to her further indignation she found there was to be an hour of reading aloud and of needleworkactual plain needlework the three girls were making undergarments for themselves and on dolores proving to have no work of any sort her aunt sent gillian to the drawer and produced a childs pinafore which she was desired to hem  each however had a quarter of an hours reading aloud of history to do in turn all from one big book a history of rome and there was a map hung up over the black board where they were in turn to point to the places mentioned  before gillian began reading the date and something about the former lesson was required to be told by the children and it came quite readily valetta especially declaring that she did love pyrrhus which the others seemed to think very bad taste  dolores knew nothing about ancient history and thought it foolish to study anything that did not tell in a cambridge examination but she supposed they knew no better down there and when it came to her turn to read she mangled the names so that val burst out laughing when she spoke of apiousclaudius  lady merrifield hushed this at once and the girl read in a bewildered manner and as one affronted  she saw he aunt looking at her piece of hemming which to say the truth would not have done credit to primrose and the recollection came across her of all the oppressed orphans who had been made household drudges so that her reading did not become more intelligible  as the clock struck one a warning gong was heard everybody jumped up the work was folded away and with the obeisance at the door gillian and val ran away  mysie stayed a little longer it being her turn to tidy the room and lady merrifield said to dolores  i must teach you how to hold your needle tomorrow my dear  i hate work responded dolores  val does not like it said her aunt nor indeed did i at your age but one cannot be an independent woman without being able to take care of ones own clothes so i resolved that these children should learn better than i did  do you like a take a run with mysie before dinner or there is the amusing shelf  books may be taken out after one oclock and they must be put back at eight or they are confiscated for the ensuing day she added pointing to a paper below where this sentence was written  dolores was still rather tired and more inclined to make friends with the books than with the cousins  there were fewer than she expected and nothing like so many absolute stories as she was used to reading with maude sefton  those are such grownup books she said to mysie who came to assist her choice and pointed to the upper shelves  oh but grownup books are nicest returned mysie at least when they dont begin being stupid and marrying too soon  they must do it at last to get out of the story and its nicer than dying but they can have lots of nice adventures first  but here are the feats on the fiords and the crofton boys and water babies and all the volumes of aunt judy if you like the younger sort  or the dear dear thorn fortress thats good for young and old  havent you any books of your own  oh yes this thorn fortress is vals and a york and a lancaster rose is mine but whenever any one gives us a book if it is not a weeny little gem like gills christian year or my little pillow or vals children in the wood we bring it to mother and if it is nice we keep it here for every one  to read  if it is just rather silly and stupid we may read it once and then she keeps it and if it is very silly indeed she puts it out of the way  mysie said it as if it had been killing an animal  have you got many books  yes but i dont mean to have them knocked about by all the boys nor put out of the way neither  mamma said we were to be all like sisters said mysie with rather a craving for the new books but dolores tossed up her head and said  we cant be  its nonsense to say so  to her surprise mysie turned round to lady merrifield who was looking at some exercises that miss vincent had laid before her  mamma she said is it fair that dolores should read our books if she wont give you up hers to look over and be like ours  mysie said lady merrifield you cant expect dolores to like all our home plans till she is used to them  no my dear you need not be afraid you shall keep your books in your own room and nobody shall meddle with them  i am sure your cousins would not wish to be so unkind as to deprive you of the use of theirs  by the time dolores had made up her mind to take tom brown it was time for the general flight to prepare for dinner and she found her room made to look very pleasant and almost homelike for her books and little knickknacks had been put out not quite as she preferred but still so as to make the place seem like her own  she was pleased enough to be quite gracious to mysie and val who came to visit her and to offer to let them read any of her books when they both thanked her and said  if mamma lets us  oh then you wont have them said dolores im not going to let her have my books to take away  you dont think she would take them away when she said she wouldnt said mysie hotly  why what would she do if she didnt happen to approve of them  only tell us not to read them  and wouldnt you  why dolores in such a tone as made her ashamed of her question and she said well father never makes any fuss about what i read  he has other things to think of  how do you get books then  i buy them  and maude sefton shes my great friend has lots given to her but nobody bothers about reading them  they arent grownup books you know  how stupid said val  you had better read the talisman and then youll see how nice a grownup book is  the talisman  why  maude seftons brother had to get it up for his holiday task and he said it was all rot and bosh  what a horridly stupid boy he must be returned mysie  why i remember when jasper once had the talisman to do and the big ones were so delighted  mamma read it out and i was just old enough to listen  i remembered all about sir kenneth and roswal  tom seftons not stupid said dolores in wrath butbut the book is stupid and out of date  i heard father and the professor say it was gone by  mysie and valetta looked perfectly astounded and dolores pursued her advantage  of course it is all very well for you that have never lived in london nor had any advantages  but we have advantages cried val  you dont know what advantages are said dolores  theres the gong cried mysie and down they all plunged into the diningroom where the family were again collected with hal at one end and his mother at the other  dolores was amazed when at the first pause after every one was help valettas voice arose  mamma what are advantages  dont you know val  dolores says we havent any  and i said we have  and she says i dont know what advantages are  hal and gillian were both laughing with all their might  their mother kept her countenance and said  i suppose every one has advantages of some sort and perhaps without knowing them  im sure i know cried fergus  well what are they asked harry  having mamma cried the little boy  hear hear  thats right fergy man  couldnt be better cried harry and there was a general acclamation which inspired gentle mysie with the fear that her motherless cousin might feel the contrast and though against rules she whispered  she will make you like one of us  that wasnt what i meant returned dolores a little contemptuously  what did you mean said mysie  why youve no classes nor lectures nor master and only just a mere daily governess  dolores did not mean this to be heard beyond her neighbour but mysie demanded  what do you want to be doing lessons all day long  no but good governesses never are daily  thats a pity said gillian turning round on her  perhaps you dont know that miss vincent has a first class cambridge certificate in everything and is daily because she likes to live with her mother  i think added lady merrifield with a smile that dolores has been in the way of seeing more clever people and getting superior teaching of some kind but we will do the best we can for her and try not to let her miss many advantages  dolores felt a little abashed and decidedly angry at being put in the wrong  the elders kindly turned away the general attention from her  there was a great deal of merry family fun going on which was quite like a new language to her  fergus and primrose wanted to go out in search of blackberries  gillian undertook to drive them in the cart but as the donkey had once or twice refused to cross a little stream of water that traversed the road the brothers foretold that she would ignominiously come back again  gill and water are perilous observed hal  jacks not here said gillian  besides it is down not up the hill and im sure i dont want to draw a pail of water  nosancho will do that  the gong will sound and sound buzz and roar said wilfred  no gill  no little ones  we shall send out and find them stuck fast in the lane sancho with his feet spread out wide gill with three or four sticks lying broken on the road round her the kids reduced to eating blackberries like the children in the wood  dont fred said gillian  youll frighten them  little donkeys said wilfred  if they were we shouldnt want sancho said val  it was not a very sublime bit of wit but there was a great laugh at it all round the table  val and fergus declared they would go too till they heard that nurse halfpenny said she would not let the little ones go out without her to tear their clothes to pieces  every one unanimously declared that would be no fun at all and turned to mamma to beg her to forbid nurse to come out and spoil everything  thats just her view said mamma laughing  she thinks you spoil everything  oh thats clothes  spoiling fun is worse  but were you really going with the old halfpenny gill said mysie turning to her  yes said gillian  you know i can manage her pretty well when it is only the little ones and they wouldnt have any pleasure otherwise  oh come gill intreated fergus or nurse will make us sit in the donkeycart all the time while lois picks the blackberries  mamma do tell her not to come intreated valetta and more of them joined in with her  no my dears i dont like to vex her when she thinks she is doing her duty  she wouldnt come if you did mamma and there was a general outcry of intreaty that mamma would come with them and defend them from mrs halfpenny as fergus who was rather a formal little fellow expressed it and mamma after a little consideration consented to drive the ponycarriage in that direction and to announce to nurse halfpenny that she herself would take charge of the children  whereupon there was a whoop and a wardance of jubilee quite overwhelming to dolores who could not but privately ask mysie if nurse halfpenny was so very cross  awfully said mysie and wilfred added  as savage as a bear with a sore head  like mrs crabtree asked dolores  exactly  jasper called her so when he wanted to lash her up till at lash she got hold of his holiday house and threw it into the sea and it was in malta and we couldnt get another said mysie  and havent you one  yes gill and i save for it but mamma only let us have it on condition we made a solemn promise never to tease nurse about it  and does she go at you with that dreadful thingwhats it namethe tawse  ah youll soon know said wilfred  no no nonsense fred said mysie as dolores face worked with consternation  she never hits us not if we are ever so tiresome papa and mamma would not let her  but why do they let her be so dreadful  maudes nurse used to be horrid and slap her and when her mother found it out the woman was sent away directly  nurse halfpenny isnt that sort said mysie  her husband was papas coloursergeant and he got a sunstroke and died and then she came when gillian was just born and so weak and tiny that she would never have lived if nurse hadnt watched her day and night and so gillians her favourite except the youngest and she is ever so good you know ive heard the ladies when we were with the dear old 111th telling mamma how they envied her her trustworthy treasure  im sure they might have had her at halfprice said wilfred  shes be dear at a farthing  at that moment mrs halfpennys voice was heard demanding if it were really her ladyships pleasure to go out fatiguing herself to the very death with all the children rampaging about her and tearing themselves to pieces if not poisoning themselves with all sorts of nasty berries  indeed ill take care of them and bring them back safe to you responded her ladyship very much in the tone of one of her own children making promises  put them on their brown hollands and they cant come to much harm  well if its your wish maam my leddy what must be must but i know how it will beyoull come back tired out fit to drop and miss val and miss primrose wont have a rag fit to be seen on them  but if its your will what must be must for youre no better than a bairn yourself generals lady though you be and gcb  no nurse youll be gcbgrand commander of the bathwhen we come home called out hall who was leaning on the banister at the bottom and there was a general laugh during which dolly tardily climbed the stairs so tardily that her aunt meeting her asked whether she was still tired and if she would rather have the afternoon to arrange her room  she said yes but not thank you and went on relieved that mysie did not offer to stay and help her and yet rather offended at being left alone while all the others went their own way she heard them pattering and clattering shouting and calling up and down the passages and then came a great silence while they could be seen going down the drive some on foot some in the ponychaise or donkeycart  her things had all been unpacked and put in order and her room had a very cheerful window  it was prettily furnished with fresh pink and white dimity and choicelooking earthenware but to london eyes like those of dolores it seemed very oldfashioned and what she called poked up  the paper was ugly  the chimneypiece was a narrow painting thing of the same dull stonecolour as the door and the windowframe  and then the clear air the perfect stillness the absence of anything  moving in the view from the window gave the city bred child a sense of dreadful loneliness and dreariness as she sat on the side of her bed with one foot under her gazing dolefully round her and in he head composing her own memoirs  fully occupied with their own plans and amusements the lonely orphan was left in solitude  her aunt knew not how her heart ached after the home she had left but the machine of the family went its own way and trod her under its wheels  this was such a fine sentence that it was almost a comfort and she thought of writing it to maude sefton but as she got up to fetch her writingcase from the schoolroom she saw that her books were standing just in the way she did not like and with all the volumes mixed up together  so she tumbled them all out of the shelves on the floor and at that moment mrs halfpenny looked into the room  well to be sure she exclaimed when me and lois have been working at them books all the morning  they were all nohowas i dont like them said dolores  oh very well please yourself then miss if thats all the thanks you have in your pocket you may put them up your own way for all i care  only my lady will have the young ladies rooms kept neat and orderly or they lose marks for it  i dont want any help said dolores crossly and mrs halfpenny shut the door with a bang  the menials are insulting me said dolores to herself and a tear came to her eye while all the time there was a certain mournful satisfaction in being so entirely the heroine of a book  she went to work upon her books at first hotly and sharply and very carefully putting the tallest in the centre so as to form a gradual ascent with the tops and not for the world letting a second volume stand before its elder brother but she soon got tired took to peeping at one or two parting gifts which she had not yet been able to read and at last got quite absorbed in the sorrows of a certain clare whose golden hair was cut short by her wicked aunt because it outshone her cousins sandy locks  there was reason to think that a tress of this same golden hair would lead to her recognition by some grandfather of unknown magnificence as exactly like that of his longlost claribel and this might result in her assuming splendours that would annihilate the aunt  things seemed tending to a fracture of the ice under the cruellest cousin of all and her rescue by clare when they would be carried senseless into the great house and the recognition of clare and the discomfiture of her foes would take place  how could dolores shut the book at such a critical moment  so there she was sitting in the midst of her scattered books when the galloping and scampering began again and mysie knocked at the door to tell her there were pears apples biscuits and milk in the dining room and that after consuming them lessons had to be learnt for the next day and then would follow amusements evening toilette seven oclock tea and either games or reading aloud till bedtime  as to the books mysie stood aghast  i thought nurse and lois had done them all for you  they did them all wrong so i took them down  oh dear we must put them in or therell be a report  a report  yes nurse halfpenny reports us whenever she doesnt find our rooms tidy and then we get a bad mark  perhaps mamma wouldnt give you one this first day but it is best to make sure  shall i help you or you wont have time to eat any pears  dolores was thankful for help and the books were scrambled in anyhow on the shelves for mysies good nature was endangering her share of the afternoons gouter though perhaps it consoled her that her curiosity was gratified by a hasty glance at the backs of her cousins storybooks  by the time the two girls got down to the diningtable every one had left the room and there only remained one doubtful pear and three baked apples besides the loaf and the jug of milk  mysie explained that not being a regular meal no one was obliged to come punctually to it or to come at all but these who came tardily might fare the worse as to the blackberries for which dolores inquired the girls were going to make jam of them themselves the next day but mysie added with an effort she would fetch some as her cousin had had none in the gathering  oh no thank you i hate blackberries said dolores helping herself to an apple  do you said mysie blankly  we dont  they are such fun  you cant think how delicious the great overhanging clusters are in the lane  some was up so high that hal had to stand up in the cart to reach them and to take fergus up on his shoulder  we never had such a blackberrying as with mamma and hal to help us  and only think a great carriage came by with some very grand people in it we think it was the dean and they looked down the lane and stared so surprised to see what great mind to call out fee faw fum  you know nothing makes such a good giant as fergus standing on hals shoulders and a curtain over them to hide hals face oh dear i wish i hadnt told you  you would have been a new person to show it to  dolores made very little answer finished her apple and followed to the schoolroom where an irregular verb some geography and some dates awaited her  then followed another rush of the populace for the evening meal of the live stock but in this dolores was too wary to share  she made her way up to her retreat again and tried to lose the sense of her trouble and loneliness in a book  then came the warning bell and a prodigious scuffling racing and chasing accompanied by yells as of terror and roars as of victory all cut short by the growls of mrs halfpenny everything then subsided  the world was dressing dolores dressed too feeling hurt and forlorn at no ones coming to help her and yet worried when mysie arrived with orders from mrs halfpenny to come to her to have her sash tied  i think a servant ought to come to me  caroline always does said the only daughter with dignity  she cant for she is putting primrose to bed  oh its so delicious to see prim in her bath said mysie with a little skip  make haste or we shall miss her the darling  dolores did not feel pressed to behold the spectacle and not being in the habit of dressing without assistance she was tardy and mysie fidgeted about and nearly distracted her  thus when she reached the nursery primrose was already in her little white bedgown and was being incited by valetta to caper about on her cot like a little acrobat as her sisters said while mrs halfpenny declared that they were making the child that rampageous she should not get her to sleep till midnight  they would have been turned out much sooner and primrose hushed into silence if nurses soul had not been horrified by the state of dolores hair and the general set of her garments  my certie she exclaimeda dreadful exclamation in the eyes of the family who knew it implied that in all her experience mrs halfpenny had never known the like  and taking dolores by the hand she led the wrathful and indignant girl back into her bedroom untied and tied unbuttoned and buttoned brushed and combed in spite of the second bell ringing the general scamper and the sudden apparition of mysie and val whom she bade run away and tell her leddyship that miss mohoone should come as soon as she was sorted but she ought to come up early to have her hair looked to for twas shame to see how thae fine london servants sorted a motherless bairn  dolores felt herself insulted she turned red all over with feelings the old scotchwoman could not understand  she expected to hear the message roared out to the whole assembly round the teatable but mysie had discretion enough to withhold her sister from making it public  the tea itself though partaken of by lady merrifield seemed an indignity to the young lady accustomed to late dinners  after it the whole family played at dumb crambo  dolores was invited to join and instructed to do the thing you think it is but she was entirely unused to social games and thought it only ridiculous and stupid when the word being a rhyme to ite fergus gave rather too real a blow to wilfred and gillian answered tis not smite  wilfred held out a hand and was told tis not right val flourished in the air as if holding a string and was informed that kite was wrong when hal ran away as if pursued by fergus by way of flight and mysie performed antics which she was finally obliged to explain were those of a sprite dolores could not recollect anything and only felt annoyed at being made to feel stupid by such nonsense when mysie tried to make her a present of a suggestion by pointing to the back of a letter  neither write nor white would come into her head though little fergus signalized himself just before he was swept off to bed by seizing a pen and making strokes  after his departure lady merrifield read aloud the old oak staircase which had been kept to begin when dolores came hal taking the book in turn with his mother  and so ended dolores first day of banishment     chapter v  the first walk    what a lot of letters for you mamma cried mysie  papa exclaimed fergus and primrose  no it is not the right day my dears  but here is a letter from aunt ada  oh in a different tone  she writes for aunt jane  they will come down here next monday because aunt jane is wanted to address the girls at the gfs festival on tuesday  aunt jane seems to have taken to public speaking said harry  it would be rather a lark to hear her  you may have a chance said lady merrifield for here is a note from mrs blackburn to ask if i will be so very kind as to let them have the festival here  they had reckoned upon tillington park where they have always had it before but they hear that all the little tillingtons have the measles and they dont think it safe to venture there  it will be great fun said gillian  we will have all sorts of games only im afraid they will be much stupider than the irish girls  and ever so much stupider than the dear 111th children sighed mysie  arent they all great big girls asked valetta disconsolately  i believe twelve years old is the limit said her mother  twelve yearold girls have plenty of play in them vals havent they mysie let me seetwo hundred and thirty of them  for you to feast asked harry  oh nothat cost comes out of their own funds mrs blackburn takes care to tell me and miss hacket will find some one in siverfold who will provide tables and forms and crockery  i must go down and talk to miss hacket as soon as lessons are over  or perhaps it would save time and trouble if i wrote and asked her to come up to luncheon and see the capabilities of  the place  why whats the matter pausing at the blank looks  the jam mammathe blackberry jam cried valetta  well  we cant do it without gill and she will have to be after that miss constance explained val  oh never mind  she wont stay all the afternoon said gillian cheerfully  luncheon people dont  yes but then there will be lessons to be learnt  look here val said gillian if you and mysie will learn your lessons for tomorrow while im bound to miss con ill do mine some time in the evening and be free for the jam when she is gone  the dear delicious jam cried val springing about upon her chair and lady merrifield further said  i wonder whether mysie and dolores would like to take the note down they could bring back a message by word of mouth  oh thank you mamma cried mysie  then i will write the note as soon as we have done breakfast  dont dawdle fergus boy  maynt i go demanded wilfred  no my dear  it is your morning with mr poulter  and you must take care not to come back later than eleven mysie dear i cannot have him kept waiting  dolores do you like to go  yes please said dolores partly because it was at any rate gain to escape from that charityschool lesson in the morning and partly because valetta was looking at her in the ardent hope that she would refuse the privilege of the walk and it therefore became valuable but there was so little alacrity in her voice that her aunt asked her whether she were quite rested and really liked the walk which would be only half a mile to the outskirts of the town  dolores hated personal inquiries beyond everything and replied that she was quite well and didnt mind  so soon as she and mysie had finished they were sent off to get ready while aunt lilias wrote her note in pencil at the corner of the table which she never left while fergus and primrose were finishing their meal but she had to silence a storm at the didnt mindgillian even venturing to ask how she could send one to whom it was evidently no pleasure to go  i think she likes it more than she shows said the mother and she wants air and will settle to her lessons the better for it  whats that val  it was my turn mamma said valetta in an injured voice  it will be your turn next val said her mother cheerfully dolores comes between you and mysie so she must take her place accordingly  and today we grant her the privilege of the newcomer  dolores would have esteemed the privilege more if while she was going upstairs to put on her hat the recollection had not occurred to her of one of the victims of an aunts cruelty who was always made to run on errands while her favoured cousins were at their studies  was this the beginning  somehow though her better sense knew this was a foolish fancy she had a secret pleasure in pitying herself and posing to herself as a persecuted heroine and then she was greatly fretted to find the housemaid in her room looking as if no one else had any business there  what was worse she could not find her jacket  she pulled out all her drawers with fierce noisy jerks and then turned round on the maid sharply demanding  who has taken my jacket  im sure i dont know miss dollars  youd best ask mrs halfpenny  if but at that moment mysie ran in holding the jacket in her hand i saw it in the nursery she said triumphantly  nurse had taken it to mend  come along  wheres your hat  but there was pursuit mrs halfpenny was at the door  young ladies you are not going out of the policy in that fashion  mamma sent us  mamma wants us to take a note in a hurry  only to miss hacket pleaded mysie as mrs halfpenny laid violent hands on her brown holland jacket observing  my leddy never bade ye run off mair like a wild worricow than a general officers daughter miss mysie  whats that  only miss hacket do you say  you should respect yourself and them you come of mair than to show yourself to a blind beetle in an unbecoming way tis well that theres one in the house that knows what is befitting miss dollars you stand still  i must sort your necktie before you go tis all of a wisp  miss mysie you tell your mamma that i should be fain to know her pleasure about miss dollars frocks  sheve scarce got onecoloured or mourningthat dont want altering  mrs halfpenny always caused dolores such extreme astonishment and awe that she obeyed her instantly but to be turned about and tidied by an authoritative hand was extremely disagreeable to the independent young lady  caroline had never treated her thus being more willing to permit untidiness than to endure her temper  she only durst after the pair were released remonstrate with mysie on being termed miss dollars  they cant make out your name said mysie  i tried to teach lois but nurse said she had no notion of newfangled nonsense names  im sure valetta and primrose are worse  ah but val was born at malta and mamma had always loved the grand master la valetta so much and had written verses about him when she was only sixteen  and primrose was named after the first primrose mamma had seen for twelve yearsthe first one val and i had ever seen  they called me miss mohun at home  yes but we cant here because of aunt jane  all this was chattered forth on the stairs before the two girls reached the diningroom where mysie committed the feeding of her pets to val and received the note with fresh injunctions to come home by eleven and bring word whether miss hacket and miss constance would both come to luncheon  oh dear sighed gillian and there was a general groan round the table  it cant be helped my dear  oh no i know it cant said gillian resignedly  you see said mysie  yes come along basto dear  you see gill has to bedown basto i saya young lady when  never mind him dolores he wont hurt  when miss constance hacket andleave her alone basto i sayand she is such a goose  not you dolores but miss constance  oh that dog  i wish you would not take him  not take dear old basto  why tis such a treat for him to get a walk in the morningthe delight of his jolly old black heart  isnt he a dear old fellow  and he never hurt anybody in his life  its only setting off  he will quiet  down in a minute but i couldnt disappoint him  could i my old man  never having lived with animals nor entered into their feelings dolores could not understand how a dogs pleasure could be preferred to her comfort and felt a good deal hurt though bastos antics subsided as soon as they were past the inner gate shutting in the garden from the paddock which was let out to a farmer  mysie however ran on as usual with her stream of information  the miss hacket were sister or daughters or something to some old man who used to be clergyman here and they are all married up but these two and theyve got the dearest little house you ever saw  they had a nephew in the 111th and so they came and  called on us at once  miss hacket is a regular old dear but we none of us can bear miss constance except that mamma says we ought to be sorry for her because she leads such a confined life  miss hacket and aunt jane always do go on so about the gfs  they both are branch secretaries you know  i know  aunt jane did bother mrs sefton so that she says she will never have another of those gfs girls  she says it is a society for interference  mamma likes it said mysie  oh but she is only just come  yes but she always looked after the school children at beechcroft before she married and she and alethea and phyllis had the soldiers children up on sunday  alethea taught the little drummer boys and they were so funny  i wonder who teaches them now  gill always goes down to help miss hacket with her gfs classes  she has one on sunday afternoon and one on tuesday for sewing and she is the only young lady in the place who can do plain needlework properly  sewingmachines can work  what the use of fussing about it  they cant mend said mysie  besides do you know in the american war all the sewingmachines in the southern states got out of order and as all the machinery people were in the north the poor ladies didnt know what to do and couldnt work without them  sewingmachines are a recent invention said dolores  oh you didnt think i meant the great old war of independence  no i meant the war about the slavessecession they called it  that is not in the history of england said dolores as if mysie had no business to look beyond  why of course not when it happened in america  papa told us about it  he read it in some paper i think  dont you like learning things in that way  no  i dont approve of irregular unsystematic knowledge  dolores has heard her mother say something of this kind and it came into her head most opportunely as a defence of her fatherfor she would not for the world have confessed that he did not talk to her as sir jasper merrifield seemed to have done to his children  in fact she rather despised the general for so doing  oh but it is such fun picking up things out of lesson time said mysie  that is the edge dolores was not sure of the word edgeworthian so she went on to system  professor sefton says he does not approve of harassing children with cramming them with irregular information at all sorts of times  let play be play and lessons be lessons he says not mixed up together and so rex and maude never learnt anythingnot a lettertill they were seven years old  how stupid  cried mysie  maudes not stupid cried dolores nor the professor either  shes my great friend  i didnt say she was stupid said mysie apologetically only that it must be very stupid not to be able to read till one was seven could you  oh yes  i cant remember when i couldnt read  but maude used to play with a little girl who could read and talk french at five years old and she died of water upon her brain  dear me  primrose can read quite well said mysie somewhat alarmed but then she went on in a reassured voice so could all of us except jasper and gillian and they felt the heat so much at gibraltar that they were quite stupid while they were there  this discussion brought the two girls across the paddock out into a road with a broad neat footpath where numerous little children were being exercised with nurses and perambulators  at first it was bordered by fields on either side but villas soon began to spring up and presently the girls reached what looked like a long low cottage residence but was really two with a verandah along the front and a garden divided in the middle by a paling covered with canary nasturtium shrubs  the verandah on one side was hung with a rich purple pall of the dark clematis on the other by a gloire de dijon rose  there were bright flower beds and the dormer windows over the verandah looked like smiling eyes under their deep brows of creeper trimmed vergeboard  what londonbred dolores saw was a sight that shocked hera lady standing unbonnetted just beyond the verandah talking to a girl whose black hat and jacket looked what mysie called very gfsy  the lady did not turn out to be young or beautiful  she was near middle age and looked as if she were far too busy to be ever plump she had a very considerable amount of nose and rather thin dark hair done in a fashion which like that of her navy blue linen dress looked perfectly antiquated to dolores  as she saw the two girls at the gate she came down the path eagerly to welcome them  ah my dear mysie so kind of your dear mother  i thought i should hear from her  and as she kissed mysie she added and this is the new cousin  my dear i am glad to see you here  dolores thought her own dignified manner had kept off a kiss not knowing that miss hacket was far too ladylike to be overfamiliar and that there was no need to put on such a forbidding look  mysie gave her message and note but miss hacket could not give the verbal answer at once till she had consulted her sister  she was not sure whether constance had not made an engagement to play lawntennis so they must come in  there sounded cooroooo cooroooo in the verandah and mysie cried  oh the dear doves  miss hacket said she had been just feeding them when the gfs girl arrived and as mysie came to a halt in delight at the aspect of a young one that had just crept out into public life the sister was called to the window  she was a great deal younger and more of the present day in style than her sister and had pensivelooking grey eyes with a somewhat bored languid manner as she shook hands with the early visitors  the sisters had a little consultation over the note during which dolores studied them and mysie studied the doves longing to see the curious process of feeding the young ones  when miss hacket turned back to her with the acceptance of the invitation she thought she might wait just to help miss hacket to put in the corn and the sop  meantime miss constance talked to dolores  did you arrive yesterday  no the day before  ah it must be a great change to you  indeed it is  this must be the dullest place in england i think said miss constance  no variety no advantages of any kind  and have not you lived in london  yes  that is my ambition  i once spent six weeks in london and it was an absolute revelationthe opening of another world  and i understand that mr maurice mohun is such a clever man and that you saw a great deal of his friends  i used said dolores thinking of those days of her mother when she was the pet and plaything of the guests incited to say clever and pert things which then were passed round and embellished till she neither knew them nor comprehended them  that is what i pine for exclaimed miss constance  nobody here has any ideas  you cant conceive how borne and prejudiced every one her who is used to something better  dont you love art needlework  maude sefton has been working goosey goosey gander on a toiletcover  oh how sweet  we never get any new patterns here  do come in and see i dont know which to take  i brought three beginnings home to choose from and i am quite undecided  mrs sefton draws her own patterns said dolores  something she gets ideas from lorenzo dellmanhes an artist you know and a regular aesthete  he made her do a dado all sunflowers last year but they are a little gone out now and are very staring besides and i think she will have some nymphs dancing among almondtrees in blue vases instead as soon as she has designed it  isnt that lovely  oh what would i not give for such opportunities do let me have your opinion  so dolores went in with her and looked at three patterns one of tall daisies another of oddlooking doves one on each side of a red etruscan vase where the water must have been as much out of their reach as that in the pitcher was beyond the crows and a third of little bo peep  having given her opinion in favour of bo peep she was taken upstairs to inspect the young ladys store of crewels and choose the colours  dolores neither knew nor cared anything about fancy work but to be treated as an authority was quite soothing and she fully believed that the mere glimpses she had had of mrs seftons work and the shop windows enabled her to give great enlightenment to this poor country mouse so she gladly went to the bedroom with a muslinworked toilet cover embroidered curtains plates fastened against the wall and table all over knickknacks which miss constance called her little den where she could study beauty after her own bent while her sister mary was wholly engrossed with the useful and could endure nothing but the prose of the last century  meantime mysie had forgotten how time flew in her belief that in one minute more the young doves would want to be fed and then in amusement at seeing them pursue their parents with low squeaks and flutterings watching too the airs and graces bowing cooing and laughing of the old ones  when at last she was startled by hearing eleven struck there had to be a great hunt for dolores in the drawingroom and garden and when at last miss hackets calls for her sister brought the tow downstairs more than ten minutes had passed  mysie was too much dismayed and in too great a hurry to do anything but cry come along dolores and set off at such a gallop as to scandalize the londoner even when mysie recollected that it was too public a place for running and slackened her pace  dolores was soon gasping and with a stitch in her side  mysie would have exclaimed what were you doing with miss constance but breathlessness happily prevented it  the way across the paddock seemed endless and mysie was chafed at having to hold back for her companion who panted in distress leant against a tree declared she could not go on she did not care and then when mysie set off running was seized with fright at being left alone in this vast unknown space cried after her and made a rush soon ending in sobbing breath  at last they were at the door and wilfred just coming out of the diningroom greeted them with a quarter to twelve  wont you catch it  oh my  are they come said lady merrifield looking out of the schoolroom my dear children  did miss hacket keep you  no mamma gasped mysie  at least it was my fault for watching the doves  ah mysie i must not send you on a message next time  mr poulter has been waiting these twenty minutes and i am afraid you are not fit to take a lesson now  dolores looks quite done up  i shall send you both to lie down on your beds and learn your poetry for an hour  and you must write an apology to mr poulter this afternoon  no dont go in now go up at once gillian shall bring your books  does miss hacket come  yes mamma said mysie humbly looking at dolores all the time  she was too generous to say that part of the delay had been caused by looking for her cousin and having to adapt her pace to the slower one but she decidedly expected the avowal from dolores and thought it mean not to make it  and oh the jam she mourned as she went upstairs while on the other hand dolores considered what she called being sent to bed an unmerited and unjust sentence given without a hearing when their tardiness had been all mysies fault not hers  she had no notion that her aunt only sent them to lie down because they looked heated tired and spent and was really letting them off their mornings lessons  it was a pity that she felt too forlorn and sullen even to complain when gillian brought up macaulays armada for her to learn the first twelve lines or she might have come to an understanding but all that was elicited from her was a glum  no when asked if she knew it already  gillian told her not to keep her dusty boots on the bed and she vouchsafed no answer for she did not consider gillian her mistress though after she was left to herself she found them so tight and hot that she took them off  then she looked over the verses rather contemptuouslyshe who always learnt german poetry and she had a great mind to assert her independence by getting off the bed and writing a letter to maude sefton describing the narrow  stupidity of the whole family and how her aunt without hearing her had send her to be for mysies fault  however she felt so shaky and tired that she thought she had better rest a little first and somehow she fell fast asleep and was only awakened by the gong she jumped up in haste recollecting that the delightful sympathizing miss constance was coming to luncheon and set her hair and dress to rights eagerly observing however to herself that her horrid aunt was quite capable of imprisoning her all the time for not having learnt that stupid poetry  she hesitated a little where to go when she reached the hall but the schoolroom door was open and she heard a mournful voice concluding with a gasp          our glorious semper eadem the banner of our pride  and miss vincent saying now my dear go and wash your face and try not to be such a dismal spectacle  and then mysie came out with heavy eyes and a mottled face showing that she had been crying all the time she had been learning over her own fault certainly but likewise over mammas displeasure and dollys shabbiness  well dora said miss vincent have you come to repeat your poetry  no said dolores  i went to sleep instead  oh  im glad of that  i wish poor mysie had done the same  i believe it was what lady merrifield intended you both looked so knocked up  dolores cleared up a little at this especially as miss vincent was no relation and she thought it a good time to make her protest against mere english  oh she said  i supposed that was the reason she gave me such a stupid childish singsong nursery rhyme to learn  i can say lots of schiller and some goethe  i advise you not to let any one hear you call lord macaulays poem a nursery rhyme or it might never be forgotten said miss vincent gaily  then seeing the cloud return to doloress face she added you have been brought forward in german i see  we must try to bring your knowledge of english literature up to be even with it  dolores liked this better than anything she had yet heard chiefly because she had learnt from her books that governesses were not uniformly so cruel as aunts  and besides she felt that she had been spared a public humiliation  by this time the guests were ringing at the door and miss vincent with her had on only waiting till their entrance was made to depart dolores asked whether to go into the drawingroom and was told that lady merrifield preferred that the children should only appear in the diningroom on the sound of the gong which was not long in being heard  the merrifields were trained not to chatter when there was company at table besides mysie and val were in low spirits about the chance of the blackberry cookery miss hacket sat on one side of lady merrifield and talked about what associates had answered her letters and what villages would send contingents of girls and it sounded very dull to the young people  miss constance was next to hal  she looked amiable and sympathetic at dolores on the opposite side of the table but discussed lawntennis tournaments with her neighbour which was quite as little interesting to the general public as was the gfs  however as soon as primrose had said grace lady merrifield proposed to take miss hacket down to the stableyard and the whole train followed excepting the two girls who trusted hal to see whether their pets would suffer inconvenience  however it soon was made evident to gillian that she was not wanted and that dolores and constance had no notion of wandering about the paved courts and bare coachhouses among the dogs and cats guineapigs and fowls  indeed constance who was at least seven years older than gillian and a fullblown young lady dismissed her by saying that she was going to see miss mohuns books  oh certainly said gillian in a voice as though she were rather surprised though much relieved  so off the friends went togetherfor of course they were to be friends  the miss mohun had been uttered in a tone that clearly meant to be asked to drop it so they were to be dolores and constance henceforth if not dolly and cons  dolores was such a lovely name that constance could not mangle it and was sure there was some reason for it  the girl had in fact been named after a spanish lady whom her mother had known and admired in early girlhood and to whom she had made a promise of naming her first daughter after her  no doubt dolores did not know that mrs mohun had regretted the childish promise which she had felt bound to keep in spite of her husbands dislike to the name which he declared would be a misfortune to the child  dolores was really proud of its peculiarity and delighted to have any one to sympathize with her in that and a great deal besides which she communicated to her new friend in the windowseat of her room  when the two ladies went home constance told her sister that dear little dolores was a remarkable character sadly misunderstood among those commonplace people the merrifields and unjustly used too and she should do her best for her  meantime gillian finding herself not wanted had repaired to the schoolroom  oh it is of no use sighed mysie disconsolately  ive ever so much mornings work to make up too  and i never shall  ive muzzled my head  by which remarkable expression mysie signified that fatigue crying and dinner had made her brains dull and heavy but gillian was a sensible elder sister  dont try your sum yet then she said  practise your scales for half an hour while i do my algebra and then well go over your german verbs together  ill tell miss vincent and she wont mind and i think mamma will be pleased if you try  gillian was too much used to noises not to be able to work an equation and prepare her virgil to the sound of scales and mysie was a good deal restored by them and by hope  so when at length constance had been summoned by her sister who tore herself away from the arrangements being bound to fiveoclock tea elsewhere mysie was discovered with a face still rather woebegone but hopeful and persevering and though there still was a bill of parcels where 11  and 34 lbs of mutton at 13 and 12d per lb refused to come right lady merrifield kissed her said she had been a diligent child and sent her off prancing in bliss to the old still room stove where they were allowed a fire basins spoons and strainers and where the sugar lay in a snowy heap and the blackberries in a sanguine pile  theres partiality thought dolores and scowled as she stood at the front door still gazing after constance  wont you come dolly said mysie  or havent you learnt your lessons  no said dolly making one answer serve for both questions  oh then you cant  shall i ask mamma to let you off  no i dont care  i dont like messes  and whats the use if you havent a cookery class  its such fun said val  and our sisters did go to a cookery class at dublin and taught gill added mysie  but if you havent done your lessons you cant go said valetta decidedly  off they went and lady merrifield presently crossed the hall and saw dolores attitude  my dear are you waiting to say those verses she said kindly  i hadnt time to learn them i went to sleep said dolores  a very good thing too my dear  suppose we go over them together  aunt lilias took the unwilling hand led dolores into the schoolroom and for half an hour she went over the verses with her explaining what was new to the girl and vividly describing the agitation of plymouth and the flocks of people thronging in  i must show her that i will be minded but i will make it pleasant to her poor child she thought  and it could not have been otherwise than pleasant to her but that she was reflecting all this time that she was being punished while mysie was enjoying herself  therefore she put the lid on her intellect and was inconceivably stupid     chapter vi  persecution    on monday afternoon dolores was sitting at the end of the long garden walk upon a green gardenbench with a crocodiles head and tail roughly carved  the shouts of the others were audible in the distance beyond the belt of trees  aunt lily had driven into the town to meet her sisters taking fergus with her whereas dolores had never been out in the carriage  there was partiality  though to be sure fergus was to have a tooth out  harry and gillian were playing with the rest and she had been invited to join but she had made answer that she hated romping and on being assured that no romping was necessary she replied that she only wanted to read in peace  she had refused the thorn fortress which she was told would explain the game and had hunted out clare or no home to compare her lot with that of the homeless one  certainly she had not yet been sent to bed with a box on the ear because a countess had shown symptoms of noticing her more than her ugly overdressed cousin  but then aunt lily would not allow her to walk down alone to the casement villas to see dear constance and would let that farmer keep all those dreadful cows in the paddock so that even going escorted was a terror to her  nor had her handsome mourning been taken from her and old clothes of her cousin substituted for it  no but she had been cruelly pulled about between mrs halfpenny and the silverton dressmaker with a mouthful of pins and aunt lily had insisted on her dress being trimmed with velvet instead of the jingling jet she preferred  did they intercept her letters  she had had one from her father sent from falmouth but only one from maude sefton in ten days  moreover she had one from constance in her apron pocket arrived that very afternoon asking her to come down with  gillian on the sundays that the friends might enjoy themselves together while the classes were going on but she made sure that all were so jealous of her friendship with constance that no consent would be given  she did not hear or notice the whisperings in the laurels behind her  do you see that sulky old croat smoking his pipe under the tree  no he is a black brunswicker  nonsense willie the black brunswickers werent till bonapartes time  i dont care he is anything black and nasty here goes  oh stop dont shoot  i believe he is only a vivandiere  besides its treacherous  i tell you he is laying a train to blow up the tower  there  an arrow struck the bench beside dolores who more angry than she had ever been in her life snatched it up unheeding that it had no point to speak of rushed headlong in pursuit while with a tremendous shout valetta and wilfred flew before her to a waste overgrown place at the end of the kitchen garden  weve shot a croat  no a black brunswicker  oh ah  they are comingthe enemy  into the fortress  bar the wolfs passage  and as dolores struggled through the bushes she saw the whole family dashing into an outhouse and the door slammed  she pushed against it but an unearthly compound of howls yells shouts and bangs replied  gillian  harry i say she cried in great anger come out i want to speak to you  but her voice was lost in the warwhoops within and the louder she knocked the louder grew the din till she walked off swelling with grief and indignation  mysie after all her professions of friendship to use her in this way  and harry and gillian who should have kept the others within bounds  slowly she crossed the lawn just as lady merrifield the other two aunts and fergus all came out from the glass door of the drawing room  aunt jane a trim little darkeyed woman looking at two and forty much the same as she might have done at five and twenty and aunt adeline pretty and delicately fair with somewhat of the same grace as lady merrifield but more languor and an air as if everything about her were for effect  though not specially fond of theses aunts dolores was glad to have them as witnesses of her illusage  there stands dolly like a statue of diana dart in hand exclaimed aunt adeline  yes said dolores i wish to know aunt lilias if wilfred and valetta are to call me names and shoot arrows at me  what do you mean my dear  they came at me while i was sitting quietly readingthereand shot at me and called me such horrid names i cant repeat them and ran away  then the others gillian and harry and all would not listen to me but shut themselves up in an outhouse and shouted at me  i think there must be some mistake dolores said her aunt  where are they  out beyond there said dolores pointing in the direction in which fergus was running  lady merrifield set off with her and the other two ladies followed more slowly  i thought it would not do said aunt jane  lilys children are so rough added aunt adeline  i am not so sure  that the fault is theirs was the reply  she is a priggish little puss who wants shaking up  ah here come the hordes sighed adeline shrinking a little as the entire population summoned by fergus came pouring forth to meet the advancing mother  how is this wilfred  have you been shooting arrows at your cousin  mama cried valetta indignantly he did not shoot at her he only pretended and shot the old crocodilebench  he never meant any more it was only play  have you not been forbidden to shoot in the direction of any person  nor i didnt said wilfred  i only shot the crocodile  i never tried to hit her  she is quite big enough to miss  and she did look such a nice croat mamma added valetta  we were scouts out of the thorn fortress willie and i and it was such a jolly dodge to steal upon one of the enemy  you should have warned her  then it would not have been a surprise said val seriously  was she not at play with you  no mamma said mysie  we asked her and she would not  i say pausing in consternation dolores was it you that came and called at the door of the wolfs passage  of course  i wanted to show gillian how wilfred behaved to me  i thought it was fergus come home to be the enemy  didnt you know her voice asked the mother  we were all  making such a noise ourselves in the dark  said gillian that there was no hearing any one and primrose was rather frightened so that hal was attending to her  indeed dolores i am very sorry  if we had guessed that it was you we would have opened the door at once and then you would have known that it was all fun and play and not have troubled mamma about it  wilfred and valetta knew said dolores rather sullenly  oh  but it was such fun said val  it was fun that became unkindness on your part said her mother you ought not to have kept it up without warning to her  and what do i hear about names  i hope that was also misunderstanding of the game what did you call her  only a croat said valetta indignantly and a black brunswicker  was that it dolores  perhaps she muttered disconcerted by a laugh from her aunt jane  i do not know what you took them for said lady merrifield but you see some part of this trouble arose from a mistake on you part  now wilfred and valetta remember that is not right to force a person into play against her will  and as to the shooting near but not at her you both know perfectly well that it is forbidden  so give me your bow wilfred  i shall keep it for a week that you may remember obedience  wilfred looked sullen but obeyed  dolores could not call her aunt unjust but as she look round she met glances that made her think it prudent to shelter herself among the elders  aunt jane asked what the game was  the thorn fortress said gillian  it comes out of that delightful spck book so called where in the thirty years war all the people of a village took refuge from the soldiers in a field in the middle of a forest guarded by a tremendous hedge of thorns  val had it for a birthday present and the children have been acting it ever since  it has quite put out the desert island passion which used to be a regular stage in these childrens lives  every voyage we have taken somebody has come to ask whether there was any hope of being wrecked on one  fergus even asked when we crossed from dublin said gillian  he was put up to that to keep up the tradition observed harry  on reaching the house the elders proceeded to five oclock tea in the drawingroom the juniors to gouter in the diningroom  as dolores entered she beheld a row of all her five younger cousins drawn up looking at her as if se had committed high treason and she was instantly addressed  telltake tit began valetta  sneak cried wilfred  i will call her croat added fergus  worse than croat  bashi bazouk exclaimed valetta  worse than crow chimed in primrose  oh dolores how could you said mysie  to get poor willie punished said val  dolores stood her ground  it was time to speak when it came to shooting arrows at me  hush hush  willie cried mysie  i told you so  now dolores listen  nobody ever tells of anybody when it is only being tiresome and they dont mean it or there never would be any peace at all thats honour  do you see  one may go to gill sometimes  ones a sneak if one does put in wilfred but mysie unheeding went on  and gill can help without a fuss or going to mamma  mamma always knows said val  mamma knows all about everything said mysie  i think its nature ad if she does not always take notice at the time she will have it out sooner or later  then resuming the thread of her discourse so you see dolly we have made up our minds that we will forgive you this time because you are an only child and dont know whats what and thats some excuse  only you mustnt go on telling tales whenever an evident happens  dolores thought it was she who ought to forgive but the force against her was overpowering though still she hesitated  but if i promise not to tell she said how do i know what may be done to me  you might trust us cried mysie with flashing eyes  and i can tell you added wilfred that if you do tell it will be ever so much the worse for yougirl that you are  war to the knife cried valetta and everybody except mysie joined in the outcry  war to the knife with traitors in the camp  mysie managed to produce a pause and again acted orator  you see dolores if you did tell it would not be possible for mamma or gill to be always looking after you and i couldnt do you much goodand if all these three are set against you and are horrid to you and i couldnt do you much goodhorrid to you youll have no peace in your life and after all we only ask of you to give and take in a good natured sort of way and not to be always making a fuss about everything you dont like  it is the only way i assure you  dolores saw the fates were against her and said  very well  you promise  yes  then we forgive you and heres the box of chocolate things aunt ada brought  well have a cigar all round and be friends  smoke the pipe of peace  dolores afterwards thought how grand it would have been to have replied dolores mohun will never be intimidated but the fact was that her spirit did quail at the thought of the tortures which the two boys might inflict on her if mysie abandoned her to their mercy and she was relieved as well as surprised to find that her offence was condoned and she was treated as if nothing had happened  meantime aunt jane was asking in the drawingroom how do you get on  fairly well was lady merrifields answer we shall work together in time  what does gill say asked the aunt rather mischievously  well said the young lady i dont think we get on at all not even poor mysie who works steadily on at her gets snubbed a dozen times a day and never seems to feel it  i hoped her father would have sent her to school said aunt adeline i knew she would be troublesome  she has all her mothers pride  the proudest people are those who have least to be proud of said aunt jane  school would have hardened the crust and kept up the alienation said lady merrifield  perhaps not  it might teach her to value the holidays and learn that blood is thicker than water said miss jane  it is always in reserve added miss adeline  yes maurice told her to send her if i grew tired of her as he said replied lady merrifield but of course i should not think of that unless for very strong reasons  oh mamma and gillian remained with her mouth open  well said aunt jane  i meant to have told you mamma but mr leadbitter came in about the gfs and stopped me and i have never seen you to speak to since yesterday you know i stayed from evensong to look after the little ones and you said dolores might do as she pleased so she stayed at home  the children were looking at the book of bible pictures and it came out that dolly knew nothing at all about joshua and the walls of jericho nor gideon and the lamps in the pitchers nor anything else then when i was surprised she said that it was not the present system to perplex children with the myths of ancient jewish history  gillian was speaking rapidly in the growing consciousness that her mother had rather have had this communication reserved for her private earand her answer was poor child  just what i should expect said aunt jane  probably it was jargon half understood and repeated in defence of her ignorance said lady merrifield  she is an odd mixture of defiant loyalty and selfdefence  what shall you do about this kind of talk asked her sister  one must hear it sooner or later said harry  that is true returned his mother but i suppose fergus and primrose did not hear or understand  oh no mamma  i know they did not for they were squabbling because primrose wanted to turn over before fergus had done with gideon  then i dont think there is any harm done  if it comes before mysie or val i will talk to them and i mean to take this poor child alone for a little while each day in the week and try to get at her  theres another thing said gillian  is she to go down with me always to casement cottages on sunday afternoons when i take the class  to teach or to learn ironically exclaimed aunt jane  neither said gillian  to chatter to constance hacket  they both spoke to me about it yesterday before i went home and i believe constance has written a note to her to ask her today  fancy that goose told me my sweet cousin was a dear and that we didnt appreciate her  even miss hacket gave me quite a lecture on kindness and consideration to an orphan stranger  not uncalled for perhaps said aunt jane  i hope you received it in an edifying manner  now aunt jane  well i believe i said we were as kind as she would let us be especially mysie  lady merrifield here made the move to conduct her sisters to their rooms miss mohun detained her when they had reached hers and had left adeline to rest on her sofa  the two though very unlike had still the habits of absolute confidential intimacy belonging to sisters next in age  lily said miss mohun gillian spoke of a note  did maurice give you any directions about this childs correspondence  you know i did not see him  i was so much disappointed  i would give anything to have talked her over with him  i am not sure that you would have gained much  i doubt whether he knows much about her poor fellow  but the letters  he wrote that she had been a good deal with professor seftons family and he thought they might like to keep up their intercourse  nothing about flinders  he ought to have warned you  no  who is he  a halfbrotherno a stepbrother to poor mary  he was the son by a former marriage of her fathers first wife and has been always a thorn in their sides  he is a low dissipated kind of creature writes theatrical criticisms for thirdrate papers or something of that kind when he is at his best  i believe mary was really fond of him and helped him more than maurice could well bear and since her death the man has perfectly pestered him with appeals to her memory  i really believe one reason he welcomed this post was to get out of his reach  you always know everything jenny  now how did you know this  i called once in the midst of an interview between him and mary and afterwards i came on poor maurice when he was really very much provoked and had it all out ad since her deathwell i saw him get a begging letter from the man and he spoke of it again  i wish i had advised him to warn you against the wretch  i dont suppose he knows where the child is  he is no relation to her you say  none at all happily  but on that occasion when i was an uncomfortable third maurice was very angry that she should have been allowed to call him uncle alfred and mary screwed up her little mouth and evidently rather liked the aggravation to mohun pride  poor maurice so he had a skeleton  well i dont see how it can hurt us  the man probably knows nothing about us and even if he could trace the girl he must know that she can do nothing for him  you had better keep an eye on her letters  he is quite capable of asking for the poor childs half sovereigns  i wish maurice had given you authority  perhaps he spoke to her about it  at any rate what he said of the seftons is quite sufficient to imply that there is no sanction to any other correspondence  that is true  really lily i believe you are the most likely person to do some good with her though i dont think you know what you are in for  but gillian does  i believe it is very good for the children to have to exercise a little forbearance  in spite of all our knocking about the world our family exclusiveness is pretty much what ours was in the old beechcroft days  when rotherwood and robert mohun were out only outsiders and the westons came on us like new revelations  it is curious to look back on said lady merrifield  it seems to me that the system or no system on which we were brought up was rather passing away even then  specks we growed said jane  what do you call the system  just that people thought it their own business to bring up their children themselves and let the actual technical teaching depend upon opportunities whereas now they get them taught but let the bringing up take it chance  people lived with their children thenyes i see what you mean lily poor eleanor intending with all her might to be a mother to us brought us up as you call it with all her powers but public opinion would never have suffered us to get merely the odd sort of teaching that she could give us  it was regular or course but oh do you remember the old atlas with germany divided into circles and everything as it was before the congress of vienna  you liked geography i hated it  yes i was young enough to come in for the elder boys old school atlases which had some sense in them  it seems to me that we had more the spirit of working for ourselves according to our individual tastes than people have now  we learnt they are taught  well  and what did we learn  as much as we could carry said aunt jane laughing  assimilate if you like it better and i doubt if people will turn out to have done more now  what becomes of all the german that is crammed down girls throats whether they have a turn for languages or not  do they ever read a german book  now you learnt it for love of fouque and max piccolomini and you have kept it up ever since  yes by cramming it down my childrens throats  but what i complain of jane in the young folk that come across me is not overknowledge but want of knowledgewant of general culture  this dolores for instance can do what she has been taught better than mysie some tings better than gillian but she has absolutely no interest in general knowledge not even in the glaciers which she has seen she does not know whether homer wrote in greek or latin considers marmion a lesson cannot tell a planet from a star and neither knows nor cares anything about the two napoleons  now we seem to have breathed in such things  why  i remember being made into astyanax for a very unwilling andromache poor eleanor for caress and being told to shudder at the bright copper coalscuttle before harry went to school  of course poor maurice could not cultivate his child  yet after all we grew up without a mother but then the dear old baron lived among us and knew what we were doing instead of shutting us up in a schoolroom with some one with only knowledge not culture  those very late dinners have quite upset all the intelligent intercourse between fathers and children not come out  yes jasper and i have felt that difficulty but after all jenny when i look back i cannot say i think ours was a model bringing up what a strange year that was after eleanors marriage  ah  you felt responsible and were too young for it but to me it was a very jolly time though i suppose i was an ingredient in your troubles  yes we brought ourselves up but i maintain that it was better alternative than being drilled so hard as never to think of anything but arrant idling out of lessontime  lessons should be lessons and play play is one of the professors maxims to which that poor child has treated us  ah on that system where would have been all your grand heraldic pedigrees  ive got them still  oh jenny you good old brownie have you  how i should like to look at them again and show them the gillian and mysie  do you remember the little scalloped line we drew round all the true knights  ay and where would have been all your romancing about sir maurice de mohun the pride of his name  for my part i much prefer a cavalier dead two hundred years ago as the object of a girls enthusiasmif enthusiasm she must haveto the existing lieutenant or even curate  certainly i should be sorry to have been bred up to history with individual interest and romance squeezed out of it  you see when jasper came home from the crimea he exactly continued mine  you have fulfilled your ideal better than falls to the lot of most people even to the item of knighthood  ah you should have heard us grumble over the expense of it  and after all i dare say sir maurice found his knights fee quite as inconvenient  oh with a start theres the first bell and here have i been dawdling here instead of minding my business  but it is so nice to have you  i day jenny we will have one of our good old games at threadpaper verses and all the rest tonight i want you to show the children how we used to play at them  and the party played at paper games for nearly two hours that evening to the extreme delight of gillian mysie and harry to say nothing of their mother and aunts who played with all their might even aunt adeline lighting up into droll quiet humour  only dolores was first bewildered then believed herself affronted and soon gave up altogether wondering that grownup people could be so foolish     chapter vii  gfs    the first thought of dolores was that she should see constance hacket when she heard hurrah for a holiday resounding over the house  as she came out of her room mysie met her  hurrah  aunt jane has got us a holiday that we may help get ready for the gfs  mamma has sent down notes to miss vincent and mr pollock  oh jolly jolly  and obvious of past offences mysie caught her cousins arms and whirled her round and round in an exulting dance extremely unpleasant to so quiet a personage  dont she cried  you hurt  you make me dizzy  my certie miss mysie exclaimed mrs halfpenny at the same time yere daft  gae doon canny and keep your apron on for if i see a stain on that clean dress  mysie hopped downstairs without waiting to hear the terrible consequences  aunt adeline did not come down to breakfast but aunt jane appeared fresh and glowing just in time for prayers having been with gillian and harry to survey the scene of operations and to judge of the day which threatened showers the grass being dank and sparkling with something more than september dews  the tables must be in the coachhouse said lady merrifield happily our equipages are not on a large scale and we must not get the poor girls best things drenched  no and it is rather disheartening to have to address double ranks of umbrellas said aunt jane  is the post come  it is  always infamously late here said harry  we complained as the appointed hour is eight but we were told all the other ladies were satisfied i do believe they think no one not in business has a right to wish for letters before nine  here it comes though said gillian and in due time the locked letterbag was delivered to lady merrifield and primrose waited eagerly to act as postman  it was not the day for the indian mail but aunt jane expected some last directions and lady merrifield the final intelligence as to the numbers of each contingent of girls dolores was on the qui vive for a letter from maude sefton and devoured her aunt and the bag with her eyes  she was quite sure that among the bundle of postcards that were taken out there was a letter  also she saw her aunt give a  little start and put it aside and when she demanded  is there no letter for me  lady merrifields answer was none my dear from miss sefton  hot indignation glowed in doloress cheeks and eyes more especially as she perceived a look pass between the two aunts  she sat swelling while talk about the chances of rain was passing round her the forecasts in the paper the cats washing their faces the swallows flying low the upshot being that it might be fine but that emergencies were to be prepared for  all the time that lady merrifield was giving orders to children and servants for the preparations dolores kept her station and the instant there was a vacant moment she said fiercely  aunt lilias i know there is a letter for me  let me have it  your father told me you might have letter from miss sefton and there is none from her said lady merrifield with a somewhat perplexed air  i may have letters from whom i choose  my dear that is not the custom in general with girls of your age and i know your father would not wish it  tell me is there any one you have reason to expect to hear from  dolores had an instinct that all the mohuns were set against the person she was thinking of but she had an answer ready true but which would serve her purpose  there was a person herr muhlwausser that father ordered some scientific plates fromof microscopic zoophytes  he said he did not know whether anything would come of it but in case it should he gave my address and left me a cheque to pay him with  i have it in my desk upstairs  very well my dear said lady merrifield you shall have the letter when it comes  the men are come my lady to put up the tables  miss mohun says will you come down came the information at that moment sweeping away aunt lilias and everybody else into the whirl of preparation while dolores remained feeling absolutely certain that a letter was being withheld from her and she stood on the garden steps burning with hot indignation when mysie armed with the key of the linenpress flashed past her breathlessly exclaiming  arent you coming down dolly  tis such fun  im come for some tablecloths  this didnt stir dolores but presently mysie returned again followed by mrs halfpenny grumbling that a the bonnie napery that she had packed and carried sae mony miles by sea and land should be waured on a wheen silly feckless taupies that tis the leddies wull to cocker up till not a lass of em will do a stroke of wark nor gie a ceevil answer to her elders  mysie with a bundle of damask cloths under her arm paused to repeat are you not coming dolly  your dear miss constance is there looking for you  this did move dolores and she followed to the coachhouse where everybody was buzzing about like bees the tables and forms being arranged and upon them dishes with piles of fruit and cakes contributions from other associates all the vases great and small were brought out and raids were made on the flower garden to fill them  little scarlet flags with the name of each parish in white were placed to direct the parties of guests to their places and harry macrae and the little groom were adorning the beams with festoons the men from the coffeetavern supplied the essentials but the ladies undertook the decoration and aunt adeline in a basketchair with her feet on a box directed the ornamentation with great taste and ability constance hacket had been told off to make up a little bouquet to lay beside each plate and dolores volunteered to help her  well dearest will you come to me on sunday  i dont know  i have not been able to ask aunt lilias yet and gillian was very cross about it  what did she say  she said she did not think aunt lilias approved of visiting and gossiping on sunday  oh now  what does gillian do herself said constance in a hurt voice  she does come and teach certainly but she stays ever so long talking after the class is over  why should we gossip more than she does  yes but peoples own children can do no wrong  there constance became inattentive  mr poulter had come up and wanted to be useful so she jumped up with a handful of nosegays to instruct him in laying them by each plate leaving dolores to herself which she found dull  the other two however came back again and the work continued but the talk was entirely between the gentleman and lady chiefly about music for the choral society and the voices of the singers about which dolores neither knew nor cared  by one oclock the long tables were a pretty sight covered with piles of fruit and cakes vases of flowers and little flags establishments of teacups at intervals and a bouquet and pretty card at every one of the plates  then came early dinner at the house and such rest as could be had after it till the ponychaise waggonette and mrs blackburnes carriage came to the door to convey to church all whom they could carry the rest walking  the church was a sea of neat round hats mostly black with a considerable proportion of feathers tufts and flowers  on their dark dresses were pinned rosettes of differentcoloured ribbon to show to which parish they belonged  there was  a bright short service in which the clear high voices of the multitudinous maidens quite overcame those of the choir boys and then an address respecting which constance pronounced that canon fremont was always so sweet and dolores assented without in the least knowing what it had been about  constance who had driven down was to have kept guard in the walk from church over the whiterosed silverton detachment but another shower was impending and miss hacket declaring that conny must not get wet rushed up and packed her into the waggonette where dolores was climbing after when at a touch from gillian lady merrifield looked round  dolores she said you forget that miss hacket walked to church  dolores turned on the step her face looking as black as thunder and miss hacket protested that she was not tired and could not leave her girls  never mind the girls i will look after them i meant to walk  dont stand on the step  come down  she added sharply but not in time for the horses gave a jerk and with a scream from constance down tumbled dolores or would have tumbled but that she was caught between her aunt and miss hacket who with one voice admonished her never to do that again for there was nothing more dangerous  indeed there was more anger in lady merrifields tone than her niece had yet heard and as there was no making out that there was the least injury to the girl she was forced to walk home in spite of all miss hackets protestations and refusals which had nearly ended in her exposing herself to the same peril as dolores only that lady merrifield fairly pushed her in and shut the door on her  nothing would have compensated to dolores but that her constance should have jumped out to accompany her and bewail her aunts cruelty but devotion did not reach to such an extent  her aunt however said in a tone that might be either apology or reproof  my dear i could not let poor miss hacket walk after all she has done and with all she has to do today  dolores vouchsafed no answer but aunt jane said  all which applies doubly to you lily  not a bit i am not run about like all of you she answered brightly  besides it is such fun i feel like whit monday at beechcroft  dont you remember the pink and blue glazed calico banners crowned with summer snowballs  and the big drum  what a nicelooking set of girls  how pleasant to see rosy english faces tidily got up they were rosy enough in ireland but a great deal too picturesque now these are a sort of flower of maidenhood  you are getting quite poetical lily  its the effect of walking in processiontheres something quite exhilarating in it ay and of having a bit of old beechcroft  about me  do tell me who that lady is i ought to know her im sure  oh miss smith good morning  how many girls have you brought  oh the crimson rosettes are they  york and lancasterindeed  im glad we have some shelter for them im afraid there is another shower  have you no umbrella my dear  come under mine  it was a fierce scud of hail hitting rather than wetting but dolores had the satisfaction of declaring the edges of her dress to be damp and going off to change it though aunt jane pinched the kilting and said the damp was imperceptible and wilfred muttered made of sugar only not so sweet  in fact she hoped that constance who had told of her hatred to these great functions and willingness to do anything to avoid them would avail herself of the excuse but though the young lady must have seen her go she never attempted to follow and dolores feeling her own room dull came down again to find the drawingroom empty and on the next gleam of sunshine she decided on going to seek her friend  what a hum and buzz pervaded the stableyard  there was a coachhouse with all its great doors open  and the rows of girls awakening from their first shy and hungry silence into laughter and talking  there were big urns and fountains steaming active hands filling cups all the cousins all their congeners and four or five clergymen acting as waiters aunt adeline pouring out tea a the upper table for any associate who had time to swallow it and constance hacket talking away to a sandyhaired curate without so much as seeing her friend  only wilfred at sight of his cousin again getting up a violent mock cough declaring that he thought she had gone to bed with congealed lungs or else brown titus as the old women called it  his mother however heard the coughwhich indeed was too remarkable a sound not to attract any oneand with a short sharp word to him to take care she put dolores down under aunt adas wing and provided her with a lovely peach and a delicious bath bun  constance just looked up and nodded saying  you dear little thing i couldnt think what was become of you and then went on with her sandy curate aboutwhat was it dolores know not only that it seemed very interesting and she was left out of it  down came the rain a hopeless downpour and there was a consultation among the elders some laughing some doubtful looks and at last harry with macrae and one of the curates disappeared  then grace was sung and speeches followedone by the rector mr leadbitter fatherly and prosya paper read by the branch secretary about affairs in general and a very amusing speech by miss mohun full of anecdotes of example and warning  you know she said all the school storybooks endwhen the grown up books marry their people with the good girl going out to service under her young lady and there she lives happy ever after  but some of us know better  we dont know how far the marrying ones always do live very happy ever after  for shame jenny  muttered lady merrifield  but went on miss mohun even you that have been lucky enough to get under your own young ladies know that life here is all new beginnings at the bottom just as when you were very proud of yourselves for getting out of the infant school you found it was only being at the bottom of the upper one and i can tell the twelveyearoldsi see some of themthat it is often a finer thing to be at the head of the school than the last in the house  ay youve got to work up there again and it is a long business and a steady business but it is to be done  i knew a girl thirtyfive years ago that my sisterinlaw took from school and she was not a genius either and i am quite sure she could not do ruleofthree nor tell what is the capital of dahomey as i dare say every one here can do but ill tell you what she did and that was her best and there she has been ever since and the last time  i saw her was sitting up in her housekeepers room in her silk gown with her masters grandchildren hanging about her respected and loved by us all  and i knew another a much clever girl at school with prettier ways to begin with butim sorry to say her finger were too clever and it was not very happy ever after though she did right herself  and then aunt jane went on to the difficulties of having to deal with such quantities of pots and pans and knives and forks and cloths and brushes each with a use of its very own just as if she had been a scullerymaid herself telling how sense and memory must be brought to bear on these things just as much as in analyzing a sentence and how even those would not do without the higher motive of faithfulness to him whose servants we all are  her finish was a picture of the roving servant girl always saying i dont like it and always seeking novelty illustrated by her experience of a little maid who left one place because she could not sleep alone and another because the little girl slept with her a third because it was so lonesome and a fourth because it was so noisy and quitted her fifth within a half year because she could not eat twice cooked meat  aunt jane varied her voice in the most comical way and the girls as well as all her audience laughed heartily  bravo jenny said a voice close to her and a gentleman with a rather bald head a fluffy light beard touched with white dancing eyes and a slim youthful figure was seen standing in the group  lady merrifield and her sisters cried with one glad voice oh rotherwood holding out their hands  yes  i found id a few hours between the trains so i ran down to look you up  i met harry at the house and he told me i should find jane qualifying for the female parliament  its such a pity you should fall on all this turmoil said aunt ada  pity  i wouldnt have missed jennys wisdom for the world  what is it lily  temperance or have you set up a salvation army  gfs of course you rotherwood of old  and now you are come you shall save me from what has been my bugbear for the last week you shall give the premiums  come its no use making faces and pretending you know nothing about it added miss mohun  i know very well that florence is deep in it  ay theyll have you over to repeat that splendid harangue about pots and pans  said he bowing at lady merrifields introductions of him to the bystanders and obediently accepting the sheaf of envelopes while mr leadbitter made it known that the premiums would be given by the marquess of rotherwood  certainly it was a much more lively business than if lady merrifield had performed it for he had something droll to observe to each girl  one he pretended to envy telling her he had worked hard for may a year and never got such a card as that for itfar less five shillings  another he was sure kept her pans bright and always knew which was which a very little one was asked if she had gone from her cradle and so on always sending them away with a broad smile and professing great respect for the three sevenyear card maidens who came up last  then in a concluding speech he demandedwhere were the premiums for the mistresses who he was quite sure deserved them quite as much or more than the maids  while everybody was still laughing lady merrifield asked mr leadbitter to explain that as it was still raining hard she must ask all to adjourn to the great loft over the stable where they could enjoy themselves  each associate was to gather her own flock and bring them in order  lady merrifield said she would lead the way lord rotherwood coming with her picking up little primrose in his arms to carry her upstairs to the loft  every one was moving  dolores was among a crowd of strangers she heard them saying how delightful lord rotherwood was and charming and handsome and graceful lady merrifield with her beautiful eyes  it worried dolores who thought it rather foolish to be pretty except in the case of persecuted orphan and moreover admiration of her aunt always seemed to her disparagement of her mother and where was constance  she followed the stream and climbing some stairs came out into a large long empty hayloft over what had once been hunting stables the childrens wetday playplace  the deputation dispatched to the house had managed to get up there the schoolroom piano and one of the curates sat down to it and began playing dance music while miss mohun miss hacket and the other ladies began arranging couples for a country danceall girls of course except that lord rotherwood danced with the tiny premium girl and harry with primrose  wilfred and fergus could not be incited to make the attempt mysie offered herself to dolores but in vain  i hate dancing was all the answer she got and she went off to persuade lois the nursery girl  constance hacket arranged herself on a chair and looked out from between two curates there was no getting at her  then there came a pause lord rotherwood spoke to gillian and must have asked her to point dolores out for presently he made his way to the little dark figure in the window and kindly laying his hand on her shoulder asked whether she had heard from her father yet  no i suppose you cant he added  it is a great breakup for you but you are a lucky girl to be taken in here  it reminds me of what beechcroft used to be to me when i was a stray fish though not quite so lonely as you are  make the most of it for there arent many in these days like aunt lily there  he little knows thought dolores as a waltz began to be played  they want an example he said  come along  you know how im sure a londoner like you  pairs were whirling about the floor in full career in a short time to the astonishment of other maidens who had never seen dancing in their lives  dolores afraid to refuse and certainly flattered really was wonderfully exhilarated and brightened by her career wither good natured cousin  i do believe cousin rotherwood has shaken her out of the dumps observed gillian to aunt jane who returned  he can do it if any one can  the funny thing was the effect upon constance who in the next pause shook off her curates advanced to dolores who was recovering her breath under the window called her a dear thing whom she had not been able to get to all this time sat rather forward with an arm round her waist for the next halfhour and when sir roger de coverley was getting up proposed that they should be partners but not till she had seen lord rotherwood pair himself off with mysie  i must said he to lady merrifield its so like dancing with honest phyl  the greatest compliment you could have mysie said her mother looking very much pleased  the last yellow patches of evening sunshine on the sloping roof faded watches were looked at the music turned to the national anthem everybody stood up or stood still and sung it  then at the close mr leadbitter stood by the piano and said  one word more my young friends  some of you may have been surprised at this evenings amusement but we want you to understand that there is no harm in dancing itself provided that the place the manner and the companions are fit  i hope that you will all prove the truth of my words by not taking this pleasant evening as an excuse for running into places of temptation now good night with many thanks to lady merrifield for the happy day she has given us  a voice added three cheers for lady merrifield  and the gfs showed itself by no means backward in the matter of cheering  there was a hunting up of ulsters and umbrellas one associate after another got her flock together and clattered downstairs either to get into vans to walk to the station or to disperse to their homes in the town  meantime lord rotherwood had time to explain that he was on his way to fetch his wife home from some german baths where she had gone to recruit after the season and as he meant to cross at night had come to spend a few hours with his cousin  there was still an hour to spare during which lady merrifield insisted that he must have more solid food than gfs provided  lily said miss mohun as the elders walked to the house together it strikes me that rotherwood could satisfy your mind about that letter  he would know the handwriting  you remember a certain brothervery much in lawof maurices  i have reason to do so said lord rotherwood  you dont mean that he has been troubling lily  no but from the nature of the animal it is much to be apprehended that he will said miss mohun if he knows that the child is here  in fact said lady merrifield jane has made me suppress till examination a letter to her in case it should be from him  it is a horrid thing to do  what do you think rotherwood  there should be no correspondence  did not maurice warn you  then he ought  look here lily  his wifeunder strong compulsion from the fellow i should thinkbegged me to find some employment for him  i got him a secretaryship to our board ofwhat dye call it  ill do maurice the justice to say that he was considerably cool about it but the end of it was that there was an unaccountable deficit and my lady said it served me right  i was a fool as i always am and gave way to the poor woman about not bringing it home to him  and she insisted on making it up to me by degreesout of her literary work i fancyfor i dont think maurice knew the extent of the peculation  ever since ive been getting begging letters from the fellow at intervals  if he had the impertinence to molest you lily simply refer him to me  and if he writes to the child  return him the letter  say she can have no such thing without her fathers consent  is this a case in point said lady merrifield producing the letter  no said he holding it up in the waning light  i know the fellows fist too well  this is a gentlemans hand  what a relief said lady merrifield  nay dont be in a hurry said miss mohun  dont give it to her unopened  your only safety is in maintaining your right to see all the childs letters except what her father specified  dont you wish it was you brownie asked her cousin  i hate it said lady merrifield but i suppose i ought  however theres no harm in this thats a comfort it is simply that the gentleman that the house is let to has found this note to her somewhere about and thinks she would wish to have it  i think it is her mothers hand  how nice of him  now lily dont go and be too apologetic said jane  assert your right or youll have it all over again  without jenny to do prudence said lord rotherwood while lady merrifield hardly hearing either of them hurried on in search of her niece but they would have been satisfied if they could have heard her  my dear heres your letter  i am so sorry to have been too much hindered to look at it before  you must not mind dolly  i know it is very disagreeable but every one who has the care of precious articles like young ladies is bound to look after them  dolores took the letter with a kind of acknowledgement but no more for its detention offended her and she was aggrieved at the prospect of future inspection as another cruel stroke inflicted upon her  aunt adeline was found in the drawingroom where she had entertained such ladies as were afraid of the damp or who did not approve of the dancing and would not look on at it  thence all went off to a merry meal where the elders plunged into old stories and went on capping each others recollections and making fun to the extreme delight of the young folk who had often been entertained with tales of beechcroft aunt ada declared that she had not laughed so much for ten years and aunt jane declared that it was too bad to lower their dignity and be so absurd before all these young things  its having four of the old set together  said lord rotherwood a chance one doesnt get every day  i wonder how soon maurice and phyllis will meet  it depends on whether the zenobia touches at auckland before going to the fijis said lady merrifield  there is at least a sort of neighbourhood between them said miss mohun though it may be about as close as between us and sicily  she is looking out for maurice said aunt ada  she wrote only it was too late to propose his bringing dolores to be at least nearer to him  just like phyllis ejaculated the marquess  you have one of your flock with something of her countenance lily  i am so glad you see it rotherwood  it is what i am always trying to believe in and i hope the likeness is a little within as well as withoutbut we poor creatures who have been tumbled about the world get sophisticated and cant attain to the sweet blundering freshness of honest simplicity  it is a plant that must be spontaneouscant be grown to order  his lordships carriage at the door announced macrae  ah well  trains must be caught i suppose  im glad youre settled here lilias  i feel as if a sort of reflex of old beechcroft were attainable now  i hope it wont be a gfs day next time you come  oh it was very jolly  i shall bring my child next time if i can get her out of the clutches of the governesses for a day but it is a hard matter  they look daggers at me if i put my head into the schoolroom  you always were a dangerous element there you know  poor dear eleanor  what did i not make her go through  but she never went the length of one of my ladys governesses who declared that she had as much call to interfere in my stable as i had with her schoolroom  what mischief were you doing there  well if you must know i was enlivening a very dry and cromwellian abridgement with some of lilys old cavalier anecdotes so lily was at the bottom of it you see  but did she fall on you then and there  no no  i trust my beard is too grey for that  but she looked at me with impressive dignity such as neither poor little fly nor i could stand and afterwards betook herself to victoria who i am happy to say sent her to the right about  as i am about to do said lady merrifield for if you dont miss your train it will be by cruelty to animals  no youve not got time to shake hands with all that rabble  be off with you  ah  i shall tell victoria that if she sees me tomorrow its all owing to your unpitying punctuality said he shaking himself into his overcoat  dear old fellow said lady merrifield as she turned from the front door while he drove off  he is like a gust of old beechcroft air but i should think victoria had a handful  she knew what she was doing said aunt ada  i always thought she married him for the sake of breaking him in  and very well she has done it too returned aunt jane  only now and then he gets a holiday and then the real creature breaks out again  but it is much better so  he would not have been of half so much good otherwise  lady merrifield looked from one to the other but said no more for all the young folks were round her but every one was so much tired children servants and all that prayers were read early and all went to their rooms  yet tired as she was  lady merrifield sat on in her sister janes room in her dressinggown talking according to another revival of olden time  what did ada mean about rotherwood  isnt he happy  oh yes very happy and it is much the best thing that could have happened  it is only another of the proofs that life is very long especially for men  come now tell me all about it  you dont know how often i feel as if i had been buried and dug up again  there are things one cant write about  poor fellow  he never really wanted to marry anybody but phyllis  no you dont mean it  i never knew it  no for you were in the utmost parts of the earth and he was very good so that i dont believe honest phyl herself or any one without eyes guessed it but he had it all out with our father who begged him almost on that allegiance he had always shown to abstain from beginning about it  you see not only are they first cousins but our mother and his father both were consumptive and there was dear claude even then regularly breaking down every winter and ada needing to be looked after like a hothouse plan  im sure when i think of the last generation of devereuxes i wonder so many of us have been tough enough to weather the dangerous age and there had been an alarm or two about rotherwood himself  well he was very good half from obedience half from being convinced that it would be a selfish thing and especially from being wholly convinced that phyls feelings were not stirred that was the way i came to know about it for papa took me out for a drive in the old gig to ask what i thought about her heart and i could truly and honestly say she had never found it cared for rotherwood just as she did for reggie and was not the sort to think whether a man was attentive to her  besides she was eighteen and he thirtyone and she thought him venerable  i believe if he had asked her then she might have taken him because cousin rotherwood wished it but she would have had to fall in love in the second place instead of the first  well he was very good poor old fellow except that by way of taking himself off and diverting his mind he went dearstalking with such unnecessary vehemence that a scotch mist was very nearly the death of him and he discovered that he had as many lungs as other people if you could only have seen our dear old father then how distressed and how guilty he felt and how he used to watch phyllis and examine alethea and me as to whether she seemed more than reasonably concerned for rotherwood had come and hit the right nail on the head he might have carried her off  but he didnt  no for you see he was ill enough to convince himself as well as other people that he was a consumptive devereux after all  oh yes  i remember the shock with which i heard like a doom that he was going the way of the others and hen he and the dear claude came out in his yacht to us at gibraltar and were so bright  we had a wonderful little journey into spain together and how jasper enjoyed it  little did i think i was never to see claude here again  but it was true was it not that all rotherwoods care gave the dear fellow much more comfortperhaps kept him longer  i am sure it was so  rotherwood soon got over his own attachmentthe missing an english winter was all he needed but he would hear of nothing but devoting himself to claude  papa and claude were both uneasy at his going off from all his cares and duties but i believe and claude knew itthat he actually could not settle down quietly while phyllis remained unmarried and that having claude to nurse and carry about from climate was the comfort of his life  or i believe dear claude would have been glad to have been left in peace to do what he could  well then phyllis and ada went to stay in the close with emily and ada wrote conscious letters and came home bridling and blushing about captain may so that we were quite prepared for his turning up at beechcroft but not at all for what i saw before he had been ten minutes in the house that it was phyllis that he meant and had meant all along  dear harry it almost made up for its not being rotherwood  well poor ada  it hadnt gone too deep happily and i opened her eyes in time to hinder any demonstration that could have left pain and shameat least i think so but poor ada has had too many little fits for one to have told much more than another  i believe phyl did tell harry that he meant ada but she let herself be convinced to the contrary and the only objection i have to it is his having taken that appointment at auckland and carried her out of reach of any of us  however it was better for rotherwood and when she was gone and his occupation over with our dear claude his mother was always at him to let her see him married before she died  and so he let her have her way  no dont look concerned  lady rotherwood is an excellent good woman just the wife for him and he knows it and does as she tells him most faithfully and gratefully  they are patternfolk from top to toe and so is the boy  but the girl  he would have his way and named her phyllisfly he calls her  she is a little skittish elfrotherwood himself all over and doesnt he worship her  and doesnt he think it a holiday to carry her off to play pranks with and isnt he happy to get amongst a good lot of us and be his old self again     chapter viii  my persecuted uncle    dolores was allowed to go to casement cottage on sunday  it was always rather an awful thing to her to get through the paddock when the farmers cattle turned out there  she did not mind it so much in the broad road and in the midst of a large party with hal among them and no dogs but alone with only one companion and in the easy path which was the shortest way to the cottage she winced and trembled at the little black shaggy scotch oxen with white horns and faces that looked to her very wild and fierce  oh gillian those creatures  cant we go the other way  no it is a great deal further round and theres no time  they wont hurt  the farmer engaged not to turn out anything vicious here  but how can he be sure  well dont come if you dont like it said gillian impatiently it is your own concern  i must go  dolores did not like the notion of constance being told that she would not come because she was afraid of the oxen  she thought it very unkind of gillian but she came and kept carefully on the side furthest from the formidable animals  and gillian really was forbearing  she did make allowances for the londonbred girls fears and the only thing she did was that when one of the animals lifted up its head and looked and dolores made a spring as if to run away she caught the girls arm crying dont  thats the very way to make him run after you  they got safe out of the paddock at last and rang at the door  they were both kissed dolores with especial affectionateness because the good ladies pitied her so much and then while miss hacket and gillian went off to their class constance took dolores up into her own room and began to tell her how disappointed she was not to have seen more of her at the festival  but those curates would not let me alone  i was obliged to attend to them  and then she was very eager to know all about lord rotherwood which rather amazed dolores who had been in the habit of hearing her father mention him as that mad fellow rotherwood while her mother always spoke with contempt of people who ran after lords and ladies and had been heard to say that lord rotherwood himself was well enough but his wife was a mere fine lady  but dolores had a matter on which she was very anxious  connie do they always read ones letters first  i mean the old people like aunt lily  what has she been reading your letters  she says she always shall except fathers and maude seftons because papa spoke to her about that  she took a letter of mine the other day and never let me have it till the evening and i am sure aunt jane put her up to it  you poor darling exclaimed constance  was it anything you cared about  oh nonot thatbut there might be  and i want to know whether she has the right  i should not have thought lady merrifield would have been so like an old schoolmistress  miss dormer always did the old cat  where i went to school said constance  we did hate it so  she looked over every ones letters except parents so that we never could have anything nice except by a chance or so  it is tyranny said dolores solemnly  i do not see why one should submit to it  we had dodges continued constance warming with the history of her schooldays and far too eager to talk to think of the harm she might be doing to the younger girl  sometimes when a lot of us went to a shop with one of the governesses one would slip out and post a letter fraulein was so shortsighted she never guessed  we used to call her the jolly old kafer  but mademoiselle was very sharp  she once caught alice bell so that she had to make an excuse and say she had dropped something  you see she really hadthe letter into the slit  but that was an equivocation  oh you darling scrupulous longworded child  you arent like the girls at miss dormers only she drove us to it you know  youll be horribly shocked but ill tell you what louie preston did  there was a young man in the town whom she had met at a picnic in the holidaysa clerk he was at the bankand he used to put notes to her under the cushions at church but one unlucky sunday louie had a cold and didnt go and she told mabel blisset to bring it and mabel didnt understand the right place and went poking about so that miss dormer found it out and there was such a row  wasnt that rather vulgar said dolores  well he was only a clerk but he was a duck of a man with regular auburn hair you know  and he sang  we used to go to the choral society concerts and he sang ballads so beautifully and always looked at louie  i should not care for anything of that sort said dolores  i think it is bad form  so it is said constance seriously only one cant help recollecting the fun of the thing and what one was driven to in those days  is there any one you are anxious to correspond with  not in particular only i cant bear to have aunt lilias meddling with my letters and theres a poor uncle of mine that i know would not like her or any of the mohuns to see his letters  indeed  your poor mammas brother cried constance full of curiosity  mind it is in confidence  you must never tell any one  never  oh you may trust me cried constance  her halfbrother said dolores and the girl proceeded to tell constance what she had told maude sefton about mr flinders and how her mother had been used to assist  him out of her own earnings and how he had met her at exeter station and was so disappointed to have missed her father  constance listened most eagerly greatly delighted to have a secret confided to her and promising to keep it with all her might  and now said dolores what shall i do  if poor uncle alfred writes to me aunt lilias will have the letter and read it and the mohuns are all so stuck up they will despise him and very likely she will never let me have the letter  yes but dear couldnt you write here with my things and tell him how it is and tell him to write under cover to me  dear connie  how good you are  yes that would be quite delightful  all the confidences and all the caresses had however taken quite as long as the gfs class and before constance had cleared a space on the table for doloress letter there was a summons to say that gillian was ready to go home  so early said constance  i thought you would have had tea and stayed to evening service  i should like it so much cried dolores remembering that it would spare her the black oxen in the crosspath as well as giving her the time with her friend  so they went down with the invitation but gillian replied that mamma always liked to have all together for the catechism and that she could not venture to leave dolores without special permission  quite right my dear said miss hacket  connie would be very sorry to do anything against lady merrifields rules  we shall see you again in a day or two  and this is the way in which constance kept her friends secret  when miss hacket had done her further work with a gfs young woman who needed private instruction to prepare her for baptism the two sisters sat down to a leisurely tea before starting for evensong in the first place constance detailed all she had discovered as to the connection with lord rotherwood in which subject it must be confessed good miss hacket took a lively interest having never so closely encountered a live marquess and so affable she contended upon which constance declared that they were all stuckup and were very unkind and hard to poor darling dolores  i dont know  i cannot fancy dear lady merrifield being unkind to any one especially a dear girl as good as an orphan said miss hacket who if not the cleverest of women was one of the best and most warm hearted  and indeed connie i dont think dear gillian and mysie feel at all unkindly to their cousin  ah thats just like you mary  you never see more than the outside but then i am in dear dollys confidence  what do you mean connie said miss hacket eagerly  constance had come home from school with the reputation of being much more accomplished than her elder sister who had grown up while her father was a curate of very straitened means and thus though her junior she was thought wonderfully superior in discernment and everything else  well said constance what do you think of lady merrifield sending her to bed for staying late here that morning  that was strict certainly but you know she sent mysie too  it was all my own thoughtlessness for detaining them said the good elder sister  i was so grieved  yes said constance it sounds all very well to say mysie was treated in the same way but in the afternoon mysie was allowed to go and make messes with blackberry jam while poor dolly was kept shut up in the schoolroom  constance did not like lady merrifield who had unconsciously snubbed some of her affectations and nipped in the bud a flirtation with harry besides calling off some of the curates to be helpful  but miss hacket admired her neighbour as much as her sister would permit and made answer  it is so hard to judge my dear without knowing all  perhaps mysie had finished her lessons  ah  i know you always are for lady merrifield  but what do you say then to her prying into all that poor childs correspondence  my dear i think most people do think it advisable to have some check on young girls letters  perhaps doloress father desired it  he never put on any restrictions said constance  i am sure he never would  men dont  it is always women with their nasty prying tyrannous instincts  i am sure returned mary one would not think a child like dolores mohun could have anything to conceal  but she has cried constance  no my dear  impossible exclaimed miss hacket looking very much shocked  why she cant be fourteen  oh it is nothing of that sort  dont think about that mary  no no i know connie dear you would never listen to any young girls confidence of that kindso improper and so vulgar said miss hacket and constance did not think it necessary to reveal her knowledge of the postoffice under the cushions at church and other little affairs of that sort  it is her uncle said constance  her mother it seems though quite a lady was the daughter of a professor a very learned man very distinguished and all that but not a high family enough to please the mohuns and they never were friendly with her or treated her as an equal  that couldnt have been lady merrifield persevered miss hacket she lamented to me herself that she had been out of england for so many years that she had scarcely seen mrs maurice mohun  well there were the miss mohuns and all the rest said constance why dolores has only once been at the family place  and her mother had a brother an author and a journalist a very clever man and the mohuns have always regularly persecuted him  he has been very unfortunate and mrs maurice mohun has done her utmost to help him writing in periodicals and giving the proceeds to him  wasnt that sweet  and now dolores feels quite cut off from him and she is so fond of him poor darling for her mothers sake  tenderhearted as miss hacket was she had seen enough of life to have some inkling of what being very unfortunate might sometimes mean  i should think she said that lady merrifield would never withhold from the child any letter it was proper she should have especially from a relation  yes but i tell you she did keep back a letter on the festival day till she had looked at it  poor dolores saw it come and she saw a glance pass between her and miss mohun and she is quite sure she says her aunt jane had been poisoning her mind about this poor persecuted uncle and that she shall never be allowed to hear from him  i dont suppose there can be much for him to say to her said miss hacket  then after a little reflection connie my dear i really think you had better not interfere  there may be reasons that this poor child knows nothing about for keeping her aloof from this uncle  oh but her mother helped him  she was his sister  that was quite another thing  indeed connie said miss hacket more earnestly i am quite sure that you will use your influenceand you have a great deal of influence you knowmost kindly by persuading this dear child to be happy with the merrifields and submit to their arrangements  you are infatuated with lady merrifield muttered constance  ah how little you know  here the first warning note of the bell ended the discussion and constance did not think it necessary to tell her sister of the offer she had made to dolores  in her eyes mary who was the eldest of the family had always been of the dull grownup authoritative faction of the elders while she herself was still one of the sweet junior party full of antagonism to them and ready to elude them in any way besides she had promised her darling dolores and the thing was quite romantic nor could any one call it blameworthy since it was nothing like a lovernot even a young man but only a persecuted uncle in distress  so she awaited anxiously the next sunday when doloress letter was to be written in her room to tell the truth dolores could quite as easily have written in her own and brought down the letter in her pocket if she had been eager about the matter but she was not except under the influence of making a grievance  she had never written to uncle alfred in her life nor he to her and his visits to her mother had always led to something uncomfortable  nor would she have thought about the subject at all if it had not been for the sore sense that she was cut off from him as she fancied because he belonged to her mother  nothing particular had happened that week  there had been no very striking offences one way or the other she was working better with her lessons and understanding more of miss vincents methods  she perceived that they were thorough and respected them accordingly and she had had the great satisfaction of getting more good marks for french and german than mysie  she had become interested in the old oak staircase and began to look forward to aunt lilys readings as the best part of the day  but she had not drawn in the least nearer to any of the family  she absolutely disliked almost hated the quarter of an hour which aunt lily devoted to her religious teaching every morning though nobody was present not even primrose  she nearly refused to learn and said as badly as possible the very small portions she was bidden to learn by heart and she closed her mind up against taking in the sense of the very short readings and her aunts comments on them  it seemed to her to be treating her like a sundayschool child and insulting her mother who had never troubled her in this manner  her aunt said no word of reproach except to insist on attention and accuracy of repetition but there came to be an unusual gravity and gentleness about her in these lessons as if she were keeping a guard over herself and often a greatly disappointed look which exasperated dolores much more than a scolding  mysie had left off courting her cousin finding that it only brought her rebuffs and went her own way as before pleased and honoured when gillian would consort with her but generally paring with her younger sister  dolores though hitherto ungracious missed her attentions and decided that they were all falseness  wilfred absolutely did tease and annoy her whenever he could fergus imitated him and valetta enjoyed and abetted him  these three had all been against her ever since the affair of the arrow but wilfred had not many opportunities of tormenting her for in the house there was a perpetual quiet supervision and influence  mrs halfpenny was sure to detect traps in the passage or bounces at the door  miss vincent looked daggers if other peoples lesson books were interfered with  mamma had eyes all round and nobody dared to tease or play tricks in her presence  hal gillian and even mysie always thwarted such amiable acts as putting a dead wasp into a shoe or snapping a book in the readers face while as to venturing into the general family active games dolores would have felt it like rushing into a corobboree of savages  there was one wet afternoon when they could not even get as far as to the loft over the stables at least the little ones could not have done so and it was decided that it would be very cruel to them for all the others to run off and leave them to mrs halfpenny so the plan was given up  partly because lady merrifield thought it very amiable in mysie and valetta to make the sacrifice and partly to disperse the thundercloud she saw gathering on wilfreds brow she not only consented to a magnificent and extraordinary game at wolves and bears all over the house but even devoted herself to keeping mrs halfpenny quiet by shutting herself into the nursery to look over all the wardrobes and decide what was to go down in the family and what was to be given away and what must be absolutely renewed  it was an operation that mrs halfpenny enjoyed so much that it warranted her to be deaf to shrieks and trampling and almost to forget the chances of gathers and kilting being torn out and trapdoors appearing in skirts and pinafores  all that time dolores sat hunched up in her own room reading clare or no home and realizing the persecutions suffered by that afflicted child who had just been nearly drowned in rescuing her wickedest cousin and was being carried into her noble grandfathers house there to be recognized by her golden hair being exactly the colour it was when she was a baby  there were horrible growlings at times outside her door and she bolted it by way of precaution  once there was a bounce against it but gillians voice might be heard in the distance calling off the wolves  then came a lull  the wolves and bears had rushed up and down stairs till they were quite exhausted and out of breath especially as primrose had always been a cub and gone in the arms of hal or gillian fergus at last had rolled down three steps and been caught by wilfred who in his character of bear hugged and mauled him till his screams grew violent  harry had come to the rescue and it was decided that there had been enough of this and that there should be a grand exhibition of tableaux from the history of england in the diningroom which of course mamma was to guess with the assistance of any one who was not required to act  mama ever obliging hastily condemned two or three sunburnt hats and ancient pairs of shoes to be added to the bundle for miss hackets distribution and let herself be hauled off to act audience  but wheres dolly she asked as she looked at the assemblage on the stairs  bolted into her room like a donkey said wilfred the last clause under his breath  indeed mamma we did ask her and gave her the choice between wolves and bears said mysie  unfortunately she is bear without choosing said gill  a sucking of her paws in a hollow tree chimed in hal  hush hush said lady merrifield looking pained perhaps the choice seemed very terrible to a poor only child like that  we who had the luck to be one of many dont know what wild cats you may all seem to her  she never will play at anything said val  she doesnt know how to said mysie  and wont be taught added wilfred  but thats very dreadful exclaimed lady merrifield  fancy a poor child of thirteen not knowing how to play  i shall go and dig her out  so there came a gentle tap at the closed door to which dolores answered  cant you let me alone  go away thinking it a treacherous ruse of the enemy to effect an entrance but when her aunt said  is there anything the matter my dear  wont you let me in  she was obliged to open it  no theres nothing the matter she allowed  only i wanted them to let me alone  they have not been rude to you i hope  dolores was too much afraid of wilfred to mention the bouncing so she allowed that no one had been rude to her but she hated romping which she managed to say in the tone of a rebuke to her aunt for suffering it  however aunt lily only smiled and said  ah you have not been used to wholesome exercise in large families  i dare say it seems formidable but my dear you are looking quite pale i cant allow you to stay stuffed up there poking over a book all the afternoon  it is very bad for you  we are going to have some historical tableaux  they are to have one set and i thought perhaps you and i would get up some for them to guess in turn  dolores was not in a mood to be pleased but she did not quite dare to say she did not choose to make herself ridiculous and she knew there was authority in the tone so she followed and endured  so they beheld alfred watching the cakes before the bright grate in the diningroom and having his ears beautifully boxed  also knut and the waves which were graphically represented by letting the wind in under the drugget and pulling it up gradually over his feet but these mysie explained were only for the little ones  rollo and his substitute doing homage to charles the simple were much more effective as gillian in that old military cloak of her fathers which had seen as much service in the playroom as in the field stood and scowled at wilfred in the crown and mammas ermine mantle being overthrown by harry at his full height  the excitement was immense when it was announced that mamma had a tableau to represent with the help of dolores who was really warming a little to the interest of the thing and did not at all dislike being dressed up with one of the boys caps with three ostrich feathers to accompany her aunt in hood and cloak and be challenged by hal who had together with the bow and papas old regimental sword been borrowed to personate the robber of hexham  everybody screamed with ecstasy except fergus who thought it very hard that he should not have been prince edward instead of a stupid girl  so to content all parties mama undertook to bring in as many as possible and a series from the life of elizabeth woodville was accordingly arranged  she stood under the oak represented by the hall chandelier with fergus and primrose as her infant sons and fascinated king edward on the rockinghorse which was much too vivant for it reared as perpendicularly as it could and then nearly descended on its nose to mark the riders feelings  then with her hair let down which was stipulated for though as she observed nothing would make it the right colour she sat desolate on the hearth surrounded by as many daughters as could be spared from being spectators as her youngest son was born off from her maternal arms by a being as like a cardinal as a galway cloak disposed tippet fashion could make him  she could not be spared to put up her hair again before she had to forget her maternal feelings and be mere audience while her two sons were smothered by mysie and dolores converted into murderers one and two by slouched hats  fergus a little afraid of being actually suffocated began to struggle setting off wilfred and the adventure was having a conclusion which would have accounted for the authentic existence of perkin warbeck whenoh horror there was a peal at the doorbell and before there was a moment for the general scurry herbert the buttonboy popped out of the pantry passage and admitted mr leadbitter to whom as a late sixth standard boy he had a special allegiance and having spied him coming hurried to let him in out of the rain instantly  at least such was the charitable interpretation  harry strongly suspected that the imp had been a concealed spectator all the time and had particularly relished the mischief of the discomfiture which after all was much greater on the part of the vicar than any one else as he was a rather stiff oldfashioned gentleman  lady merrifield only laughed said she had been beguiled into wet day sports with the children begged him to excuse her for a moment or two and tripped away followed by gillian to help her quickly reappearing in her lace cap as the graceful matron even before mr leadbitter had quite done blushing and quoting to harry desipere in loco as he was assisted off with his dripping shiny waterproof  after all no harm would have been done ifharry and gillian being both off guardvaletta had not exclaimed most unreasonably in her disappointment  i knew the fun would be spoilt the instant dolores came in for it  yes mr murderer you squashed my little finger and all but smothered me cried fergus throwing himself on dolores and dropping her down  dont dont you know you mustnt screamed valiant mysie flying to the rescue  murderers  murderers must be done for shouted wilfred falling upon mysie  you shant hurt my mysie bellowed valetta hurling herself upon wilfred  and there they were all in a heap when gillian summoned by the shrieks came down from helping her mother pulled valetta off wilfred wilfred off mysie mysie off fergus and fergus off dolores who was discovered at the bottom with an angry frightened face and all her hair standing on end  are you hurt dolores i am very sorry said gillian  it was very naughty  go up to the nursery fergus and val and be made fit to be seen  they obeyed crestfallen  dolores felt herself all over  it would have been gratifying to have had some injury to complain of but she had fallen on the princes cushions and there really was none  so she only said no im not hurt though it is a wonder and off she walked to bolt herself into her own room again there to brood on valettas speech  it worked up into a very telling and pathetic history for constances sympathizing ears on sunday especially as it turned out to be one of the things not reported to mamma  and on that day dolores being reminded of it by her friend sent a letter to mr flinders to the office of the paper for which he worked in london to tell him that if he wished to write to her as he had promised he must address under cover to miss constance hacket casement cottage as otherwise aunt lilias would certainly read all his letters     chapter ix  letters    constance hacket was very much excited about the address to doloress letter to her uncle  she had not noticed it at the moment that it was written but she did when she posted it and the next time she could get her young friend alone she eagerly demanded what mr flinders had to do with the many tongues and why her niece wrote to him at the office  he writes the criticisms said dolores magnificently for though she despised pluming herself on any connection with a marquess she did greatly esteem that with the world of letters  you know we are all literary  oh yes i know  but what kind of criticisms do you mean  i suppose it is a very clever paper  of course it it said dolores but i dont think i ever saw it father never takes in society papers i believe he does criticisms on plays and novels  i know he always has tickets for all the theatres and exhibitions  she did not say how she did know it for a pang  smote her as she remembered dimly a scene when her father had forbidden her mother to avail herself of escort thus obtained  nor was she sure that the word all was accurately the fact but it was delightful to impress constance who cried how perfectly delicious i suppose he can get any article into his paper  oh yes of course said dolores  did your dear mother write in it  no it was not her line she used to write metaphysical and scientific articles in the firstclass reviews and magazines and the many tongues is what they call a society paper you know  oh yes i know  there are charming things about the upper ten thousand  they tell all that is going on but i hardly ever can see one  mary wont take in anything about church bells and we get the guardian when it is a week old and my brother james has done with it  dear me  how dreadful  said dolores who had been used to see all manner of papers come in as regularly as hot rolls  why you never can know anything  we didnt take in society papers because father does not care for gossip or grandees  he has other pursuits  i can show you some of dear mothers articles theres one called unconscious volition and another on the progress of species  ill bring them down next time i come  have you read them  no they are too difficult  mother was so very clever you know  she must have been said constance with a sigh but how did she get them published  sent them to the editor of course said dolores  they all knew her and were glad to get anything that she wrote  ah  that is what it is to have an introduction sighed constance  what have you written anything cried dolores  only a few little trifles said constance modestly  it is a great secret you know a dead secret  oh ill keep it  i told you my secret you know so you might tell me yours  and so to dolores were confided sundry verses and tales on which constance had been wont to spend a good deal of her time in that pretty sittingroom  she had actually sent her manuscripts to magazines but she had heard no more of one and the other had been returned declined with thanksall for want of an introduction  dolores was delighted to promise that as soon as she heard from uncle alfred she would get him to patronize them and the reading occupied several sunday afternoons dolores suggested however that a goodygoody story about a choirboy lost in the snow would never do for the many tongues and a far more exciting one was taken up called the waif of the moorland being the story of a maiden whom a wicked stepmother was suspected of murdering but who walked from time to time like the woman in white there was only too much time for the romance for weeks passed and there was no answer from mr flinders  it was possible that he might have broken off his connection with the paper only then the letter would probably have been returned and the other alternative was less agreeable that it was not worth his while to write to his niece while as to maude sefton nothing was heard of her  were her letters intercepted  and so the winter side of autumn set in  hal was gone to oxford and there had been time for letters to come from mr mohun posted from auckland new zealand where he had made a halt with his sister mrs harry may otherwise aunt phyllis  dolores was very much pleased to receive her letter and to have it all to herself but after all she was somewhat disappointed in it for there was really nothing in it that might not have been proclaimed round the breakfast table like the public letters from that quarter of the family who were at rawul pindee  it told of deepsea soundings and investigations into the creatures at the bottom of the sea of portuguese menofwar and albatrosses and there were some orders to scientificinstrument makers for her to send to thema very improving letter but a good deal like a book of travels  only at the end did the writer say i hope my little daughter is happy among her cousins and takes care to give her aunt no trouble and to profit by her kind care  your three cousins here mary lily and maggie are exceedingly nice girls and much interested about you indeed they wish i had brought you with me  dolores read her letter over and over and over for the pleasure of having something all to herself and never communicated a word about the miscroscopic monsters her father had described but she drew her head back and reflected he little knows when he spoke of her being happy among her cousins  lady merrifield likewise received a letter about which she did not say much to her children but miss mohun who had had a much longer one came over for the day to read this to her sister  in point of fact she had paired in childhood with her brother maurice  she had been his correspondent in school and college days and being a person never easily rebuffed she had kept up more intercourse with him and his wife than any others of the family had done and he had preserved the habit of writing to her much more freely and unreservedly than to any one else  so the day after the new zealand letters came just as the historical reading and needlework were in full force the schoolroom door was opened and a brisk little figure stood there in sealskin coat and hat  up jumped mamma  oh jenny  brownie indeed  how did you come  you didnt walk from the station  yes why not  otherwise i should have been too soon and have disturbed the lessons said aunt jane in the intervals of the greeting kisses  all well with the indian folks  oh yes theyve come back from the emerald valleys of cashmere and alethea has actually sent me a primrosejust like an english onethat they found growing there  they did enjoy it so  have you heard from maurice  yes i thought you would like to hear about phyllis so having enjoyed it with ada i brought it over for further enjoyment with you  thats a dear old brownie  weve a good hour before dinner  shall we read it to the general public or shall we adjourn to the drawing room  oh  i assure you it is very instructive  quite as much so as miss sewells rome  and aunt jane whom gillian had aided in disrobing herself of her outdoor garments was installed by the fire and unfolded a whole volume of thin mauve sheets in mr mohuns tiny greeklooking handwriting  it was a sort of journal of his voyage  there were all the same accounts of the minute creatures that are incipient chalk and their exquisite cells made some of coral some of silex spicule from sponges the some descriptions of phosphorescent animals meduse and the like that dolores had thought her own special treasure and privilege only a great deal fuller and with the scientific terms untranslatedindeed aunt jane had now and then to stop and explain since she had always kept up with the course of modern discovery there was also much more about his shipmates with one or two of whom mr mohun had evidently made great friends  he told his sister a great deal about them and his conversations with them whereas he had only told dolores abut one little midshipman getting into a scrape  perhaps nothing else was to be expected but it made her feel the contrast between being treated with real confidence and as a mere child and it seemed to put her father further away from her than ever  then came the conclusion written on shore  harry may came on board to take me home with him  he is a fine genial fellow and his welcome did ones heart good  i never did him justice before but i see his good sense and superiority called into play out here  depend upon it theres nothing like going to the other end of the world to teach the value of home ties  well done maurice exclaimed lady merrifield but she glanced at dolores and checked herself  miss mohun went on phyllis met me at the door of a pleasant english looking house with all her tribe about her  she has the true honest phyl face still carrying me back over some thirty or forty years of life and as you would imagine she is a capital mother with all her flock well in hand and making themselves thoroughly useful in the scarcity of servants though the other matters do not seem neglected the eldest can talk like a well informed girl and shows reasonable interest in things in general but phyllis wants to put finishing touches to their education and her husband talks of throwing up his appointment before long as he is anxious to go home while his father lives  i wish i had gone to stoneborough before coming out here now that i see what a gratification it would have been if i could have brought a fresh report of old dr may somehow i think there has been a numbness or obtuseness about me all these last two years which hindered me from perceiving or doing much that i now regret since either the change or the wholesome atmosphere of this house has wakened me as it were  among these ungracious omissions is what i now am much concerned to think of that i never went to see lilias when i committed my child to her charge nor talked over her disposition  not that i really understand it as i ought to have done when the poor child was left to me  i take shame to myself when phyllis questions me about her but as i watch these children with their parents i am quite convinced that the being taken under lilys motherly wing is by far the best thing that could have befallen dolores and that my absence is for her real benefit as well as mine  the part between brackets was omitted by miss mohun in the public reading but the last sentence she did read thinking it good for both parties to hear it  however dolores both disliked the conclusion to which her father had come and still more that her aunt and cousins should hear it though after all it was only gillian and mysie who remained to listen by the time the end of the letter was reached  the long words had frightened away valetta as soon as her appointed task of work was finished  aunt lily did not see the omitted sentence till the two sisters were alone together later in the afternoon  it filled her eyes with tears poor maurice she said he wrote something of the same kind to me  i expect we shall see him wonderfully shaken up and brightened when he comes home the numbness he talks of was half of it marys dislike to us all only i never would let her keep me aloof from him  i almost wish he had taken dolores out to phyllis  i am not in the least fulfilling his ideal towards her  nor would phyllis unless the voyage had had as much effect on her as it seems to have had upon maurice  so you dont get on any better  not a bit  it is a case of parallel lines we dont often have collisionsunless wilfred gets an opportunity of provoking her  why dont you send that boy to school  i shall after christmas  he is quite well now and to have him at home is bad both for himself and the others  he needs licking into shape as only boys can do to one another and he is not a model for fergus especially since harry has been away  what does he do  nothing very brilliant nor of the kind one half forgives for the drollery of it  putting mustard into the custard was the worst i think inciting the dogs to bring the cattle down on the girls when they cross the paddock shutting up their books when the places are foundthose are the sort of things putting that very lifelike wild cat chauffepied with glaring eyes in dollys bed  i believe he does such things to all but his sisters would let him torture them rather than complain whereas dolores does her best to bring them under my notice without actually laying an information which she is evidently afraid to do  it is very unlucky that her coming should have been just when we had such an element aboutfor it really gives her some just cause of complaint  but you say he is impartial  teasing is unfortunately his delight  he will even frighten primrose but i am afraid there is active dislike making dolores his favourite victim and then val and fergus who dont tease actively on their own account have come to enjoy her discomfiture  and you go on the principle of  tolerer beaucoup  i do hoping that it is not laziness and weakness that makes me abstain from nagging about what is not brought before my eyes by the children or the policei mean gill halfpenny and miss vincent  then i scold or i punish and that i think maintains the principle without danger to truth or forbearance  at least i hope it does  i am pretty sure that if i punished wilfred for every teasing trick i know or guess at he wouldin his present moodonly become deceitful and esprit de corps  might make val and fergus the same though i dont think mysies truth could be shaken any more than honest phyls  besides mutual discipline is not a thing to upset  lily i revere you i never thought you were going to turn out such a sensible mother  well you see the difficulty is that what may work for ones own children may not work for other peoples  and i confess i dont understand her persistent repulse of mysie  nor of you the nasty little cat said aunt jane with a little fierce shake of the head  i do understand that a little  i am too unlike mary for her to stand being mothered by me  there must be some other influence at work for this perverseness to keep on so long  tell me did she take up with that very goosey girl that miss hacket  oh yes she goes there every sunday afternoon  it is the only thing the poor child seem much to care about and i dont think there can be any harm in it  humph the folly of girl is unfathomable  oh you may say what you likeyou who have thrown yourself into your daughters and kept them one with you  you little know in your innocence the product of an ill managed boardingschool  nay said lady merrifield a little hotly i do know that miss hacket is one of the most excellent people in the world a little tiresome and borne perhaps but thoroughly good and every inch a lady  granted but thats not the other oneconstance is her name  my dear i saw her goings on at the gfs affairif she had only been a member wouldnt i have been at her  my dear jenny you always had more eyes to your share than other people  and you think that being an old maid has not lessened their sharpness eh  lily  well i cant help it but my notion is that the sweet constancewhatever her sister may beis the boardingschool miss a little further developed into sentiment and flirtation  nay but that would be so utterly uncongenial to a grave reserved intellectual girl brought up as dolores has been  dont trust to that  dolores is an interesting orphan and the notice of a grownup young lady is so flattering that it carries off a great deal of folly  well jenny i must think about it  i hope i have done no harm by allowing the friendshipthe only indulgence she has seemed to wish for and i am afraid checking it would only alienate he still more poor maurice when he is trusting and hoping in vain  three year is a long time lily and you have no had three months of her yet  the door opened at that moment for the afternoon tea which was earlier than usual to follow of miss mohuns reaching the station in time for her train  lady merrifield was to drive her and it was the turn of dolores to go out so that she shared the refection instead of waiting for gouter  in the midst the miss hackets were announced and there were exclamations of great joy at the sight of miss mohun as she and miss hacket flew upon each other and to the very last moment discussed the allengrossing subject of gfs politics  nevertheless while miss mohun was hurrying on her sealskin in her sisters room she found an opportunity of saying take care lily i saw a note pass between those two  my dear jenny how could you  you were going on the whole time about cards and premiums and associates  oh yes i know a peacock or a lynx is nothing to you but how was it possible  why i was making talk to constance all along  and trying to make dolly speak of her fathers letter  i might retort by talking of moles and bats  did you never hear of the london clergyman whose silver creamjug full of cream too was abstracted by the penitent sunday school boy whom he was exhorting over his breakfasttable  i dont believe london curates have silver jugs or cream either  a relic of past wealth like st gregorys one silver dish and perhaps it was milk  well to descend to particulars  it was done with a meaning glance as dolores was helping her on with her cloud and was instantly disposed of in the pocket  i wonder what i ought to do about it sighed lady merrifield if i had seen it myself i should have no doubts  oh  if jasper were but here  and yet it is hardly a thing to worry him about  it is most likely to be quite innocent  well then you can speak of the appearance of secrecy as bad manners you will have her all to yourself as you go home  but when the aunts came downstairs dolores was not there  on being called she sent a voice down over the balusters that she was not going  aunt jane shrugged her shoulders  there was barely time to reach the train so that it was impossible to do anything at the moment but in the merrifield family bad manners and disrespect were never passed over sir jasper having made his wife very particular in that respect and as soon as  she came home in the twilight she looked into the schoolroom but dolores was not there and then into the drawingroom where she was found learning her lessons by firelight  my dear why did you not go with your aunt jane and me  i did not want to go  it was so cold said dolores in a glum tone  would it not have been kinder to have found that out sooner  if i had not met the others in the paddock and picked up valetta the chance would have been missed and you knew she wanted to go  dolores knew it well enough  the reason she was in this room was that all the returning party had fallen upon her wilfred had called her a dog in the manger and gillian herself had not gainsayed himbut the general indignation had only made her feel what a fuss about the darling  another time too added lady merrifield remember that it would be proper to come down and speak to me instead of shouting over the balusters in that unmannerly way without so much as taking leave of your aunt jane if she had not been almost late for her train i should have insisted  you might and i should not have come if you had dragged me thought but did not say dolores  she only stood looking dogged and not attempting the i beg your pardon for which her aunt was waiting  i think said lady merrifield gently that when you consider it a little you will see that it would be well to be more considerate and gracious and one thing more my dear i can have no passing of private notes between you and constance hacket  you see a good deal of each other openly and such doings are very silly and missish and have an underhand appearance such as i am sure your father would not like  dolores burst out with i didnt and as primrose at this instant ran in to help mamma take off her things she turned on her heel and went away leaving lady merrifield trusting to a word never hitherto in that house proved to be false rather than to those glances of aunt jane which had been always held in the mohun family to be a little too discerning and ubiquitous to be always relied on and it was a satisfactory recollection that at the farewell moment when miss jane professed to have observed the transaction she had been heard saying yes it will never do to be too slack in inquiring into antecedents or the whole character of the society will be given up and with her black eyes fixed full upon miss hackets face     chapter x  the evening star    oh connie dear i had such a fright  do you know you must never venture to give me anything when any one is thereespecially aunt jane i am sure it was her  she is always spying about  well but dearest dolly i couldnt tell that she would be there and when i got your letter i could not keep it back you know so i made mary come up and call on lady merrifield for the chance of being able to give it to youand i thought it was so lucky miss mohun was there for she and mary were quite swallowed up in their dear gfs  you dont know aunt jane  and the worst of it is she always makes aunt lilias twice as cross  i  did get into such a row only because i didnt want to go driving with the two old aunts in the dark and cold and be scolded all the way there and back  when you had a letter to read too  and then aunt lily said all manner of cross things about giving notes between us  i was so glad i could say i didnt for you know i didnt give it to you and it wasnt between us  you cunning child laughed constance rather amused at the sophistry  besides argued dolores what right has she to interfere between my uncle and my friends and me  you dear  yes it is all jealousy  i have heardor i have read said dolores that when people ask questions they have no right to put it is quite fair to give them a denial or at least to go as near the wind  as one can  to be sure assented constance or one would not get on at all  but you have no told me a word about your letters  fathers letter  oh he tells me a great deal about his voyage and all the funny creatures they get up with the dredge  i think he will be sure to write a book about them and make great discoveries  and now he is staying with aunt phyllis in new zealand and he is thinking poor father how well off i must be with aunt lilias  he little knows  oh but you could write to him dearest  he wouldnt get the letter for so long  besides i dont think i could say anything he would care about  gentlemen dont you know  no  gentlemen cant enter into our feelings or know what it is to be rubbed against and never appreciated  but your uncle was the letter from him  oh yes  and where do you think he is  at darminsterediting a paper there  it is called the darminster politician  he said he sent a copy here  oh yes i know mary and i could not think where it came from  it had a piece of a story in it and some poetry i wonder if he would put in my evening star  you may read his letter if you like you see he says he would run over to see me if it were not for the dragons  i wish he could come and meet you here  it would be so romantic but you see mary is half a dragon herself and would be afraid of lady merrifieldthen reading the letterhow droll  how clever  what a delightful man he must be  how very strange that all your family should be so prejudiced against him  ill tell you what dolores i will write and subscribe for the darminster politician my own selfi must see the rest of that storyand then mary cant make any objection i cant stand never seeing anything but church bells and then you can read it too darling  oh thank you connie  then i shall have got him one subscriber as he asks me to do i am afraid i shant get any more for i thought aunt lily was in a good humour yesterday and i put one of the little advertisement papers he sent out on the table and she found it and only said something about wondering who had sent the advertisement of that paper that mr leadbitter didnt approve of  she is so dreadfully fussy and particular  she wont let even gillian read anything she hasnt looked over and she doesnt like anything that isnt goody goody  my poor darling  but couldnt you write and get your uncle to look at some of my poor little verses that have never seen the light  i dare say i could said dolores pleased to be able to patronize oh but you must not write on both sides of the paper i know for father and mother were always writing for the press  oh ill copy them out fresh  heres the evening star  it was suggested by the sound of the guns firing at the autumn manoevres heres the  bereaved mothers address to her infant                   sweet little bud of stainless white                  thoult blossom in the garden of light   mary thought that so sweet she asked miss mohun to send it to friendly leaves but she wouldntmiss mohun i mean she said she didnt think they would accept it and that the lines didnt scan  now im sure its only latin and greek that scan  english rhymes and doesnt scan thats the difference  to be sure said dolores but aunt jane always does look out for what nobody else cares about  still i wouldnt send the babyverses to uncle alfred for they do sound a little bit goody and the evening star would be better  the verses were turned over and discussed until the summons came to tea poured out by kind old miss hacket who had delighted in providing her young guests with buttered toast and tea cakes  dolores went home quite exhilarated and unusually amiable  her letter to her father was finished the next day  it contained the following information  uncle alfred is at darminster  he is subeditor to the politician the liberal county paper  i do not  suppose aunt lilias will let me see him for she does not like anything that dear mother did there is a childish obsolete tone of mind here i suppose it is because they have never lived in london and the children are all so young of their age and so rude wilfred most especially  even gillian who is sixteen likes quite childish games and mysie who is my age is a mere child in tastes and no companion  i do wish i could have gone with you  lady merrifield wrote by the same mail your dolores is quite well and shows herself both clever and well taught  miss vincent thinks highly of her abilities and gets on with her better than any one else except the daughter of our late vicar for whom she has set up a strong girlish friendship  she plainly has very deep affections which are not readily transferred to new claimants but i feel sure that we shall get on in time  miss mohun wrote lily and i enjoyed your letter together  dolly looks all the better for country life though i am afraid she has not learnt to relish it nor to assimilate with the merrifield children as i expected  i dont think lily has quite fathomed her as yet but cela viendra with patience only mayhap not without a previous explosion  i fancy it takes a long time for an only child to settle in among a large family  it was a great pity you could not see lily yourself  to my dismay i encountered flinders in the street at darminster last week  i believe he is on the staff of a paper there happily dolly does not know it nor do i think he knows where she is  in another three weeks constance was in the utmost elation for on hearing the cannonade of the autumn manoeuvres was in print and miss hacket was so much delighted that justice should be done to her sisters abilities that she forgot mr leadbitters disapproval and ordered half a dozen copies of the politician for the present and one for the future  dolores walking home in the twilight could not help showing gillian in confidence the precious slip though it was almost too dark to read the small type  newspaper poetry i thought that always was trumpery said gillian making a youthfully sweeping assertion  many great poets have begun with a periodical press said dolores picking up a sentence which she had somewhere read  i thought you hated english poetry dolly  you always grumble at having to learn it  oh that is lessons  il penseroso for instance  this is a very different thing  that it certainly is said gillian beginning to read                 how lovely mounts the evening star                climbing the sunset skies afar   what a wonderful evening  why the evening star was going up backward  you only want to make nonsense of it  it is not i that make nonsense said gillian why dont you see dolly which way the sun and everything moves  this is the evening star said dolores sulkily  it was just rising  i do believe you think it rises in the west  you always see it there  you showed it to me only last sunday  do you think it had just risen  of course the stars rise when the sun sets  gillian could hardly move for laughing  my dear dolores you to be daughter to a scientific man  dont you know that the stars are in the sky going on all the time only we cant see them till the sunlight is gone  but dolores was too much offended to attend and only grunted  she wanted to get the cutting away from gillian but there was no doing so                 the mist is rising oer the mead                with silver hiding grass and reed                tis silent all on hill and heath                the evening winds they hardly breathe                what sudden breaks the silent charm                the echo wakes with wild alarm                with rapid loud and furious rattle                sure tis the voice of deadly battle                bidding the rustic swain to fly                before his countrys enemy   did anybody ever hear of a sham fight in the evening cried the soldiers daughter indignantly  there i cant see any more of it  give it to me then  you are welcome  where did it come from  let me look  ch  oh did constance hacket write it  nobody else could be so delicious or so far superior to milton  you knew it all the time and that was the reason you made game of it  no indeed it was not dolores  i did not guess  you should have told me at first  you would have gone on about it all the same  no indeed i hope not  i did not mean to vex you but how was i to know it was so near your heart  i ought to have known better than to have shown it to you  you are always laughing at her and me all over the houseand now  come dolly  i never meant to hurt your feelings  i will promise not to tell the others about it  no answer  there was something hard and swelling in doloress throat  wont that do said gillian  you know i cant say that i admire it but im sorry i hurt you and ill take care the others dont tease you about it  dolores made hardly any answer but it was a sort of pacification and gillian said not a word to the younger ones  still she thought it no breach of her promise when they were all gone to bed and she the sole survivor to tell her mother how inadvertently she had affronted dolores by cutting up the verses before she knew whose they were  i am sorry said lady merrifield  anything that tends to keep dolores aloof from us is a pity  but mama i had no notion whose they were  you saw that she was pleased with them  yes but that was the more ridiculous  fancy the evening star climbing upupyou know in the sunset  portentous certainly  yet still i wish you could have found it in your heart to take advantage of any feeler towards sympathy  how could i pretend to admire such stuff  you need not pretend but there are two ways of taking hold of a thing without being untrue  if you had been a little wiser and more forbearing you need not have given dolores such a shock as would drive her in upon herself  depend upon it the older you grow the more dangerous you will find it to begin by hitting the blots  gillian looked on in some curiosity when the next day good miss hacket enchanted with her dear connies success trotted up to display the lines to lady merrifield who on her side felt bound to set an example alike of tenderness and sincerity and was glad to be able to observe the lines run very smoothly  this must be a great pleasure to her  indeed it is  connie is so clever  i always say i cant think where she got it from but we always tried to give her very advantage and she was quite a favourite pupil at miss dormers  is not it a sweet idea the stillness of the evening broken by the sounds of battle and then it proving to be only our brave defenders  yes was the answer  i have often thought of that and of what it might be to hear those volleys of musketry in earnest  it has made me very thankful  so miss hacket went away gratified and gillian owned that it would have been useless to wound the good ladys feelings by criticism though her mother made her understand that if her opinion had been asked or connie herself had shown the verses it would have been desirable to point out the faults in a kindly spirit  the wonder was how they could have found their way into the paper and they were followed by more with the like signature  indeed the great sensational tale the waif of the moorland was being copied out of the books where it had been first written  dolores had sounded mr flinders on the subject and he had replied that he could ensure its consideration by a publisher but that her fair friend must be aware that an untried author must be prepared for some risk  constance could hardly abstain from communicating her hopes to her sister but mr leadbitterto whom the poetry was duly shownhad given such a character of the darminster politician that miss hacket besought constance to have no more to do with it  besides she was so entirely a lady and so conscientious that all her tender blindness would not have prevented her from being shocked at encouraging or profiting by a surreptitious correspondence  constance declared that mr leadbitters objection to the paper was merely political and her sister was too willing that she should be gratified to protest any further  the copying had to be done in secret since it was impossible to confess the hopes founded on mr flinders and it therefore lasted several weeks each fresh portion being communicated to dolores on sunday afternoons  there were at first a few scruples on constances part whether this were exactly a sunday occupation but dolores pronounced that the sabbatarian system was gone out and after constance had introduced the ghostly double of her vanished waif walking in a surpliced procession she persuaded herself that there was a sufficient aroma of religion about the story to bring it within the pale of sunday books  the days were shortening so that lady merrifield had doubts as to the fitness of letting the girls return in the dark but gillian would have been grieved to relinquish her class and the matter was adjusted by the two remaining till evensong when there was sure to be sufficient escort for them to come home with  therewith arrived the holidays and jasper whose age came between those of gillian and mysie  dolores had looked forward to his coming for by all the laws of fiction he was bound to be the champion of the orphan niece and finally to develop into her lover and hero  in no home when clares aunt locked her up and fed her on bread and water for playing the piano better than her spiteful cousin augusta eric the boy of the family had solaced her with cold pie and icecreams drawn up in a basket by a cord from the window  he had likewise forced from his cruel mother the locket which proved clares identity with the mourning countesss goldenhaired grandchild and heiress and he had finally been rewarded with her hand becoming in some mysterious manner lord eric  jasper however or japs as his family preferred to call him proved to be a big shy boy not at all delighted with the introduction of a stranger among his sisters neither goldenhaired nor allaccomplished only making him feel his home invaded and looking at him with her great eyes  is that girl here for good he asked when he found himself with harry and gillian  yes of course said the cousin while her father is away and that is for three years  jasper whistled  aunt ada said added gillian that if she got too tiresome mamma had uncle maurices leave to send her to  school  that would be no good to me said jasper for she would still be here in the holidays  has she been getting worse asked harry  no i dont know that she has said gillian except that she runs after that constance more than ever  but i say jasper mamma says she is particularly anxious that there should be no teasing of her and you can hinder wilfred better than anybody can  she wants her to be really at home and one  but though jasper was very fond both of mother and sister he would not stand a secondhand lecture and broke in with an inquiry about chances of rabbitshooting  among his juniors he heard more opinions and more undisguised when the whole party had rushed out together to the stableyard to inspect the rabbits and other livestock  and dolly says you are a fright sighed mysie condoling with a very awkwardlooking puppy which she was nursing  she she thinks everything a fright said valetta  except constance added wilfred  who is ugliest of all politely chimed in fergus  oh japs she is such a nasty girldolly i mean cried valetta  you know you ought not to say nasty exclaimed mysie  well but she is insisted val  she squashed a dear little lady bird and said it would sting  she really thought it would said mysie  at which the young barbarians shouted aloud with contempt and valetta added  she is afraid of everythingcows and dogs and frogs  i got a whole matchbox full of grasshoppers to shut up in her desk and make her squall said wilfred only the girls went and turned them out  it was so cruel to the poor grasshoppers said mysie one had his horn broken and dragged his leg  what does she do asked jasper  shes always cross said fergus  and she wont play added valetta  and never will lend us anything of hers  and shes a regular sneak said wilfred  she wants to tell of everythingonly we stopped that and she doesnt dare now  you see said mysie gravely she has always lived alone and in london and that makes her horribly stupid about everything sensible we thought we should soon teach her to be nice and mamma says we shall if we are patient  well teach her wont we japs said wilfred aside in an ominous voice  she is only thirteen added valetta and she pretends to be grown up and only to care for a grownup young ladythat constance hacket  yes added mysie only thinkthey write poetry  what rot it must be said jasper  theres a man in my house that writes poetry and dont they chaff him  and this must be ever so much worse  oh that it is said valetta  i heard mr poulter and miss vincent laughing about it like anything  but they get it put into print said mysie still impressed  miss hacket brought it up to give to mamma and theres ever so much of it shut up in the drawingroom blottingbook with the malachite knobs  i cant think why they laughi think it is very pretty  old miss hacket read me the one about my lost dove  mysie always will stick up for dolores said valetta in a grumbling voice  i always meant her to be my friend said mysie disconsolately  well im glad shes not said jasper  what a sell it would have been for me to find you chummy with a stupid poetrywriting goodfor nothing girl like that instead of my jolly old mice  and at that minute all dollys slights were fully compensated for  there was a lurking purpose in the boys minds that if dolores would not join in fun yet still fun should be extracted from her jasper had brought home a box of japanese fireworks and wilfred who was superintending his unpacking proposed to light the serpent and place it in doloress path as she was going up to bed but jasper was old enough to reply that he would have no concern with anything so low and snobbish as such a trick in fact there was in jaspers mind a decided line between bullying and teasing which did not exist as yet in wilfreds conscience  and altogether dolores was in a state of mind that made her stiff letters to her father betray low spirits and discontent  on sunday while waiting for the early dinner jasper and mysie happened to be together in the drawingroom and mysie took the opportunity of showing her brother the different cuttings of poetry the lines were smooth and some had a certain swing in them such as mysie with an unformed taste a love for miss hacket and amazement that the words of a familiar acquaintance of her own should appear in print genuinely admired but the eyes of a youth exercised in chaffing the productions of one of his fellow men were infinitely more critical besides what could be more shocking to the generals son than the confusion between the evening gun and the sham fight and mysie had been reduced to confusion for not detecting the faults and then pardoned in consideration of being only a girl by the time the gong summoned them to the sunday roast beef  the dinner over the female part of the family scampered headlong upstairs while harry repaired with his mother to her room to talk over a letter from his father respecting his plans on leaving oxford the other boys hung about the hall until gillian and dolores came down equipped for walking  hollo gill  all right  wheres mysie  well be off  mysie  mice  mouse  val  you must wait for them japs said gillian  they are having their dresses changed and dont you remember i always go to miss hackets  botheration  what for  you know very well  oh yes  to help her to write touching verses about the sweet dead dove with voice and plumage soft as love eh only gill im afraid your memory is failing if you dont know the evening gun from rifle practice  nonsense thats no concern of mine said gillian opening the front door very anxious to get dolores away from hearing anything worse  oh thats your modesty only such a conjunction could have produced such a scene that the evening star came up backwards to look at it  for shame jasper how in the world did you get hold of that  too sweet a thing not to meet with universal fame said jasper to whom it was exquisite fun to assume that gillian devoted her sunday afternoons to the concoction of such poetry with constance hacket and thus to revenge himself for his disgust and jealousy at having his favourite companion and  slave engrossed wilfred hopped about like an imp in ecstasy grinning in the face of dolores whom gillian longed to free from her tormentors the shout was welcome as mysie and valetta came tearing down the drive after them  japs  japs  oh we couldnt come before because nurse would make us take off our sunday serges come and let out the dogs mamma says we may see if there are any nice fir cones in the plantation to gild for the christmastree  and you wont come said jasper  the muses must meet  what a poem you will produce                   hear i a cannon or a rifle                  that is an unessential trifle   what nonsense boys do talk said gillian turning her back on them with regret for much as she loved her class she better loved a walk with jasper and here was dolores on her hands in a state of exasperation believing her to have broken her promise and muttering  you set him on  no indeed i never did  you know i promised  there are plenty of ways of getting out of a promise  speak for yourself dolores  there were ten minutes of offended silence and then gillian said this is nonsense  you may believe me i was sorry i laughed at the first verses you showed me and mamma said i ought not  we never spoke of it but miss hacket has been giving mamma all the poems and jasper must have got at them  dont you see  oh yes you say so said dolores sulkily  you dont believe me  you promised that your brothers should never hear of it  i promised for myself i couldnt promise for what was put into a newspaper and trumpeted all over the place said gillian really angry now  dolores could not deny this but she was hurt by the word trumpeted and besides her own slippery behaviour was weakening her trust in other peoples sincerity and she only gave a kind of grunt  but gillian recovering herself a little and remembering her mothers words proceeded to argue  besides it was me whom jasper meant to tease not you  i dont care which it was  he is as bad as the rest of them  gillian attempted no more conciliation and they arrived in silence at the casement cottages where constance was awaiting her friend in the greatest excitement for she had despatched the waif of the moorland to mr flinders in the course of the week and had received a letter from him in return saying that a personal interview with the gifted authoress would be desirable  and i do long to see him dont you darling  it is very hard that he should be kept away from me said dolores trying to stir up some tender feelings  that it is my poor sweet i thought whether he could come to me for a merely literary consultation without marys knowing anything further about it and then we could contrive for you to come down and meet him but there are so many horrid prejudices that i suppose it would not be safe  i dont see how i could come down here without the others  aunt lily wont let me come alone and though it is holiday time that is no good for those horrid boys are always about and i see that jasper is going to be worse even than wilfred  various ways and means were discussed but no excuse seemed available for either constances going to darminster or for mr flinders coming to silverton without exciting suspicion     chapter xi  secret expedition    the christmastree  oh mamma do let it be the christmastree  it is quite well  weve been to look at it  christmastrees have got so stale val said gillian  rot put in jasper  oh please please mamma implored valetta please let it be the dear old christmastree  you said i should choose because it will be my birthday  there is no need to whine val you shall have your tree  im so glad cried mysie  the dear old tree is best of all  i could never get tired of it if i lived to be a hundred years old  such are institutions said their mother  i never heard of a christmastree till i was twice your age  oh mamma  how dreadful  what did you do  i suppose it is all very well for you kids said jasper loftily putting his hands in his pockets  perhaps something may be found interesting eve to the high and mighty elders observed lady merrifield  oh what mamma  mamma of course only looked mysterious  and added val maynt we all go on a secret expedition and buy things for it  weve all been saving up added mysie and everybody knows every single thing in all the shop at silverton  besides added gillian the sconces will none of them hold and almost all the golden globes got smashed in coming from dublin and one of the birds has its head off and another has lost its spunglass tail and another its legs  a bird of paradise said lady merrifield laughing but wasnt there a tree at malta decked with no apparatus at all  yes but alley and phyl can do anything  i think we must ask aunt jane  there was a howl  oh please mamma dont let aunt jane get all the things  we do so want to choose  you impatient monsters  you havent heard me out and you dont deserve it  oh mamma i beg your pardon  oh mamma please  oh mamma pray cried the most impatient howlers dancing round her  what i was about to observe before the interruption by the honourable members was that we might perhaps ask aunt jane and aunt ada to receive at luncheon a party of caterers for this same tree  oh oh oh  how delicious  hooray  thats what i call jolly fun  and mamma added gillian perhaps we might let miss hacket join  i know she wants to get up something for a gfs class but mamma was attending to primrose and the brothers burst in  there goes gill spoiling it all exclaimed wilfred  thats always the way said jasper  girls must puzzle everything up with some philanthropic great fuss society dodge  i am sure jasper said gillian i dont see why it should spoil anything to make other people happy i thought we were told to make feasts not only for our own friends  gills getting just like old miss hacket said wilfred  or sweet constance put in jasper  shell be writing poems next  hush hush boys said lady merrifield  i do not mean to interfere with your pleasure but i had rather our discussions were not entirely selfish  suppose gillian we walked down to casement cottages and consulted miss hacket  this was done in the company of all the little girls for miss hackets cats doves and gingerbread were highly popular moreover dolores was glad of a chance sight of constance  my dear said lady merrifield as gillian walked beside her you must be satisfied with giving miss hacket the reversion of our tree and you and mysie can go and help her it will not do to make these kind of works a nuisance to your brothers  i did not think jasper would have been so selfish as to object said gillian almost tearfully  remember that boys have a very short time at home and cannot be expected to care for these things like those who work in them said lady merrifield  it will not make them do so to bore them and take away their sense of home and liberty at the same time they must not expect to have everything sacrificed to them and so i shall make jasper understand  you wont scold him mamma  cant you any of you trust me gill  oh mamma only i didnt want him to think i wouldnt do everything he liked except that i dont want him to be unkind about those poor girls  miss hacket was perfectly enraptured at the offer of the reversion of the christmastree and its trapping valettas birthday was on the 28th of december and the tree was to be lighted on the ensuing evening for gfs  moreover the party would go to rockstone as soon as an appointment could be made with miss mohun to make selections at a great german fancy shop recently opened there and in full glory and the hacket sisters were invited to join the party starting at a quarter to eight and returning at a few minutes after seven the element of darkness at each end only adding to the charm in the eyes of the children and valetta with a little leap repeated that it would be a real secret expedition  very secret indeed said her mother considering how many it is known to  yes but it is mamma for everybody has a secret from everybody  the words made constance and dolores look round with a start from their colloquy under the shade of the windowcurtains but no one was thinking of them  just as the plans were settled constance came forward saying lady merrifield may i have dear dolores to spend the day with me  we neithe of us wish to join your kind party to rockstone and we should so enjoy being together  i had much rather stay added dolores  very well said lady merrifield reflecting that her sisters would be grateful for the diminution of the party and that it would be easier to keep the peace without dolores  the defection was hailed with joy by her cousins though they were struck dumb at her extraordinary taste in not liking shopping  jasper did look rather small when his mother assured him in private he might have trusted her to see that he was not to be incommoded with gillians girls and he only observed in excuse for his murmurs that it made a man mad to see his sisters always off after some charity fad or other  always being a few hours once a week she said  just when one wants her  look here my boy she said you dont want your sisters to be selfish useless fine ladiesnever doing any one any good if they take up good works they cant drop them entirely to wait on you gillian does give up a great deal and it would be kinder to forbear a little and not treat all she does as an injury to yourself  i only meant to get a rise out of her  you are quite welcome to do that provided it is done in good nature gill is quite sound stuff enough to be laughed at  but i say my japs i should prefer your letting dolores alone she has not learned to be laughed at yet and has not come even to the stage for being taught to bear it  she looks fit to turn the cream sour observed jasper  i say mamma you dont want me to go on this shopping business do you  not by any means sir  happily the chance of a days rabbit shooting presented itself at a warren some miles off and harry undertook the care of wilfred who gave his word of honour to obey implicitly and take no liberties with the guns fergus would gladly have gone with them but he was still young enough to be sensible of the attractions of toyshops only primrose had to be left to the nursery and there was no need to waste pity on her for on such an occasion mrs halfpenny would relax her mood and lay herself out to be agreeable when she had exhausted her forebodings about her leddyship making herself ill for a week gaun rampaging about with all the bairns as if she was no better than one herself  i shall let miss mohun do most of the rampaging nurse but if it is fine will you take miss primrose into the town and let her choose her own cards  i have given her a florin and if you make the most of that for her she will be as happy as going with us  that i will my leddy  bairns is easy content when ye ken how to sort em  and nurse i believe there will be a box from sir jasper at the station  it may come home in the waggonette that takes us  will you and macrae get it safe into the storeroom for i dont want the children to see it too soon  there was nothing but satisfaction in the house on the morning of the expedition  the untimely candlelight breakfast was only a fresh element of delight and so was the paling gas at the station the round red sun peeping out through a yellow break between grey sky and greyer woods the meeting miss hacket in her fur cloak the taking of the tickets the coughing of the train the tumbling into one of the many empty carriages the triumphant startall seemed as fresh and delicious as if the young people had never taken a journey before in all their lives  the fog in the valleys the sleepy villages the halfroused stations all gave rise to exclamations and nothing was regretted but that the windows would get clouded over  even the waiting at the junction had its charms for it was enlivened by a supplementary breakfast on rolls and milk and at a few minutes past eleven the train was drawing up at rockstone and aunt jane sealskins and all was beckoning from the platform hurrying after the carriage as it swept past and holding out a hand to jump the party from the door  there she was ready to take them to the most charming and cheapest shops where the coins burning in those five pockets would go the furthest go in a cab  no i thank you it is far more delightful to walk  so mamma and miss hacket were stowed away in the despised vehicle to make the purchases that nobody cared about or which were to be unseen and unknown till the great day while aunt jane undertook to guide the young people through the town for her house was at the other end of it securing the christmascards on the way if nothin else  for though all the cards and gifts to mamma and a good many besides were of domestic manufacture some had to be purchased and she knew this wonderful woman where to get cards of former seasons at reduced prices to suit their youthful finances  considerable patience was requisite before all the choices were made and the balance cast between cards and presents and miss mohun got her quartette past all the shop windows to the seaside villa shut in by tamarisks which aunt adeline believed to be the only place that suited her health  mamma and miss hacket had already arrived and filled the little vestibule with parcels and boxes  then the early dinner  the aunts had anticipated their christmas turkey for that goodly company to help them eat it but afterwards there was only time for a mince pie all round for more than half the work remained to be done by all except mamma who would stay and rest with aunt ada having finished all that could not be deputed  however first she had a conference in private with aunt jane who undertook therein to come to silverton for valettas birthday and add astonishment and mystery sufficient to satisfy such of the public as were weary of christmastrees  she added however you will think i am always at you lily but did you know that flinders is living at darminster  no but it is five and twenty miles off and he has never troubled us  dont be too secure  he is in connection with that low paperthe politicianwhich methinks is the place where those remarkable poems of miss constances have appeared  is it not the way of poetry of that calibre to see the light in county papers  this seems to me of a lower calibre than is likely to get in without private interest  but to my certain knowledge the child has neither written to nor heard of the man all this time  you dont know what goes on with her bosom friend  i am certain miss hacket would connive at nothing underhand  besides i have never seen any thing sly or deceitful in poor dolores  she will not make friends with us that is all and that may be our fault  i only say look out you unsuspicious dame  now jenny satisfy my curiosity as to how you know all this  i am sure i never showed you those effusions  we have had trouble enough about them for the children cut them up in a way dolores has never forgiven  oh  miss hacket sent them to me to ask if mollsey to her babe and the canary might not be passed on to friendly leaves  and as to flinders when i went to the gfs conference at darminster i met the man full in the street and of course i inquired afterwards how he came there  so theres nothing preternatural about it  it is well you did not live two hundred years ago or you would certainly have been burnt for a witch  see what a witch i shall make on the 28th  but i hear those unfortunate children dancing and prancing with impatience on the stairs  i must go before they have driven ada distracted  what would the two aunts have said could they have seen dolores and constance at that moment partaking of the most elaborate meal the darminster refreshmentroom could supply at a little round marble table in company with mr flinders  they had not been obliged to start nearly so early as the other party as the journey was much shorter and with no change of line so they had quietly walked to the station by ten oclock arrived at darminster at halfpast eleven and have been met by the personage whom dolores recognized as uncle alfred constance was a little disappointed not to see something more distinguished and less flashy in style but he was so polite and complimentary and made such touching allusions to his misfortunes and his dear sister that she soon began to think him exceedingly interesting and pitied him greatly when he said he could not take them to his lodgingsthey were not fit for his niece or her friend who had done him a kindness for which he could never be sufficiently grateful in affording him a glimpse of his dear sisters child  it made dolores wince for she never could bear the mention of her mother it was like touching a wound and the old sensation of discomfort and dislike to her uncles company began to grow over her again now that she was not struggling against mohun opposition to her meeting him  he lionized them about the town but it was a foggy drizzly day one of those when the fringe of seacoast often enjoys finer weather than inland places the streets were very sloppy and dolores and constance did not do much beyond purchasing a few cards and some presents at a fancy shop as they had agreed to do to serve as an excuse for their expedition in case it could not be kept a secret and most of the visit was made in the waitingroom at the station or walking up and down the platform as to the grand point mr flinders told constance that her tale was talented and striking full of great excellence she might hope for success equal to ouidasbut that he had found it quite impossible to induce a publisher to accept a work by an unknown author unless she advanced something  he could guarantee the return but she must entrust him with thirty pounds  poor constance it was a fatal blow she had not thirty pounds in the world she doubted if she could raise the sum even by her sisters help  then mr flinders sighed and thought that if he represented the circumstances the firm might be content with twentynay even fifteen  constance cheered up a little she did think she could make up fifteen after the 21st when certain moneys became due which she shared with her sister  she would be left very bare all the springbut what was that to the return she was promised  only mr flinders impressed on her the necessity of secrecy even from her sistersince he said if he were once known to have obtained such terms for a young authoress he should be besieged for ever  but uncle alfred said dolores surely my father and mother and all the other people i have known did not pay to get their things published  my dear niece you speak as one who has been with persons of high and established famethe literary aristocracy in fact  the doors once opened miss hacket will like them make her own terms but such doors like many others are only to be opened by a silver key  there were other particulars which he talked over with the authoress in a promenade on the platform while dolores was left in the waitingroom but afterwards he indulged his niece with a teteatete asking her fathers address and mourning over the length of time it would take to obtain an answer from fiji  mr mohun had promised to help him solemnly and kindly promised for the sake of her whom they had both loved so much and here he was cut off and quite in extremity unfortunate as usual through his determined enemies a company in which he had shares had collapsed he was penniless till his salary from the politician became due in march  meanwhile he should be expelled from his lodging and brought to ruin if he could not raise a few poundseven one  dolores had nearly two pounds in her purse  her father had left her amply provided and she had not much opportunity of spending  she knew he had seen the gold when she was shopping and when she had paid for the refreshments which of course she had found she had to do with some hesitation she said if thirty shillings would be of any good to you  my dear generous child your dear mothers own daughter  it will be the saving of me temporarily  but among all your wealthy relatives surely considering your fathers promise you could obtain some advance until he can be communicated with  if he is still in new zealand we could telegraph and hear directly he did not know how long he should be there for the ship had something to be done to it  this did not suit mr flinders  such telegrams were very expensive and it was too uncertain whether mr mohun would be at auckland surely lady merrifield whose husband was shaking the pagoda tree would make an advance if she knew the circumstances  i dont think she would said dolores i dont think they are very rich  there is only one horse and one little pony and my cousins have such very tiny allowances  haughty and poor  stuck up and skimping  yes i understand  but i am not asking from her only an advance on your fathers promise which he would be certain to repay  yes quite certain  it is only a matter of time  it would save me at the present moment from utter ruin and destruction that would have broken your dear mothers heart  oh mary what i lost in you  then as perhaps he saw reflection on doloress face he added she is gone the only person who took an interest in me so it matters the less and when you hear again of your unhappy uncle you will know what drove him  if it was only an advancei have a cheque began dolores  if seven pounds would do you any good  it would be salvation he exclaimed  father left it with me pursued dolores considering in case professor muhlwasser went on with his great book of coloured plates of microscopic marine zoophytes and sent it in  i was to keep this and pay with it  oh  muhlwasser you need not trouble about him  i saw his death in the paper a month ago  then i really think i might send you the cheque and write to my father why i did so  ah dolly i knew that your mothers daughter could never desert me  more followed of the same kind tending to make dolores feel that she was doing a heroically generous thing and stifling the lurking sense in her mind that she had no right to dispose of her fathers money without his consent  the december day began to close in the gas was lighted constance was seen disconsolately peeping out at the waiting room door to see whether the private conference were over  they joined her again and mr flinders discoursed about the envy and jealousy of critics and success being only attained by getting into a certain clique till she began to look rather frightened but reassured by the voluble list of names and papers to which he assured her of recommendations  then he began to be complimentary and she to put on the silly tituppy kind of face and tone wherewith she had talked to the curates at the festival  dolores began to find this very dull and to feel neglected perhaps also cross and doubts came across her whether she might not get into a dreadful scrape about the money which she certainly had no right to dispose of  she at last broke in with uncle alfred are you quite sure professor muhlwasser is dead  bless your heart child hes as dead as harry the eighth said mr flinders in haste died at berlin of fatty degeneration of the heart well as i was saying miss constance  but uncle i was thinking  hush as a couple of ladies and a whole train of nurses and children invaded the waitingroom it wont do to talk of such little matters in public places you know  would you not like a cup of tea miss constance  will you allow me to be your cavalier  people were beginning to arrive in expectation of the coming train and talk was not possible in the throng at least mr flinders did not make it so  at last the train swept up and he was hurrying to find places for the ladies when there was a moments glimpse of a handsome moustached face at a smokingcarriage window  dolores started and had almost exclaimed uncle reginald but before the words were out of her mouth mr flinders had drawn her on swiftly among all the numbers of people getting out and getting in hurled her into a distant carriage handed constance in after her and muttering something about forgetting an appointment he vanished without any of the arrangements about footwarmers that he had promised  uncle reginald again exclaimed dolores i am sure it was he  oh dear  what an escape answered constance breathless with surprise and settling herself with disgust and difficulty next to a fat old farmer as three or four more people entered and jammed them close together  who is he she presently whispered  colonel mohun  his regiment is at galway  i know he talked of getting over this winter if he possibly could but aunt lily went away before the post was come in  we shall have to take great care when we get out  here the train started and conversation in undertones became impossible more especially as two of the farmers in the carriage were coming back from the smithfield cattle show and were discussing the prize oxen with all their might  it was very stuffy and close constance looked ineffably fastidious and uncomfortable and dolores gazed at the clouded window and dull little lamp overhead put in to enliven the deepening twilight  this avoiding of uncle reginald brought more before her mind a sense of wrongdoing than anything that had gone before  she was fond of this uncle who always made her fathers house his headquarters when in london and used to play with her when she was a small child and always to take her to the zoological gardens till she declared she was too old to care for such a childish show and then he and her father both laughed at her so much that she would never have forgiven anybody else and she found he enjoyed it for his own sake far more than she did  however he always did take her out for walks and sights that were sure to be amusing with him  father too was quite bright and alive when he was in the house and thus dolores had nothing but pleasant associations connected with this uncle and had heard of the chances of his coming like a ray of light though without much hope since the state of ireland had prevented him from being able even to run over to take leave of her father  and now he was come she must hide from him like a guilty thing  there was no spirit of opposition against him in her mind and thus she could feel that she was doing something sad and strange moreover she began to feel that her promise about the cheque had been a rash one and the echo of her fathers voice came back on her saying surely mary you know better than to believe a word out of flinderss mouth  but then she thought of her mothers rare tears glistening in her eyes and the answer poor alfred  i cannot give him up  everything has been against him  it was quite dark before silverton was reached at halfpast five with three quarters of an hour to spare before the other travellers were expected  most of their fellow passengers had got out at previous stations so that constance was able to open the door and jump out so perilously before the train had quite stopped that a porter caught her with a sharp word of reproof  she grasped doloress hand and scudded across the platform giving the return tickets almost before the collector was ready  a cautious guard even exclaimed whats those two young women up to but was answered at once theyre all right thats nought but one of the old parsons daughters as have been out with a return to darminster  a sweetheartin demanded one of the bystanders and there was a laugh  constance heard the tones and vulgar laugh though not the words and she was in such a panic as she hurried down the steps that she did not stop to look out for a cab the place was small and they were not very plentiful at any time and she was mortally afraid though she hardly knew why of being overtaken and questioned by colonel mohun who might know his niece though he would not know her but dolores was tired and had a headache and did not at all like the walk in the dirt and fog and dark after turning from the gas lit station  we were to have a cab constance  we cant was the answer still hurrying on  he would come out upon us  he is much more likely to overtake us this way said dolores thinking of her uncles long strides  well we cant turn back now said constance getting almost into a run which lasted till they were past the paddock gate  dolores panting to keep up with her had half a mind to turn up there and go straight home but there might be any number of oxen in the way and almost worse she might meet jasper and wilfred or if uncle reginald overtook her what would he think  the pair slackened their pace a little when they had satisfied themselves that the break in the dark hedge beside them was the gate they heard wheels and presently saw the lamps of a cab bearing down halt at the gate they had left behind and turn in  we should have been off first said dolores  if we could have got a cab in time  one can always get cabs  oh no not at all for certain  this is a nasty stupid outoftheway place said dolores wanting to say something cross  it isnt a vulgar place full of traffic returned constance equally cross  well i never meant to walk home in this way  im sure my feet are wet  i wish i had waited and gone with uncle regie  now dolly what do you mean you would not have it all betrayed  ive a great mind to tell uncle regie all about it  now dolly  when you said so much about the mohun pride and scorn of your poor dear uncle  uncle regie is not proud  and he would know what to do  but cried constance in a fright you would never tell him  you promised that it should be a secret and i should be in such a dreadful scrape with lady merrifield and mary  well it was your doing and you had all the pleasure of it flourishing about the platform with him  how can you be so disagreeable dolores when you know it was all on business though i do think he is the most interesting man i ever did see  just because he flattered you  however there is no need to tell how many cross and quarrelsome things the two tired friends said to each other  they were sitting on opposite sides of the fire one very gloomy and the other very pettish when the waggonette stopped at the gate to put out miss hacket and take up dolores  hands pulled her up the step and a hubbub of merry voices received her in the dark  good girl not to keep us waiting  oh dolly dolly macrae says uncle regies come  oh dolly it has been such fun  take care of my parcel  ah ha you dont know what is in there  heres something under my feet  oh take care  tisnt my  hush hush val  and so it went on till on the steps was seen in full light among the boys uncle reginald ready to lift every one out with a kiss  ha  dolly is that you he said as they came into the hall  i saw such a likeness of you at one station that i was as near as possible jumping out to speak to her  she had on just that fur tippet  that comes of living in ireland regie said aunt lily  once in a shop at belfast a lady darted up to me with and its i that am glad to see you me dear  and hows me sweet little goddaughter  oh and it isnt yourself  and arent you mrs phelim oshaugnessy  and under cover of this dolores retreated to her own room  she took off her things and then looked at the cheque  professor muhlwasser was a clever german always at work on science counting in the most minute and accurate manner such details as the rays in a sea anemones tentacles or the eggs in a shrimps roe  he was engaged on a huge book in numbers of which mr maurice mohun had promised to take two copiesbut whereas extravagances upon peculiar hobbies were apt not to be tolerated in the family and it was really uncertain whether the work would ever be completed mr mohun had preferred leaving a cheque for the payment in his little daughters hand rather than entrust it to one of the brothers who would have howled and growled at such a waste of good money on such a subject thus he had told dolores to back the draft get it changed and send the amount by a postal order to germany if the books and account should come which he thought very doubtful  and now the professor was dead dolores looked at the cheque and supposed she could do as she pleased with it  mother helped uncle alfred  yes but mother earned all she sent him herself  perhaps he would not ask again  how much more he had talked to constance than to herself  dolly wished she had not seen him to get into this difficulty  she was tired cold and damp  oh if she had never gone and not been half caught by uncle regie     chapter xii  a hunt    dolores was glad to recollect when she awoke that uncle reginald was in the house  it was as if she had a friend of her own there who might enter into all the illusage she suffered and whom she could even consult about uncle alfred so far as she could do so without disclosing all the underhand correspondence  she called doing so betraying constance but in truth she shrank more from shocking him with what he might think very wrongsince after all he belonged to that hardhearted generation of grownup people who had no feeling nor understanding of ones troubles  as she went downstairs she was aware of an increasing hubbub and frequently looking over the balusters perceived the top of primroses wavy head above the closecropped one of uncle regie as with her mounted on his shoulder he careered round the hall with a pack of others vociferating behind him  there was a lull for lady merrifield came out of her room just as dolores had paused primrose was put down the morning salutations took place and dolores had her full share of them  she was even allowed to sit next her uncle at breakfast but her rasher of bacon had not been half eaten before she had perceived that as to possessing him as she used to do at home he was just as much everybody elses uncle regie as hers for during the time of their being stationed at belfast he had been so often with them that he was quite established as the prince of playfellows  uncle regie will you have a crack at the rabbits tomorrow  brown said we might have a day and we have been keeping it for you  uncle regie the hounds meet at the bugle this morning wont you come and see them throw off  oh let me come too  and me  and me  my dear children exclaimed their mother i cant have the whole tribe of little ones and girls going galloping after your uncle  you will only hinder him  no no lily the more merrifields the merrier the field  ill drill them well  how far off is this bugle  not two miles over furzy common  oh not so far hal  thats nothing  who is coming  a general outbreak of mes ensued but mamma laid an embargo on primrose who must stay at home and help her while gillian looked wistful and doubtful knowing that more efficient help than the little ones might be desirable  you had better go my dear said her mother if you are not tired i dont like to send mysie and val without some one to turn back with them if your uncle and the boys want to go further  but whereas it was not nearly time to start uncle reginald was dragged down to inspect all the live stock in the stableyard at their feedingtime and went off with val and primrose clinging to his hands and the general rabble surrounding him  nothing could have been more alien to doloress taste than going out to a meet on foot through mud and mireshe who hated the being driven out to take a constitutional walk on the gravel road or the paved path but she had some hope that while all the others ran off madly as was their wont she might secure a little rational conversation with uncle reginald  so she came down in hat and ulster and was rewarded with thats right doll im glad to see they have taught you to take country walks  it is all compliment to you uncle regie said gillian  she hates them generally  are we all ready  where are japs and will  gone to shut up the dogs and hal is not coming  beneath his dignity eh  i think he has some reading to do said gillian  now mind reginald said aunt lily coming on the scene you are not to let those imps drag you farther than you like  it is a very different thing remember children from going out with the hounds like a gentleman  yes mamma returned fergus  if you would only let me have the pony  and send home the girls as soon as you find them in the way she added  all right answered he and off plunged the party but dolores soon found that she was not to be allowed much of uncle reginalds exclusive society  he did begin talking to her about her fathers voyage last letters and intended departure from auckland but valetta kept fast hold of his other hand and the others were all round every moment pointing out somethingto them noticeableand telling the story of some exploit delighted when their uncle capped it with some boyish tales of beechcroft or with some droll irish story  with such talk the strong healthy young folk little heeded the surface mud or the lanes  even dolores when she heard her fathers name in the reminiscences was interested for a time and was always hoping that the others would fly off and leave her to her uncle but she was much less used to country mud and stout boots than the others and she had been very much tired by her expedition on the previous day so that she had begun to find the way very long before they came out on an open green with a few cottages standing a good way back in their gardens and as their centre one of the great old coaching inns of past days now chiefly farmhouse though a sign bearing a golden buglehorn upon a blue ground stood aloft in front of it over the heads of the speckled mass of tan black and white pervaded with curved tails over which the scarletcoated whips kept guard while shining horses bearing red coats and black coats boys and a few ladies were moving about and carriages drew up from time to time  there was a long standing about and colonel mohun being a stranger there himself kept his flock on the outskirts only jasper plunging in at sight of a mounted schoolfellow while gillian and mysie told the names of the few they recognized  at last there was a move and jasper came back to point out the wood they were going to draw close at hand should they not all go on and see it  oh let us do come uncle regie cried mysie and val  look here gill said the uncle this child doesnt look fit to go any farther  im very tired and so cold said dolores  yes said gillian we ought to go home now  not me not me cried the other two girls uncle regie will take care of us  i think you must come said gillian mamma said you had better come home when i do  yes said wilfred we dont want a pack of girls to go and get tired  we shall go into all sorts of places not fit for you said jasper you wouldnt come back with a whole petticoat among you  and val would be left stodged in a ditch for a month of sundays added wilfred  i am afraid we had better part company gill said the colonel  i would take you on a little further but this poor little londoner wont have a leg to stand upon by the time she gets home  more shame for her to come out to spoil our fun muttered valetta too low for her uncle to hear  mamma will think we have gone quite far enough thank you uncle said the sage gillian and i think fergus had better come too  that he had said jasper  fancy him over peat hill  hell be left behind to be picked up as we come back said wilfred  no no no  i can keep up better than you can wil  take me uncle regie  the little boy was so near a howl that goodnatured colonel mohuns heart was touched and he consented to let him come on though jasper argued youll have to carry him uncle  no ill make you master  tell your mother not to wait luncheon for us gillian well pick up something somewhere  hurrah cried wilfred and fergus to whom this was an immense additional pleasure  the girls turned away into the lane valetta indulging in an outrageous grumble  why should dolores have come out to spoil everything  dolores did not speak  just our one chance sighed mysie and perhaps we should have seen the fox  we may do that yet said gillian he may come this way  i dont care if he does said valetta  i wanted to see them draw the copse  i believe dolores did it on purpose to spoil our pleasure  dont be so cross val said mysie  she cant help being tired  why did she come then when nobody wanted her  for shame val said gillian you know mamma would be very angry to hear you say anything so unkind  its quite true though muttered valetta  never mind dolly dear said mysie shocked  val doesnt really mean it you know  yes she does said dolores shaking her comforter off you all do i wish i had never come here  mysie tried in her own persevering way to argue again that val was only put out and disappointed at having to turn back to which valetta in spite of gillians endeavour to silence her added so stupid of her to come out  what did she do it for  dolores who hardly ever cried was tired into crying now  you grudge me everything you wouldnt let me speak one single word to uncle regie and kept bothering about  ill never do anything with you again  i wont  did you want to speak to uncle regie asked mysie  to be sure i did  he is my uncle that i knew ever so long before you did and you never let him speak to me  mrs halfpenny always put us on the high chair with our faces to the wall when we were jealous remarked valetta  but did you want to say anything to him in particular said mysie revolving means of contriving a private interview  thats no business of yours  i wish you would let me alone broke out dolores in a fretful fright lest any one should guess that she had anything on her mind  to make up stories of us of course growled valetta but gillian here interposed declaring with authority that if she heard another word before they reached the paddock gate she should certainly tell mother how disgracefully they had been behaving  when gillian said such things she kept her word  besides by way of precaution she marched down the muddy middle of the road with dolores limping along the footpath on one side and val as far off as possible on the border of the ditch on the other the more inoffensive mysie keeping by her side  they were all weary and dolores was very footsore also by the time they reached home at the very moment that the two misses hacket appeared coming up the drive  lady merrifield having the day before invited the elder as the purchases needed to be looked over and preparations set in hand and she did not then know that her brother was coming  dolores scarcely knew whether she was glad to see constance she had many doubts and qualms about that cheque  and if she had spent any quiet time alone with her uncle she might have laid enough of her trouble before him to get some advice or help but to ask for an interview especially when everybody thought it was to make complaints was too uncomfortable and alarming and she was inclined to escape from thought of the whole subject altogether by taking action quickly  gillian gave her uncles message about not waiting the dirty boots were taken off in the hall and constance followed her friend up to her room to take off her things  dolores sat on the side of her bed too much tired at first to be willing to move constances pity elicited tears and that they had all been so very unkind to her they were angry at her getting tired and they were jealous of her even speaking to uncle regie  again this alarmed constance you werent going to tell him about mr flinders you know you promised  he knows about him already and he would tell me what to do  oh but that would never do darling dolly  you told me all the family were hard and unjust and he would tell lady merrifield and we should never be allowed to see each other again  and only think of my poor little secret  i didnt think you would have turned from your poor relation in misfortune for the sake of this grand colonel  the end of it was that just as the gong was sounding dolores handed over to constance an envelope directed to mr flinders and containing mr maurice mohuns cheque  it was off her mind now she thought as she shuffled down to dinner lookup so pale and uneasy that her aunt made her have a glass of wine and some gravy soup to begin with and when dinner was over turned all the parcels off the schoolroom sofa and made her lie upon it during the grand unpacking which was almost as charming as the purchasing perhaps more so since there was no comparison with costlier articles  there was not very much time  this was friday and christmas day was on monday so there were only two more clear weekdays before the birthday and miss hacket would be churchdecorating on the morrow but lady merrifield would not send her daughters to help as there were plenty of hands without them and they were too young to trust in a mixed set who were not always sure to be reverent  dinner had rested and refreshed them they rejoiced in the absence of the mankind and primrose was sent out for her walk while the numerous boxes and packages were opened and displayed sconces and tapers gilt balls and glass birds oranges and bonbons disguised in every imaginable fashion there was a double set of the tapers and two relays of devices in sweets for the benefit of the party of the second night a list of whom miss hacket had brought that heads might be counted and any deficiency supplied in time through aunt jane  for lady merrifield had commissioned gillian to lay inunknown to the good ladya stock of such treasures as are valuable indeed to the little maid shell pincushions cinderella slippers holding thimbles cases of hairpins queer housewives and the like things wonderfully pretty for the price and which filled the kind heart of miss hacket with rapture and gratitude at such brilliant additions to her own homemade contrivances in the way of cuffs comforters and illuminated workbags all beautifully neat i though it was hard to persuade her of what lady merrifield averred that such things ought to be far more precious than brilliant shopbought readymade ware with no loveseed in it  it is very hard she said how fancy shops try to spoil all one used to be able to do for ones friends  the purses and the penwipers and the needlecases that were ones choicest presents in my youth are all turned out now smart and tight and fashioned but without a scrap of the honest old labour and love that went into them  but papa and mamma do care still cried gillian papa never will have any purse but the long ones mamma nets for him  and mamma always will have the old brown and blue carriagebag that aunt phyllis worked chimed in mysie though claude did say he would throw it into the sea when we crossed from dublin for it looked like an old housekeepers  claude was in a superfine condition thenin awe of an old sandhurst comrade  he would be gild enough to see the old brown bag now poor fellow said lady merrifield tenderly  so it went on with merry chat and a good deal of real preparation till the early darkness came on and a great noise in the haul announced the return of the boys among whom lady merrifield still classed her colonel brother  they were muddy up to the eyes but they had seen a great deal more than was easy to understand in their incoherent accounts  wilfed had rolled into a wet ditch and been picked out by his uncle and hung up to dry at a little village inn wherethis seemed to have been the supreme glorythey had made a meal on pigsliver and breadandcheese before plodding home againlosing their way under wilfreds confident pilotagefinding themselves five miles from homegetting a cast in a cart for the two little boys just as fergus was almost ready to crycolonel mohun and jasper walking alongside of the carter for two miles and conversing in a friendly manner though the man said he knew the soldier by his step and thought it was a pooltrade  finally he directed them by a short cut which proved to be through a lane of clay and pools of such an adhesive nature that fergus had to be pulled out step by step by main force by his uncle who deposited him on some stones at the other end and then came back to assist the struggles of wilfred who was slowly proceeding with jaspers help  and thats the way we make you spend your christmas holiday regie said lady merrifield  never mind lily mud was a congenial element to us both in old times you know so no wonder your brood take to it like ducks or hippopotamuses  i say we ought to have come in by the rear  couldnt that imp of a buttons of yours come and scrape us before we go upstairs  you are certainly grown older regie  you never would have thought of that once  no more would you lilyso do yourself justice  however when five oclock tea was spread in the drawingroom and the hacket ladies came in constance beheld such a splendid vision of a fine fair though sunburnt face long light moustaches and tall figure that she instantly assumed her most affected graces and did not wonder the less that the mohuns were all so very high  doloress strong desire for a private interview with her uncle died away when constance carried off the cheque  she knew he would tell her she had no right to give it and she did not want to be told so nor to have any special inquiries made she was not sorry that an invitation from a neighbour kept him and hal out shooting all saturday and on the other hand she so far shrank from constances talk about mr flinders as not to be vexed that it was too wet on sunday afternoon for any going down to casement cottages  it was on that wet afternoon however that uncle reginald crossing the hall for once without his tail of followers saw her slowly dragging downstairs with a book in her hand  well miss doll he said you dont look very jolly  whats the matter  nothing uncle regie  i dont believe in nothing  here sitting down on the stairs with an arm round her tell me all about it dolly we are old chums you know  have you got into a row  oh no  is there anything i can put straight  no thank you uncle regie  theres something amiss said the goodnatured puzzled uncle  what is it  i should have thought you would have got on with these young folks likelike a house on fire  thats all you know about it thought dolly  what she said was one never does  i dont understand that generalization answered her uncle then as she did not answer he added i am sure your aunt lily is very anxious to make you happy  have you anything to complain of  no said dolores i dont complain of anything  she was thinking of valettas notion that she wanted to make up stories of them and therefore she said it in a manner which conveyed that she had a good deal to complain of if she would though really she would have been a good deal puzzled to produce a grievance that a man like uncle reginald would understand though she had plenty for sympathy like constances  however it was not to be expected that a private conference should last long in that house and mysie appeared at that moment looking for her cousin to say that mamma was ready for her  dolores went off with more alacrity than usual and uncle reginald beckoned up his other niece and observed i say mysie whats the matter with dolly  she is always like that uncle answered mysie  dont you hit it off with her then  i cant uncle said mysie looking up with a sudden wink now and then to stop her tears  i thought we should have been such friends but she wont let me  i didnt mean to be stupid and disagreeable like the girls in ashenden schoolroom but she doesnt care for anybody but miss constance and maude sefton  i hope you are all very kind to her said uncle reginald rather wistfully  we try said mysie who was not going to betray wilfred and valetta and could honestly say so of herself and gillian  and there again came an interruption in the shape of gillian  mysie mamma says we may finish up our sacred illuminated cards for it will be sunday work  oh jolly cried mysie jumping up  and will you give me one rub of your real good carmine gillyflower dear  and of my ultramarine too responded gillian wherewith the two sisters disappeared radiant with goodwill and gratitude while poor uncle reginald who had intended to devote this wet sunday afternoon to writing to his brother that dolores was perfectly happy and thriving in lilys care and like a sister to his other favourite mysie remained disappointed and perplexed wondering whether the poor little maiden were homesick or whether no children could be depended on for kindness when out of sight and deciding that he should defer his letter till he had seen a little more and talked to his sister jane who could see through a milestone any day  it was understood that mamma preferred homemade cards to bought ones so there was always a great manufacture of them in the weeks previous to christmas the comparative failures being exchanged among the younger members  the presents were always reserved for valettas birthday and the tree and this rendered the circulation of the cards doubly interesting in the immediate family alone there were thirteen times thirteen besides those coming from and going to outsiders so that it was as well that a good many should be of domestic manufacture either with pencil and brush or of tiny leaves carefully dried and gummed  and mamma had kept an album with names and dates into which all these home efforts were inserted and nothing else  this years series began with a little chestnut curl of primroses hair fastened down on a card by gillian and rose to a beautiful drawing of a blue indian lotus lily with a gorgeous dragonfly on it sent by alethea  the indian party had sent a card for every onethe girls beautiful drawings of birds insects and scenery the brother a bundle of ricepaper figured with costumes and papa some clever penandink outlines of odd figures which his daughters beguiled from him in his leisure moments  as to the home circle it is enough to say that their performances were highly satisfactory to the makers and were rewarded by mammas kisses and the text or verse she had secretly illuminated for each  she had no time to do more and the series were infinitely prized and laid up as treasures  there were plenty of ornamental cards from without to be admired the brighton and beechcroft aunts the stokesley cousins and whole multitudes of friends pouring them in as usual so that the entire review seemed to occupy all those free moments of the christmas day when the young folks were neither at church nor at meals nor singing carols themselves nor hearing the choir sing in the hall nor looking over photograph books and hearing old family stories this last occupation was received in the family as the regular evening pleasure ending in all singing when shepherds watch their flocks by night  dolores had a card from her aunt and each of her cousins besides one of the parcel uncle reginald had brought  she did not think enough of the very bad drawing and smeared painting of the ambitious attempts she received to feel at all disconcerted at having no reciprocity to offer  the only cards she had sent were to constance hacket to fraulein and to maude seftonthe last with a sore sense of the long interval since she had heard  however there was a card from maude but it was a very poor one looking very much like a last years possession and the letter was not much better being chiefly an apology for having been too busy to write  maude was going to lectures with nona stylesnona was such a darling girland breaking off because she was wanted to rehearse cinderella with this same darling nona  it made doloress heart go down farther though there was a beautiful and unexpected card from mrs sefton one from her former servant caroline also from fraulein and three or four from old friends of her mother who had remembered the solitary girl  in truth she had more beautiful ones than anybody else but she kept these in their envelopes and showed herself so much averse to free fingering and admiration of them that lady merrifield had to call off valetta remind her that her cousin had a right to her own cards and hear in return that dolores was so cross  dolly said uncle reginald in a low voice since he was permitted to look over the cards with her i think i have found out part of your troubles  she looked at him in alarm  he put his finger on a card bearing the words goodwill to men  umph said she  i dont want everything of mine messed and spoilt  and as his eye fell on ferguss cards he felt there was reason in what she said  aunt lily had taken her for a quarter of an hour that morning trying to infuse the real thought underlying the joy that makes it christmas not only yuletide  but it all fell flatit was all lessons to her imposed on her on a day that she had not been used to see made what she called goody  last year her father had shut himself up after church and she had spent the evening in noisy mirth with the seftons     chapter xiii  an egyptian sphynx    aunt adeline was afraid of winter journeys as well as of the tumultuous festivities of silverton so at twelve oclock  colonel mohun drove the ponycarriage to meet the little trim brownie who stepped out of the station the porter carrying behind her a huge thing long and swathed in brown paper  it is quite light it wont hurt she said it must go with us  put your legs across it regie  thats right  then what becomes of yours  mine can go anywhere said miss mohun crumpling herself up in some mysterious manner under the fur rug while they drove off her luggage sticking far off on either side of the splashboard  what in the name of wonder are you smuggling in there  if you must know it is the body of a mummy over whose dissection you will have to assist  ah  rotherwood is coming  rotherwood  and his little girl  just like him  lily gets a note this morning from london telling her to telegraph if she cant have them by the 520 train  ive just been ordering a fly  it seems that lady rotherwood going to meet ivinghoe at the station coming from school found he had measles coming out  so they packed off his sister to beechcroft without having seen him and thence rotherwood took her to london  and is having a fine frolic with her no doubt but he might as well have given lily more notice considering that a marquess or two makes more difference to her household than it does to his  oh she is glad enough only in some trepidation as to how mrs halfpenny may receive the unspecified maid that the child may bring  how jolly we shall be i wish ada had come  i tried to drag her out but it gets harder and harder to shake her up  you must come back with me and see her  i say jane have you seen maurices child lately  not very  she wouldnt come with the others last week  what do you think about her  i thought leaving her with lily would have been the making of her  indeed i told maurice there could not be a better brought up set anywhere than the merrifields and that lily would mother her like one of her own and now i find her moping about looking regularly down in the mouth  i got hold of her one day and tried to find out what was the matter but she only said she would not complain can they bully her  ill tell you what maurice lily is a great deal too kind to her she has a kind of temper that wont let them make friends with her  come now she was a nice jolly little girl at home she and i have had no end of larks together and it is hard to blame her for fretting after her home poor childaye i know you never liked her or she might have done better with you and ada than turned in among a lot of imps  im thankful it was otherwise  now do jane set your mind to it dont be prejudiced but make those sharp eyes of some use i really feel bound to give maurice an account of dolly and tell him what is best for her  i believe said jane that there is some counterinfluence at work and i am trying to find it out but after all i believe patience is the only thing and that lily will conquer her if nobody meddles  tis not lily i am afraid of but her children  nonsense regie one would think you had never been turned loose into school to be licked into shape  she is a girl not a cub like me  a worse cub for she has not your temper sir and moreover you had had the wholesome discipline of a large family besides nobody teases but wilfred gillian and mysie behave like angels to the tiresome puss  well im bound to believe you jenny but i dont like the looks of it  aunt janes mysterious parcel was greeted rapturously and conveyed into the diningroom which had a semicircular end filled with glass and capable of being shut off with heavy curtains when the season made snugness desirable this bay had been set apart from the first for her operations the tree whose second season it was having been taken up and already erected in the centre of the room not much the worse for last years excursion for if rather stunted that was all the better no one was excluded from the decoration thereof since that was the best part of the sport to those too old for the mysteryand yet young enough to fasten sconces where their candles would infallibly set fire to the twigs above them the only defaulters were jasper who had preferred going down to the meadows with his gun and dolores who had retired to the drawingroom with a book on having a paper star removed from immediate risk of conflagration they were determined not to let her help she said  so she only emerged when the workers halted for a merry hurried meal in the schoolroom where jasper appeared very late very cross at having had to make himself fit to be seen and likewise at having brought home no spoil the snipes having been so malicious as to escape him having sallied forth before the post came in it was only now that it broke on him that visitors were expected and he did not like it at all  i thought we had got rid of a11 the enemy he growled at his end of the table  thats what he calls constance thought dolores  polite observed gillian  this will be worse still being lord and ladies grumbled on jasper i hate swells  oh but these arent like horrid common fine lords and ladies cried mysie why you know all mammas old stories about the fun they had with cousin rotherwood  whats the good of that  thats a hundred years ago  hell just make mamma and uncle regie of no good at all and then theres a girl too in a tone of inconceivable disgust  i dont want strange girlsan awful stuckup swell of a londoner not able to do anything  i wish i had gone to spend christmas with bruce  i would if i had known it was to be like this  the speech brought mysie to the verge of tears  aunt janes sharp ears heard it and she looked at the head of the table expecting to hear a rebuke but lady merrifield turned a deaf ear on that side  only after the meal she called her son jasper she said i want to send a note to redford if you like to ride over with it  you need not come home till eight oclock if it is moonlight it the boys are disengaged and if you do really wish to keep out of the way  jaspers eyes fell under hers  mamma i dont want that  only you said more than you meant japs if it relieves your mind it hurts other people but i do want the note taken so go and come back in time for the sports which i dont think you will find much damaged  meantime aunt jane had ensconced herself behind the curtains where she admitted no one but miss vincent and uncle reginald and in process of time mamma and macrae the others were still fully employed in garnishing the tree though it was only to bear lights ornaments and sweets all solid articles had been for some time past committed to a huge box or ottoman the veteran companion of the family travels which stood in the centre of the bay into its capacious interior everybody had been dropping parcels of various sizes and shapes with addresses in all sorts of hands which were to find their destination on this great evening  this was part of the mystery that kept mysie and valetta in one continual dance and caper it was all they could do not to peep between the curtains when the privileged mortals went in and out bearing all sorts of mysterious loads well covered up from all eyes  wilfred did make one attempt but something extraordinary snapped at his nose with a sharp crack and drove him back with a start  a lamp had been taken thither and there really was nothing more to do to the tree the scraps of packing had been picked up and the hands tingling from firneedle pricks had been washed though not without protest from valetta that it wasnt worth while and from wilfred that it was all along of these horrid swells  the sound of wheels summoned lady merrifield and her brother from the place of mystery and they were in the hall when a fresh gust of keen air came in from the door an ulstered figure hurried in and something small and furred was put into the ladys embrace  heres my fly lily look fly here they all areall the cousins off with the hat let us see your funny little face  it was a funny little smiling face set in short light wavy hair not exactly pretty but with a bright quaint confiding look as if used to be shown off by her father and ready to make friends on the spot and how is your boy as the round of greetings was completed and the wraps thrown off  going on capitally better than he deserves the young scamp for suppressing all symptoms for fear he should be hindered from coming home his mother was in a proper fright she showed him to the doctor on the way who told her to put him to bed at once and send his sister out of the house she never set eyes on him or i would not have brought her here  i am exceedingly glad you have said lady merrifield bending for another kiss  and lily ive done another awful thing victoria kept old nurse to help with ivinghoe and we brought the swiss bonne louise away with us but the poor thing found her sister very ill in london and i hadnt the heart to bring her away so phyllis said she would do for herself if your maid or some of them would have an eye to her  there im doubly glad rotherwood if i had any fears it was not of you or phyllis but that like vich ian vhor she should have her tail on and oh rotherwood do you know what you are in for  high jinks of some sort ive no doubt we picked up a couple of boxes at gunters and millers with a view thereto who is master of the revels  jane shes too deep in preparations to come forth at present gillian will you take phyllis to the nursery and take care of her we are to have a very high tea at halfpast six but rotherwood i promise that another day you shall have a respectable dinner in this house  return to the prose of life eh lily well fly what do you think of it  oh daddy arent you glad we came she cried dancing off in gillians wake arminarm with mysie and valetta while he called after her find the boxes and make them over to the right quarter  this was enough to make the whole bevy of children rush away and only the three elders remained lord rotherwood said this is short notice lily but i did not know reginald was here and i thought you might want help dont be frightened only a queer thing has happened i went to ws bank yesterday i thought they looked at me as if something was up and byandby one of the partners came and took me into his private room  there he showed me a cheque and asked my opinion whether the writing was maurices and i should say it decidedly was but it was actually for seventy pounds payable to order of miss dolores m mohun  seventy  yes and dated the 19th of august  just before maurice went  there was a sudden silence for the door opened but it was to admit miss mohun who began oh rotherwood you are too munificent why whats the matter lady merrifield hastily explained as far as she yet understood what had brought him  how did they get the cheque she asked  sent up from the country bank where it had been casheddarminster  ah came from both the aunts  lord rotherwood went on they asked me who miss dolores mohun was and i could do no otherwise than tell them and likewise where to find her but i explained that she is a mere child and i told them i would come down here so i hope you will have as little annoyance as possible  it is very good of you rotherwood but i cant understand it at all was her name on the back  certainly i told them i thought the whole thing must be a well got up forgery and a confidential clerk was to go down today to darminster to try to find out who gave it in there  darminster flinders ejaculated miss mohun  regie exclaimed lady merrifield what did you say about having seen some one like dolores at darminster station  i was nearly jumping out after her i should have said it was herself if it had not been impossible why she was with you at rockstone and it was a pouring dripping day said the colonel  no she was not she begged to spend the day with constance hacket and we picked her up as we came home poor child what has she been doing i have not looked after her properly  but need she have had anything to do with it said colonel mohun how should a cheque of maurices come into her possession  she did tell me said lady merrifield that her father had left one with her to pay for some german scientific book that might be sent for him  i see then cried miss mohun that wretch flinders must have got into communication with her and induced her to fill up her fathers cheque for him  but why should it be flinders said lord rotherwood  jane found out that he is living at darminster and has been trying to put me on my guard returned lady merrifield  it is all that fellow flinders depend upon it said colonel mohun he is quite capable of it and youll find poor dolly has nothing to do with it quite preposterous and look here lily let the poor child alone to enjoy herself tonight most likely rotherwoods clerk or detective or whatever he may be will have ferreted out the rights of the matter at darminster i sincerely hope he will and have flinders in custody and then you would have upset her and accused her all for nothing  i am glad you think so regie said lady merrifield i am thankful enough to wait and hope it will be explained without spoiling the childrens evening  all right said the visitor i only hope i have not spoilt yours  oh one learns to throw things off i shall believe it is all flinders and none of it the childs said lady merrifield carefully avoiding a glance that could show her any gesture of dissent on the part of her sister and only looking up for her brothers nod of approval besides how foolish it would be to worry myself when i have two such protectors it was very good in you rotherwood i only hope we shall take good care of your fly and that her mother will be satisfied about her  she knew the little woman and i should have a lark together said he the governess was safe out of reach holidaymaking so i could have her all to myself victoria suggested her brothers and we must go there before we have done but business and the pantomime by good luck took us to london first so when i wrote to you from the bank i also let her know that i was obliged to take the little woman down here first i couldnt take her to high court till louise is available again  so much the better im sure  and what i was going to say is that rotherwood has been startlingly munificent and splendid said aunt jane we shall have a set of new surprises  i dont in the least know what i brought i only told each of them to put up such a box as they sent out for christmas concerns do precisely what you please with them  come and see lily for i think there will be enough to reserve a fresh lot of things for miss hackets affair bytheby regie did you say it rained at darminster  poured all the way down  well we had it quite fine  was it fine here  yes certainly said lady merrifield or primrose would not have gone out take care of rotherwood regie you know his room  and the two sisters crossed the hall where the very high tea was being laid hearing from the regions above sounds of exquisite glee and merriment as perfect and almost as inexpressive of anything else as the singing of birds so that they themselves could not help answering with a laugh before they vanished into the chamber of mystery  indeed phylliss conversation was like a fairy tale her brothers illness which was not enough to damp any ones spirits had prevented or hindered a grand childrens party as the butterflys ball where she was to have been the butterfly and lord ivinghoe the grasshopper and all the children were to appear as one of the characters in roscoes pretty poem never was anything more delightful to the imagination of the little cousins and they could not marvel enough at her seeming so little uneasy about anything so charming and quite ready and eager to throw herself headlong into all their present enjoyments making wonderful surmises as to the mystery in preparation  dolores heard the laughing and it did not suit with her vaguely uneasy and injured frame of mind feeling dreadfully lonely too as she came downstairs dressed for the evening but not knowing where to go for the diningroom was engrossed the schoolroom was dark and the fire out the drawingroom occupied by the two gentlemen she crouched down in one of the big armchairs on either side of the hearth in the hall and began to read by the firelight presently jasper came in from his ride and began taking off his greatcoat leggings and boots whistling as he did so then perceiving the tempting object of a black leg sticking out of the chair he stole up across the soft carpet and caught hold of the ankle he received a vigorous kick in return which perhaps he expected but what he did not expect was the black figure that rose up in outraged dignity and indignation for shame i wont be insulted  whew i thought twas val i beg your pardon  i shall ask my aunt if i am to be insulted  well if you choose to take it in that waya man cant do more than beg pardon im sure i would never have presumed to touch you if i had known it was your dolorousness  and he turned to walk away just as the babbling ripple of laughter began to flow downstairs and a whole mass of little girls intertwined together was descending i always hop said a voice new to him except on the great staircase and mother doesnt like it there but this is such a jolly stair cant you hop  hopping in a threefold embrace on a slippery stair was hardly a safe pastime and before jasper had time to utter more than holloa there take care there descended suddenly on him an avalanche of little girls knocking him off his feet so that all promiscuously rolled down two or three steps together fergus and primrose who had somehow been holding on behind remained upright but nevertheless screaming the shrieks of the fallen were however laughter there was a soft rug below and by the time the gentlemen had rushed out of the diningroom and the ladies from the curtained recess giggling below and legs above were chiefly apparent  any one hurt was of course lady merrifields cry  oh no mamma only we are so mixed up we cant get up called out mysie  is this arm you or me exclaimed phyllis following up the joke  come sort yourselves ladies and gentlemen said lord rotherwood whats this a flys wing  no its mine cried val as his hand pulled her out and the others extricated themselves still laughing go that they could hardly stand and fly declaring oh daddy daddy it is such fun i am so glad we came and taking a gratuitous leap into the air  every one to her taste said lady merrifield i congratulate those to whom a compound tumbledownstairs is felicity  she has found her congenial element you see said her father as the elders proceeded upstairs to their toilette tis laughinggas with her to be with other children and the most laughingest of all are naturally yours old lily  meanwhile jasper risen on his stocking soles looked all over at the little figure dressed old picture fashion in the simplest white frock with blue sash and shortcut hair tied back with blue  well you are a jolly little girl he said and a cool customer too what do you mean by knocking a fellow over the first time you see him  and what do you mean by coming like a greathugebig elephant in our way to stop up the stairs demanded fly in return  do you mean to insinivate that twas i that made you fall said jasperi that was quietly walking up the stairs when down there came on me a showernot cats and dogs but worserer far worserer why im kilt my nose is flat as a pancake i shant recover my beauty all the evening for the great swells that are coming  jasper japs called his mothers warning voice you must come up and dress for tea is going in  he obeyed rushing two steps at a time but meeting at the bottom of the attic flight his sister gillian he demanded gill what awfully jolly little girl have they got down there  why fly of course lady phyllis devereux  no no nothing swell a comical little soul with no nonsense about her in a white thing  well thats phyllis theres no one else there  i say gill tis like sunshine and clouds she and the other i mean why i gave a little pull to a foot i saw in the armchair thinking it belonged to val and out breaks my lady of the rueful countenance vowing shell complain that ive insulted her and as to the other the whole lot of them tumbled over me together on the stairs and she did nothing but laugh and chaff  i hope she is not a romp said the staid gillian sagely as she went downstairs  but on that score she was soon satisfied phyllis devereux was a thorough little lady wild and merry as she was and enchanted to be in the rare fairyland of child companionship and that indeed she had mysie and valetta between whose ages she stood hung to her inseparably and jasper was quite transformed from his grim superciliousness into her devoted knight at teatime there was a competition for the seats next to her determined by valettas taking one side in right of the birthday and jasper the other because he secured it and mysie gave way to him because he was japs and she always did while dolores laid up a store of moralizings on the adulation paid to the little lady of title and at the same time speculated what concatenation of circumstances could ever make her lady dolores mohun on the whole it would be more likely that her father should gain a peerage by putting down a fijian rebellion than that it should be discovered that his mother lady emily had been the true heiress of the marquessate and even so an uncomfortable number of people must be disposed of before it could come to him she had one consolation however for uncle reginald always kind to her was particularly affectionate this evening as if he would not have that little foolish fly set up before her  the tea and the tree both went off joyously there is no need to describe the spectacle to folks who can count their christmastrees by the years of their life and the memorable part of this one was that much of the fruit that had been left hanging on it was now metamorphosed into something much more gorgeousoranges had become eggs full of sugarplums guttapercha monkeys grinned on the branches golden flowers had sprung to life on the ends of the twigs a lovely jewellike lantern crowned the whole and as to sweets everybody servants and allhad some delightful devices containing them whether drum bird or birds nest  before the distribution was over it was observed that aunt jane and uncle reginald also harry had vanished from the scene there was a pause during which such tapers as began to burn perilously low were extinguished an operation as delightful apparently as the fixing them presently a horn was heard and a start or shudder of mysterious ecstasy pervaded the audience as a tall figure came through the curtains and announced  ladies and gentlemen i have the honour to inform you that a fresh discovery has been made in the secret chambers of the pyramid of chops otherwise known as tegunterra a mummy has been disinterred which is about to be opened by the celebrated egyptologist herr professor freudigfeldius who has likewise discovered the means of making such a conjuration of the sphynx that she will not only summon each of the present company by name but will require of each of them to reply to a question the penalty of a refusal is well known  therewith the curtains were drawn back and a scene was presented which made some of the spectators start behind was the semblance of a wall marked with the joints of large stones and lighted apparently with two brass lamps on the floor lay extended an enormous mummy with the regulation canvas case and huge flaps of ears between which appeared a small painted face and below lay a long gaily coloured scroll in hieroglyphics exalted stiffly in a seat placed on a seeming block of stone was a figure with elbows as it were glued to its sides and hands crossed altogether stonecoloured and monumental and with the true sphynx head surrounded with beetles lizards and other mystic creatures very chocolatecoloured and beside her stood the herr professor in a red fez long dark gown and spectacles a flowing beard concealing the rest of his face how delightful to see such an egyptologist even though one perfectly knew the family beard and fez also that the gown was papas old dressinggown captured for the theatrical wardrobe and how grand to hear him speak even though his broken english continually became more vernacular  liebes herrschaft he began i would nobles gentry and ladies say you here see the embalmed rests of the celebrated monarch nicnac cino lately up have i them graben and likewise his tutelar sphynx have found and have even to give signs of animation compelled  touching the effigy with his wand she emitted certain growls and hisses which made primrose hide her face in alarm at anything so uncanny and lord rotherwood observe  nearly related to the catgoddess pasht i thought so  there was something of the lion or cat in the sphynx said gillian gravely while the three little girls clasped each others hands with delightful thrills of awe and expectation  observe continued the professor the outer case with the features of the deceased is painted i should conclude that king nicnac etcetera had been of a peculiarly jollyi mean frolichnature judging by the grin on his face we proceed  as he laid his hand on the wrapper the sphynx gave utterance to sounds so like the bad language of a cat that some looked round for one the professor waved at her and she subsided he turned back the covering and demanded will the amiable fraulein there mademoiselle valetta come and see what treasures she can discover in the secrets of the tomb  val who in right of her birthday had expected the first call jumped up but the sphynx made awful noises as she advanced and the professor explained that she would have to answer the sphynxs question first  but i dont know egyptian she observed  never mind it will sound like english  it did so for it was how many months old art thou maiden  vals arithmetic was slightly scared she clasped her hand nervously and was indebted to the professor for the sotto voce hint twelve nines before she uttered a hundred and eight  the sphynx relapsed into stoniness and the herr professor guided the hands which trembled a little to the interior of the mummy whence they drew out a basket labelled wonderful to relate val and containingoh such treasures a blue egg full of needlework implements a new book an indian ivory case a skippingrope a shuttlecock and other delights past description the exhibition of them was only beginning when the professor called for primrose who was too much frightened to come alone and therefore was permitted to be brought by mrs halfpenny the sphynx was particularly amiable on this occasion and only asked when primroses came and as the little one in her shy fright did not reply nurse did so with come missie cant you find a word to tell that mammas primrose came in spring this was allowed to pass and mrs halfpenny bore off her child clutching a dolls cradle stuffed with pretty things and for herself a bundle wrapped up in a shawl from sir jasper himself  after primrose was gone to bed the sphynx became much more ill tempered and demonstrative snarling considerably at the approach of some of the party some of whom replied with convulsive laughter some such as jasper with demonstrations of poking up the sphynx she had a question for everybodyfly was asked which was best a tree or a butterflys ball and answered with truthful politeness that where mysie and val were was best of all she carried off a collection that had hastily been made of indian curiosities photographs of her two friends and a book and her father after being asked what was the best of insects and replying  on the whole i think it is my house fly even when she isnt a butterfly received a letterweight of brass fashioned like an enormous fly which lady merrifield had snatched up from the table for the purpose the maids giggled at the wellknown conundrums proposed to them and dolores had a very easy question   what was the weather this day week  a horrid wet day she promptly answered and found herself endowed with a parcel containing some of the best presents of all bangles from the indian box a beautiful pair of storklike scissors a writing case etc  the sphynxs invention is running low observed jasper to gillian when the creature put the same question about last weeks weather to herbert the pageboy as a prelude to his discovering the treasures of the mummy as a knife and an umbrella his view of the weather was that it was a fine day maam yes a fine day  macrae came last and the sphynx asked him which of the two contrary views was right  it was fine maam that i know for i walked down with nurse and little miss primrose into silverton to help to carry her in case she was tired and we never had occasion to put up an umbrella  wherewith macrae received his combination of gifts and retired the mummy being completely rifled and the construction of the body a frame of light open wickerwork revealed aunt jane had had it made at the basketmakers while as to the head and covering her own ingenious fingers had painted and fashioned them everybody had to look at everybodys presents a lengthened operation and then there was a splendid game at blindmansbuff in the hall in which all the elders joined except mamma who had to go and sit in the nursery with the restless and excited primrose while mrs halfpenny and lots went down to the servants festivity  when she came down again it was to quiet the tempest of merriment and send off the younger folks in succession to bed till only the four elders and hal remained on the scene waiting till there was reason to think the household would be ready for prayers  it was dolores that you saw at darminster reginald said miss mohun quietly  you sphynx woman how do you know  you said it was raining at darminster  yes that it was everywhere beyond the tunnel through the darfield hills  exactly i know they make a line in the rainfall well here it was dry but dolores called it a wet day  now i call that too bad jane to lay a trap for the poor child in the game cried colonel mohun just as if they had still been boy and girl together  it was to satisfy my own mind she said colouring a little i didnt want any one to act on it indeed i think there will be no occasion  besides he added it is nothing to go upon no doubt if it wasnt raining it was the next thing to it here and bow was she to recollect at this distance of time i wont have her caught out in that way  i am glad she has a champion regie said lady merrifield here come the servants     chapter xiv  a cypher and a ty    dolores was coming down to breakfast the next morning when colonel mohuns door opened he exclaimed my little dolly good morning stooped down and kissed her  then standing still a moment and holding her hand he said  dolly it was not you i saw at darminster station  it was a terrible shock  some one no doubt was trying to set him against her  and should she betray constance and her uncle at any rate almost before she knew what she was saying no uncle regie was out of her mouth and her conscience was being answered with how do i know it was me that he saw these fur capes are very common  i thought not he answered kindly look here dolly i want one word with you did your father ever leave anything in charge with you for mr flinders did he ever speak to you about him  never dolores truly answered  because my dear though its a hard thing to say and your poor mother felt bound to him he is a slippery fellowa scamp in fact and if ever he writes to you here you had better send the letter straight off to me and ill see whats to be done he never has i suppose  no said dolores answering the word here and foolishly feeling the involvement too great and constance too much concerned in it for her to confess to her uncle what had really happened indeed the first falsehood held her to the second and there was no more time for lord rotherwood was coming out of his room further down the passage and after the greetings as she went downstairs before the two gentlemen she was sure she heard uncle regie say shes all right what could it mean was a storm averted or was it brewing could that spiteful aunt jane and her questions about the weather be at the bottom of it  the fun that was going on at breakfast seemed a mere roar of folly to her and she had an instinct of nothing but getting away to constance she soon found that there would be opportunity enough for the tree was to be taken down in a barrow and all the youthful world was to carry down the decorations in baskets and help to put them on she dashed off among the first to put on her things and then was disappointed to find that first all the pets were to be fed and shown off to fly who appreciated them far more than she had doneknew how to lay hold of a rabbit nursed the guineapigs and puppies in turn and was rapturous in her acceptance of two young guineapigs and one puppy  i can keep them up in daddys dressingroom while we are at high court and it will be such fun she said  will he let you asked gillian in some doubt  oh daddy will always let me and so will griffinhis man you know only we left him in london because daddy said he would be in your butlers way but i cant think why griffin would have helped about the tree and learnt to make a mummy when we have our party louise would not let me have them in the nursery i know but daddy and griffin would and i could go and feed them in the morning before breakfast  griffin would get me bran that is if we do go to high court i wish we were to stay on here theres nobody to play with at high court and grandpapa always keeps daddy talking politics so that i can hardly ever get him mysie whatever do you do with your father away in india  yes it is horrid but then theres mamma said mysie whispering however as she saw dolores near and feared to hurt her feelings  ah said fly with a tender little shake of her head tis worse for her to have no mother at all is that why she looks so sad  cross is the word said wilfred i cant think what she is come bothering down here for  oh for shame wilfred said fly  you should be sorry for her and she went up to dolores and by way of doing the kindest thing in the world said  heres my new puppy is not he a dear ill let you hold him and she attempted to deposit the fat curly satiny creature in doloress arms which instantly hung down stiff as she answered half in fright i hate dogs  the puppy fell down with a flop and began to squeak while the girls crying oh dolly how could you and poor little pup all crowded round in pity and indignation and wilfred observed i told you so  youll get no change but that out of the lady of the rueful countenance said jasper  mysie had for once nothing to say in doloress defence being equally hurt for flys sake and the puppys dolores found herself virtually sent to coventry as she accompanied the party across the paddock only just near enough to benefit by their protection from the herd of half grown calves which were there disporting themselves and as if to make the contrast still more provoking fly who had a natural affinity for all animals insisted on trying to attract them calling sukkey sukkey and hold out bunches of grass in vain for they only galloped away and she could only explain how tame those at home were and how she went out farming with daddy whenever he had time and mother and fraulein would let her out  the tree meantime came trundling down a wonderful spectacle with all its gilt balls and fircones nodding and dangling wildly and its other embellishments turning upside down there were greetings of delight at casement cottage and miss hacket had kissed everybody all round before gillian had time to present the newcomer and then the good lady was shocked at her own presumption and exclaimed  i beg your ladyships pardon dear me i had no notion who it was  then please kiss me again now you do know said fly holding up her funny little face to that very lovable kind one and they were all soon absorbed in the difficulty of getting the tree in at the front door and setting it up in the room that had been prepared for it  dolores had hoped to confide her alarms to constances sympathetic ear but her friend who had written and dreamt of many a magnificently titled scion of the peerage but had never before seen one in her own house had not a minute to spare for her being far too much engrossed in observing the habits of the animal these certainly were peculiar since she insisted on a waltz round the room with the tabby cat and ascended a stepladder merrily spurning jaspers protection to insert the circle of tapers on the crowning chandelier there was nothing left for dolores to do but to sit by in the windowseat philosophizing on the remarkable effects of a handle to ones name and feeling cruelly neglected  suddenly she saw a fly coming up to the gate there was a general peeping and wondering then uncle reginald and a stranger got out and came up to the door there was a ringeverybody paused and wondered for a moment then the maid tapped at the door and said would miss mohun come and speak to colonel mohun a minute in the drawingroom  there was a hush of dread throughout the room ah sighed miss hacket looking at gillian and all the elders thought without saying that some terrible news of her father had to be told to the poor child they let her go frightened at the summons but that idea not occurring to her  there said uncle regie she can set it straight dont be frightened my dear only tell this gentleman whether that is your writing  the stranger held a strip so that she could only just see dolores m mohun and she unhesitatingly answered yesvery much surprised  you are sure said her uncle in a tone of disappointment that made her falter as she added i think so at the same time the stranger turned the paper round and she knew it for the cheque that had so long resided in her desk but with dilated eyes she exclaimed butbut that was for seven pounds  that said the stranger then miss mohun you know this draft  only it was for seven repeated dolores  you mean i conclude that it was drawn for seven pounds and that it was still for seven when it left your handy  yes muttered dolores who was beginning to get very much frightened at she knew not what and to feel on her guard at all points  theres nothing to be afraid of my dear said uncle reginald tenderly nobody suspects you of anything only tell us did your father give you this paper  yes  and when did you cash it asked the clerk  dolores hung her head i didnt she said  but how did it get out of your possession said her uncle you are sure this is your own writing at the back it could surely not have been stolen from her he added to the stranger  that could hardly be said that person miss mohun you had better speak out to whom did you give this cheque  there was a whirl of terror all round about dolores a horror of bringing herself first then uncle alfred constance and everybody else into trouble she took refuge in uttering not a word  dolores said her uncle and his tone was now much more grave and less tender thus increasing her terror this silence is of no use did you give this cheque to mr flinders  in the silence the ticks of the clock on the mantelpiece seemed like a hammer beating on her ears  dolores thought of the mornings flat denial of all intercourse with flinders  then the word give occurred to her as a loophole and her mind did not embrace all the consequences of the denial she only saw one thing at a time i didnt give it she answered almost inaudibly  you did not give it repeated her uncle getting angry and speaking loud  then how did it get into his hands is there no truth in you he added after a pause which only terrified her more and more whom did you give it to  constance the word came out she hardly knew how as something which at least was true colonel mohun knocked at the door of the room she had come from it was instantly opened and miss hacket began the poor dear can i get anything for her i am sure it is a terrible shock and as he stood astonished gillian added oh i see it isnt that we were afraid it was something about uncle maurice  no my dear no such thing only would miss constance hacket be kind enough to come here a minute  oh my apron my fingers excuse me for being such a figure constance ran on as colonel mohun made her come across to the room opposite where she looked about her in amazement was the stranger a publisher about to make her an offer for the waif of the moorland but doloress downcast attitude and set sullen face forbade the idea  miss constance hacket said the colonel here is an uncomfortable matter in which we want your assistance will you kindly answer a question or two from mr ellis the manager of the  bank  then the manager politely asked her if she had seen the cheque before  yeswhywhats wrong about it oh it is for seventy why dolores i thought it was only for seven  it was for seven when you parted with it then miss hacket said the manager let me ask whether you changed it yourself  no she said i sent it to and there she came to a dead pause in alarm  did you send it to mr alfred flinders said mr ellis  yesoh another little scream he cant have done it he cant be such a villain your own uncle dolores  he is no uncle of dolores mohun said the colonel  he is only the son of her mothers stepmother by her first marriage  oh dolores then you deceived me exclaimed constance you told me he was your own uncle or i would neverand oh my fifteen pounds where is he  that madam said mr ellis gravely i hope the police may discover he has quitted darminster after having cashed this cheque for seventy pounds we have already telegraphed to the police to be on the look out for him but i much fear that it will be too late  oh my fifteen pounds what shall i do oh dolores how could you i shall never trust any one again  perhaps uncle reginald felt the same but he only darted a look upon his niece which she felt in every nerve though to his eyes she only stood hard and stolid the manager who found constances torrent of words as hard to deal with as doloress silence asked for pen and ink and begged to take down miss hackets statement to lay before a magistrate in case of flinderss apprehension it was not very easy to keep her to the point especially as her chief interest was in her own fifteen pounds of which mr ellis only would say that she could prosecute the man for obtaining money on false pretences and this she trusted meant getting it back again  as to the cheque in question she told how dolores had entrusted it to her to send to her supposed uncle mr flinders to whom it had been promised the day they went to darminster and she was quite ready to depose that when it left her hands it was only for seven pounds  this was all that the bank manager wanted he thanked her told colonel mohun they should hear from him and went off in a hurry both to communicate with the police and to leave the young ladies to be dealt with by their friends who he might well suppose would rather that he removed himself  put on your hat dolores said colonel mohun gravely you had better come home with me miss hacket excuse me but i am afraid i must ask whether you have been assisting in a correspondence between my niece and this flinders  oh colonel mohun you will believe me i was quite deceived dolores represented that he was her uncle to whom she was much attached and that lady merrifield separated her from him out of mere family prejudice  i am afraid you have paid dearly for your sympathy said the colonel it certainly led you far when you assisted your friend to deceive the aunt who trusted you with her  the movement that was taking place seemed like licence to that roomful burning with curiosity to break out mysie was running after dolores to ask if she could do anything for her but colonel mohun called her back with not now mysie  miss hacket came forward with agitated hopes that nothing was amiss and at sight of her constance collapsed quite oh mary she cried out i have been so deceived oh that man and she sunk upon a chair in a violent fit of crying which alarmed miss hacket so dreadfully that she looked imploringly up to colonel mohun he had meant to have left miss constance to explain but he saw it was necessary to relieve the poor elder sisters mind from worse fears by saying i am afraid it is my niece who deceived her by leading her into forwarding letters and money to a person who calls himself a relation he seems to have been guilty of a forgery which may have unpleasant consequences children i think you had better follow us home  dolores had come down by this time and colonel mohun walked home at some paces from her very much as if he had been guarding a criminal under arrest  poor uncle reginald  he had put such absolute trust in the two answers she had made him in the morning and had been so sure of her good faith that when the manager brought word that the cheque had been traced to flinders who had absconded he still held that it was a barefaced forgery entirely due to flinders himself and that dolores could show that she had no knowledge of it and he had gone down in the fly expecting to come home triumphant and confute his sister jane who persisted in being mournfully sagacious and he was indignant in proportion to the confidence he had misplaced grieved too for his brothers sake and absolutely ashamed  once he asked when they were within the paddock out of the way of meeting any one have you nothing to say to me dolores  it was not said in a manner to draw out an answer and she made none at all  again he spoke as they came near the house  you had better go up to your room at once i do not know how to think of the blow this will be to your father  it was so entirely what dolores was thinking of that it seemed to her barbarous to tell her of it  in fact she was stunned scarcely understanding what had happened and too proud and miserable to ask for an explanation for had not every one turned against her even uncle reginald and constanceand what had happened to that cheque  she did not see uncle reginald turn into the drawingroom and letting himself drop despairingly into an armchair say well jane you were right mores the pity  she really gave him the cheque  yes but at least it was only for seven  the rascal himself must have altered it into seventy  she and the other girl both agree as to that theres been a clandestine correspondence going on with that scamp ever since she has been here under cover to that precious friend of hers that hacket girl  ah you warned me jenny said lady merrifield but im quite sure miss hacket knew nothing of it  i dont suppose she did she seemed struck all of a heap any way theyve quarrelled now the other one has turned kings evidencehas lost some money too and says dolores deceived her  shes deceived every one all round thats the fact why she told me two flat lies this very morningliestheres no other name for it what will you do with her lily  i dont know said lady merrifield utterly shocked and recollecting but not mentioning the falsehood told to her about the note lord rotherwood said poor child and colonel mohun groaned poor maurice  then she did go to darminster said miss mohun  yes that came out from this miss constance who seems to have been properly taken in about some publishing trash serve her right but it seems dolores beguiled her with stories about her dear uncle in distress we left her nearly in hysterics and i told the children to come away  what does dolores say asked jane  nothing i could not get a word out of her after the first surprise at the alteration of the cheque not a word nor a tear she is as hardas hard as a bit of stone  really said lady merrifield i cant help thinking theres a good deal of excuse for her  what that poor maurices wife was half a heathen and afterwards the girl was left to chance said colonel mohun i see no other and you lily are the last person i should expect to excuse untruth  i did not mean to do that regie but you all say that poor mary was fond of this man and helped him  that she did said lord rotherwood and very much against the grain it went with maurice  then dont you see that this poor child who probably never had the matter explained to her may have felt it a great hardship to be cut off from the man her mother taught her to care for and that may have led her into concealments  well said colonel mohun at that rate at least one may be thankful never to have married  oneor two regie said jane as they all laughed at his sally i think i had better go up and see whether i can get anything out of the child do you mean to have her down to dinner lily she added glancing at the clock  oh yes certainly  i dont want to put her to disgrace before all the children and servantsthat is if she is not crying herself out of condition to appear poor child  not she said uncle reginald  on opening the door the children were all discovered in the hall in anxious curiosity not venturing in uncalled but very much puzzled  gillian came forward and said mamma may we know what is the matter  i hardly understand it myself yet my dear only that dolores and constance hacket have let themselves be taken in by a sort of relation of doloress mother and uncle maurice has lost a good deal of money through it it would not have happened if there had been fair and upright dealing towards me but we do not know the rights of it and you had better take no notice of it to her  i thought said valetta sagaciously no good could come of running after that stupid miss constance  who cant pull a cracker and screams at a daddy longlegs added fergus  but mamma what shall we do said gillian i came away because uncle regie told us and constance was crying so terribly but what is poor miss hacket to do there is the tree only half dressed and all the girls coming tonight unless she puts them off  yes you had better go down alone as soon as dinner is over and see what she would like said lady merrifield we must not leave her in the lurch as if we cast her off though i am afraid constance has been very foolish in this matter  oh gillian i wish we could have made dolores happier amongst us and then this would not have happened  she would never let us mamma said gillian  but mysie coming up close to her mother as they all went up the broad staircase to prepare for the midday meal confessed in a grave little voice mamma i think i have sometimes been cross to dollymore lately because it has been so very tiresome  lady merrifield drew the little girl into her own room stooped down and kissed her saying my dear child these things need a great deal of patience you will have to be doubly kind and forbearing now for she must be very unhappy and perhaps not like to show it you might say a little prayer for her that god will help us to be kind to her and soften her heart  oh yes mamma and please will you set it down for me  yes my dear and for myself too you shall have it before bedtime  aunt jane had followed dolores to her own room the girl who was sitting on her bed dazed regretted that she had not bolted her door as her aunt entered with the words oh dolores i am very sorry i could not have thought you would so have abused the confidence that was placed in you  to this dolores did not answer to her mind she was the person illused by the prohibition of correspondence but she could not say so every one was falling on her but aunt janes questions could not well help being answered  what will your father think of if  he never forbade me to write to uncle alfred said dolores  because he never thought of your doing such a thing did he give you this cheque  yes  for yourself  nno but it was the same  what do you mean by that  it was to pay a mana mans thats dead  that may be but what right did that give you to spend the money otherwise who was the man  professor muhlwasser for some books of plates  how do you know he is dead who told you so eh was it flinders ah you see what comes of trusting to an unprincipled man like that  if you had only been open and straightforward with aunt lily or with any of us you would have been saved from this tissue of falsehood forfeiting your uncle reginalds good opinion and enabling flinders to do your father this great injury she paused and as dolores made no answer she went on againindeed there is no saying what you have not brought on yourself by your deceit and disobedience  if flinders is apprehended you will have to appear against him in court and publicly avow that you gave away what your father trusted to you  dolores gave a little moan and start and her aunt perceiving that she had touched an apparently vulnerable spot proceededthe only thing left for you to do is to tell the whole story frankly and honestly i dont say so only for the sake of showing aunt lily that you are sorry for having abused her confidence i wish i could think that you are but unless we know all we cannot shield you from any further consequences and that of course we should wish to do for your fathers sake  dolores did not feel drawn to confession but she knew that when aunt jane once set herself to ask questions there was no use in trying to conceal anything so she made answers chiefly yes or no and her aunt by severe and diligent pumping had extracted bit by bit what it was most essential should be known before the gong summoned them dolores would rather have been a solitary prisoner able to chafe against oppression than have been obliged to come down and confront everybody but she crept into the place left for her between mysie and wilfred she had very little appetite and never found out how mysie was fulfilling her resolution of kindness by baulking wilfred of sundry attempts to tease by substituting her own kissingcrust for dollys more unpoetical piece of bread and offering to exchange her delicious strawberryjam tartlet for the blackcurrant one at which her cousin was looking with reluctant eyes  mysie and valetta were grievously exercised about their chances of returning to the gfs tree indeed gillian went the length of telling them that fly was behaving far better in her disappointment as to the butterflys ball than they were as to this old secondhand tree fly laughed and observed dear me things one would like are always being stopped if one was to mind every time how horrid it would be and theres always something to make up  then it occurred to gillian though not to her younger sisters that lady phyllis devereux lived in general a much less indulged and more frequently disappointed life than did herself and her sisters  however there was great delight at that dinnertable jasper had ridden to get the letters of the second post and lord rotherwood had his hands and his head full of them when he came in to luncheonthere being what lady merrifield called a respectable dinner in view  in the first place lord ivinghoe was getting on very well and was up sitting by the fire playing patience nobody was catching the measles and quarantine would be over on the 9th of january secondly fly shall you be very brokenhearted if i tell you  oh daddy you wouldnt look like that if it was anything very bad lion isnt dead  no but i grieve to say your unnatural grandparents dont want you grandmamma is nervous about having you without mamma what did we do last time we were there fly  dont you remember daddy they said there was nothing for me to ride to the meet and you and griffin put the sidesaddle on crazy kate and we went out with the hounds and ive got the brush up in my room  i dont wonder grandmamma is nervous observed lady merrifield  will you be nervous lily said lord rotherwood if this same flyaway mortal is left on your hands till the 9th  dinner manners silence before company and all could not repress a general scream of ecstacy which called forth the reply i should think you and her mother were the people to be nervous  oh my lady has been duly instructed in merrifield perfections and esteems you a model mother  the childrens nods and smiles said hear hear  well youve got it all in her own letter  continued lord rotherwood  you see theyve got a caucus at high court and a dinner and i must go up there on monday but if youll keep this dangerous fly  i can answer for the pleasure it will give  well then ill come back for her by the 9th and youve victorias letter havent you  yes it is very kind of her  then i shall expect you to be ready to start with me for the butterflys ball  eh young ladies what will you come out as  oh daddy daddy is it  has mamma asked them  oh it is more delicious than anything ever was  mysie mysie what will you be  the sly little dormouse crept out of his hole quoted mysie in a very low happy voice  and i will be a jolly old frog shouted fergus finding the ordinance of silence broken and making the most of it on the presumption that the whole family were invited  however the tone rather than the uncomprehended words of his mothers answer nobody asked you sir she said reduced him to silence and it became understood through flys inquiries that the invitation included lady merrifield must make her acceptance doubtful  and besides the question which three were to go was the unspoken drawback to full bliss and yet the delight was exceedingly great in the prospect great enough to make the contrast of gloom in poor doloress spirit all the darker as she sat left out of everything and she could not now say with absolute injustice though she still clung to the belief that there was more misfortune than fault in her disgrace  she crept away shivering with unhappiness to the schoolroom while the others frisked off discussing the wonderful butterflys ball  lady merrifield looked in on her and she hardened herself to endure either another probing or fresh reproaches but all she heard was my dear i cannot talk over this sad affair now as i have to go out but if you can i think you had better write to your father about it and let him understand exactly how it happened or if you had rather write than speak in explaining it to me you can do so and we can consider tomorrow what is to be done about it  then she went out with her brother and cousin to drive to some industrial schools which lord rotherwood wanted to see     chapter xv  the butterflys ball    miss mohun went to the casement cottages with gillian to see what the elder miss hacket might wish and whether they could be of use to her the young people being left to exercise themselves within call in case the tree was to be continued  this proved to be an act of great kindness for poor mary hacket was suffering all the distress of an upright and honourable woman at her sisters abuse of confidence and had felt as if colonel mohuns summons to his nieces was the close of all intimacy with such an unworthy household moreover the evenings entertainment could not be given up and gillian was despatched to summon the eager assistants while aunt jane repeated her assurances that lady merrifield perfectly understood miss hackets ignorance of the doings in constances room listening patiently even when the tenderhearted woman began to excuse her sister for having accepted doloress lamentations at being cut off from her so called uncle dear connie is so romantic and so easily touched she said though of course it was very wrong of her to suppose that lady merrifield could do anything harsh or unkind she is in great grief now poor darling she feels so bitterly that her friend led her into it by deceiving her about the relationship and character  this aunt jane did not think the worst part of the affair and she said that the girl had been brought up to call the man uncle alfred and very possibly did not understand that he was only so by courtesy nor that he was so utterly untrustworthy  i thought so said mary hacket i told connie that such a child could not possibly have been a willing party to his fraudfor fraud i fear it wasmiss mohun do you think there is any hope of her recovering the sum she advanced  i am afraid there is not even if the wretched man is apprehended  ah if she had only told me what she wanted it for  i hope it was all her own  oh miss mohun no doubt you know that two sisters living together must accommodate one another a little and connies dress expenses at her age are necessarily more than mine but here come the dear children and we ought to dismiss all painful subjects though i declare i am so nervous i hardly know what i am about  however by miss mohuns help the good lady rose to the occasion and when once busy the trouble was thrown off so that no guests would have detected how unhappy she had been in the forenoon  constance soon came down and confided to gillian a parcel directed to miss d mohun containing all the notes written to her and all the books lent to her by the false friend whom she had cast off after which she threw herself into the interests of the present  the london ornaments and the residue of the gifts and bonbons made the christmastree a most memorable one to the gfs mind  as to fly she fraternized to a great extent with a very small maid in a very long brown dress and very thick boots who did not taste a single bonbon and being asked whether she understood that they were good to eat replied that she was keeping them for  our bertie and minnie  and on encouragement launched into such a description of her chargesthe blacksmiths small childrenthat lady phyllis went back not without regrets that she could not be a little nurse who had done with school at twelve years old and spent her days at the back of a perambulator  oh daddy she said i do wish you had come down it was such lovely funthe best tree i ever saw  why wouldnt you come  if thirty odd years should pass over that little head of yours my lady fly and you should then meet with mysie and val maybe you will then learn the reason why  we will recollect that in thirty years time  when our children go to a christmastree  and we sit over the fire instead  oh but should we ever not care for a dear delightful christmas tree  if we had each other instead  then we would all go still together  and tell our little boys and girls all about this one and the butterflys ball  perhaps our husbands would want us and not let us go  oh i dont want a husband  hed be in the way  wed send him off to india or somewhere like aunt lilys  dont fly it is not at all nice to have papa away  oh yes it would be ten hundred times better if he were at home  such were the mingled sentiments of the triad as they went upstairs to bed linked together in their curious fashion  some time later a bedroom discussion of affairs was held by lady merrifield and miss mohun who had not had a moment alone together all day to converse upon the two versions of the disaster which the latter had extracted from dolores and constance and which fairly agreed though constance had been by far the most voluble and somewhat ungenerously violent against her former friend at least so lady merrifield remarked  you should take into account the authoresss disappointed vanity  yes poor thing how he must have nattered her  besides there is the loss of the money which i fear falls as seriously on good miss hacket as on the goose herself  does it indeed  that must not be  how much is it  fifteen pounds and that foolish constance fancies that poor dolores assisted in duping her  i really had to defend the girl though i am just as angry myself when i watch her adamantine sullenness  i am the person to be angry with for having allowed the intimacy in spite of your warnings jenny  you were too innocent to know what girls are made of  oh yes you are very welcome to have six of your own but you might have six dozen without knowing what a girl brought up at a secondrate boardingschool is capable of or what it is to have had no development of conscience what shall you do  send her to school  after that recommendation of yours  i didnt propose a secondrate boardingschool maam  theres a high school starting after the holidays at rockstone  let me have her and send her there  ada would not like it  never mind ada ill settle her  i would keep dolly well up to her lessons and prevent these friendships  i suppose you would manage her better than i have been able to do said lady merrifield reluctantly  yet i should like to try again i dont want to let her go  is it the old story of duty and love jane have i failed again through negligence and ignorance and deceived myself by calling weakness and blindness love  you dont fail with your own lily  rotherwood runs about admiring them and saying he never saw a better union of freedom and obedience it was really a treat to see gillians ways tonight she had so much consideration and managed her sisters so well  ah but theres their father  i do so dread spoiling them for him before he comes home but then he is a present influence with us all the time  they would all clap their hands if i carried dolly off  yes and that is one reason i dont want to give her up it seems so sad to send maurices child away leaving such an impression  one thing i am  thankful for that it will be all over before grandmamma and bessie merrifield come  at that moment there was a knock at the door and a small figure appeared in a scarlet robe bare feet and dishevelled hair  mysie dear child  whats the matter who is ill  oh please come mamma dolly is choking and crying in such a dreadful way and i cant stop her  i give up lily  this is motherwork said miss mohun  hurrying upstairs lady merrifield found very distressing sounds issuing from doloress room sobs not loud but almost strangled into a perfect agony of choking down by the resolute instinct for it was scarcely will  my dear my dear dont stop it she exclaimed lifting up the girl in her arms  let it out cry freely never mind  she will be better soon mysie dear  only get me a glass of water and find a fresh handkerchief  there there thats right  as dolores let herself lean on the kind breast and conscious that the utmost effects of the disturbance had come allowed her longdrawn sobs to come freely and moaned as they shook her whole frame though without screaming  her aunt propped her up on her own bosom parted back her hair kissed her and saying she was getting better sent mysie back to her bed  the first words that were gasped out between the rending sobs were oh is myheto be tried  most likely not my dear  he has had full time to get away and i hope it is so  but wasnt he there  havent they got him  werent they asking me about him and saying i must be tried for stealing fathers cheque  you were dreaming my poor child  they have not taken him and i am quite sure you will not be tried anyway  they saidaunt jane and uncle reginald and all and that dreadful man that came  perhaps they said you might have to be examined but only if he is apprehended and i fully expect that he is out of reach so that you need not frighten yourself about that my dear  oh dont go cried dolores as her aunt stirred  no im not going  i was only reaching some water for you  let me sponge your face  to this dolores submitted gratefully and then sighed as if under heavy oppression and did he really do it  i am afraid he must have done so  i never thought it  mother always helped him  yes my dear that made it very hard for you to know what was right to do and this is a most terrible shock for you said her aunt feeling unable to utter another reproach just then to one who had been so loaded with blame and she was touched the more when dolores moaned mother would have cared so much  she answered with a kiss was glad to find her hand still held and forgot that it was past eleven oclock  please will it quite ruin father asked dolores who had not out grown childish confusion about large sums of money  not exactly my dear  it was more than he had in the bank and uncle regie thinks the bankers will undertake part of the loss if he will let them  it is more inconvenient than ruinous  ah  there was a faintness and oppression in the sound which made lady merrifield think the girl ought not to be left and before long sickness came on  nurse halfpenny had to be called up and it was one oclock before there was a quiet comfortable sleep which satisfied the aunt and nurse that it was safe to repair to their own beds again  the dreary undefined selfreproach and vague alarms intensified by the sullen reserved temper and culminating in such a shock alienating the only persons she cared for and filling her with terror for the future could not but have a physical effect and dolores was found on the morrow with a bad headache and altogether in a state to be kept in bed with a fire in her room  gillian and mysie were much impressed by the intelligence of their cousins illness when they came to their mothers room on the way to breakfast and mysie turned to her sister saying there gill you see she did care though she didnt cry like us  being ill is more than crying  well  said gillian it is a good deal more than such things as you and val cry for mysie  it was a trial such as you dont understand my dears said lady merrifield  i dont of course excuse much that she did but she had been used to see her mother make every exertion to help the man  that does make a difference said gillian but she shouldnt have taken her fathers money  and wasnt it dreadful of constance to smuggle her letters  im quite glad constance gets part of the punishment  certainly that might be just gillian but unfortunately the loss falls infinitely more heavily upon miss hacket who cannot afford the loss at all  oh dear cried mysie  im very sorry said gillian  and my dear girls in all honour and honesty we must make it up to her  cant we save it out of our allowance said mysie  sixpence a month from you a shilling perhaps from gill how long would that take  no my dear girls i am going to put you to a heavy trial  oh mamma dont cried gillian seeing what she was driving at dont give up the butterflys ball  oh dont  implored mysie tears starting in her eyes  we never saw a costume ball and fly wishes it so  and i thought you had promised said gillian  cousin rotherwood assumes that i did but i did not really accept  i told him i could not tell for you know your grandmamma merrifield talked of coming here and i cannot put her off  and now i see that it must be given up  it need only be calico sighed gillian sticking pins in and out of the pincushion  fancy dresses even in calico are very expensive  besides i could not go to a place like rotherwood without at least two new dresses and it is not right to put papa to more expense  oh mamma couldnt you  you always do look nicer than any one said mysie  my dear i am afraid nothing i have at present would be suitable for a generals wife at lady rotherwoods party and we must think of what would be fitting both towards our hostess and papa  dont you see  ah your velvet dress sighed gillian  my poor old faithful state apparel smiled lady merrifield  poor gill you did not think again to have to mourn for it but i dont know that even that could have been sufficiently revivified though it was my cheval de bataille for so many years  for lady merrifields black velvet of many years usefulness had been put on for her ppc party at belfast when gillian in abetting jasper in roasting chestnuts over a paraffinlamp had set herself and the tablecloth on fire and had been extinguished with such damages as singed hair a scar on jaspers hands and the destruction of her mothers front breadth  there had been such relief and thankfulness at its being no worse that the state apparel had not been much mourned especially as the remains made a charming pelisse for primrose  and in the retirement of silverton it had not been missed till the present occasion  do gowns cost so very much said mysie  indeed they do my poor mouse  the lamented cost more than twenty pounds  i had been thinking whether i could afford the requisite garmentsnot quite so costlyand thought i might get them for about sixteen with contrivance but you see i feel it my fault that i let dolores go and lead constance to get cheated and i cannot take the money out of what papa gives for household expenses and your education so it must come out of my own personal allowance  dont you see  yees  said gillian apparently intent on getting a big black headed pin repeatedly into the same hole while mysie was trying with all her might not to cry  you are thinking it is very hard that you should suffer for dollys faults  perhaps it is but such things may often happen to you my dears  christians bear them well for loves sake you know  and it is a little my fault said gillian thoughtfully  for it was i that let the chestnut fall into the lamp  ii dont think i should have minded so much said mysie almost crying if we had done it our own selvesand fly toofor some very poor woman in the snow  i know that very well mysie and this is a much harder trial as you dont get the honour and glory of it and besides you will have to take care to say not a word of this reason to fly or valetta or any one else  val will be awfully disappointed said gillian  poor val  but i should not have taken her anyway so that matters the less  i should have taken jasper for that would have been more convenient than so many girls  in fact i did not mean anybody to have heard of it till i had made up my mind so that there would have been no disappointment but that naughty cousin rotherwood could not keep it to himself and so my poor maidens you have to bear it with a good grace and to be treated as my confidential friends  mysie smiled and kissed her mothergillian cleared somewhat but observing i only wish it wasnt clothes  tried to dismiss the subject as the gong began to sound but mysie caught her mothers dress and said maynt i tell fly for a great secret  no my dear certainly not  fly is a dear little girl but we dont know how she can keep secrets and it would never do to let the rotherwoods know papa and uncle william would be exceedingly annoyed and only think of miss hackets feelings if it came round  it will be hard enough to get her to take it now  perhaps she wont flashed into the minds of both girls but mysie said entreatingly one moment more mamma please what can i say to fly that will be the truth  say that i find we cannot go and that i had never promised said lady merrifield  i trust you my dears  and as she opened the door to hurry down to prayers the two sisters felt the words very precious and inspiriting  mysie lingered on the step and bravely asked gillian whether her eyes looked like crying  no only a little twinkly answered the elder sister they will be all right after prayers if you dont rub them  no i wont said mysie ill try to mean thy will be done  for i suppose it is his will though it is mammas  im glad you thought of that mysie said gillian you see it is mammas goodness  and gillian added to herself dear little mysie too  if it had not been for her i believe i should have grizzled all prayertime and now i hope i shall attend instead  when everybody rose up from their knees lady merrifield was glad to see two fairly cheerful faces  she tried to lessen the responsibility of the confidants and to get the matter settled by telling lord rotherwood at once and publicly that she had thought his kind invitation over and that she found she must not accept it  perhaps she warily took the moment after she had seen the postman coming up the drive for he had only time to say now thats too bad lily you dont mean it and she to answer yes in sad earnest i do  before the letters came in and the attention of the elders was taken off by the distribution  but valetta whispered to gillian not going oh why  no never mind you wouldnt have gone anywayhush said gillian beginning it may be a little sharply but then becoming dismayed as valetta perhaps a little unhinged by the late pleasures burst forth into such a fit of crying as made everybody look up and her mother tell her to go away if she could not behave better  gillian understanding a sign of the head as permission led her away hearing lord rotherwood observe  there you cruel party before again becoming absorbed in his letter  oh dear sighed fly turning to mysie as they rose from table i am so sorry it would have been so nice and i thought we were safe as mamma had written herself  ah but my mamma hadnt accepted said mysie  phyllis seemed to take this as final and sighed but mysie presently exclaimed i say cant we all play at butterflys ball in the hall after lessons  lessons said fly but its holidaytime  mamma always makes us do a sort of little lesson even in the holidays as she says we get naughty  but i suppose you need not and perhaps she will not make us now you are here  colonel mohun and lord rotherwood were going to darminster to see what was the state of the investigation about mr  flinders  they set out directly after breakfast and after the feeding of the pets where valetta joined them much consoled by the prospect of the extemporary butterflys ball at home lady phyllis with her usual ready adaptability repaired with the others to the schoolroom where the psalms and lessons were read and a small amount of french reading in turn from en quarantaine followed with accompaniment of needlework or drawing after which the children were free  aunt jane was going home to her sunday school and the rockstone festivities  she came down for her final talk with her sister just in time to perceive the folding up of three fivepound notes  lily she said with instant perception i could beat myself for what i told you yesterday  lady merrifield laughed  the girls are very good about it she said now you have found it out see whether that note will make miss hacket swallow it  cant be better but oh  lily it is disgusting could not i rig up something fanciful for the children  thats not so much the point  the generals lady as mrs halfpenny would say is bound not to look like ane scrub as she would be unwelcome to victoria and what would be williams feelings i could hardly have accomplished it even with this and the catastrophe settles the matter  you could not get into my black satin  no i thank you my dear little brownie said lady merrifield elongating herself like a girl measuring heights  ada has a larger assortment as well as a taller person continued miss jane but then they are rather henspeckle and they have all made their first appearance at rotherwood  no no thank you my dear jasper would not like the notioneven if there was not more of me than of ada  i have no doubt it is much better for us  should you have liked it lily  for once in a way  for rotherwoods sake dear old fellow  yes i should  ah well you are a bit of a grande dame yourself  ada enjoys it too or i dont think i ever should go there  surely victoria behaves well to you  far be it from me to say she is not exemplary in her perfect civility to all her husbands relations  ada thinks her charming but oh lily youve never found out what it is to be a little person in a great persons house and to feel ones self scrupulously made one of the family because her husband is so much attached to all of them theres nothing spontaneous about it  i dare say you would get on better though you are not a countrytown old maid you would have an air of the world and of distinction even if you went in your old grey poplin  well i thought better of my lady  you ought not she makes great efforts i am sure and is a pattern of graciousness and cordialityonly thats just what riles one when one knows one is just as well born and all the rest of it  and then im provided with the clever men and the philanthropical folk to talk to i know its a great compliment and they are very nice but id ten times rather take my chance among them  however now ive made the grapes sour for you what do you think about dolores  will you send her to us  not immediately at any rate dear jane  it is very kind in you to wish to take her off our hands but i do want to try her a little longer  i thought she seemed to be softening last night  she was as hard as ever when i went in to wish her goodbye  i thought she had too much headache for conversation when i went in last i think this is a regular upset from unhappiness and reserve  alias temper and deceitfulness  something of both  you know the body often suffers when things are not thrown out in a wholesome explosion at once but go simmering on and i mean to let this poor child alone till she is well  ah here comes the ponycarriage  well lily send her to me if you repent  the sisters came out to find the butterflys ball in full action  fly had become a butterfly by the help of a battered pair of fairy wings stretched on wire which were part of the theatrical stock  the shy little dormouse was creeping about on all fours under a fur jacket with a dilapidated boa for a long tail but her blind brother the mole had escaped from her and had been transformed into the frog by means of a spotted handkerchief over his back and tremendous leapfrog jumps  primrose in another pair of fairy wings was personating the dragonfly and all his relations green orange and blue  valetta in perfect content with the present with a queer pair of ears and a tail made of an old brush sat up and nibbled as squirrel  the grasshopper was performing antics which made him not easily distinguishable from the frog and the spider was actually descending by a rope from the balusters while his mother standing somewhat aghast breathed a hope that poor harlequins fall was not part of the programme  but she did not interfere having trust in the gymnastics that were studied at school by jasper who had been beguiled into the game by flys fascinations  a far more realistic performance than the rotherwood butterflys ball is likely to be said aunt jane aside as the various guests came up for her departing kiss  and much more entertaining if they could only think so  wheres gillian  gillian appeared on the stairs in her own person at the moment  she said mrs  halfpenny had called her and told her that miss dollars was crying and that she did not think the child ought to be left alone long to fret herself but saturday morning needments called away nurse herself so she had ordered in miss gillian as her substitute  gillian was reading to her and had only come away to make her farewells to aunt jane  that is right my dear said her mother i will come and sit with her after luncheon  for the whole youthful family were to turn out to superintend the replantation of the muchenduring fir which it was hoped might survive for many another christmas  however lady merrifield could not keep her promise for a whole party of visitors arrived just after the childrens dinner was over  and its old mrs norgood sighed gillian looking over the balusters and she always slays for ages  one of you young ladies must bide with miss dollars said nurse halfpenny decidedly or we shall have her fretting herself ill again  oh nursie cant you entreated gillian  me miss gillian how can i when miss primrose is going out with the whole clamjamfrie and all the laddies into the wet plantations  na one of ye maun keep the lassie company  yeve had your turn miss gillian so it should be miss mysie  it winna hurt ye bairn ye that hae been rampaging ower the house all the morning  mysie knew it was her turn but she also knew that nurse always favoured gillian and snubbed her  she had a devouring longing to be with her dear fly and a certain sense that she was the preferred one must another pleasure be sacrificed to that very naughty dolores whose misdemeanours had deprived them of the visit to rotherwood  she looked so dismal that gillian said goodnaturedly  really mysie i dont think mamma would mind doloress being left a little while i must go down to see about the tree because mamma gave me a message to old webb  but ill come back directly  or perhaps dolly is going to sleep and does not want any one  go and see  mysie on this crept quietly into the room full of hope of escape but dolores was anything but asleep  oh are you come mysie  now youll go on with the story  i tried but my eyes ache at the back of them and i cant  mysies fate was sealed  she sat down by the fire and took up the book a story for the schoolroom one of the new ones given from the tree  it was the middle of the story and she did not care about it at first especially when she heard flys voice and all the others laughing and chattering on the stairs  didnt they care for her absence and her voice grew thick and her eyes dim but dolores must not think her cross and unwilling and she made a great effort became interested in the girls there described and wondered whether staying with fly would have turned her head after the example of the heroine of the book  dolores did not seem to want to talk  in fact she was clinging to the reading because she could not bear to speak or think of the state of affairs and the story seemed as it were to drown her misery  she knew that her aunt and cousins were far less severe with her than she expected but that could only be because she was ill  had not uncle reginald turned against her and constance  it would all come upon her as soon as she came out of her room and she was rather sorry to believe that she should be up and  about tomorrow morning  mysie read on till the short winter day showed the first symptoms of closing in  then lady merrifield came up  you here little nurse she said  run out now and meet the others  ill stay with dolly mysie knew by the kiss that her mother was  pleased with her but dolores dreaded the talk with her aunt and made herself sleepy     chapter xvi  the inconstancy of constance    the two gentlemen who had gone to darminster brought home tidings that the police who had been put on the track of flinders had telegraphed that it was thought that a person answering to his description had embarked at liverpool in an americanbound steamer  this idea though very uncertain was a relief at least to all except the boys who thought it a great shame that such a rascal should escape and wanted to know whether the americans could not be made to give him up  they did not at all understand their elders being glad for the sake of maurice mohun and his dead wife that the man should not be publicly convicted and above all that dolores should not have to bear testimony against him in court and describe her own very doubtful proceedings  besides there would have been other things to try him for since he had cheated the publishing house which employed him of all he had been able to get into his hands  there was reason to believe that he had heavy debts especially gambling ones and that he had become desperate since he no longer had his stepsister to fall back upon  looking into his room among other papers a halfburnt manuscript was found upon his grate among some exhausted cinders as if he had been trying to use the unfortunate waif of the moorland to eke out his last fire  moreover the proprietor of the politician told colonel mohun of having remonstrated with him on the exceeding weakness and poorness of the constantia poetry which as that indignant personage added was evidently done merely as a lure to the unfortunate young lady  the fifteen pounds had been accepted in an honourable and ladylike manner by the elder sisterbut without any overpowering expression of gratitude  no doubt it was a bitter pill to her forced down by necessity and without guessing that it cost the donors anything  doloress mind was set at rest as to flinderss evasion before night and on the sunday morning even nurse halfpenny could find out nothing the matter with her so that she was obliged to make her appearance as usual  uncle reginald did not kiss her he only gave a cold nod and said good morning  otherwise all went on as usual and it was pleasant to find that fly was as entirely used as they were to learning collect and hymn and copying out texts illustrating catechism and that she was expected to have them ready to repeat them to her mother some time in the afternoon  there was something too that mysie could not have described but which she liked in the manner in which on this morning dolores accepted small acts of good nature such as finding a book for her getting a new pen and helping her to the whereabouts of a scriptural reference  it seemed for the first time as if she liked to receive a kindness and her thank you really had a sound of thanks instead of being much more like i wish you would not  mysie felt really encouraged to be kind and when on setting forth to church everybody was crowding round trying to walk with fly and dolores was going along lonely and deserted mysie resigned her chance of one side of the favourite phyllis and dropped back to give her company to the solitary one  to her surprise and gratification dolores took hold of her hand and listened quite willingly to her chatter about the schemes for the fortnight that fly was to be left with them  presently constance was seen going markedly by the other gate of the churchyard quite out of her usual way and not even looking towards them  it was the last day of the old year and in the midst of the christmas joy there were allusions to it in the services and hymns  something in the tune of days and moments quickly flying touched some chord in doloress spirit and set her off crying  she would have done anything to stop it but there was no helping it great round splashes came down and the more she was afraid of being noticed the worse the choking grew  at last the very worst personshe thoughtto take notice  uncle reginald did so and under cover of a general rising said sternly stop that or go out  stop that  much did the colonel know about a girls tears or how she would have given anything to check them  but here was aunt lily edging down to her taking her by the hand leading her out she did not know how stopping all who would have come after them with helpthen pausing a little in the open frosty air  oh aunt lily i am very sorry  never mind that my dear  do you feel poorly  oh no im quite wellonly  only overcomei dont wondermy dearcan you walk quietly home with me  yes please  nothing was said till they had passed the idle corner where men and halfgrown lads smoked their pipes in anything but sunday trim and stared at the lady making her exit till they were through the short street with shop windows closed and a strong atmosphere of cooking and had come into the quiet lane leading to the paddock  then lady merrifield laid her hand on the girls shoulder very gently and said it was too much for you my dear you are not quite strong yet  oh yes im well  only i am so veryvery miserable and the gust of sobs and tears rushed on her again  dear child i should like to be able to help you  you cant ive done it andand theyll all be against me always uncle regie and all  uncle regie was very much hurt but im sure he will forgive you when he sees how sorry you are you know we all hope this is going to be a fresh start  i am sure you were deceived  yes said dolores  i never could have thought heuncle alfredwas such a dreadful man  i expect that since he lost your mothers influence and help he may have sunk lower than when you had seen him before  did your father give you any directions about him  no  father hated to hear of him and never spoke about him if he could help it and we thought it was all mohun high notions because he wasnt quite a gentleman  i see  indeed my dear though you have done very wrong i have already felt that there was great excuse for you in trying to keep up intercourse with a person who belonged to your mother  i wish you had told me but i suppose you were afraid  yes said dolores  and i thought you were sure to be cross and harsh she muttered  and then suddenly looking up oh aunt lily everybody is angry but youyou and mysie  please go on being kind i believe youve been good to me always  my dear ive tried said lady merrifield with fears in her brown eyes and a choke in her voice caressing the hand that had been put into hers  i have wished very much to make you happy with us but the ways of a large family must be a trial to a newcomer  dolores raised her face for a kiss and said i see it now  but i did not like everything always and i thought aunts were sure to be unkind  that was very hard  and why  she was heard to mutter something about aunts in books always being cross  ah my dear i suppose there are some unkind aunts but i am sure there are a great many more who wish with all their hearts to make happy homes for their nieces  i hope now we may do so  i have more hope than ever i had and so i shall write to your father  and pleaseplease cried dolores dont let uncle regie write him a very dreadful letter i know he will  i think you can prevent that best yourself by telling uncle regie how sorry you are  he was specially grieved because he thinks you told him two direct falsehoods  oh i didnt think they were that said dolores for it was true that father did not leave anything with me for uncle alfred  and i did not know whether it was me whom he saw at darminster  i did tell you one once aunt lily when you asked if i gave constance a note  at least she gave it to me and not i to her  indeed i dont tell falsehoods aunt lilyi mean i never did at home but constance said everybody said those sort of things at school and that one was driven to it when one was  was what my dear  tyrannized over dolores got out  ah dolly i am afraid constance was no real friend  it was a great mistake to think her like miss hacket  and now she has sent back all my notes and wont look at me or speak to me and doloress tears began afresh  it is very ungenerous of her but very likely she will be very sorry to have done so when her first anger is over and she understands that you were quite as much deceived as she was  but i shall never care for her again  it is not like mysie who never stopped being kind all the timenor gillian either  i shall cut her next time  you should remember that she has something to forgive  i dont want you to be intimate with her but i think it would be better if instead of quarrelling openly you wrote a note to say that you were deceived and that you are very sorry for what you brought on her  i should not have gone on with it but for her and her stupid poems  can you bear to tell me how it all was my dear  i do not half understand it  and on the way home and in lady merrifields own room dolores found it a relief to pour forth an explanation of the whole affair beginning with that meeting with mr  flinders at exeter of which no one had heard and going on to her indignation at the inspection of her letters and how constance had undertaken to conduct her correspondence and that made it seem as if she must write to some oneso she wrote to uncle alfred  and then constance becoming excited at the prospect of a literary connection all the rest followed  it was a great relief to have told it all and lady merrifield was glad to see that the sense of deceit was what weighed most heavily upon her niece and seemed to have depressed her all along  indeed the aunt came to the conclusion that though dolores alone might still have been sullen morose and disagreeable perhaps very reserved she never would have kept up the systematic deceit but for constance  the errors regarded as sin weighed on lady merrifields mind but she judged it wiser not to press that thought on an unprepared spirit trusting that just as dolores had wakened to the sense of the human love that surrounded her hitherto disbelieved and disregarded so she might yet awake to the feeling of the divine love and her offence against it  the afternoon was tolerably free for the gentlemen including the elder boys walked to evensong at a neighbouring church noted for its musical services and lady merrifield as she said lashed herself up to go with gillian carry back the remnant of the unhappy waif and have it out with constance who would she feared never otherwise understand the measure of her own delinquency and from whom perhaps evidence might be extracted which would palliate the poor childs offence in the eyes of colonel mohun  both the hacket sisters looked terribly frightened when she appeared and the elder one made an excuse for getting her outside the door to beseech her to be careful dear constance was so nervous and so dreadfully upset by all she had undergone  lady merrifield was not the least nervous of the two and she felt additionally displeased with constance for not having said one word of commiseration when her sister had inquired for dolores  on returning to the drawingroom lady merrifield found the young lady standing by the window playing with the blind and looking as if she wanted to make her escape  i do not know whether you will be sorry or glad to see this said lady merrifield producing a halfburnt roll of paper  it was found in mr  flinderss grate and my brother thought you would be glad that it should not get into strange hands  oh it was cruel it was base what a wicked man he is cried constance with hot tears as she beheld the mutilated condition of her poor waif  yes it was a most unfortunate thing that you  should have run into intercourse with such an utterly untrustworthy person  i was grossly deceived lady merrifield said constance clasping her hands somewhat theatrically  i shall never believe in any one again  not without better grounds i hope was the answer  your poor little friend is terribly broken down by all this  dont call her my friend  lady merrifield  she has used me shamefully what business had she to tell me he was her uncle when he was no such thing  she had been always used to call him so  dont tell me lady merrifield said constance who after her first fright was working herself into a passion  you dont know what a little viper you have been warming nor what things she has been continually saying of you  she told me  lady merrifield held up her hand with authority  stay constance  do you think it is generous in you to tell me this  i am sure you ought to know  then why did you encourage her  i pitied heri believed heri never thought she would have led me into this  how did she lead you  always talking about her precious persecuted uncle  i believe she was in league with him all the time  that is nonsense said lady merrifield as you must see if you reflect a little  dolores was too young to have been told this mans real character she only knew that her mother who had spent her childhood with him treated him as a brother and did all she could for him  dolores did very wrongly and foolishly in keeping up a connection with him unknown to me but i cannot help feeling there was great excuse for her and she was quite as much deceived as you were  oh of course you stand by your own niece lady merrifield  if you knew what horrid things she said about your pride and unkindness as she called it you would not think she deserved it  nay that is exactly what does most excuse her in my eyes  her fancying such things of me was what did prevent her from confiding in me  constance had believed herself romantic but the christian chivalry of lady merrifields nature was something quite beyond her  she muttered something about dolores not deserving which made her visitor really angry and say we had better not talk of deserts  dolores is a mere childa motherless child who had been a good deal left to herself for many months  i let her come to you because she seemed shy and unhappy with us and i did not like to deny her the one pleasure she seemed to care for  i knew what an excellent person and thorough lady your sister is and i thought i could perfectly trust her with you  i little thought you would have encouraged her in concealment andi must saydeceit and thus made me fail in the trust her father reposed in me  i would never have done it constance sobbed but for what she said about you  lady merrifield  well and even if i am such a hard severe person does that make it honourable or right to help the child i trusted to you to carry on this underhand correspondence  constance hung her head  her sister had said the same to her but she still felt herself the most injured party and thought it very hard that she should be so severely blamed for what the girls at her school treated so lightly  she said i am very sorry  lady merrifield but it was not exactly the tone of repentance and it ended with if it had not been for her i should never have done it  i suppose not for there would have been no temptation  i was in hopes that you would have shown some kindlier and more generous feeling towards the younger girl who could not have gone so far wrong without your assistance and who feels your treatment of her very bitterly but to find you incapable of understanding what you have done makes me all the more glad that the friendshipif friendship it can be called is broken off between you  goodbye  i think when you are older and wiser you will be very sorry to recollect the doings of the last few months  lady merrifield walked away and found on her return that dolores had succeeded in writing to her father and was so utterly tired out by the feelings it had cost her that she was only fit to lie on the sofa and sleep  gillian was of course not seen till she came home from evening service  oh mamma she said what did you do to constance  why  well i heard you shut the front door  and presently after there came such a noise through the wall that all the girls pricked up their ears and miss hacket jumped up in a fright  if it had been val one would have called it a naughty child roaring  what did i send her into hysterics  i suppose as she is grown up it must have the fine name but it wasnt a bit like poor dollys choking  i am sure she did it to make her sister come well of course miss hacket went away and i did the best i could but what could one do with all these screeches and bellowings breaking out  for shame  gill  i cant help it mamma  if you had only seen their faces when the uproar came in a fresh gust how they whispered and some looked awe struck  i thought i had better get rid of them and come home myself but miss hacket met me and implored me to stay and i was weakminded enough to do so  i wish i hadnt for it was only to be provoked past bearing  that horrid girl has poisoned even miss hackets mind and she thinks you have been hard on her darling  you did not know how nervous and timid dear connie is  well gill i confess she made me very angry and i told her what i thought of her  and that she didnt choose to hear  did you see her again  no i am thankful to say i did not  but miss hacket would go on all teatime explaining and explaining for me to tell you how dear connie is so affectionate and so easily led and how dolores came over her with persuasions and deceived her  i declare i never liked dolly so well before  at any rate she doesnt make professions and not a bit more fuss than she can help  and there was miss hacket getting brandy cherries and strong coffee and i dont know what all because dear connie was so overcome and dear lady merrifield was quite under a mistake and so deceived by dolores  i told miss hacket you were never under a mistake nor deceived  you didnt gillian  yes i did and the stupid woman only wanted to kiss me but i wouldnt let her and said i was very right to stand up for my dear mamma  as if that had anything to do with it what are you laughing at mamma  why uncle regie is laughing and cousin rotherwood what is it  at the two partisans who never stand up for their own families said uncle regie  but its true cried gillian  what that i am never mistaken nor deceived said lady merrifield  except when you took miss constance for a sensible woman eh said her brother  that i never did but i did take her for a moderately honourable one  well that was a mistake owned gillian  and miss hacket is as bad theres no gratitude  hush broke in her mother and gillian stopped abashed while lady merrifield continued i wont have miss hacket abused  she is only blinded by sisterly affection  i dont think i can go there again said gillian after what she said about you  nonsense said her mother  dont be as bad as constance in trying to make me angry by telling me all poor dollys grumblings  follow your mothers example gillian said lord rotherwood and if possible never hear certainly never attend to what any one says of you behind your back  is said to have said of you you should add rotherwood put in the colonel  it is a decree worse than eavesdropping  oh regie exclaimed his sister  well not perhaps for your own honour and conscience but the keyhole is a more trustworthy medium than the reporter  thats a strong way of stating it but at any rate the keyhole has no temper nor imagination or prejudice of its own said lady merrifield  no and as far as it goes it enables you to judge of the frame in which the words even if correctly reported were spoken added colonel mohun  the moral of which is said lord rotherwood drolly that gillian is not to take notice of anyones observations upon her unless she has heard them through the keyhole  and so one would never hear them at all  q e d said lord rotherwood  and now lily do you  ever sing the two eveninghymns  ken and keble now as the family used to do on sundays at the old court long ere the days of  hymns ancient and modern  dont we said lady merrifield  only all our best voices will be singing it at rawul pindee  and as she struck a note on the piano all the younger people still up mysie phyllis wilfred and valetta gathered round from the outer room to join in their evening sunday delight  fly put her hand into her fathers and whispered you told me about it daddy  he began to sing but his voice thickened as he missed the tones once associated with it  and lady merrifield too nearly broke down as with all her heart she sang hopefully                      now lord the gracious work begin     chapter xvii  the stone melting    it was with a strange feeling that dolores woke on the new years morning that something was very sad and strange and yet that there was a sense of relief   for one thing that terrible confession to her father was written and was no longer a weight hanging over her  and though his answer was still to come that was months away  there was uncle regie greatly displeased with her there was constance treating her as a traitor there was the mischief done and yet something hard and heavy was gone  something sweet and precious had come in on her surely it was that now she knew and felt that she could trust in aunt liliasyes and in mysie  she got up quite looking forward to meeting those gentle brown eyes of her aunts that she seemed never before to have looked into and to feeling the sweet motherly kiss which had so mud  more meaning in it now as almost to make up for uncle reginalds estrangement  she even anticipated gladly those ten minutes alone with her aunt which she used to dislike so much hoping that the holidaytime would not hinder them  really wishing to please her aunt she had learnt her portion perfectly and lady merrifield showed that she appreciated the effort though still it was more a lesson than a reality  my dear she said i am afraid this is another blow for youit came this morning  it was the account from professor muhlwassers german publisher amounting to a few shillings more than six pounds  and an announcement that the books were on the way  oh cried dolores i thought he was dead he told me so uncle alfred i mean and it was only to get the money how could he be so wicked  i am afraid that was all he cared for  and what shall i do  aunt lily  will you pay it please and take all my allowance till it is made up  i think it will be more comfortable for you if i do something of that sort though i dont think you should go entirely without money  you have a pound a quarter  i was going to give you yours at once  oh take itpray  suppose i give you five shillings instead of twenty  i do not think it well to leave you with nothing for a year and a half and this is nearly what mysie has  a shilling a monthvery well  i wish i could pay it all at once  no doubt you do my dear but this will keep you in mind for a long time what a dangerous thing you did in giving away money you had no right to dispose of  yes said dolores  mother earned money for him  i know she never took fathers without asking him but i couldnt earn and couldnt ask  lady merrifield kissed her for very joy to hear no sullenness in her tone and then all went to church together on the new years day that was to be the beginning of better things  lord rotherwood had just time to go before meeting the train which was to take him to high court leaving his fly too much used to his absences to be distressed about them and in fact somewhat crazy about a notion which gillian had started that morning of getting up a little play to surprise him when he came back for twelfth day as he promised to do  mamma declared that if it was in french and the words were learnt every morning before halfpast eleven it should supersede all other lessons but such was the hatred of the whole boy faction to french that they declared they had rather do rational sensible lessons twice over than learn such rot and this carried the day  the drama proposed was that one in an old number of  aunt judy where the village mayor is persuaded by the drummer to fine the girls for wearing lace caps the french original existed in the house and fly started the idea that the male performers should speak english and the female french but this was laughed down  in the midst uncle reginald came to the door and called lilias can you speak to me a minute  lady merrifield went out into the hall to him  heres a policeman come over lily  they have got the fellow flinders   yes arrested him on board a steamer at bristol  oh i wish they had let it alone  so do i  they are bringing him back  the darminster city bench sits today and they want that unlucky child over there to make her deposition for his committal  cant they commit him without her  not for the forgery  the bank people are bent on prosecuting for that and we cant stop them  i suppose she can be depended on  reginald dont i told you the deceit was an unnatural growth from constances pseudo sentiment  well get her ready to come with me said the colonel with a gesture of doubt we must catch the 1250  the superintendent brought a fly  you will frighten her out of her senses  i cant let her go alone with you in this mood  as you please if you choose to knock yourself up  ill tell the superintendent and walk on to the station  youve not a moment to lose so dont let her stand dawdling and crying  it was a hard task for lady merrifield  she called dolores whom mysie was inviting to be one of the village maidens and bade her put on her things quickly  she ordered cold meat and wine into the diningroom called gillian into her room and explained while dressing and bade her keep the others away  then meeting dolores on the stairs took her into the diningroom and made her swallow some cold beef and drink some sherry before telling her that the magistrates at darminster wanted to ask her some questions  dolores looked pale and frightened and exclaimed  oh but he has got away  my dear i am grieved to say that he has not  dolores understood and submitted more quietly and resignedly than her aunt had feared  she was a barristers daughter and once or twice her father had taken her and her mother part of the way on circuit with him and she had been in court so that she had known from the first that if her uncle were arrested there was no choice but that she must speak out  so she only trembled very much and said  aunt lily are you going with me  indeed i am my poor child  uncle regie is gone on  no more was spoken then but dolores put her cold hand into her aunts muff  gillian kept all  the flock prisoned in the schoolroom  wilfred val and fergus rushed to the window and were greatly disappointed not to see a policeman on the box taking dolores to be triedas fergus declared and wilfred insisted just because gillian and mysie contradicted it with all their might  he continued to repeat it with variations and exaggerations until jasper heard him and declared that he should have a thorough good licking if he said so again administering a cuff by way of earnest  wilfred howled and was ordered not to be such an ape and fly looked on in wonder at the domestic discipline  the superintendent had in fact walked on with uncle reginald and dolores saw nothing of him but was put into an empty firstclass carriage into which her aunt followed her but her uncle observing you know how to manage her lily betook himself to a smoking carriage and left them to themselves  dolores was never a very talking girl and the habit of silence had grown upon her  she leant against her aunt and she put her arm round her and did not attempt to say anything till she asked  will he be there  i dont know i am afraid he will  it is very sad for you my poor dolly but we must recollect that after all it may be much better for him to be stopped now than to go on and get worse and worse in some strange country  dolores did not ask what she was to do she knew enough already about trials to understand that she was only to answer questions and she presently said  this cant be his trial  there are no assizes now  no this is only for the committal  it will very soon be over if you will only answer quietly and steadily  if you do so i think uncle regie will be pleased and tell your father  i am sure i shall  dolores pressed up closer and laid her cheek against the soft sealskin in the midst of her trouble there was a strange wonder in her  could this be really the aunt whom she had thought so cruel unjust and tyrannical and from whom she had so carefully hidden her feelings nobody got into the carriage and just before reaching darminster lady merrifield made a great effort over her own shyness and said  now dolly we will pray a little prayer that you may be a faithful witness and that god may turn it all to good for your poor uncle  dolores was very much surprised and did not know whether she liked it or not but she saw her aunts closed eyes and uplifted hands and she tried to follow the example  the train stopped and her uncle came to the door looking inquiringly at her  she will be good and brave said her aunt and quickly passing across the platform dolores found herself beside her aunt with her uncle opposite in another fly  things had been arranged for them considerately and after they came to the guildhall where the city magistrates were sitting colonel mohun went at once into court the others were taken to a little room and waited there a few minutes before colonel mohun came to call for his niece  it was a long room with a rail at one end and dolores knew with a strange thrill which made her shudder that mr flinders was there but she could not bear to look at him and only squeezed hard at the hand of her aunt who asked in a somewhat shaky voice if she might come with her niece  certainly certainly  lady merrifield said one of the magistrates and chairs were set both for her and colonel mohun  you are miss mohun i thinkmay i ask your christian name in full and then she had to spell it and likewise tell her exact age after which she was put on oathas she knew enough of trials to expect  are you residing with lady merrifield  yes  but your father is living  yes but he is in the fiji islands  will you favour us with his exact name  maurice devereux mohun  when did he leave england  the fifth of last september  did he leave any money with you  yes  in what form  a cheque on ws bank  to bearer or order  to order  what was the date  i think it was the 31st of august but i am not sure  for how much  for seven pounds  when did you part with it  on the friday before christmas day  did you do anything to it first  i wrote my name on the back  what did you do with it  i sent it to her voice became a little hoarse but she brought out the wordsto mr flinders  is this the same  yesonly some one has put ty to the seven in writing and 0 to the figure 7  can you swear to the rest as your fathers writing and your own  the evidence of the bankers clerk as to the cashing of the cheque had been already taken and the magistrate said thank you  miss mohun i think the case is complete and we need not trouble you any more  but the prisoners voice made dolores start and shudder again as he said  i beg your pardon sir but you have not asked the young ladythere was a sort of sneer in his voicehow she sent this draft  did not you send it direct by the post demanded the magistrate  no i gave it to again she paused and the words gave it to were authoritatively repeated so that she had no choice  i gave it to miss constance hacket to send  you will observe sir said flinders in a somewhat insolent tone that the evidence which the witness has been so ready to adduce is incomplete  there is another link between her hands and mine  you may reserve that point for your defence on your trial rejoined the magistrate  there is quite sufficient evidence for your committal  there was already a movement to let dolores be taken away by her uncle and aunt so as to spare her from any reproach or impertinence that flinders might launch at her  she was like some one moving in a dream glad that her aunt should hold her hand as if she were a little child saying as they came out into the street very clearly and steadily done dolly wasnt it uncle regie  yes he said absently  we must look out or we shant catch the 450 train  he almost threw them into a cab and made the driver go his quickest so that after all they had full ten minutes to spare  it made dolores sick at heart to go near the waiting and refreshmentrooms where she and constance had spent all that time with flinders but she could not bear to say so before her uncle and he was bent on getting some food for lady merrifield  not soup regie there might not be time to swallow it  a glass of milk for us each please we can drink that at once and anything solid that we can take with us  i am sure your mouth must be dry my dear  very dry it was and dolores gladly swallowed the milk and found when seated in the train that she was really hungry enough to eat her full share of the sandwiches and buns which the colonel had brought in with him and then she sat resting against her aunt closed her eyes and half dozed in the rattle of the train not moving in the pause at the stations but quite conscious that colonel mohun said not a spark of feeling for anybody not even for that man as hard as a stone  for shame regie said her aunt  how angry you would have been if she had made a scene  i should have liked her better  no you wouldnt when you come to understand  theres stuff in her and depth too  aye shes deep enough  poor child said lady merrifield tenderly  and then the train went on and the noise drowned the voices so that dolores only partly heard you will see how she will rise and the answer you may be right i hope so  but i cant get over deliberate deceit  he settled himself in his corner and lady merrifield durst not move nor raise her voice lest she should break what seemed such deep slumber but which really was half torpor half a dull dismay holding fast eyes lips and limbs and which really became sleep so that dolores did not hear the next bit of conversation during the ensuing halt  i say lily i did not like the fellows last question  he means to give trouble about it  i was sorry the other name was brought in but it must have come sooner or later  thats true but if she cant swear to the figures on the draft ten to one that the fellow will get off  you dont doubt  no no but theres the chance for the defence and he was sharp enough to see it  there is nothing to be said or done about it of course  of course not  theres nothing for it but to let it alone  they went on again and when the train reached silverton dolly was dreaming that her father had come and that he said uncle alfred should be hanged unless she found the money for professor muhlwasser  she even looked about for him and said wheres father when she was wakened to get out  gillian came up to her mothers room to hear what had happened and to give an account of the day which had gone off prosperously by harrys help  he had kept excellent order at dinner and theres something about fly which makes even wilfred be mannerly before her  and then they had gone out and had made fly free of the thorn fortress  my dear that must have been terribly damp and cold at this time of year  i thought of that mamma and so we didnt sit down and made it a guerrilla war only fergus couldnt understand the difference between guerrillas and gorillas and would thump upon himself and roar when they were in ambush  rather awkward for the ambush  yes wilfred said he was a traitor and tied him to a tree and then fly found him crying and would have let him out but she couldnt get the knots undone and what do you think  she made wilfred cut the string himself with his own knife i never knew such a girl for making every one do as she pleases  then when it got dark we came in and had a sort of a kind of a rehearsal only that nobody knew any of the parts or what each was to be  a sort of a kind indeed it must have been  but we think the play will be lovely you cant think how nice fly was  you know we settled for her to be annette the dear funny naughty girl but as soon as she saw that val wanted the part she said she didnt care and gave it up directly and i dont think we ought to let her and hal thinks so too and all the boys are very angry and say val will make a horrid mess of it  then mysie wanted to give up the good girl to fly and only be one of the chorus but fly says she had rather be one of the chorus ones herself than that  so we settled that you should fix the parts and we would abide by your choice  i hope there was no quarrelling  nno only a little falling upon val by the boys and fly put a stop to that  oh mamma if it were only possible to turn dolly into fly i cant help saying it we seemed to get on so much better just because we hadnt poor dolly to make a deadweight and tempt the boys to be tiresome while fly made everything go off well  i cant describe it she didnt in the least mean to keep order or interfere but somehow squabbles seem to die away before her and nobody wants to be troublesome  dear little thing it is a very sweet disposition  but gill i do believe that we shall see poor dolly take a turn now  well having quarrelled with that constance is in her favour  try and think kindly of her trouble  gill and then it will be easier to be kind to her  gillian sighed  falsehood and determined opposition to her mother were the greatest possible crimes in her eyes and at her age it was not easy to separate the sin from the sinner  new years night was always held to be one of especial merriment but lady merrifield was so much tired out by her expedition that she hardly felt equal to presiding over any sports and proposed that instead the young folk should dance  gillian and hal took turns to play for them and uncle reginald and fly were in equal request as partners  it was mysie who came to draw dolores out of her corner and begged her to be her partnerif you wouldnt very much rather not she said in a pleading wistful voice  dolores would very much rather not but she saw that mysie would be left out altogether if she did not consent as hal was playing and uncle regie was dancing with primrose  she thought of resolutions to turn over a new leaf and not to refuse everything so she said yes this once and it was wonderful how much freshened she felt by the gay motion and perhaps by mysies merry goodnatured eyes and caressing hand  after that she had another turn with gillian and one with hal and even one with fergus because as he politely informed her no one else would have him for a quadrille  but just as this was in progress and she could not help laughing at his ridiculous mistakes and contempt of rules she met uncle reginalds eye fixed on her in wonder  he thinks i dont care thought she to herself  all her pleasure was gone and she moved so dejectedly that her aunt watching from the sofa called her and told her she was overtired and sent her to bed  dolores was tired but not in the way which made it harder instead of easier to sleep or rather she slept just enough to relax her full consciousness and hold over herself and bring on her a misery of terror and loneliness and feeling of being forsaken by the whole world  and when she woke fully enough to understand the reality it was no better she felt then the position she had put herself into and almost saw in the dark flinderss malicious vindictive glance constances anger uncle regies cold severe look and worse than all her father reading her letter  she fell again into an agony of sobbing not without a little hope that aunt lily would be again brought to her side  at last the door was softly pushed open in the dark but it was not aunt lily it was mysies little bare feet that patted up to the bed her arms that embraced her cheek that was squeezed against the tearful oneoh dolly dolly please dont cry so sadly  oh it is so dreadful mysie  are you illlike the other night  nobutmysiei cant bear it  i dont want to call mamma said mysie thoughtfully for she is so much tired and uncle regie and gill said she would be quite knocked up and got her to come up to bed when we went  dolly would it be better if i got into your bed and cuddled you up  oh yes oh yes please do theres a dear good mysie  there was not much room but that mattered the less and the hugging of the warm arms seemed to heal the terrible sense of being unloved and forsaken the presence to drive away the visions of angry faces that had haunted her but there was the longing for fellowfeeling on her and she said thats nice oh mysie you cant think what it is like uncle regie said i didnt care and he could never forgive deliberate deceitand i was so fond of uncle regie  oh but he will if you never tell a story again said mysieand as she felt a gesture implying despairyes they do i told a story once  you mysie i thought you never did  yes once when we were crossing to ireland and nurse wouldnt let wilfred tie our handkerchiefs together and fish over the side and he was very angry and threw her parasol into the sea when she wasnt looking and i knew she would be so cross that when she asked me if i knew what was become of it i said no and thought i didnt really but then it came over me again and again that i had told a story and oh i was so miserable whenever i thought of itat church and saying my prayers you know and mamma was poorly and couldnt come to us at night for ever so long but at last i could bear it no longer i heard her say mysie is always truthful and then i did get it out and told her  and oh she and papa were so kind and they did quite and entirely forgive me  yes you told of your own accord and they were your ownnot uncle regie  ah mysie everybody hates me  i saw them all looking at me  no no dont say such things  dolly  none of us do anything so shocking  yes jasper does and wilfred and val  no no no they dont hate only they are tiresome sometimes but if you wouldnt be cross they would be nice directlyat least japs and val  and tisnt hating with willie only he thinks teasing is fun  and you and gillian  you can only just bear me  no no no with a great hug thats not true  you like fly ever so much better  she is so dear and so funny said mysie the truthful but somehow dolly dear do you know i think if you and i got to love one another like real friends it would be nicer still than even flybecause you are here like one of us you know and besides it would be more because you are harder to get at  will you be my own friend  dolly  oh mysie i must and there was a fresh kissing and hugging  and theres mamma added mysie  yes i know aunt lily does now but oh if you had seen uncle alfreds face and heard uncle regie and dolly began to sob again as they returned on her  i see them whenever i shut my eyes  darling whispered mysie when i feel bad at night i always kneel up in bed and say my prayers again  do you ever feel bad  oh yes when im frightened or if ive been naughty and havent told mamma  shall we do it dolly  i dont know what that has to do with it but well try  mamma told me something to say out of  the two little girls rose up with clasped hands in their bed and mysie whispered very low but so that her companion heard and said with her a few childish words of confession pleading and entreating for strength and then the lords prayer and the sweet old verse            i lay my body down to sleep           i give my soul to christ to keep           wake i at morn as wake i never           i give my soul to christ for ever   ah but i am afraid of that  i dont like it said dolores as they lay down again  it wont make one never wake returned mysie  and i do like to give my soul to christ  it seems so to rest one and make one not afraid  i dont know said dolores and why did you say the lords prayer that hasnt anything to do with it  oh dolly when he is our father near though our own dear fathers are far away and theres deliver us from evilall that hurts us you knowand forgive us  its all there  i never thought that said dolores  i think you have some different prayers from mine  old nurse taught me long ago  i wish you would always say yours with me  you make them nicer  mysie answered with a hug and a murmured if i can and offered to say the 121st psalm her other step to comfort and as she said it she resolved in her mind whether she could grant doloress request for she was not sure whether she should be allowed  to leave her room before saying her own and she i knew enough of dolores by this time to be aware that to say she would ask mammas leave would put an end to all  i know was her final decision ill say my own first and then come to dollys room  but by that time dolores was asleep even if mysie had not been too sleepy to speak  she meant to have rushed to the room she shared with valetta before it was time to get up but lots found the black head and the brown together on doloress pillow wrapped in slumber and though mysie flew home as soon as she was well awake mrs halfpenny descended on her while she was yet in her bath and inflicted a sharp scolding for the malpractice of getting into her cousins bed  but dolly was so miserable nurse and mamma was too tired to call  then you should have called me miss mysie and id have sorted her well you kenned well tis a thing not to be done and at your age ye should have minded your duties better  and nurse even intercepted mysie on her way to doloress room and declared she would have no messing and gossiping in one anothers rooms  miss mysie was getting spoilt among strangers  mysie went down with a strong sense of having been disobedient as well as of grief for doloress disappointment  happily mamma was late that morning and nobody was in her room but primrose  poor mysie had soon with tears in her eyes confessed her transgression  her mothers tears to her great surprise were on her cheek together with a kiss dear child i am not displeased  indeed i am not  i will tell nurse  it must not be a habit but this was an exception and i am only thankful you could comfort her  and mamma may i go now to her  she said i could help her to say her prayers and i think she only has little baby ones that her nurse taught her and she doesnt see into the lords prayer  my dear my dear if you can help her to pray you will do the thing most sure to be a blessing to her of all  and when mysie was gone lady merrifield knelt down afresh in thankfulness     chapter xviii  mysie and dolores    things were going on more quietly at silverton  that is to say there were no outward agitations for the house was anything but quiet  lady merrifield had no great love for childrens parties where as she said they sat up too late to eat and drink what was not good for them and to get presents that they did not care about and though at dublin it had been necessary on her husbands account to give and take such civilities she had kept out of the exchange at silverton  but on the other hand there were festivals and she promoted a full amount of special treats at home among themselves or with only an outsider or two and she endured any amount of noise provided it was not quarrelsome overboisterous or at unfit times  there was the school tea and magiclantern when mr pollock acted as exhibitor and harry as spokesman and worked them up gradually from grave and beautiful scenes like the cedars of lebanon the parthenon and colosseum with full explanations through dissolving views of cottage and bridge by day and night summer and winter of lifeboat rescue and the siege of sevastopol with shells flying on to jack and the beanstalk and the new tale of a tub the seaserpent and the nose grinding lady phylliss ecstacy was surpassing more especially as she found her beloved little maidofallwork and was introduced to all that small persons younger brothers and sisters  here they met miss hacket who was in charge of a class  she comported herself just as usual and gillians dignity and displeasure gave way before her homely cordiality  constance had not come as indeed nothing but childhood sympathy with responsibility for childhood could make the darkness stuffiness and noise of the exhibition tolerable  even lady merrifield trusted her flock to its two elders and enjoyed a teteatete evening with her brother who profited by it to advise her strongly to send dolores to their sister jane before harm was done to her own children  i would not see that little mysie of yours spoilt for all the world said he  nor i but i dont think it likely to happen  do you know that they are always after each other chattering in their bedrooms at night  i hear them through the floor  only one nightmysie told me all about iti believe mysie will do more for that poor child than any of us  uncle regie shrugged his shoulders a little  yes i know i was wrong before when i wouldnt take janes warning but that was not about one of my own and besides poor dolores is very much altered  ill  tell you what lily when any one i dont care who man or woman or child once is given up to that sort of humbug and deceit carrying it on a that girl dolores had done i would never trust again an inch beyond what i could see  it eats into the very marrow of the boneseverything is acting afterwards  that would be saying no repentance was possiblethat jacob never could become israel  i only say i have never seen it  then i hope you will nay that you do  i believe your displeasure is the climax of all dollys troubles  but colonel reginald mohun could not forgive the having been so entirely deceived where he had so fully trusted and there was no shaking his opinion that dolores was essentially deceitful and devoid of feeling and that the few demonstrations of emotion that were brought before him were only put on to excite the compassion of her weakly goodnatured aunt so he only answered you always were a soft one lily  to which she only answered we shall see knowing that in his present state of mind he would only set down the hopeful tokens that she perceived either to hypocrisy on the girls side or weakness on hers  dolores had indeed gone with the others rather because she could not bear remaining to see her uncles altered looks than because she expected much pleasure  and she had the satisfaction of sitting by mysie and holding her hand which had become a very great comfort in her forlorn stateso great that she forebore to hurt her cousins feelings by discoursing of the dissolving views she had seen at a london party  also she exacted a promise that this station should always be hers  mysie on her side was in some of the difficulties of a popular character for fly felt herself deserted and attacked her on the first opportunity  what does make you always go after dolly instead of me mysie  do you like her so much better  oh no but you have them all and she has nobody  well but she has been so horridly naughty hasnt she  i dont think she meant it  one never does  at least im sure i dontand mamma always says it is nonsense to say that  im not sure whether it is always said mysie thoughtfully for sometimes one does worse than one knows  once i made a mousetrap of a beautiful large sheet of bluey paper and it turned out to be an order come down to papa  mamma and alethea gummed it up as well as ever they could again but all the officers had to know what had happened to it  and were you punished  i was not allowed to go into papas room without one of the elder ones till after my next birthday but that wasnt so bad as papas being so vexed and everybody knowing it and major denny would talk about mice and mousetraps every time he saw me till i quite hated my name  and im sure you didnt mean to cut up an important paper  no but i did do a little wrong for we had no leave to take anything not quite in the waste basket and this had been blown off the table and was on the floor outside  they didnt punish me so much i think because of that  papa said it was partly his own fault for not securing it when he was called off  you see little wrongs that one knows turn out great wrongs that one would never think of and that is so very dreadful and makes me so very sorry for dolores  i didnt think you would like a cross naughty girl like that more than your own fly  no no fly dont say that  i dont really like her half so well you know only if you would help me to be kind to her  i am sure my mother wouldnt wish me to have anything to do with her i dont think she would have let me come here if she had known what sort of girl she is  but your papa knew when he left you  oh papa yes but he can never see anything amiss in a mohun i heard her say so  and he wants me to be friends with you dear darling friends like him and your uncle claude mysie so you must be and not be always after that dolores  i want to be friends with both  one can have two friends  no no no not two best friends  and you are my best friend mysie ever so much better than alberta fitzhugh if only youll come always to me this little time when im here and sit by me instead of that dolly  i do love you very much fly  and youll sit by me at the penny reading tonight  i promised dolly  but she may sit on the other side  no said phyllis with jealous perverseness  i dont care if that dolly is to be on the other side youll talk to nobody but her now mysie i had been writing to ask daddy to let you come home with me you yourself to the butterflys ball but if you wont sit by me you may stay with your dear dolores  oh fly when you know i promised and there is the other side  but fly had been courted enough by all the cousinhood to have become exacting and displeased at having any rival to the honour of her hand so she pouted and said i dont care about it if you have her  i shall sit between val and jasper  one must be thirteen with a dash of the sentiment of a budding friendship to enter into all that sitting by involves and in mysies case here was her compassionate promise standing not only between her and the avowed preference of one so charming as fly but possibly depriving her of the chances of the wonders of the butterflys ball  no wonder that disconsolate tears came into her eyes as she uttered another pleading oh fly how can you  you must choose said the offended young lady you cant have us both  to which argument she stuck being offended as well as scandalized at being set aside for such a culprit as dolores whose misdemeanours and discourtesy were equally shocking to her imagination  mysie could confide her troubles to no one for she was aware that caring about sitting together was treated by the elders as egregious folly but a promise was a promise with her and she held staunchly to her purpose though between dolores and miss vincent she lost all those delightful asides which enhanced the charms of the amusing parts of the penny reading and beguiled the duller onesof which there were many since it was more concert than penny reading people being rather shy of committing themselves to readinghal mr  pollock and the schoolmaster being the only volunteers in that line  gillian had sorely against the grain to play a duet with constance hacket  the two young ladies had met one another with freezing civility in the classroom and to those who understood matters the stiffness of their necks and shoulders as they sat at the piano spoke unutterable things  but there had never been any real liking between constance and the younger merrifields and the mother did not trouble herself much about this knowing that the vexation of the elder sister about whom she did care would pass off with friendly intercourse  flys displeasure did not last long for mysie bad more attractions for her than any one else and she was a goodhumoured creature  there was a joyous twelfthnight with homemade cake and homecharacters prepared by mamma and gillian and followed up by games in which dolores had a share promoted by her aunt who was very anxious to keep her from feeling set apart from every one but this was difficult to manage as she was so generally disliked that even gillian was only goodnatured to her in accordance with her mothers desire that she should not be treated as out of the pale of humanity  mysie alone sought her out and brought her forward with any real earnestness and good little mysie had a somewhat difficult part to play between kindness to her and flys occasional little jealous tiffs and decided disapproval  mysie never thought however about the situation or its difficulties she simply followed the moments call of kindness to dolores and when it was possible followed her own inclinations and enjoyed flys lively society  and dolores was certainly softening and improving  a word to mrs halfpenny had secured the two girls being permitted to say their prayers together in doloress room unmolested and what was a reality to a contemporary became less and less to dolores a mere lesson imposed by the authority of an elder  that link between religious instruction and daily life which is all important yet so difficult to find was being gradually put into doloress hands by her little cousinfriend lady merrifield hoped and guessed it might be thus from the questions that mysie asked her at times and from the quickened attention dolores showed to her religious lessons and her less dull and indifferent air at church  it could not be said that she was different with the others  she was depressed and wanted spirits for enjoyment nor would active romping diversions ever be pleasant to her  she had not the nature for them and was not young enough to learn to like them  it could not but seem foolish to her to race about as a croat or a savage and she only beheld with wonder gillians genuine delight in games not merely entered into for the sake of the little ones  but there was a strong devotion growing up in her to her aunt and to mysie and what they asked of her she dideven when on a wet day her aunt condemned her to learn battledore and shuttlecock of gillian who was equally to be pitied for the awkwardness of her pupil and the banter of her brothers while dolly picked up her shuttlecock and tossed it off with grim determination as if doing penance for this dismal half hour  she managed better in the games where ready sharpness of intellect or memory was wanted and she liked these and would have liked them still better if uncle reginald had not always looked astonished if she laughed  she did her part too in the little play being one of the chorus of the maidens who make a vow to make a row  lady merrifield had according to the general request saved disputes by casting the parts gillian being the sage old woman who brought the damsels to reason fly the prime mover of the tumult and mysie her confidante while val and dolly made up the mob  a little manipulation of skirts tennisaprons ribbons and caps made very nice peasant costumes  hal was the selfimportant bailli and jasper the drummer the part of gensdarmes being all that wilfred and fergus could be trusted with  lord rotherwood came back and his little daughters ecstacy was goodly to see as she danced about her daddy almost bursting with the secret of what he was to see after dinner and showing herself so brilliantly well and happy that he congratulated himself upon her mothers satisfaction  while the elders were at dinner gillian with miss vincents help finished off the arrangements  there were no outsiders except the vicar and mr  pollock who had been asked to dinner for lady merrifield said she never liked to make her children an exhibition  you are an oldfashioned lily said her cousin and happily not concerned with popularity  it is a fine thing to be able to consult ones childrens absolute best  the performance went off beautifullyat least so thought both actors and spectators  the dignity of the bailli and the meddling of the drummer were alike delightful fly was charmingly arch and mutinous mysie very straightforward and the least successful personation was that of gillian who had a fit of stagefright forgot sentences and whirred her spinningwheel nervously all the worse for being scolded by her brothers behind the scenes and assured that she was making a mull of the whole affair  and she had been so spirited at the rehearsals but she was at a selfconscious age and could not forget the four spectators  very little was required of dolores but that little she did simply and well and lord rotherwood after watching her all the evening observed to lady merrifield i should say your difficulties were diminishing are they not  the thundercloud seems to be a little lightened  i am so glad you think so rotherwood  i feel sure that all this distress has drawn her nearer to us only regie wont believe it  regie is prejudiced  is he  i thought him specially fond of maurices child and that this was revulsion of feeling but what i am afraid of is that he will never believe in her or like her again whatever she may be and she is really fond of him  yes reginald is not over disposed to believe in any womans truth outside his own family and sisters  poor fellow i cant say he was well used  what  i suppose be has bad his romance like other peoplehis little episode as my husband calls it  yes and i am afraid we were accountable for it  you remember we were at harthope castle for the first two years after i was married while rotherwood was brought up to the requirements of the victorian age  the th was quartered at harfield within easy distance and a splendid looking fellow like regie was invaluable to victoria whenever she wanted anything to go off well  well in those days i had a ward my mothers great niece maude conway  a pretty winsome creature it was and an heiress in a moderate sort of way and poor old redge after all his little affairs and he had had his share of them was evidently in for it at last  victoria thought as well as myself it was the best thing for them both  he was the soundhearted good fellow to keep her matters straight and she had enough for comfort without overweighting the balance  so they were engaged but unluckily they had to wait till she was of age about eight months off and they were both ridiculously shy and would not have the thing known though victoria said it was unwise  i dont think even jane suspected it  no i dont think she could have done so  well there was the season and victoria was not in condition for going out and maude was all for staying quietly with her but old lady conway came abouta regular schemera woman i never could abide  she had married off her own daughters and wanted her niece to practise on that was the fact  victoria says she always knew that she maude i mean was very impressionable and impulsive and so she wanted to have her out of harms way but one could not prevent her aunt from getting hold of her and taking her out  then people told us of her goings on with that scamp clanmacklosky and that sister of his  victoria talked to her by the yard but she denied it and we thought it all gossip regie came up for a couple of nights and she was as sweet on him as ever and sent him away thinking it all right but the end of it was she fought off going down to rotherwood with us but went to brighton with lady conway and the next thing we heard was that she wrote to throw reginald over and she married clanmacklosky a month after she was twentyone i dont think i ever saw victoria so cut up for we had really liked the girl and thought well of her  to this hour i believe it was all that womans doing and that poor maude has supped sorrow she has lost all her good looks  and regie has never got over it  not so as to believe in a woman again  he used to be rather a joke for susceptibility and was still a regular boy when we went out to gibraltar  i thought him much graver  exactly since that affair his soul has gone into his regiment  its a wife to him and luckily he got his promotion in time so as not to be shelved  i suppose it was really an escape  i dont knowshe would have done very well in his hands  she is the sort of woman to be as you make her and even now is a world too good for clan  victoria can never be quite cordial with her but i cant see the poor harassed thing without thinking what a sweet creature she once was and wishing id had the sense to look after her better  but what i came here for lily was to say you must let me have that mysie of yours since you wont come yourself to this concern of ours  im afraid you wont think much good has come of us but we couldnt do the country mouse much harm in a fortnight and you know it is the wish of my heart that my lonely fly should grow up on such terms with your flock as florence and i did with you all  he pleaded quite piteously and he was backed up by a letter from his wife very grateful for her little phylliss happy visit reiterating the invitation to lady merrifield and begging that if she still could not come herself she would at least send jasper and mysie for the butterflys ball  mysies fancy dress would be ready for her only waiting for the final touches after it was tried on  lady florence devereux too was near at hand and wrote to promise to look after mysie  there was no refusing after this  lady florence was not far from being like a sister to her cousins  she had tended her mothers old age and had subsequently settled down into the lady of all work of rotherwood parish  lady merrifield had much confidence in her and indeed all she saw of fly gave her a great respect for lady rotherwoods management of her child  harry was going to his uncles at beechcroft for some shooting and would bring mysie home when jasper went back to school  so gillian was called to her mothers room to be told first of the arrangement which certainly in some aspects was rather hard on her  i could not help it my dear said lady merrifield without absolutely asking for an invitation for you  no mamma and it is mysie who is flys friend being the same age and all  it is quite right and i understand it  my dear i am so glad i can do such a thing as this  if there were small jealousies among you i could not venture on letting you be set aside for i know the disappointment was quite as great to you as to mysie when we gave it up  but she was better about it than i said gillian mamma your trusting me in that way is better than a dozen balls  besides i know i should hate being there without you im a great old thing as jasper says neither fish nor fowl you know not come out and not a little girl in the schoolroom and it would be very horrid going to a grand place like that on ones own account  thats right gillyflower tis very wholesome to discover the sourness of the grapes  and as i think grandmamma is really coming i shall want you at home and to look after dolores  thats the worst of it mamma i shall never get on with her as mysie does  we must do our best for i do think really the poor child is improving  lessons will begin again thats one comfort said gillian rather quaintly thinking of the length of time that dolores would thus be off her hands  and now call mysie  i must speak to her  as for mysie she was in a state of rapture  she knew her bliss before her mother had communicated it for lord rotherwood could not refrain from telling his daughter that consent was gained and fly darted headlong to embrace mysie dance round her and rejoice  the boys declared that mysie at once sprang into the air like a chamois and that her head touched the ceiling but this is believed to be a figment of jaspers  it was only on the summons to her mothers room that mysie discovered that gillian was not going with her  it dimmed the lustre of her delight for a little while oh gill arent you very sorry  you ought to have had the first turn  never mind mysie you are flys friendand the two sisters looks at one another at that moment were a real pleasure to their mother  mysie was of a less shy nature than gillian as well as at a less awkward age so that the visiting without her mother was less formidable and she rushed about wild with delight but dolores was very disconsolate  every one i care for goes away and changes she said in her melancholy little sentiment  but its only for a fortnight dolly i dont think i could change so fast  oh yes you will among all those swells  you like fly ever so much better than me  mysie looked grieved and puzzled but then exclaimed in the tone of a discovery there are different sorts of likings dolly dont you see i do love fly very much but you know you are like a sort of almost twin sister to me  i like her best but i care about you most  with which curious distinction dolores had to put up     chapter xix  a sadder and a wiser authoress    colonel mohun took wilfred to his school which began its term earlier than did jaspers and silverton was wonderfully quiet  the elder mrs  merrifield was not to come for nearly a week so that it would have been possible for her daughterinlaw to go to the rotherwood festivities without interfering with her visit but this no one except gillian and mysie knew and they kept the secret well  the departure of the boys was a great relief to dolores  her aunt did not rank her with valetta and fergus but let her consort with herself and gillian and this suited her much better  even gillian allowed that she was ever so much nicer when there was no one to tease her  it was true that jasper certainly and perhaps wilfred would not have molested her if she had not offended the latter and offered herself as fair game but gillian who had to forestall and prevent their pranks could not feel their absence quite the privation her sisterly spirit usually did  valetta and fergus were harmless without them but they were forlorn being so much used to having their sports led by their two seniors that they hardly knew what to do without them and the entreaty or rather the whine i want something to do was heard unusually often  this led to gillians being often called off to attend to them during the course of wet days that ensued and thus dolores was a good deal alone with her aunt who was superintending her knitting a pair of silk stockings to send out to her father it was hoped in time for his next birthday  at the first proposal dolores looked dull and unwilling and at last she squeezed out i dont think father will ever want me to do anything for him again  my poor child do you think a father does not forgive and love all the more one who is in deep sorrow for a fault  i dont think my letter seemed sorry i was not half so sorry then as i am now then at a kind word from her aunt her eyes overflowed and she said no i wasnt i didnt know how good you were or how bad i was  and when aunt lily kissed her she put her arms round the kind neck that bent down to her and laid her head against it as if it was quite a rest to feel that love  her aunt encouraged her to write again to her father and to try to express something of her grief and entreaty for forgiveness and she was somewhat cheered after this as though something of the load on her mind was removed  one day she brought down all the books in her room and said please aunt lily look at them and let them be with the rest in the schoolroom i want to be just like the others  lady merrifield was much pleased with this surrender  some of the books were really well worth having and reading indeed the best of them she knew but there were eight or ten which she suspected of being what mysie called silly stories and she kept them back to look over she had been trying in this quiet interval to get dolly to read something besides mere childish stories for recreation and when she saw how well worn the story books were and how untouched the easy history and the books about animals and foreign countries were she saw why so clever a girl as dolores seemed so stupid about everything she had not learnt as a lesson and entirely ignorant of english poetry  lady merrifield read to her and gillian in the evenings and how they did enjoy it and bemoaned the coming of grandmamma to spoil their snugness and occupy mamma for dolores began so to call lady merrifield  she had never so termed her own mother and it seemed to her that with the words aunt lily she put away all sorts of foolish sinister feelings  mrs  merrifield was a wonderful old lady brisk of mind and body though of great age  she had been spending christmas with her eldest son the admiral at stokesley and was going to take on her way the daughterinlaw of whom she knew but little in comparison and with her she brought the granddaughter elizabeth merrifield whosince her own daughter had diedgenerally lived with her in london to take care of her  it will be all company and horrid and nobody will be allowed to make a noise sighed valetta to fergus as the waggonette well shut up drove to the door  theres cousin bessie said fergus  oh cousin bessie is thirtyfour and that is as bad as being as old as grandmamma  and they hung back while the old lady was helped out and brought across the hall into the warm drawingroom before her fur cloak was taken off  there was a quiet little person with her and val whispered shell be just like aunt jane  but the eyes that bessie turned on her cousins were not at an like aunt janes little searching black ones  they were of a dark shade of grey and had a wonderful softness and sweetness in them  gillian knew her a little already but very little for there had always been the elder sisters at their former short meetings  mamma lamented that there should be so few grandchildren at home to be shown though as she said  the full number might have been too noisy  grandmamma shook her head  i like the house full she said im all right but it is a pity to see the nest emptied like stokesley now nobody left at home but susan and little sally make the most of them while you have them about you  the old lady was quite delighted to find primrose so nearly a baby and to have one grandchild still quite as small or smaller than some of her great grandchildren whom she had never seen  her great pleasure however soon proved to be in talking about her son jasper and hearing all his wife could tell her about his life in india and as lady merrifield liked no other subject so well they were very happy together and quite absorbed  meanwhile bessie made herself a companion to gillian and dolores and though so much older seemed to consider herself as a girl like them then living for the most part in town she could talk about london matters to dolly and this was a great treat while yet she had country tastes enough to suit gillian and was not in the least afraid of a long walk to the fir plantations to pick up weymouth pine cones and the still more precious pinaster ones  for the first time gillian began to see dolores as uncle reginald used to know her free from that heavy mist of sullen dislike to everything and everybody  it seemed to bring them together but in spite of bessies charms they both continually missed mysie out of doors and in in schoolroom and drawingroom and above all in dollys bedroom she seemed to be as gillian told bessie a sort of family cement holding the two ends big and little together and bessie responded that her elder sister susan was one of that sort  the evenings now were quite unlike the usual ones  dinner was late and the two girls came down to it  afterwards the young ones sat round the fire in the hall where bessie who was a wonderful storyteller kept fergus and valetta quiet and delighted either with invented tales or histories of the feats of her own brothers and sisters who were so much older than their silverton first cousins as to be like an elder generation  when the two young ones were gone to bed the others came into the drawingroom where mamma and grandmamma were to be found either going over papas letters or else mrs  merrifield talking about her stokesley grandchildren the same whose pranks bessie had just been telling so that it was not easy to believe in sam a captain in the navy  harry and john farming in canada david working as a clergyman in the black country george in  a government office anne a clergymans wife and mother to the great grandchildren who were always being compared to primrose susan keeping her fathers house and sarah though as old as alethea still treated as the youngestthe child of the family  the bits of conversation came to the girls as they sat over their work and bessie would join in and tell interesting things till she saw that grandmamma was ready for her nap and then one or other gave a little music during which dollys bedtime generally came  you cant think how grateful i am to you for helping to brighten up that poor child in a wholesome way said lady merrifield to bessie under cover of gillians performance  one cant help being very sorry for her said elizabeth who knew what was hanging over dolly  yes it is a terrible punishment especially as she has a certain affection for her stepuncle or whatever he should be called for her mothers sake  it really was a perplexed situation  but why did she not consult you  do you know i think i have found out  she held aloof from us all and treated usespecially meas if we were her natural enemies and i never could guess what was the reason till the other day she voluntarily gave me up all her books to be looked over and put into the common stock which you saw in the schoolroom  you look over all the childrens books  yes  while we were wandering they did not get enough to make it a very arduous task and now i find that they want weeding  if children read nothing but a multitude of stories rather beneath their capacity they are likely never to exert themselves to anything beyond novel reading  that is quite true i believe  well among this literature of dollys i found no less than four stories based on the cruelty and injustice suffered by orphans from their aunts  the wicked stepmothers are gone out and the barbarous aunts are come in  it is the stock subject  i really think it is cruel considering that there are many children who have to be adopted into uncles families to add to their distress and terror by raising this prejudice  just look at this onetaking up dollys favourite clare or no homeit is not at all badly written which makes it all the worse  oh aunt lilias cried bessie whose colour had been rising all this time  how shall i tell you i wrote it  you i never guessed you did anything in that line  we dont talk about it  my father knows and so does grandmamma in a way but i never bring it before her if i can help it for she does not half like the notion  but indeed they arent all as bad as that i know now there is a great deal of silly imitation in it but i never thought of doing harm in this way  it is a punishment for thoughtlessness cried poor bessie reddening desperately and with tears in her eyes  my dear i am so sorry i said it if i bad not one of these aunts i should think it a very effective story  im afraid thats so much the worse  let me tell you about it aunt lilias  at home they always laughed at me for my turn for dismalities  i believe one always has such a turn when one is young  well when i went to live with grandmamma it was very different from the houseful at home i had so much time on my hands and i took to dreaming and writing because i could not help it and all my stories were fearfully doleful  i did not think of publishing them for ever so long but at last when david terribly wanted some money for his mission church i thought i would try and this clare was about the best  they took it and gave me five pounds for it and i was so pleased and never thought of its doing harm and now i dont know how much more mischief it may have done  you only thought of piling up the agony but dont be unhappy about it  you dont know how many aunts it may have warned  im afraid aunts are not so impressionable as nieces  and indeed among ourselves storybooks seemed quite outside from life we never thought of getting any ideas from them any more than from bluebeard  so it has been with some of mine while on the other hand dolores seemed to mysie an interesting storybook heroinewhich indeed she is rather too much so  but you have not stood still with clare  no i hope i have grown rather more sensible  david set me to do stories for his lads and as he is dreadfully critical it was very improving  did you write kates jewel that is delightful  aunt jane gave it to val this christmas and all of us have enjoyed it we shall be quite proud of itthat ismay i tell the children  oh aunt you are very good to try to make me forget that miserable clare  i wonder whether it will do any good to tell dolores all about it  only i cant get at all the other girls i may have hurt  nay bessie i think it most likely that dolores would have been an uncomfortable damsel even if clare had remained in your brain  there were other causes at any rate here are three more persecuted nieces in her library  besides as you observed everybody does not go to storybooks for views of human nature and happily also homeless children are commoner in books than out of them so i dont think the damage can be very extensive  one such case is quite enough indeed it is a great lesson to think whether what one writes can give any wrong notion  i believe one always does begin with imitation  yes it is extraordinary how little originality there is in the world in the literature of my time everybody had small hands and high foreheads the girls wanted to do great things and did or did not do little ones and the boys all took first classes and the fashion was to have violet eyes so dark you could not tell their colour and golden hair  whereas now the hair is apt to be bronze whatever that may be like  and all the dresses and all the complexions and all the lace and all the roses are creamy  bessie i hope you dont deal in creaminess  im afraid skim milk is more like me and that you would say i had taken to the goody line  i never thought of the responsibility then only when i wrote for davids classes  it is a responsibility i suppose in the way in which every word one speaks and every letter one writes is so  and nowhere is gillian finishing her piece  how far is it a secret my dear  it need not be so here aunt lilias  only my people are rather old fashioned you know and are inclined to think it rather shocking of me so it ought not to go beyond the family and especially dont  let her indicating her grandmother hear about it  she knows i do such thingsit would not be honest not to tell herbut it goes against the grain and she has never heard one word of it all  it appeared that bessie daily read the psalms and lessons to grandmamma followed up by a sermon  then with her wonderful eyes mrs  merrifield read the newspaper from end to end which lasted her till luncheon then came a drive in the brougham followed by a rest in her own room dinner and then bessie read her to sleep with a book of travels or biography of the old bookclub class of her youth  her principles were against novels and the tale she viewed as only fit for children  lady merrifield could not help thinking what a dull life it must be for bessie a woman full of natural gifts and of great powers of enjoyment accustomed to a country home and a large family and she said something of the kind  i did not like it at first said bessie but i have plenty of occupations now besides all these companions that ive made for myself or that came to me for i think they come of themselves  but what time have you to yourself  grandmamma does not want me till halfpast ten in the morning except for a little visit  and she does not mind my writing letters while she is reading the paper provided i am ready to answer anything remarkable  i am quite the family newsmonger then theres always from four to halfpast six when i can go out if i like  theres a dear old governess of ours living not far off and we have nice little expeditions together  and you know it is nice to be at the family headquarters in london and have every one dropping in  oh dear how good you are to like going on like that said gillian who had come up while this was passing i should eat my heart out you must be made up of contentment  elizabeth held up her hand in warning lest her grandmother should be wakened but she laughed and said my brothers would tell you i used to be pipy bet  but that dear old governess  miss fosbrook was the making of me and taught me how to be jolly like mark tapley among the rattlesnakes she finished looking drolly up to gillian  and gill you dont know what bessie has made her companions instead of the rattlesnakes said lady merrifield  what do you think of kates jewel  gillians astonishment and rapture actually woke grandmamma not that she made much noise but there was a disturbing force about her excitement and the subject had to be abandoned  as the great secret might be shared with dolores though not with the younger ones whose discretion could not be depended upon gillian could enter upon it the more freely though she was rather disappointed that an author was not such an extraordinary sight to dolly as to herself  but it was charming to both that bessie let them look at the proofs of the story she was publishing in a magazine and allowed them as well as mamma to read the manuscript of the tale romance or novel whichever it was to be called on which she wished for her aunts opinion  bessie took care when complying with the girls entreaty that she would tell them all she had written to observe that she thought clare a very foolish book indeed and that she wished heartily she had never written it  gillian asked why she had done it  oh said dolores things arent interesting unless something horrid happens or some one is frightened or very miserable  i like things best just and exactly as they really areor were said gillian  the question between sensation and character said bessie to her aunt  i suppose that on the whole it is the few who are palpably affected by the mass of fiction in the world but that it is needful to take good care that those few gather at least no harm from ones work to be faithful in it in fact like other things  and there was no doubt that bessie had been faithful in her work ever since she had realized her vocation  her lending library books written with a purpose were excellent and were already so much valued by miss hacket that gillian thought how once she should have felt it a privation not to be allowed to tell her whence they came but to her surprise on the sunday instead of the constraint with which of late she had been treated at teatime the eager inquiry was made whether this was really the authoress miss merrifield  secrets are not kept as well as people think  the hackets married sister was a neighbour of bessies married sister and through these ladies it had just come round not only who was the author of charlies whistle etc but that she wrote in the  magazine and was in the neighbourhood  all offences seemed to be forgotten in the burning desire for an introduction to this marvel of success  constance had made the most of her opportunities in gazing at church but if she called would she be introduced  of course said gillian if my cousin is in the room  she spoke rather coldly and gravely and miss hacket exclaimed  i know we have been a little remiss my dear i hope lady merrifield was not offended  mamma is never offended said gillianbut i do think and so would she and all of us that if constance comes she ought to treat dolores mohunasas usual  the two sisters were silent perhaps from sheer amazement at this outbreak of gillians who had never seemed particularly fond of her cousin  gillian was quite as much surprised at herself but something seemed to drive her on with flaming cheeks  dolores is half broken hearted about it all  she did not thoroughly know how wrong it was and it does make her miserable that the one who went along with her in it should turn against her and cut her and all  connie never meant to keep it up im sure said miss hacket but she was very much hurt  so was dolly said gillian  is she so fond of me said constance in a softened tone  she was replied gillian  im sure said miss hacket our only wish is to forget and forgive as christians  lady merrifield has behaved most handsomely and it is our most earnest wish that this unfortunate transaction should be forgotten  and im sure im willing to overlook it all said constance  one must have scrapes you know but friendship will triumph over all  gillian did not exactly wish to unravel this fine sentiment and was glad that the little gfs maid came in with the tea  lady merrifield was a good deal diverted with gillians report and invited the two sisters to luncheon on the plea of their slight acquaintance with anneotherwise mrs daventrywith a hint in the note not to compliment mrs merrifield on elizabeths production  then dolores had to be prepared to receive any advance from constance she looked disgusted at first and then when she heard that gillian had spoken her mind said i cant think why you should care  of course i care to have constance behaving so ill to one of us  do you think me one of you gillian  who what else are you  and dolores held up her face for a kiss a heartier one than had ever passed between the cousins  there was no kiss between the quondam friends but they shook hands with perfect civility and no stranger would have guessed their former or their present terms from their manner  in fact constance was perfectly absorbed in the contemplation of the successful authoress the object of her envy and veneration and only wanted to forget all the unpleasantness connected with the dark head on the opposite side of the table  oh miss merrifield she asked in an interval afterwards when hats were being put on bow do you make them take your things  i dont know said bessie smiling  i take all the pains i can and try to make them useful  useful but thats so dulland the critics always laugh at things with a purpose  but i dont think that is a reason for not trying to do good even in this very small and uncertain way  indeed she added earnestly  i have no right to speak for i have made great mistakes but i wanted to tell you that the one thing i did get published which was not written conscientiouslyas i may saybut only to work out a silly sentimental fancy has brought me pain and punishment by the harm i know i did  this was a very new idea to constance and she actually carried it away with her  the visit had restored the usual terms of intercourse with the hackets though there was no resumption of intimacy such as there had been between constance and dolores  it had however done much to make the latter feel that the others considered themselves one with them and there was something that drew them together in the universal missing of mysie and eagerness for her letters  these were however rather disappointing  mysie had not a genius for correspondence and dealt in very bare facts  there was an enclosure which made lady merrifield somewhat anxious   my dear mamma this is for you all by yourself  i have been in sad mischief for i broke the conservatory and a palmtree with my umbrella and i did still worse for i broke my promise and told all about what you told me never to  i will tell you all when i come home and i hope you will forgive me  i wish i was at home  it is very horrid when they say one is good and one knows one is not but i am very happy and lord rotherwood is nicer than ever and so is fly i am your affectionate and penitent and dutiful little daughter                                     maria millicent merrifield   with all mammas intuitive knowledge of her little daughters mind and forms of expression she was puzzled by this note and the various fractures it described  she obeyed its injunctions of secrecy even with regard to gillian and bessie though she could not help wishing that the latter could have seen and judged of her mysie  grandmamma was somewhat disappointed to have missed her eldest grandson but she was obliged to leave silverton two days before his return with his little sister  she had certainly escaped the full tumult of the entire household but bessie observed that she suspected that it might have been preferred to the general quiescence  in spite of all the regrets that bessies more coeval cousins alethea and phyllis were not at home she and her aunt each felt that a new friendship had been made and that they understood each other and bessie had uttered her resolution henceforth always to think of the impression for good or evil produced on the readers as well as of the effectiveness of her story  little did i suppose that clare would add to any ones difficulties she said still less to yours aunt lilias     chapter xx  confessions of a country mouse    here were the travellers at home again and mysie clinging to her mother with oh mamma and a look of perfect rest  they arrived at the same time as dolores had come so late that mysie was tired out and only half awake  she was consigned to mrs halfpenny after her first kiss but as she passed along the corridor a door was thrown back and a white figure sprang upon her  oh mysie mysie and in spite of the nurses chidings held her fast in an embrace of delight dolores had been lying awake watching for her and implored permission at least to look on while she was going to bed  harry meanwhile related his experiences to his mother and gillian over the suppertable  the butterflys ball had been a great success  he had never seen anything prettier in his life  plants and lights had been judiciously disposed so as to make the hall a continuation of the conservatory almost a fairy land and the children in their costumes had been more like fairies than flesh and blood pinafore and bread andbutter beings  there was a most perfect tableau at the opening of the scenery constructed with moss and plants so as to form a bower where the butterfly and grasshopper with their immediate attendants welcomed their company and afterwards formed the first quadrille lady phyllis with mysie and two other little girls staying in the house being the butterflies and lord ivinghoe and three more boys of the same ages the grasshoppers in pages dresses of suitable colours  i never thought said harry that our little brown mouse would come out so pretty or so swell  she wanted to be the dormouse said gillian  that was impracticable  they were all heath butterflies of different sorts wings very correctly coloured and dresses to correspond phyllis the ringlet with the blue lining mysie the blue one little lady alberta the orangetip and the other child the burnet moth  how did mysie dance  very fairly if she had not looked so awfully serious  the dancing mistress french of course had trained them it was more ballet than quadrille and they looked uncommonly pretty  uncle william granted that though he grumbled at the whole concern as nonsense and wondered you should send your nice little girl into it to have her head turned  do you think she was happy  oh yes of course  she always is but she was in prodigious spirits when we started to come home lady rotherwood said i was to tell you that no child could be more truthful and conscientious  still somehow she did not look like the swells  except that once when she was got up regardless of expense for the ball she always had the country mouse look about her  she hadnt  the jenny say caw as macrae calls it said his mother  well i can endure that you need not look so disgusted gill  you didnt hear of her getting into any scrape did you  no said hal  stay i believe she did break some glass or other and blurted out her confession in full assembly but i was over at beechcroft and i am happy to say i didnt see her  mysies tap came early to her mothers door the next morning and it was in the midst of her toilette that lady merrifield was called on to hear the confession that had been weighing on the little girls mind  i was too sleepy to tell you last night mamma but i did want to do so  well then my dear begin at the beginning for i could not understand your letter  the beginning was mamma that we had just come in from our walk and we went out into the schoolroom balcony because we could see round the corner who was coming up the drive  and we began playing at camps with umbrellas up as tents  ivinghoe and alberta and i  ivy was general and i was the sentry with my umbrella shut up and over my shoulder  i was the only one who knew how to present arms  i heard something coming and called out who goes there and alberta jumped up in such a hurry that the points other tenther umbrella i mean scratched my face and before i could recover arms over went my umbrella perpendicular straight  smash through the glass of the conservatory and we heard it  and what did you do of course you told  oh yes i jumped up and said ill go and tell lady rotherwood  i knew i must before i got into a fright and ivinghoe said i couldnt then and he would speak to his mother and make it easy for me and ply says he really meant it but i thought then thats the way the bad ones always get the others into concealments and lies  so i wouldnt listen a moment and i ran down with him after me saying hear reason mysie and i ran full butt up against somebodylord ormersfield it was i foundbut i didnt know then  i only said something about begging pardon and dashed on and opened the door  i saw a whole lot of fine people all at fiveoclock tea but i couldnt stop to get more frightened and i went up straight to lady rotherwood and said please i did it  mamma do you think i ought not  there are such things as fit places and times my dear  what did she say  at first she just said my dear i cannot attend to you now run away but then in the midst a thought seemed to strike her and she said rather frightened is any one hurt and i said oh no only my umbrella has gone right through the roof of the conservatory and i thought i ought to come and tell her directly  that was the noise said some of the people and everybody got up and went to look  and there were fly and ivy who had got in some other way and the umbrella was sticking right upright in the top of one of those palmtrees with leaves like screens and somebody said it was a new development of fruit  lady rotherwood asked them what they were doing there and ivy said they had come to see what harm was done  dear fly ran up to her and said  we were all at play together mother it was not one more than another  but lady rotherwood only said thats enough phyllis i will come to you byandby in the schoolroom and she would have sent us away if cousin rotherwood himself had not come in just then and asked what was the matter  i heard some of the answers they were very odd mamma  one was a storm of umbrellas and of untimely confessions and another was truth in undress  oh my dear i hope you were fit to be seen  i forgot about that mamma i had taken off my ulster and had my little scarlet flannel underbody so as to make a better soldier  oh groaned lady merrifield  and then that dear good fly gave a jump and flew at him and said oh daddy daddy its mysie and she has been telling the truth like like frank or sir thomas more or george washington or anybody she really did say so mamma  i can quite believe it of her mysie and how did cousin rotherwood respond  he sat down upon one of the seats and took fly on one knee and me on the other though we were big for itjust like papa you knowand made us tell him all about it  lady rotherwood got the others out of the way somehowi dont know how for my back was that way and i think ivinghoe went after them but there was some use in talking to cousin rotherwood he has got some sense and knows what one means as if he was at the dear nice playing age and ivinghoe was his stupid old father in a book  exactly said lady merrifield delighted and longing to laugh  but that was the worst of it said mysie sadly he was so nice that i said all sorts of things i didnt mean or ought to have said  i told him i would pay for the glass if he would only wait till we had helped dolores pay for those books that the cheque was for because the man came alive again after her wicked uncle said he was dead and so somehow it all came out how you made up to miss constance and couldnt come to the butterflys ball for want of new dresses  oh mysie you should not have said that  i thought you were to be trusted  yes mamma i know said mysie meekly  i recollected as soon as i had said it and told him and he kissed me and promised he would never tell anyone and made fly promise that she never would  but i have been so miserable about it ever since mamma i tried to write it in a letter but i am afraid you didnt half understand  i only saw that something was on your mind my dear  now that is all over i do not so much mind cousin rotherwoods knowing he has always been so like a brother but i do hope both he and fly will keep their word  i am more sorry for my little girls telling than about his knowing  and ivinghoe said my running in that way on all the company was worse than breaking the glass or the palmtree  was it mamma  well you know mysie there is a time for all things and very likely it vexed lady rotherwood more to be invaded by such a little wild colt  but not cousin rotherwood himself mamma said mysie for he said i was quite right and an honourable little fellow just like old times and so i told ivy  and he said in such a way every one knew what his father was so i told him his father was ten thousand times nicer than ever he would be if be lived a hundred years and i could not bear him if he talked in that wicked disrespectful way and fly kissed me for it mamma and said her daddy was worth a hundred of such a prig as he was  my dear i am afraid neither you nor fly showed your good manners  it was only ivinghoe mamma and im sure i dont care what he thinks if he could talk of his father in that way  isnt it what you call metallicalnoironical  indeed mysie i dont wonder it made you very angry and i cant be sorry you showed your indignation  but please mamma what ought i to have done about the glass  i dont quite know i think a very wise little girl might have gone to cousin florences room and consulted her  it would have been better than making an explosion before so many people  florence was kind to you i hope  oh yes mamma it was almost like being at home in her room and she has such a dear little house at the end of the park  a good deal more oozed out from mysie to different auditors at different times  by her account everything was delightful and yet mamma concluded that all had not absolutely fulfilled the paradisiacal expectation with which her country mouse had viewed rotherwood from afar  lady rotherwood was very kind and so was the governess and cousin florence especially  cousin florences house felt just like a bit of home  it really was the dearest little houseand fluffy cat and kittens and the sweetest love birds  it was perfectly delicious when they drank tea there but unluckily she was not allowed to go thither without the governess or louise as it was all across the park and a bit of village  and fly oh fly was always dear and good and funny but there was alberta to be attended to and other little girls sometimes and it was not like having her here at home nor was there any making a row in the galleries nor playing at anything really jolly though the great pillars in the hall seemed made for tying cords to make a spiders web it was always company except when cousin rotherwood called them into his den for a little fun  but he had gentlemen to entertain most of the time and the only day that he could have taken them to see the farm and the pheasants lady rotherwood said that phyllis was a little hoarse and must not get a cold before the ball  and as to the butterflys ball itself imagination had depicted a splendid realization of the verses and it was flat to find it merely a childrens fancy ball no acting at all only dancing and most of the children not attempting any characteristic dress only with some insect attached to head or shoulder nothing approaching to the fun of the rehearsal at silverton as indeed fly had predicted  the only attempt at representation had cost mysie more trouble than pleasure for the training to dance together had been a difficult and wearisome business two of the grasshoppers had been greatly displeased about it and called it a beastly shame words much shocking gentle mysie from aristocratic lips  one of them had been as sulky angry and impracticable as possible just like a log and the other had consoled himself with all manner of tricks especially upon the teacher and on ivinghoe  he would skip like a real grasshopper he made faces that set all laughing he tripped ivinghoe up he uttered saucy speeches that mysie considered too shocking to repeat but which convulsed every one with laughter fly most especially and her governess had punished her for it  she would not punish me said mysie though i know i was just as bad and i think that was a shame at last the practising had to be carried on without the boys and yet when it came to the point both the recusants behaved as well and danced as suitably as if they had submitted to the training like their sisters and oh the dressing that was worse  i did not think i was so stupid said mysie but i heard louise tell mademoiselle that i was trop bourgeoise and mademoiselle answered that i was plutot petite paysanne and would never have lair de distinction  abominable impertinence cried gillian  they thought i did not understand said mysie and i knew it was fair to tell them so i said mais non car je suis la petite souris de compagne  well done mysie cried her sister  they did jump and louise began apologizing in a perfect gabble and mademoiselle said i had de lesprit but i am sure i did not mean it  but how could they exclaimed gillian  im sure mysie looks like a lady a gentlemans childi mean as much as fly or any one else  i trust you all look like gentlewomen and are such in refinement and manners but there is an air which comes partly of birth partly of breeding and that none of you except perhaps alethea can boast of and about which papa and i dont care one rush  has fly got it mamma said valetta  she seemed like one of ourselves  oh yes put in dolores  it was what made me think her stuck up  i should have known her for a swell anywhere  im sure fly has no airs exclaimed val hotly and gillian was ready to second her but lady merrifield explained  the absence of airs is one ingredient val both in being ladylike and in the distinction in which the maid justly perceived our mouse to be deficient  come you foolish girls dont look concerned  nobody but the maid would have ever let mysie perceive the difference  mysie coloured and answered i dont know i saw the fitzhughs look at me at first as if they did not think i belonged and ivinghoe was always so awfully polite that i thought he was laughing at me  ivinghoe must be horrid broke out valetta  the fitzhughs said they would knock it out of him at eton returned mysie  they got very nice after the first day and said fly and i were twice as jolly fellows as he was  it further appeared that mysie had had plenty of partners at the ball and on all occasions her full share of notice the country neighbours welcoming her as her mothers daughter but most of them saying she was far more like her aunt phyllis than her own mother  the dancing and excitement so late at night had however tired her overmuch she had cramp all the remainder of the night could eat no breakfast the next day and was quite miserable  i should like to have cried for you mamma she said but they were all quite used to it and not a bit tired  however cousin florence came in and she was so kind  she took me to the little west room and made me lie on the sofa and read to me till i went to sleep and i was all right after dinner and had a ride on flys old pony dormouse  she has the loveliest new one all bay with a black mane and tail called fairy but alberta had that  oh it was so nice  altogether lady merrifield was satisfied that her little girl had not been spoilt for home by her taste of dissipation though she did not hear the further confidence to dolores in the twilight by the schoolroom fire  do you know dolly though fly is such a darling and they all wanted to be kind as well as they knew how i came to understand how horrid you must have felt when you came among the whole lot of us  but you knew fly already  that made it better but i dont like it  to feel one does not belong and to be afraid to open a door for fear it should be somebodys room and not quite to know who every one is  oh dear it is enough to make anybody cross and stupid  oh i am so glad to be back again  im sure i am glad you are and there was a little kissing match youll always come to my room wont you do you know when constance came to luncheon i only shook hands i wouldnt try to kiss her  was that unforgiving  i am sure i couldnt said mysie did she try  i dont think so i dont think i ever could kiss her for i never should have said what was not true without her and that is what makes uncle reginald so angry still  he would not kiss me even when he went away  oh mysie thats worse than anything and doloress face contracted with tears very near at hand  i did always so love uncle regie and he wont forgive me and father will be just the same  poor dear dear dolly said mysie hugging her  but you know fathers always forgive and we will try and make a little prayer about it like the prodigal sons you know  i dont blow properly said dolores  i think i can say him said mysie and the little girls sat with enfolded arms while mysie reverently went through the parable  but he had been very wicked indeed objected dolores what one calls dissipated  isnt that making too much of such things as girls like us can do  i dont know said mysie knitting her young brows you see if we are as bad as ever we can be while we are at home it is really and truly as bad in us ourselves as in shocking people that run away because it shows we might have done anything if we had not been taken care of  and the poor son felt as if he could not be pardoned which is just what you do feel  aunt lily forgives me said dolores wistfully  and your father will im sure said mysie though he is yet a great way off  and as to uncle regie i do wish something would happen that you could tell the truth about  if you had only broken the palmtree instead of me and i didnt do right even about that  but if any mischief does happen or accident i promise you dolly you shall have the telling of it if you have had ever so little to do with it and then mamma will write to uncle regie that you have proved yourself truthful  dolores did not seem much consoled by this curious promise and mysies childishness suddenly gave way to something deeper  i suppose she said if one is true people find it out and trust one  people cant see into one said dolly  mamma says there is a bright side and a dark side from which to look at everybody and everything said mysie  i know that said dolores i looked at the dark side of you all when i came here  some day said mysie your bright side will come round to uncle regie as it has to us you dear dear old dolly  but do you know mysie whispered dolores in her embrace theres something more dreadful that im very much afraid of  do you know there hasnt been a letter from father since he was staying with aunt phyllisnot to me nor aunt jane nor anybody  well he couldnt write when he was at sea i mean there wasnt any post  it would not take so long as this to get to fiji and besides  uncle regie telegraphed to ask about that dreadful cheque and there hasnt been any answer at all  perhaps he is gone about sailing somewhere in the pacific ocean i heard uncle william saying so to cousin rotherwood he said maurice is not a fellow to resist a cruise  then they are thinking about it  they are anxious  not very said mysie for they think he is sure to be gone on a cruise  they said something about his going down like a carpenter into the deep sea  making deepsea soundings like dr carpenter a carpenter indeed said dolores laughing for a moment  oh if it is that i dont mind  the weight was lifted but byandby when the two girls said their prayers together poor dolores broke forth again oh mysie mysie your papa has allall of you besides mamma to pray that he may be kept safe and my father has only me only horrid me to pray for him and even i have never cared to do it really till just lately oh poor poor father  and suppose he should be drowned and never never have forgiven me  it was a trouble and misery that recurred night after night though apparently it weighed much less during the dayand nobody but mysie knew how much dolores was suffering from it  lady merrifield was increasingly anxious as time went on and still no mail brought letters from mr  mohun but confidence based on his erratic habits and the uncertainty of communication began to fail  and as she grieved more for the possible loss she became more and more tender to her niece and strange to say in spite of the terror that gnawed so achingly every night and of the ordeal that the lent assizes would bring dolores was happier and more peaceful than ever before at silverton and developed more of her bright side  i really think wrote lady merrifield to miss mohun that she is growing more simple and childlike poor little maid  she is apparently free from all our apprehensions about dear maurice and i would not inspire her with them for the world  neither does she seem to dread the trial as i do for her nor to guess what cross examination may be  constance hacket has been subpoenaed and her sister expatiates on her nervousness  it is one comfort that reginald must be there as a witness so that it is not in the power of irish disturbances to keep him from us may we only be at ease about maurice by that time     chapter xxi  in court and out    how doloress heart beat when colonel mohun drove up to the door she durst not run out to greet him among her cousins but stood by her aunt feeling hot and cold and trembling in the doubt whether he would kiss her  yes she did feel his kiss and mysie looked at her in congratulation but what did it mean was it only that it came as a matter of course and he forgot to withhold it or was it that he had given up hopes of her father and was sorry for her she could not make up her mind for he came so late in the evening that she scarcely saw him before bed time and he did not take any special notice of her the next morning he had done his best to save her from being long detained at darminster by ascertaining as nearly as possible when flinderss case would come on and securing a room at the nearest inn where she might await a summons into court  lady merrifield was going with them but would not take either of her daughters thinking that every home eye would be an additional distress and that it was better that no one should see or remember dolores as a witness  miss mohun met the party at the station going off however with her brother into court after having established lady merrifield and her niece in an inn parlour where they kept as quiet as they could by the help of knitting and reading aloud  lady merrifield found that dolores had been into court before and knew enough about it to need no explanation or preparation and being much afraid of causing agitation she thought it best only to try to interest her in such tales as neales triumphs of the cross instead of letting her dwell on what she most dreaded the sight of the prisoner and the punishment her words might bring upon him  the morning ended and uncle reginald brought word that his case would come on immediately after luncheon  this he shared with his sister and niece saying that jane had gone to a pastrycooks withwith rotherwoodthinking this best for dolly  he seemed to be in strangely excited spirits and was quite his old self to dolores tempting her to eat and showing himself so entirely the kind uncle that she would have been quite cheered up if she had not been afraid that it was all out of pity and that he knew something dreadful  lord rotherwood met them at the hotel entrance and took his cousin on his arm dolores following with her uncle was sure that she gave a great start at something that he said but she had to turn in a different direction to wait under the charge of her uncle who treated her as if she were far more childish and inexperienced in the ways of courts than she really was and instructed her in much that she knew perfectly well but it was too comfortable to have him kind to her for her to take the least offence and she only said yes and thank you at the proper places  the sheriff meantime had given lord rotherwood and lady merrifield seats near the judge where miss mohun was already installed  alfred flinders was already at the bar and for the first time lady merrifield saw his somewhat handsome but shiftylooking face and red beard as the counsel for the prosecution was giving a detailed account of his embarrassed finances and of his having obtained from the inexperienced kindness of a young lady a mere child in age who called him uncle though without blood relationship a draft of her fathers for seven pounds which when presented at the bank had become one for seventy  as before the presenting and cashing of the seventy pounds was sworn to by the bankers clerk and then dolores mary mohun was called  there she stood looking smaller than usual in her black closefitting dress and hat in a place meant for grown people her dark face pale and set keeping her eyes as much as she could from the prisoner  when the counsel spoke she gave a little start for she knew him as one who had often spent an evening with her parents in the cheerful times while her mother lived  there was something in the familiar glance of his eyes that encouraged her though he looked so much altered by his wig and gown and it seemed strange that he should question her as a stranger on her exact name and age her fathers absence the connection with the prisoner and present residence  then came  did your father leave any money with you  yes  what was the amount  five pounds for myself seven besides  in what form was the seven pounds  a cheque from ws bank  did you part with it  yes  to whom  i sent it to him  to whom if you please  to mr alfred flinders and her voice trembled  can you tell me when you sent it away  it was on the 22nd of december  is this the cheque  it has been altered  explain in what manner  there has ty been put at the end of the written seven and a cipher after the figure 7 making it 70  you are sure that it was not so when it went out of your possession  perfectly sure  mr calderwood seemed to have done with her and said thank you but then there stood up a barrister whom she suspected of being a man her mother had disliked and she knew that the worst was coming when he said in a specially polite voice too allow me to ask whether the cheque in question had been intended by mr mohun for the prisoner  no  or was it given to you as pocketmoney  no it was to pay a bill  then did you divert it from that purpose  i thought the man was dead  what man  professor muhlwasser  the creditor  yes  mr calderwood objected to these questions as irrelevant but the prisoners counsel declared them to be essential and the judge let him go on to extract from dolores that the payment was intended for an expensive illustrated work on natural history which was to be published in germany  her father had promised to take two copies of it if it were completed but being doubtful whether this would ever be the case he had preferred leaving a draft with her to letting the account be discharged by his brother and he had reckoned that seven pounds would cover the expense  you say you supposed the author was dead  what reason had you for thinking so  he told me mr flinders did  had mr mohun sanctioned your applying this sum to any other purpose than that specified  no he had not  i did wrong said dolores firmly  he wrinkled up his forehead so that the point of his wig went upwards and proceeded to inquire whether she had herself given the cheque to the prisoner  i sent it  did you post it  not myself  i gave it to miss constance hacket to send it for me  can you swear to the sum for which it was drawn when you parted with it  yes  i looked at it to see whether it was pounds or guineas  did you give it loose or in an envelope  in an envelope  was any other person aware of your doing so  nobody  what led you to make this advance to the prisoner  because he told me that he was in great distress  he told you  by letter or in person  in person  when did he tell you so  on the 22nd of december  and where  at darminster  let me ask whether this interview at darminster took place with the knowledge of the lady with whom you reside  no it did not said dolores colouring deeply  was it a chance meeting  noby appointment  how was the appointment made  we wrote to say we would come that day  wewho was the other party  miss constance hacket  you were then in correspondence with the prisoner  was it with the sanction of lady merrifield  no  a secret correspondence then romantically carried onby what means  constance hacket sent the letters and received them for me  what was the motive for this arrangement  i knew my aunt would prevent my having anything to do with him  and youexcuse mewhat interest had you in doing so  my mother had been like his sister and always helped him  all these answers were made with a grave resolute straightforwardness generally with something of doloress peculiar stony look and only twice was there any involuntary token of feeling when she blushed at confessing the concealment from her aunt and at the last question when her voice trembled as she spoke of her mother  she kept her eyes on her interrogators all the time never once glancing towards the prisoner though all the time she had a sensation as if his reproachful looks were piercing her through  she was dismissed and constance hacket was brought in looking about in every direction carrying a handkerchief and scent bottle and not attempting to conceal her flutter of agitation  mr calderwood had nothing to ask her but about her having received the cheque from miss mohun and forwarded it to flinders though she could not answer for the date without a public computation back from christmas day and forward from st thomass  as to the amount  oh yes certainly seven pounds  moreover she had posted it herself  then came the crossexamination  had she seen the draft before posting it  wellshe really did not remember exactly  how did she know the amount then  well i thinkyesi think dolores told me so  you think he said in a sort of sneer  on your oath  do you know  yes yes yes  she assured me i know something was said about seven  then you cannot swear to the contents of the envelope you forwarded  i dont know  it was all such a confusion and hurry  why so  oh because it was a secret  the counsel of course availed himself of this handle to elicit that the witness had conducted a secret correspondence between the prisoner and her young friend without the knowledge of the childs natural protectors  a perfect romance he said i believe the prisoner is unmarried  perhaps this insinuation would have been checked but before any one had time to interfere constance blushing crimson exclaimed oh oh i assure you it was not that  it was because she said he was her uncle and that they illused him  this brought upon her the searching question whether the last witness had stated the prisoner to be really her uncle and constance replied rather hotly that she had always understood that he was  in fact she gave you to understand that the prisoner was actually related to her by blood  did you say that she also told you that he was persecuted or illused by her other relations  i thought so  yes i am sure she said so  and it was wholly and solely on these grounds that you assisted in this clandestine correspondence  whyyespartly faltered constance thinking of her literary efforts so it began  there was a manifest inclination to laugh in the audience who naturally thought her hesitation implied something very different and the judge thinking that there was no need to push her further when mr calderwood represented that all this did not bear on the matter and was no evidence silenced mr yokes and the witness was dismissed  the next point was that colonel reginald mohun was called upon to attest that the handwriting was his brothers  he answered for the main body of the draft and the signature but the additions in which the forgery lay were so slight that it was impossible to swear that they did not come from the hand of maurice mohun  had application been made to mr mohun on the subject  yes colonel mohun had immediately telegraphed to him at the address in the fiji islands  has any answer been received  no but colonel mohun had a curious expression in his eyes and mr calderwood electrified the court by begging to call upon mr maurice mohun  there he was in the witnessbox looking sunburnt but vigorous  he replied immediately to the question that the cheque was his own and that it had been left under his daughters charge also that it had been for seven pounds and the ty and the cypher had never been written by him  the prisoner winced for a moment and then looked at him defiantly  the connection with alfred flinders was inquired into and explained and being asked as to the term uncle he replied my daughter was allowed to get into the habit of so terming him  the sisters saw his look of pain and jane remembered his strong objection to the title and his wifes indignant defence of it  dolores stood trembling outside in the waitingroom by her uncle reginald from whom she heard that her father had come that morning from london with lord rotherwood but that it had been thought better not to agitate her by letting her know of it before she gave her evidence  has he had my letter she asked  no he knew nothing till he saw rotherwood last night  all the misery of writing the confession came back upon poor dolores and she turned quite white and sick but her uncle said kindly never mind my dear he was very much pleased with your manner of giving evidence  such a contrast to your friends  faugh  in a few more seconds mr mohun had come out  he took the cold trembling hands in his own pressed them close met the anxious eyes with his own full of moisture and said my poor little girl in a tone that somehow lightened dollys heart of its worst dread  will you go back into court asked the colonel  you dont wish it dolly said her father  oh no please not  then said the colonel take your father back to the room at the hotel and we will come to you  i suppose this will not last much longer  probably not half an hour  i dont want to see that fellow either convicted or acquitted  then dolores found herself steered out of the passages and from among the people waiting or gazing into the clearer space in the street her father holding her hand as if she had been a little child  neither of them spoke till they had reached the sittingroom and there the first thing he did when the door was shut was to sit down take her between his knees put an arm round her and kiss her saying again my poor child  you never got my letter she said leaning against him feeling the peace and rest his embrace gave  no but i have heard all  i should have warned you dolly but i never imagined that he could get at you there and i was unwilling to accuse one for whom your mother had a certain affection  that was why i helped him whispered dolores  i knew it he said kindly  but how did he find you out and how had he the impertinence to write to you at your aunt lilys  i wrote to him first she said hanging down her head  how was that you surely had not been in the habit of doing so whilst i was at home  no but he came and spoke to me at exeter the day you went away uncle william was not there he had gone into the town  and hemr flinders said he was going down to see you and was very much disappointed to hear that you were gone  did he ask you to write to him  i dont think he did  father it seems too silly now but i was very angry because aunt lilias said she must see all my letters except yours and maude seftons and i told constance hacket  she said she would send anything for me and i could not think of any one i wanted to write to so i wrote toto him  ah i saw you did not get on with your aunt was the answer that was partly what brought me home and either not hearing or not heeding her exclamation oh but now i do he went on to explain that on his arrival at fiji he had found that circumstances had altered there and that the person with whom he was to have been associated had died so that the whole scheme had been broken up  a still better appointment had however been offered to him in new zealand on the resignation of the present holder after a halfyears notice and he had at once written to accept it  a proposal had been made to him to spend the intermediate time in a scientific cruise among the polynesian islands but the letters he had found awaiting him at vanua levu had convinced him that the arrangements he had made in england had been a mistake and he had therefore hurried home via san francisco as fast as any letter could have gone to wind up his english affairs and fetch his daughter to the permanent home in auckland which her aunt phyllis would prepare for her  her countenance betrayed a sudden dismay which made him recollect that she was a strangely undemonstrative girl but before she had recovered the shock so as to utter more than a long oh they were interrupted by the cup of tea that had been ordered for dolores and in a minute more steps were heard and the two aunts were in the room  seven years were janes first words and my dear maurice lady merrifields oh i wish i could have spared you this and then among greetings came again seven years from the brother and cousin who had seen the traveller before  im glad you were not there maurice said lady merrifield  it was dreadful  i never saw a more insolent fellow said lord rotherwood  that yokes you mean said miss mohun  i declare i think he is worse than flinders  thats like you women jenny returned the colonel you cant understand that a mans business is to get off his client  when he gave him up as an honest man altogether cried lady merrifield  and cast such imputations exclaimed aunt jane  i saw what the wretch was driving at all the time of the crossexamination and if id been the judge would not i have stopped him  there you go  lily and jenny said the colonel and rotherwood just as bad why maurice would have had to take just the same line if he had been for the defence  he would not have done it in such a blackguard fashion though said lord rotherwood  i saw what his defence would be said mr mohun briefly  there said colonel mohun with a boyish pleasure in confuting his sisters but they were not subdued  now maurice cried jane when that man was known to be utterly dishonourable and good for nothing was it fairwas it not contrary to all common senseto try to cast the imputation between those two poor girls so the judge and jury felt it i am happy to say but i call it abominable to have thrown out the mere suggestion  nay now jane said the colonel if the man was to be defended at all how else was it to be done  i wouldnt have had him defended at all but unfortunately thats his right as an englishman  thats another thing but as the cheque did not alter itself one of the three must have done it and nothing was left but to show that there had been an amount of shuffling andin short nonsensethat might cast enough doubt on their evidence to make it insufficient for a conviction  reginald i cant think how you can stand up for such a wretch a vulgar wretch cried miss mohun  you put it delicately as a gentleman who had the misfortune to be counsel in such a case might do but he was infinitely worse than that though that was bad enough  it was yokes put in mr mohun but what did he say looking anxiously at his daughter  it was not so bad about her said her uncle he only made her out a foolish child easily played upon by everybody and possibly ignorant and frightened or led away by her regard for her supposed relation it was the other poor girl  the amiable susceptibilities of romantic young ladies broke out lady merrifield  oh the creature  to think of that poor foolish constance sitting by to hear it represented that the expedition to darminster and all the rest of it was because she was actually touched by that fellow  i really felt ready to take her part  she had certainly brought it on herself said aunt jane but it was atrocious of him and if the other counsel had only known it he stopped the cross examination just at the wrong time or it would have come out that it was literary vanity that was the lure  no doubt he would have made a laughingstock of that but it would not have been as bad as the other  poor thing said lady merrifield it was a trying retribution for schoolgirl folly and want of conscientiousness  i should think she was a sadder and a wiser woman  he must have overdone it said mr mohun he is a vulgar fellow and always does so but as reginald says the only available defence was to enhance the folly and sentiment of the girls but of course the judge charged the other way  entirely said lord rotherwood he brought dolly rather well out of it saying that as he understood it a young girl who had seen a needy connection assisted from her home might think herself justified in corresponding with him and even in diverting to his use money left in her charge when it was probable that it would not be required for the original object  he did not say it was right but it was an error of judgment by no means implying swindlingin fact  he disposed of miss hacket in the same wayfoolish sentimental unscrupulous but not to that degree  girls might be silly enough in all conscience but not so as to commit forgery or perjury  that was the gist of it and happily the jury were of the same opinion  happily well i suppose so said mr mohun with a certain sorrowfulness of tone into which his little daughter entered  i say rotherwood exclaimed the colonel as the town clocks two strokes for the halfhour echoed loudly if you mean to catch the 450 you must fly  fly he coolly repeated  tell mysie lily that fly has never ceased talking of her  that child has been saving her money to fit out one of florences orphans  she  rotherwood broke in mr mohun your wife charged me to see that you were in time for that dinner  a ministerial one  dont encourage him lily chimed in the colonel  ill call a cab see him safe off maurice  and off he was hunted amid the laughter of the ladies the manner of all to one another was so exactly what it had been in the old times  i could hardly help telling him to take care or victoria would never let him out again said miss mohun  poor old fellow it would have been a fine chance for him with four of us together  you can come back with us jenny  i brought my bag in case of accidents  and well telegraph to adeline to join us tomorrow said mr mohun who seemed to have been seized with a hunger for the sight of his kindred  telegraph  my dear maurice adas nerves would be torn to smithereens by a telegram without me to open it for her  ive a card here to post to her but i expect that i must go down tomorrow and fetch her which will be the best way for i have a meeting  jenny i declare you are a caution even to miss hacket said colonel reginald reentering  well ada always was the family pet  besides i told you i had a gfs meeting  did you get a cab for us lily has had quite walking enough  the ladies went in a cab while the gentlemen walked  there was not much time to spare and in the compartment into which the first comers threw themselves they found both the hacket sisters installed and the gentlemen coming up in haste nodded and got into a smokingcarriage on seeing how theirs was occupied  oh we could have made room said constance to whom a gentleman was a gentleman under whatever circumstances  dear miss doloress papa is it indeed said miss hacket  so wonderfully interesting chimed in constance  and they both made a dart at dolores to kiss her in congratulation much against her will  the train clattered on and lady merrifield hoped it would hush all other voices but neither of the hackets could refrain from discussing the trial and heaping such unmitigated censure on the counsel for the prisoner that miss mohun felt herself constrained to fly in the face of all she had said at the hotel and to maintain the right of even such an englishman to be defended and of his advocate to prevent his conviction if possible  on which the regular sentiment against becoming lawyers was produced and the subject might have been dropped if constance had not broken out again as if she could not leave it so atrocious so abominably insolent asking if he was unmarried  evidently flattered muttered aunt jane between her teeth and unheard but the speed slackened and constances voice went on  i really thought i should have died of it on the spot  the bare idea of thinking i could endure such a being  well said dolores just as the clatter ceased at a little station you know you did walk up and down with him ever so long and i am sure you liked him very much  an indignant you dont understand was absolutely cut off by an imperative grasp and hush from miss hacket the elder aunt jane was suffocating with laughter lady merrifield between that and a certain shame for womanhood which made her begin to talk at random about anything or everything else     chapter xxii  nay    what a mull they have made of it were mr maurice mohuns first words when he found the compartment free for a teteatete with his brother  alls well that ends well was the brief reply  well indeed mary would not have thought so  to which the colonel had nothing to say  it serves me out his brother went on presently  i ought to have done something for that wretched fellow before i went or at any rate have put dolly on her guard but i always shirked the very thought of him  nothing would have kept him out of harms way  it might have kept the child but she must have been thicker with him than i ever knew  however i shall have her with me for the future and in better hands  you really mean to take her out  thats what brought me home  she isnt happy that is plain from her letters and jane does not know what to make of her nor lilias either  when were your last letters dated  the last week in september  early days muttered the colonel  i thought it an experiment you know but you said so much about lilys girls being patterns that i thought jasper merrifield might have made her more rational and less flighty and all that sort of thing but of course it was a very different tone from what the child was used to and you couldnt tell what the young barbarians were out of sight  so i began to think last winter but i fancy you will find that she and lily understand one another a good deal better than they did at first  i thought she did not receive my intelligence as a deliverance  i am glad if she can carry away an affectionate remembrance but i want to have her under my own eye  i suppose thats all right was the half reluctant reply  theres phyllis  she is full of good sense with no nonsense about her or may and her girls are downright charming  very likely but i say maurice you must not underrate lilias  she has gone through a good deal with dolores and i believe she has been the making of her  youve had to leave the poor child a good deal to herself and fraulein and as you see by this affair she had some ways that made it hard for lily to deal with her at first  her father plainly did not like this  there was no harm in the poor child but as i should have foreseen theres always an atmosphere of sentiment and ritual and flummery about lilias totally different from what she was used to  colonel mohun had nearly said so much the better but turned it into i think you will change your opinion  brothers and sisters and cousins whatever they may be to the external world always remain relatively to each other pretty much as they knew one another when a single home held them all  the familiar christian names seemed to revive the old ways and it was amusing to see the somewhat grave and silent colonel treated by his elder brother as the dashing heedless boy needing to be looked after while his sister jane remained the ready helper and counsellor and lady merrifield was still in his eyes the unpractical fanciful lily with an unfortunately suggestive rhyme to her name  perhaps it maintained him in this opinion that when he had answered all questions about captain and mrs  harry may and had dilated on their pretty house in the suburbs of auckland his sisters expected him to tell of the work of the church among the maoris and fijians  he laughed at them for thinking colonists troubled their heads about natives  i know phyllis does  one of harry mays brothers went out as a missionary  disenchanted and came home again when his wife came into a fortune  not a bit of it said aunt jane  i know him and all about him  he stayed till his health broke and now he is one of the most useful men in the country  he is coming to speak for the spg at rockquay lily and you must come and meet him and his charming wife  they will tell you a very different story about harrys doings  well allowed mr mohun there are apparitions of brown niggers done up as smart as twopence prancing about the house  perfectly uninteresting you know the savage sophisticated out of his picturesqueness  i made a point of asking no questions not knowing what i might be let in for  then you heard nothing of mr ward the melanesian missionary whom phyllis keeps a room for when he comes to new zealand to recruit  the man who was convicted of murder on circumstantial evidence  oh yes  i heard of him  i believe the labourtraffic agents heartily wish him at portland still he makes the natives so much too sharp  aye said the colonel as long as britons arent slaves they have no objection to anything but the name for other people  wait till you get out there regie and see what they all say about those lazy fellowsexcept of course ladies and parsons and a few whom theyve bitten like may  the few are on the christian side of course said lady merrifield with irony in her tone  indeed she was not at all sure that half this colonial prejudice was not assumed in order to tease her just as in former times her brother would make game of her enthusiasms about school children for he was altogether returned to his old self his sister jane who had seen the most of him testifying that the original maurice had revived as never in the course of his married life  dolores tried to forget or disbelieve the words she had heard about his having come to fetch her away and said no word about them until they had been unmistakably repeated  then she felt a sort of despair at the idea of being separated from her aunt and mysie for indeed they had penetrated to affections deeper than had ever been consciously stirred in her before  yet she was old enough to shrink from allowing to her father that she preferred staying with them to going with him and it was to her aunt jane that she had recourse  that lady after returning from her expedition to bring her sister adeline to silverton was surprised by a timid knock at the door and doloress entrance  oh if you please aunt jane may i come in i do so want to speak to you alone  dont you think it is a sad pity that i should go away from the cambridge examination could not you tell my father so  you want to stay for the cambridge examination said aunt jane a little amused at the manner of touching on the subject though sorry for the girl  i have been taking great pains under miss vincent and it does seem a pity to miss it  i dont think it will make much difference to you  oh but i do want to be thoroughly well educated  i meant to go through them all like gillian and mysie and i am sure father must wish it too  i know he meant it when he went out last year  yes he did said miss mohun  it was very unlucky that he did not get any of our later letters  i have tried to tell him that it is all different now but he does not seem to care said dolores  he has quite made up his mind said her aunt  has he quite said dolores  i thought perhaps if you talked to him about the examination and the confirmation too  but dolly you are not going to a heathen country  your confirmation will be as much attended to in new zealand as here  oh but i should be confirmed with mysie and aunt lily would read with me and help me  yes i see  do please tell him  aunt jane  he heeds what you say more than any one  do tell him that the only hope of my being good is if i stay with aunt lily just these few years  ah dolly that is what you really mean and care aboutnot the cambridge business  of course it is  please tell him aunt janesomehow i cantthat i was bad and foolish when i wrote all the letters he had but now i know better andandi dont want to vex him but i shall be ever so much better a daughter to him if he will leave me with aunt lily to learn some of her goodnessand there were tears in her eyes for these months had softened her greatly  my poor dolly said aunt jane much more tenderly than she generally spoke  i am very sorry for you  i do think aunt lily has been the making of you and that it is very hard that you should have to be uprooted from her just as you had learnt to value her i will tell your father so but honestly i do not think it is likely to make him change his mind  miss mohun sought her brother out the next day and told him that they had all been waiting in patience when thinking that his daughters residence at silverton was an unsuccessful experiment  the explosion she had predicted had come and dolores had been a different creature ever since owing to lady merrifields management of her in the crisis and she added that the girl was most unwilling to leave her aunt and that she herself thought it would be much better to leave her for a few years to the advantages of her present training where her affections had been gained  mr  mohun could not see it in the same light  the intimacy with constance hacket was in his eyes a folly consequent on his sisters passion for sunday schools and charities and jane being infected with the like ardour he disregarded her explanations  the underhand correspondence could not have been carried on without great blindness and carelessness or at least injudiciousness on lady merrifields part and there was no denying that she had trusted to a sense of honour that was nonexistent  nor did he appreciate janes argument that the conquest of the heart and will had thus been far more thoroughly gained than it would have been by constant thwarting and watching  it was hard to forgive such an exposure as had taken place or to believe that it had not been brought about by unjustifiable errors more especially as lady merrifield was the first to accuse herself of them   moreover he had become sensible of a strong natural yearning for the presence of his only child and he had been so much struck with his sister phylliss family that he sincerely believed himself consulting the girls best interests  he was by no means an irreligious or ungodly man but he had always thought his sister lilias more or less of an enthusiast and he did not wish to see dolores the same  perhaps indeed the poor childs manifest clinging to her aunt and cousins made him all the more resolute to remove her before her affection should be entirely weaned from himself  he made his headquarters at silverton and during the next two months modified his opinions so far as to confess to his sister jane that lilias was a much more sensible woman than he had believed her and had her children well in hand  he even allowed that dolores was improved and owed much to her kindness and when the first sting of the exposure was over he could see that the treatment had been far from injudicious as regarded the girls own character  he was even glad that warm love and friendship had grown up towards her aunt and cousins but all this left his purpose unchanged although after the first nothing was said about it dolores tried to forget it and hoped that the sight of her going on well and peaceably would convince him of the inexpediency of disturbing her  she could not even mention it to mysie lest the dread should become a reality by being uttered  so no more passed on the subject till it became necessary to take her outfit in hand and he also wished to take her to beechcroft that the old family home which he regarded with fresh tenderness might be impressed on her memory  then though she never durst directly oppose the fate which he destined for her she surprised him by a violent burst of tears and sobbing and an entreaty that he would not take her away from aunt lily and mysie a moment sooner than could be helped  she clung to everything even to the guineapigs and she was the first in the easter holidays to beg for the thorn fortress indeed mysie was a little shocked at her grief as disloyal and unfilial  one ought not to mind going anywhere with ones father she said we all thought it a great honour for phyllis and alethea  they are grown up said dolores and aunt lily does get into one so oh dont say theres aunt phyllis  i hate the very name of her  she must be nice said mysie whenever the grownups are pleased with me they say i am getting like her as if it was the best thing one could be  but i dont want mysie old and grown up i want my mysie now as you areand youll forget and leave off writing like maude sefton  never cried mysie  eight across the world you will always be my own twin cousin  the wishes of the girl were so far fulfilled that lady merrifield took her to london to provide her outfit and mysie accompanied them  a room and its dressingroom received the three at old mrs merrifields and the two cousins thought their close quarters ineffably precious  mysie was introduced to maude sefton who seemed entirely unconscious of her treachery to friendship  one had so little time and couldnt always be writing she said when dolores reproached her exercises were enough to tire out ones hand  they also drank tea with lady phyllis devereux and her governess  fly could not pour forth questions and reminiscences fast enough about all the beloved animals at silverton not forgetting the little gfs nursemaid for whom she had actually made an apron in her plainwork lessons  moreover she deemed doloress fate most enviable to be going off with her father to strange countries away from lessons and masters and towns  it would be almost as good as leila on the island  as to the beechcroft visit mr and mrs mohun collected all the brothers and sisters in england there for a week and still mysie and dolores were allowed to be together squeezed into a corner of lady merrifields room  it was high summer bright and glowing and so dry and even the invalidish sisters lady henry gray and miss adeline mohun could not object to the sitting out on the lawn among the dragon flies as in days of yore  much of old thought and feeling was then and there taken up again and it was on one of the last evenings of the visit that mr mohun walking up and down the alley with lady merrifield said  well lily i think my determination to take dolly away was hasty  i cannot leave her now but if i had understood all that i see at present i should have been both content and grateful to have her among your children  i am afraid i have been ungracious  i never thought so maurice  it is quite right that she should be with you and phyllis will do everything for her much better than i  poor child i believe she is very sorry to go said mr mohun but at any rate she will remember silverton as i hope a lasting influence on her life  dolores truly believed that so it would be and that her aunts guidance would be always looked back upon as the turningpoint of her life  it is my own fault she said as on the last night she clung tearfully to lady merrifield if i had behaved better i might have gone on just like one of your own  you will still be in my heart like one of my own dear child said lady merrifield  we know the way in which we all can hold together as one keep to that and the distance apart will matter the less  and as they watched dolores and her father driven away to the station the next morning jane mohun laid her hand on her sisters arm and said you thought you had made a great failure  lily but is not the other side of a failure often a success  byandby came letters from dolores  she seemed after the first to have enjoyed her journey for as she wrote to lady merrifield in a letter very private and all to her own self father was so very good and kind to me i dont know how to tell you  it was as if a little bit of mother had got into him and now i am here i think i shall like the mays  indeed i am trying to remember your advice and not beginning by hating everybody and thinking who they are not  aunt phyllis is very nice indeed and sometimes her eyes and mouth get like mysies and her voice is just exactly yours   only she is plump and roundabout not a dear tall graceful figure like my white lily aunt please dont call it nonsense for indeed i mean it and aunt phyllis does like your photograph so much  i have the whole group hung up in my room and you over it and i wish you all good morning every day for i never never as long as i live shall love anybody like you and mysie    the end
