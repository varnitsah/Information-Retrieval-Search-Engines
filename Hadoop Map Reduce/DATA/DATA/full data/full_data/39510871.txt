39510871	a millionaire of yesterday  by e phillips oppenheim     chapter i   filth grunted trentugh i tell you what it is my venerable friendi have seen some dirty cabins in the west of ireland and some vile holes in east london ive been in some places which i cant think of even now without feeling sick im not a particular chap wasnt brought up to itno nor squeamish either but this is a bit thicker than anything ive ever knocked up against if francis doesnt hurry well have to chuck it we shall never stand it out monty  the older man gaunt bleareyed ragged turned over on his side his appearance was little short of repulsive his voice when he spoke was curiously enough the voice of a gentleman thick and a trifle rough though it sounded  my young friend he said i agree with youin effectmost heartily the place is filthy the surroundings are repulsive not to add degrading the society isernot congeniali allude of course to our hostsand the attentions of these unwashed and i am afraid i must say unclothed ladies of dusky complexion is to say the least of it embarrassing  dusky complexion trent interrupted scornfully theyre coal black  monty nodded his head with solemn emphasis i will go so far as to admit that you are right he acknowledged they are as black as sin but my friend trent i want you to consider this if the nature of our surroundings is offensive to you think what it must be to me i may i presume between ourselves allude to you as one of the people refinement and luxury have never come in your way far less have they become indispensable to you you were i believe educated at a board school i was at eton afterwards you were apprenticed to a harnessmaker ibut no matter let us summarise the situation  if that means cutting it short for heavens sake do so trent grumbled youll talk yourself into a fever if you dont mind lets know what youre driving at  talking the elder man remarked with a slight shrug of his shoulders will never have a prejudicial effect upon my health to men of yourpardon mescanty education the expression of ideas in speech is doubtless a labour to me on the other hand it is at once a pleasure and a relief what i was about to observe is this i belong by birth to what are called i believe the classes you to the masses i have inherited instincts which have been refined and cultivated perhaps overcultivated by breeding and associationsyou are troubled with nothing of the sort therefore if these surroundings this discomfort not to mention the appalling overtures of our lady friends are distressing to you why consider how much more so they must be to me  trent smiled very faintly but he said nothing he was sitting crosslegged with his back against one of the poles which supported the open hut with his eyes fixed upon the cloud of mist hanging over a distant swamp a great yellow moon had stolen over the low range of stony hillsthe mist was curling away in little wreaths of gold trent was watching it but if you had asked him he would have told you that he was wondering when the alligators came out to feed and how near the village they ventured looking at his hard square face and keen black eyes no one would surely have credited him with any less material thoughts  furthermore the man whom trent had addressed as monty continued there arises the question of danger and physical suitability to the situation contrast our two cases my dear young friend i am twentyfive years older than you i have a weak heart a ridiculous muscle and the stamina of a rabbit my fighting days are over i can shoot straight but shooting would only serve us here until our cartridges were gonewhen the rush came a child could knock me over you on the contrary have the constitution of an ox the muscles of a bull and the wind of an ostrich you are if you will pardon my saying so a magnificent specimen of the animal man in the event of trouble you would not hesitate to admit that your chances of escape would be at least double mine trent lit a match under pretence of lighting his pipein reality because only a few feet away he had seen a pair of bright eyes gleaming at them through a low shrub a little native boy scuttled awayas black as night woollyheaded and shiny he had crept up unknown to look with fearful eyes upon the wonderful white strangers trent threw a lump of earth at him and laughed as he dodged it  well go ahead monty he said lets hear what youre driving at what a gab youve got to be sure  monty waved his handa magnificent and silencing gesture  i have alluded to these matters he continued merely in order to show you that the greater share of danger and discomfort in this expedition falls to my lot having reminded you of this trent i refer to the concluding sentence of your last speech the words indicated as i understood them some doubt of our ability to see this thing through  he paused peering over to where trent was sitting with grim immovable face listening with little show of interest he drew a long deep breath and moved over nearer to the doorway his manner was suddenly changed  scarlett trent he cried scarlett trent listen to me you are young and i am old to you this may be one adventure amongst manyit is my last ive craved for such a chance as this ever since i set foot in this cursed land its come late enough too late almost for me but im going through with it while theres breath in my body swear to me now that you will not back out do you hear trent swear  trent looked curiously at his companion vastly interested in this sudden outburst in the firmness of his tone and the tightening of the weak mouth after all then the old chap had some grit in him to trent who had known him for years as a brokendown hangeron of the settlement at buckomari a drunkard gambler a creature to all appearance hopelessly gone under this look and this almost passionate appeal were like a revelation he stretched out his great hand and patted his companion on the backa proceeding which obviously caused him much discomfort  bravo old cockie he said didnt imagine youd got the grit you know im not the chap to be let down easy well go through with it then and take all chances its my game right along every copper ive got went to pay the bearers here and to buy the kickshaws and rum for old whatshisname and im not anxious to start again as a pauper well stay here till we get our concessions or till they bury us then its a go  montyno one at buckomari had ever known of any other name for himstretched out a long hand with delicate tapering fingers and let it rest for a moment gingerly in the thick brown palm of his companion then he glanced stealthily over his shoulder and his eyes gleamed  i think if you will allow me trent i will just moisten my lipsno morewith some of that excellent brandy  trent caught his arm and held it firmly  no you dont he said shaking his head thats the last bottle and weve got the journey back well keep that in case of fever  a struggle went on in the face of the man whose hot breath fell upon trents cheek it was the usual thingthe disappointment of the baffled drunkarda little more terrible in his case perhaps because of the remnants of refinement still to be traced in his wellshaped features his weak eyes for once were eloquent but with the eloquence of cupidity and unwholesome craving his lean cheeks twitched and his hands shook  just a drop trent he pleaded im not feeling well indeed im not the odours here are so foul a liqueurglassful will do me all the good in the world  you wont get it monty so its no use whining trent said bluntly ive given way to you too much already buck up man were on the threshold of fortune and we need all our wits about us  of fortunefortune montys head dropped upon his chest his nostrils dilated he seemed to fall into a state of stupor trent watched him half curiously half contemptuously  youre terribly keen on moneymaking for an old un he remarked after a somewhat lengthy pause what do you want to do with it  to do with it the old man raised his head to do with it the gleam of reawakened desire lit up his face he sat for a moment thinking then he laughed softly  i will tell you master scarlett trent he said i will tell you why i crave for wealth you are a young and an ignorant man amongst other things you do not know what money will buy you have your coarse pleasures i do not doubt which seem sweet to you beyond themwhat a tasteless and barbaric display a vulgar generosity an ignorant and purposeless prodigality bah how different it is with those who know there are many things my young friend which i learned in my younger days and amongst them was the knowledge of how to spend money how to spend it you understand it is an art believe me i mastered it and until the end came it was magnificent in london and paris today to have wealth and to know how to spend it is to be the equal of princes the salons of the beautiful fly open before you great men will clamour for your friendship all the sweetest triumphs which love and sport can offer are yours you stalk amongst a world of pygmies a veritable giant the adored of women the envied of men you may be oldit matters not uglyyou will be fooled into reckoning yourself an adonis nobility is great art is great genius is great but the key to the pleasure storehouse of the world is a key of goldof gold  he broke off with a little gasp he held his throat and looked imploringly towards the bottle trent shook his head stonily there was something pitiful in the mans talk in that odd mixture of bitter cynicism and passionate earnestness but there was also something fascinating as regards the brandy however trent was adamant  not a drop he declared what a fool you are to want it monty youre a wreck already you want to pull through dont you leave the filthy stuff alone youll not live a month to enjoy your coin if we get it  live monty straightened himself out a tremor went through all his frame  live he repeated with fierce contempt you are making the common mistake of the whole ignorant herd you are measuring life by its length when its depth alone is of any import i want no more than a year or two at the most and i promise you mr scarlett trent my most estimable young companion that during that year i will live more than you in your whole lifetime i will drink deep of pleasures which you know nothing of i will be steeped in joys which you will never reach more nearly than the man who watches a change in the skies or a sunset across the ocean to you with boundless wealth there will be depths of happiness which you will never probe joys which if you have the wit to see them at all will be no more than a mirage to you  trent laughed outright easily and with real mirth yet in his heart were sown already the seeds of a secret dread there was a ring of passionate truth in montys words he believed what he was saying perhaps he was right the mans inborn hatred of a second or inferior place in anything stung him were there to be any niches after all in the temple of happiness to which he could never climb he looked back rapidly looked down the avenue of a squalid and unlovely life saw himself the child of drinksodden and brutal parents remembered the board school with its unlovely surroundings his struggles at a dreary trade his running away and the fierce draughts of delight which the joy and freedom of the sea had brought to him on the morning when he had crept on deck a stowaway to be lashed with every ropeend and to do the dirty work of every one then the slavery at a belgian settlement the job on a steamer trading along the congo the life at buckomari and lastly this bold enterprise in which the savings of years were invested it was a life which called aloud for fortune some day or other to make a little atonement the old man was dreaming wealth would bring him uneducated though he was happiness enough and to spare  a footstep fell softly upon the turf outside trent sprang at once into an attitude of rigid attention his revolver which for four days had been at full cock by his side stole out and covered the approaching shadow stealing gradually nearer and nearer the old man saw nothing for he slept worn out with excitement and exhaustion    chapter ii   a fat unwholesomelooking creature half native half belgian waddled across the open space towards the hut in which the two strangers had been housed he was followed at a little distance by two sturdy natives bearing a steaming pot which they carried on a pole between them trent set down his revolver and rose to his feet  what news oom sam he asked has the english officer been heard of he must be close up now  no news the little man grunted the king he send some of his own supper to the white men they got what they want he say they start work mine soon as like but they go away from here he not like them about the place see  oh that be blowed trent muttered whats this in the pot it dont smell bad  rabbit the interpreter answered tersely very good part kings own supper white men very favoured  trent bent over the pot which the two men had set upon the ground he took a fork from his belt and dug it in  very big bones for a rabbit sam he remarked doubtfully  sam looked away very big rabbits round here he remarked best keep pot send men away  trent nodded and the men withdrew  stew all right sam whispered confidentially you eat him no fear but you got to go king beginning get angry he say white men not to stay they got what he promised now they go i know kingknow this people well you get away quick he think you want be king here you got the papersall you want eh  not quite sam trent answered theres an englishman captain francis on his way here up the coast going on to walgetta fort he must be here tomorrow i want him to see the kings signature if hes a witness these niggers can never back out of the concession theyre slippery devils another chap may come on with more rum and theyll forget us and give him the right to work the mines too see  i see sam answered but him not safe to wait you believe me i know these tam niggers they take two days get drunk then get devils fourraving mad they drunk now kill any one tomorrowperhaps you kill you certain tomorrow night you listen now  trent stood up in the shadow of the overhanging roof every now and then came a wild shrill cry from the lower end of the village some one was beating a frightful cracked drum which they had got from a trader the tumult was certainly increasing trent swore softly and then looked irresolutely over his shoulder to where monty was sleeping  if the worst comes we shall never get away quickly he muttered that old carcase can scarcely drag himself along  sam looked at him with cunning eyes  he not fit only die he said softly he very old very sick man you leave him here i see to him  trent turned away in sick disgust  well be off tomorrow sam he said shortly i say im beastly hungry whats in that pot  sam spread out the palms of his hands  he all right i see him cooked he declared he two rabbits and one monkey  trent took out a plate and helped himself  all right he said be off now well go tomorrow before these towslyheaded beauties are awake  sam nodded and waddled off trent threw a biscuit and hit his companion on the cheek  here wake up monty he exclaimed suppers come from the royal kitchen bring your plate and tuck in  monty struggled to his feet and came meekly towards where the pot stood simmering upon the ground  im not hungry trent he said but i am very thirsty very thirsty indeed my throat is all parched i am most uncomfortable really i think your behaviour with regard to the brandy is most unkind and ungenerous i shall be ill i know i shall wont you  no i wont trent interrupted now shut up all that rot and eat something  i have no appetite thank you monty answered with sulky dignity  eat something and dont be a silly ass trent insisted weve a hard journey before us and youll need all the strength in your carcase to land in buckomari again here youve dropped some of your precious rubbish  trent stooped forward and picked up what seemed to him at first to be a piece of cardboard from the ground he was about to fling it to its owner when he saw that it was a photograph it was the likeness of a girl a very young girl apparently for her hair was still down her back and her dress was scarcely of the orthodox length it was not particularly well taken but trent had never seen anything like it before the lips were slightly parted the deep eyes were brimming with laughter the pose was full of grace even though the girls figure was angular trent had seen as much as this when he felt the smart of a sudden blow upon the cheek the picture was snatched from his hand and montyhis face convulsed with angerglowered fiercely upon him  you infernal young blackguard you impertinent meddling blockhead how dare you presume to look at that photograph how dare you sir how dare you  trent was too thoroughly astonished to resent either the blow or the fierce words he looked up into his aggressors face in blank surprise  i only looked at it he muttered it was lying on the floor  looked at it you looked at it like your confounded impertinence sir who are you to look at her if ever i catch you prying into my concerns again ill shoot youby heaven i will  trent laughed sullenly and having finished eating lit his pipe  your concerns are of no interest to me he said shortly keep em to yourselfand look here old un keep your hands off me i aint a safe man to hit let me tell you now sit down and cool off i dont want any more of your tantrums  then there was a long silence between the two men monty sat where trent had been earlier in the night at the front of the open hut his eyes fixed upon the everrising moon his face devoid of intelligence his eyes dim the fire of the last few minutes had speedily burnt out his halfsoddened brain refused to answer to the sudden spasm of memory which had awakened a spark of the former man if he had thoughts at all they hung around that brandy bottle the calm beauty of the african night could weave no spell upon him a few feet behind trent by the light of the moon was practising tricks with a pack of greasy cards by and by a spark of intelligence found its way into montys brain he turned round furtively  trent he said this is slow let us have a friendly gameyou and i  trent yawned  come on then he said single poker or euchre eh  i do not mind monty replied affably just which you prefer  single poker then trent said  and the stakes  weve nothing left to play for trent answered gloomily except cartridges  monty made a wry face poker for love my dear trent he said between you and me would lack all the charm of excitement it would be in fact monotonous let us exercise our ingenuity there must be something still of value in our possession  he relapsed into an affectation of thoughtfulness trent watched him curiously he knew quite well that his partner was dissembling but he scarcely saw to what end montys eyes moving round the grassbound hut stopped at trents knapsack which hung from the central pole he uttered a little exclamation  i have it he declared the very thing  well  you are pleased to set an altogether fictitious value upon half bottle of brandy we have left he said now i tell you what i will do in a few months we shall both be rich men i will play you for my i o u for fifty pounds fifty sovereigns trent against half the contents of that bottle come that is a fair offer is it not how we shall laugh at this in a year or two fifty pounds against a tumblerfulpositively there is no morea tumblerful of brandy  he was watching trents face all the time but the younger man gave no sign when he had finished trent took up the cards which he had shuffled for poker and dealt them out for patience montys eyes were dim with disappointment  what he cried you dont agree did you understand me fifty pounds trent why you must be mad  oh shut up trent growled i dont want your money and the brandys poison to you go to sleep  monty crept a little nearer to his partner and laid his hand upon his arm his shirt fell open showing the cords of his throat swollen and twitching his voice was half a sob  trent you are a young mannot old like me you dont understand my constitution brandy is a necessity to me ive lived on it so long that i shall die if you keep it from me remember its a whole day since i tasted a drop now ill make it a hundred what do you say to that one hundred  trent paused in his game and looked steadfastly into the eager face thrust close to his then he shrugged his shoulders and gathered up the cards  youre the silliest fool i ever knew he said bluntly but i suppose youll worry me into a fever if you dont have your own way  you agree monty shrieked trent nodded and dealt the cards  it must be a show after the draw he said we cant bet for weve nothing to raise the stakes with  monty was breathing hard and his fingers trembled as though the ague of the swamps was already upon him he took up his cards one by one and as he snatched up the last he groaned not a pair  four cards he whispered hoarsely trent dealt them out looked at his own hand and keeping a pair of queens took three more cards he failed to improve and threw them upon the floor with frantic eagerness monty grovelled down to see themthen with a shriek of triumph he threw down a pair of aces  mine he said i kept an ace and drew another give me the brandy  trent rose up measured the contents of the bottle with his forefinger and poured out half the contents into a horn mug monty stood trembling by  mind trent said you are a fool to drink it and i am a fool to let you you risk your life and mine sam has been up and swears we must clear out tomorrow what sort of form do you think youll be in to walk sixty miles through the swamps and bush with perhaps a score of these devils at our heels come now old un be reasonable  the veins on the old mans forehead stood out like whipcord  i won it he cried give it me give it me i say  trent made no further protest he walked back to where he had been lying and recommenced his patience monty drank off the contents of the tumbler in two long delicious gulps then he flung the horn upon the floor and laughed aloud  thats better he cried thats better what an ass you are trent to imagine that a drain like that would have any effect at all save to put life into a man bah what do you know about it  trent did not raise his head he went on with his solitary game and to all appearance paid no heed to his companions words monty was not in the humour to be ignored he flung himself on the ground opposite to his companion  what a slowblooded sort of creature you are trent he said dont you ever drink dont you ever take life a little more gaily  not when i am carrying my life in my hands trent answered grimly i get drunk sometimeswhen theres nothing on and the blues comenever at a time like this though  it is pleasant to hear the old man remarked stretching out his limbs that you do occasionally relax in your present frame of mindyou will not be offended i trustyou are just a little heavy as a companion never mind in a years time i will be teaching you how to dineto drink champagne toby the way trent have you ever tasted champagne  never trent answered gruffly dont know that i want to either  monty was compassionate my young friend he said i would give my soul to have our future before us to have your youth and never to have tasted champagne phew the memory of it is delicious  why dont you go to bed trent said youll need all your strength tomorrow  monty waved his hand with serene contempt  i am a man of humours my dear friend he said and tonight my humour is to talk and to be merry what is it the philosophers tell usthat the sweetest joys of life are the joys of anticipation here we are then on the eve of our triumphlet us talk plan be happy bah how thirsty it makes one come trent what stake will you have me set up against that other tumblerful of brandy  no stake that you can offer trent answered shortly that drop of brandy may stand between us and death pluck up your courage man and forget for a bit that there is such a thing as drink  monty frowned and looked stealthily across towards the bottle  thats all very well my friend he said but kindly remember that you are young and well and strong i am old and an invalid i need support dont be hard on me trent say fifty again  no nor fifty hundred trent answered shortly i dont want your money dont be such a fool or youll never live to enjoy it  monty shuffled on to his feet and walked aimlessly about the hut once or twice as he passed the place where the bottle rested he hesitated at last he paused his eyes lit up he stretched out his hand stealthily but before he could possess himself of it trents hand was upon his collar  you poor fool he said leave it alone cant you you want to poison yourself i know well you can do as you jolly well like when you are out of thisnot before  montys eyes flashed evil fires but his tone remained persuasive trent he said be reasonable look at me i ask you now whether i am not better for that last drop i tell you that it is food and wine to me i need it to brace me up for tomorrow now listen name your own stake set it up against that single glass i am not a mean man trent shall we say one hundred and fifty  trent looked at him half scornfully half deprecatingly  you are only wasting your breath monty he said i couldnt touch money won in such a way and i want to get you out of this alive theres fever in the air all around us and if either of us got a touch of it that drop of brandy might stand between us and death dont worry me like a spoilt child roll yourself up and get to sleep ill keep watch  i will be reasonable monty whined i will go to sleep my friend and worry you no more when i have had just one sip of that brandy it is the finest medicine in the world for me it will keep the fever off you do not want money you say come is there anything in this world which i possess or may possess which you will set against that three inches of brown liquid  trent was on the point of an angry negative suddenly he stoppedhesitatedand said nothing montys face lit up with sudden hope  come he cried there is something i see youre the right sort trent dont be afraid to speak out its yours man if you win it speak up  i will stake that brandy trent answered against the picture you let fall from your pocket an hour ago    chapter iii   for a moment monty stood as though dazed then the excitement which had shone in his face slowly subsided he stood quite silent muttering softly to himself his eyes fixed upon trent  her picture my little girls picture trent youre joking youre mad  am i trent answered nonchalantly perhaps so anyhow those are my terms you can play or not as you like i dont care  a red spot burned in montys cheeks and a sudden passion shook him he threw himself upon trent and would have struck him but that he was as a child in the younger mans grasp trent held him at a distance easily and without effort  theres nothing for you to make a fuss about he said gruffly i answered a plain question thats all i dont want to play at all i should most likely lose and youre much better without the brandy  monty was foaming with passion and baffled desire you beast he cried you low illbred cur how dared you look at her picture how dare you make me such an offer let me go i say let me go  but trent did not immediately relax his grasp it was evidently not safe to let him go his fit of anger bordered upon hysterics presently he grew calmer but more maudlin trent at last released him and thrusting the bottle of brandy into his coatpocket returned to his game of patience monty lay on the ground watching him with red shifty eyes  trent he whimpered but trent did not answer him  trent you neednt have been so beastly rough my arm is black and blue and i am sore all over  but trent remained silent monty crept a little nearer he was beginning to feel a very injured person  trent he said im sorry weve had words perhaps i said more than i ought to have done i did not mean to call you names i apologise  granted trent said tersely bending over his game  you see trent he went on youre not a family man are you if you were you would understand ive been down in the mire for years an utter scoundrel a poor weak brokendown creature but ive always kept that picture its my little girl she doesnt know im alive never will know but its all i have to remind me of her and i couldnt part with it could i  youd be a blackguard if you did trent answered curtly  montys face brightened  i was sure he declared that upon reflection you would think so i was sure of it i have always found you very fair trent and very reasonable now shall we say two hundred  you seem very anxious for a game trent remarked listen i will play you for any amount you like my i o u against your i o u are you agreeable  monty shook his head i dont want your money trent he said you know that i want that brandy i will leave it to you to name the stake i am to set up against it  as regards that trent answered shortly ive named the stake ill not consider any other  montys face once more grew black with anger  you are a beast trenta bully he exclaimed passionately ill not part with it  i hope you wont trent answered ive told you what i should think of you if you did  monty moved a little nearer to the opening of the hut he drew the photograph hesitatingly from his pocket and looked at it by the moonlight his eyes filled with maudlin tears he raised it to his lips and kissed it  my little girl he whispered my little daughter trent had relit his pipe and started a fresh game of patience monty standing in the opening began to mutter to himself  i am sure to wintrent is always unlucky at cardssuch a little risk and the brandyah  he sucked in his lips for a moment with a slight gurgling sound he looked over his shoulder and his face grew haggard with longing his eyes sought trents but trent was smoking stolidly and looking at the cards spread out before him as a chessplayer at his pieces  such a very small risk monty whispered softly to himself i need the brandy too i cannot sleep without it trent  trent made no answer he did not wish to hear already he had repented he was not a man of keen susceptibility but he was a trifle ashamed of himself at that moment he was tempted to draw the cork and empty the brandy out upon the ground  trent do you hear trent  he could no longer ignore the hoarse plaintive cry he looked unwillingly up monty was standing over him with white twitching face and bloodshot eyes  deal the cards he muttered simply and sat down  trent hesitated monty misunderstood him and slowly drew the photograph from his pocket and laid it face downwards upon the table trent bit his lip and frowned  rather a foolish game this he said lets call it off eh you shall havewell a thimbleful of the brandy and go to bed ill sit up im not tired  but monty swore a very profane and a very ugly oath  ill have the lot he muttered every drop every dd drop ay and ill keep the picture you see my friend you see deal the cards  then trent who had more faults than most men but who hated bad language looked at the back of the photograph and shuddering hesitated no longer he shuffled the cards and handed them to monty  your deal he said laconically same as before i suppose  monty nodded for his tongue was hot and his mouth dry and speech was not an easy thing but he dealt the cards one by one with jealous care and when he had finished he snatched upon his own and looked at each with sickly disappointment  how many trent asked holding out the pack monty hesitated half made up his mind to throw away three cards then put one upon the table finally with a little whine he laid three down with trembling fingers and snatched at the three which trent handed him his face lit up a scarlet flush burned in his cheek it was evident that the draw had improved his hand  trent took his own cards up looked at them nonchalantly and helped himself to one card monty could restrain himself no longer he threw his hand upon the ground  threes he cried in fierce triumph three of a kindnines  trent laid his own cards calmly down  a full hand he said kings up  monty gave a little gasp and then a moan his eyes were fixed with a fascinating glare upon those five cards which trent had so calmly laid down trent took up the photograph thrust it carefully into his pocket without looking at it and rose to his feet  look here monty he said you shall have the brandy youve no right to it and youre best without it by long chalks but there you shall have your own way  monty rose to his feet and balanced himself against the post  never mindabout the brandy he faltered give me back the photograph  trent shrugged his shoulders why he asked coolly full hand beats three dont it it was my win and my stake  thenthen take that but the blow never touched trent he thrust out his hand and held his assailant away at arms length  monty burst into tears  you dont want it he moaned whats my little girl to you you never saw her and you never will see her in your life  she is nothing to me of course trent answered a moment or so ago her picture was worth less to you than a quarter of a bottle of brandy  i was mad monty moaned she was my own little daughter god help her  i never heard you speak of her before trent remarked  there was a moments silence then monty crept out between the posts into the soft darkness and his voice seemed to come from a great distance  i have never told you about her he said because she is not the sort of woman who is spoken of at all to such men as you i am no more worthy to be her father than you are to touch the hem of her skirt there was a time trent many many years ago when i was proud to think that she was my daughter my own flesh and blood when i began to go downit was different down and down and lower still then she ceased to be my daughter after all it is best i am not fit to carry her picture you keep it trentyou keep itand give me the brandy  he staggered up on to his feet and crept back into the hut his hands were outstretched clawlike and bony his eyes were fierce as a wild cats but trent stood between him and the brandy bottle  look here he said you shall have the picture backcurse you but listen if i were you and had wife or daughter or sweetheart like this he touched the photograph almost reverentlywhy id go through fire and water but id keep myself decent aint you a silly old fool now weve made our piles you can go back and take her a fortune give her jewels and pretty dresses and all the faldelals that women love youll never do it if you muddle yourself up with that stuff pull yourself together old un chuck the drink till weve seen this thing through at any rate  you dont know my little girl monty muttered how should you shed care little for money or gewgaws but shed break her heart to see her old fathercome to thisbroken downworthlessa hopeless miserable wretch its too late trent ill have just a glass i think it will do me good i have been fretting trent you see how pale i am  he staggered towards the bottle trent watched him interfering no longer with a little chuckle of content he seized upon it and too fearful of interference from trent to wait for a glass raised it to his lips there was a gurgling in his throata little spasm as he choked and released his lips for a moment then the bottle slid from his nerveless fingers to the floor and the liquor oozed away in a little brown stream even trent dropped his pack of cards and sprang up startled for bending down under the sloping roof was a european to all appearance an englishman in linen clothes and white hat it was the man for whom they had waited    chapter iv   trent moved forward and greeted the newcomer awkwardly youre captain francis he said weve been waiting for you  the statement appeared to annoy the explorer he looked nervously at the two men and about the hut  i dont know how the devil you got to hear of my coming or what you want with me he answered brusquely are you both english  trent assented waving his hand towards his companion in introductory fashion  thats my pal monty he said were both english right enough  monty raised a flushed face and gazed with bloodshot eyes at the man who was surveying him so calmly then he gave a little gurgling cry and turned away captain francis started and moved a step towards him there was a puzzled look in his faceas though he were making an effort to recall something familiar  what is the matter with him he asked trent  drink  then why the devil dont you see that he doesnt get too much the newcomer said sharply dont you know what it means in this climate why hes on the highroad to a fever now who on this earth is it he reminds me of  trent laughed shortly  theres never a man in buckomarino nor in all africacould keep monty from the drink he said live with him for a month and try it it wouldnt suit youi dont think  he glanced disdainfully at the smooth face and careful dress of their visitor who bore the inspection with a kindly return of contempt  ive no desire to try he said but he reminds me very strongly of some one i knew in england what do you call himmonty  trent nodded  never heard any other name he said  have you ever heard him speak of england francis asked  trent hesitated what was this newcomer to him that he should give away his pal less than nothing he hated the fellow already with a rough sensitive mans contempt of a bearing and manners far above his own  never he dont talk  captain francis moved a step towards the huddledup figure breathing heavily upon the floor but trent leaning over stopped him  let him be he said gruffly i know enough of him to be sure that he needs no one prying and ferreting into his affairs besides it isnt safe for us to be dawdling about here how many soldiers have you brought with you  two hundred captain francis answered shortly  trent whistled  were all right for a bit then he said but its a pretty sort of a picnic youre on eh  never mind my business captain francis answered curtly what about yours why have you been hanging about here for me  ill show you trent answered taking a paper from his knapsack you see its like this there are two places near this show where ive found gold no use blowing about it down at buckomarithe fellows there havent the nerve of a kitten this cursed climate has sapped it all out of them i reckon monty and i clubbed together and bought presents for his majesty the boss here and monty wrote out this little documentsort of concession to us to sink mines and work them you see the old buffer signed it like winking directly he spotted the rum but we aint quite happy about it you see it aint to be supposed that hes got a conscience and theres only us saw him put his mark there well have to raise money to work the thing upon this and maybe therell be difficulties so what we thought was this heres an english officer coming lets get him to witness it and then if the king dont go on the square why its a government matter  captain francis lit a cigarette and smoked thoughtfully for a moment or two  i dont quite see he said why we should risk a row for the sake of you two  trent snorted  look here he said i suppose you know your business you dont want me to tell you that a decent excuse for having a row with this old johnny is about the best thing that could happen to you hes a bit too near the borders of civilisation to be a decent savage sooner or later some one will have to take him under their protection if you dont do it the french will theyre hanging round now looking out for an opportunity listen  both men moved instinctively towards the open part of the hut and looked across towards the village up from the little open space in front of the kings dwellinghouse leaped a hissing bright flame they had kindled a fire and black forms of men stark naked and wounding themselves with spears danced around it and made the air hideous with discordant cries the king himself too drunk to stand squatted upon the ground with an empty bottle by his side a breath of wind brought a strong noxious odour to the two men who stood watching captain francis puffed hard at his cigarette  ugh he muttered beastly  you may take my word for it trent said gruffly that if your two hundred soldiers werent camped in the bush yonder you and i and poor monty would be making sport for them tonight now come do you think a quarrel with that crew is a serious thing to risk  in the interests of civilisation captain francis answered with a smile i think not  i dont care how you put it trent answered shortly you soldiers all prate of the interests of civilisation of course its all rot you want the landyou want to rule to plant a flag and be called a patriot  captain francis laughed and you my superior friend he said glancing at trent gaunt ragged not too clean and back at montyyou want goldhonestly if you can get it if notwell it is not too wise to ask your partnership is a little mysterious isnt itwith a man like that out of your magnificent morality i trust that he may get his share  trent flushed a brickred an angry answer trembled upon his lips but oom sam white and with his little fat body quivering with fear came hurrying up to them in the broad track of the moonlight  king he angry he called out to them breathlessly him mad drunk angry he say white men all go away or he fire bush and use the poisoned arrow me off got bearers waiting  if you go before weve finished trent said ill not pay you a penny please yourself  the little fat man trembledpartly with rage partly with fear  you stay any longer he said and king him send after you and kill on way home white english soldiers go buckomari with you  trent shook his head  going the other way he said down to wana hill  oom sam shook his head vigorously  now you mind he said i tell you king send after you him blind mad  oom sam scuttled away captain francis looked thoughtful that little fat chap may be right he remarked if i were you id get out of this sharp you see im going the other way i cant help you  trent set his teeth  ive spent a good few years trying to put a bit together and this is the first chance ive had he said im going to have you back me as a british subject on that concession well go down into the village now if youre ready  ill get an escort francis said best to impress em a bit i think half a minute  he stepped back into the hut and looked steadfastly at the man who was still lying doubled up upon the floor was it his fancy or had those eyes closed swiftly at his turningwas it by accident too that monty with a little groan changed his position at that moment so that his face was in the shadow captain francis was puzzled  its like him he said to himself softly but after all the things too improbable  he turned away with a shade upon his face and followed trent out into the moonlight the screeching from the village below grew louder and more hideous every minute    chapter v   the howls became a roar blind passion was changed into purposeful fury who were these white men to march so boldly into the presence of the king without even the formality of sending an envoy ahead for the king of bekwando drunk or sober was a stickler for etiquette it pleased him to keep white men waiting for days sometimes a visitor was kept waiting his pleasure not altogether certain either as to his ultimate fate for there were ugly stories as to those who had journeyed to bekwando and never been seen or heard of since those were the sort of visitors with whom his ebon majesty loved to dally until they became pale with fright or furious with anger and impatience but men like this white captain who had brought him no presents who came in overwhelming force and demanded a passage through his country as a matter of right were his special detestation on his arrival he had simply marched into the place at the head of his columns of hausas without ceremony almost as a master into the very presence of the king now he had come again with one of those other miscreants who at least had knelt before him and brought rum and many other presents a slow burning sullen wrath was kindled in the kings heart as the three men drew near his people halfmad with excitement and debauch needed only a cry from him to have closed like magic round these insolent intruders his thick lips were parted his breath came hot and fierce whilst he hesitated but away outside the clearing was that little army of hausas cleanlimbed faithful well drilled and armed he choked down his wrath there were grim stories about those who had yielded to the luxury of slaying these white menstories of villages razed to the ground and destroyed of a king himself who had been shot of vengeance very swift and very merciless he closed his mouth with a snap and sat up with drunken dignity oom sam in fear and trembling moved to his side  what they want the king asked  oom sam spread out the document which trent had handed him upon a treestump and explained his majesty nodded more affably the document reminded him of the pleasant fact that there were three casks of rum to come to him every year besides he rather liked scratching his royal mark upon the smooth white paper he was quite willing to repeat the performance and took up the pen which sam handed him readily  him white man just come oom sam explained want see you do this  his majesty was flattered and with the air of one to whom the signing of treaties and concessions is an everyday affair affixed a thick black cross upon the spot indicated  that all right he asked oom sam  oom sam bowed to the ground  him want to know he said jerking his head towards captain francis whether you know what means  his forefinger wandered aimlessly down the document his majestys reply was prompt and cheerful  three barrels of rum a year  sam explained further there will be white men come digging he said white men with engines that blow making holes under the ground and cutting trees  the king was interested where he asked  oom sam pointed westward through the bush  down by creekside  the king was thoughtful rum come all right he asked  oom sam pointed to the papers  say so there he declared all quite plain  the king grinned it was not regal but he certainly did it if white men come too near they must be shotcarefully and from ambush he leaned back with the air of desiring the conference to cease oom sam turned to captain francis  king him quite satisfied he declared him all explained beforehe agree  the king suddenly woke up again he clutched sam by the arm and whispered in his ear this time it was sam who grinned  king him say him signed paper twice he explained him want four barrels of rum now  trent laughed harshly  he shall swim in it sam he said he shall float down to hell upon it  oom sam explained to the king that owing to the sentiments of affection and admiration with which the white men regarded him the three barrels should be made into four whereupon his majesty bluntly pronounced the audience at an end and waddled off into his imperial abode  the two englishmen walked slowly back to the hut between them there had sprung up from the first moment a strong and mutual antipathy the blunt savagery of trent his apparently heartless treatment of his weaker partner and his avowed unscrupulousness offended the newcomer much in the same manner as in many ways he himself was obnoxious to trent his immaculate fatigueuniform his calm superciliousness his obvious air of belonging to a superior class were galling to trent beyond measure he himself felt the differencehe realised his ignorance his unkempt and uncaredfor appearance perhaps as the two men walked side by side some faint foreshadowing of the future showed to trent another and a larger world where they two would once more walk side by side the outward differences between them lessened the smouldering irritation of the present leaping up into the redhot flame of hatred perhaps it was just as well for john francis that the man who walked so sullenly by his side had not the eyes of a seer for it was a wild country and trent himself had drunk deep of its lawlessness a little accident with a knife a carelessly handled revolver and the man who was destined to stand more than once in his way would pass out of his life for ever but in those days trent knew nothing of what was to comewhich was just as well for john francis                                                       monty was sitting up when they reached the hut but at the sight of trents companion he cowered back and affected sleepiness this time however francis was not to be denied he walked to montys side and stood looking down upon him  i think he said gently that we have met before  a mistake monty declared never saw you in my life just off to sleep  but francis had seen the trembling of the mans lips and his nervously shaking hands  there is nothing to fear he said i wanted to speak to you as a friend  dont know you dont want to speak to you monty declared  francis stooped down and whispered a name in the ear of the sullen man trent leaned forward but he could not hear itonly he too saw the shudder and caught the little cry which broke from the white lips of his partner  monty sat up white despairing with strained set face and bloodshot eyes  look here he said i may be what you say and i may not its no business of yours do you hear now be off and leave me alone such as i am i am i wont be interfered with but montys voice became a shriek  leave me alone he cried i have no name i tell you no past no future let me alone or by heaven ill shoot you  francis shrugged his shoulders and turned away with a sigh  a word with you outside he said to trentand trent followed him out into the night the moon was palingin the east there was a faint shimmer of dawn a breeze was rustling in the trees the two men stood face to face  look here sir francis said i notice that this concession of yours is granted to you and your partner jointly whilst alive and to the survivor in case of the death of either of you  what then trent asked fiercely  this its a beastly unfair arrangement but i suppose its too late to upset it your partner is half sodden with drink now you know what that means in this climate youve the wit to keep sober enough yourself youre a strong man and he is weak you must take care of him you can if you will  anything else trent asked roughly  the officer looked his man up and down  were in a pretty rough country he said and a man gets into the habit of having his own way here but listen to me if anything happens to your partner here or in buckomari youll have me to reckon with i shall not forget we are bound to meet remember that  trent turned his back upon him in a fit of passion which choked down all speech captain francis lit a cigarette and walked across towards his camp    chapter vi   a sky like flame and an atmosphere of sulphur no breath of air not a single ruffle in the great drooping leaves of the african trees and dense prickly shrubs all around the dank nauseous odour of poison flowers the ceaseless dripping of poisonous moisture from the face of the man who stood erect unvanquished as yet in the struggle for life the fierce sweat poured like rainhis older companion had sunk to the ground and the spasms of an ugly death were twitching at his whitening lips  im done trent he gasped faintly fight your way on alone youve a chance yet the ways getting a bit easieri fancy were on the right track and weve given those black devils the slip nurse your strength youve a chance let me be its no use carrying a dead man gaunt and wild with the cold fear of death before him also the younger man broke out into a fit of cursing  may they rot in the blackest corner of hell oom sam and those miserable vermin he shouted a path all the way the fever season over the swamps dry oh when i think of sams smooth jargon i would give my chance of life such as it is to have him here for one moment to think that beast must live and we die  prop me up against this tree trentand listen monty whispered dont fritter away the little strength you have left  trent did as he was told he had no particular affection for his partner and the prospect of his death scarcely troubled him yet for twenty miles and more through fetid swamps and poisoned jungles he had carried him over his shoulder fighting fiercely for the lives of both of them while there remained any chance whatever of escape now he knew that it was in vain he regretted only his wasted effortshe had no sentimental regrets in leaving him it was his own life he wantedhis own life he meant to fight for  i wouldnt swear at oom sam too hard monty continued remember for the last two days he was doing all he could to get us out of the place it was those fetish fellows who worked the mischief and hecertainlywarned us all he could he took us safely to bekwando and he worked the oracle with the king  yes and afterwards sneaked off with francis trent broke in bitterly and took every bearer with himafter wed paid them for the return journey too sent us out here to be trapped and butchered like rats if wed only had a guide we should have been at buckomari by now  he was right about the gold monty faltered its there for the picking up if only we could have got back we were rich for life if you escapeyou need never do another stroke of work as long as you live  trent stood upright wiped the dank sweat from his forehead and gazed around him fiercely and upwards at that lurid little patch of blue sky  if i escape he muttered ill get out of this if i die walking im sorry youre done monty he continued slowly say the word and ill have one more spell at carrying you youre not a heavy weight and im rested now  but monty in whose veins was the chill of death and who sought only for rest shook his head  it shakes me too much he said and its only a waste of strength you get on trent and dont you bother about me youve done your duty by your partner and a bit more you might leave me the small revolver in case those howling savages come upand trent  yes  the picturejust for a moment id like to have one look at her  trent drew it out from his pocketawkwardlyand with a little shame at the care which had prompted him to wrap it so tenderly in the oilskin sheet monty shaded his face with his hands and the picture stole up to his lips trent stood a little apart and hated himself for this last piece of inhumanity he pretended to be listening for the stealthy approach of their enemies in reality he was struggling with the feeling which prompted him to leave this picture with the dying man  i suppose youd best have it he said sullenly at last  but monty shook his head feebly and held out the picture  trent took it with an odd sense of shame which puzzled him he was not often subject to anything of the sort  it belongs to you trent i lost it on the square and its the only social law ive never brokento pay my gambling debts theres one word more  yes  its about that clause in our agreement i never thought it was quite fair you know trent  which clause  the clause whichat my deathmakes you sole owner of the whole concession you seethe odds were scarcely even were they it wasnt likely anything would happen to you  i planned the thing trent said and i saw it through you did nothing but find a bit of brass it was only square that the odds should be in my favour besides you agreed you signed the thing  but i wasnt quite well at the time monty faltered i didnt quite understand no trent its not quite fair i did a bit of the work at least and im paying for it with my life  whats it matter to you now trent said with unintentional brutality you cant take it with you  monty raised himself a little his eyes lit with feverish fire were fastened upon the other man  theres my little girl he said hoarsely id like to leave her something if the thing turns out big trent you can spare a small share theres a letter here its to my lawyers theyll tell you all about her  trent held out his hands for the letter  all right he said with sullen ungraciousness ill promise something i wont say how much well see  trent youll keep your word monty begged id like her to know that i thought of her  oh very well trent declared thrusting the letter into his pocket its a bit outside our agreement you know but ill see to it anyhow anything else  monty fell back speechless there was a sudden change in his face trent who had seen men die before let go his hand and turned away without any visible emotion then he drew himself straight and set his teeth hard together  im going to get out of this he said to himself slowly and with fierce emphasis im not for dying and i wont die  he stumbled on a few steps a little black snake crept out of its bed of mud and looked at him with yellow eyes protruding from its upraised head he kicked it savagely awaya crumpled shapeless mass it was a piece of brutality typical of the man ahead he fancied that the air was clearerthe fetid mists less chokingin the deep nightsilence a few hours back he had fancied that he had heard the faint thunder of the sea if this were indeed so it would be but a short distance now to the end of his journey with dull glazed eyes and clenched hands he reeled on a sort of stupor had laid hold of him but through it all his brain was working and he kept steadily to a fixed course was it the sea in his ears he wondered that long monotonous rolling of sound and there were lights before his eyesthe lights of buckomari or the lights of death  they found him an hour or two later unconscious but alive on the outskirts of the village   three days later two men were seated face to face in a long wooden house the largest and most important in buckomari village  smoking a corncob pipe and showing in his face but few marks of the terrible days through which he had passed was scarlett trentopposite to him was hiram da souza the capitalist of the region the jewof da souzas nationality it was impossible to have any doubtwas coarse and large of his type he wore soiled linen clothes and was smoking a black cigar on the little finger of each hand thickly encrusted with dirt was a diamond ring on his thick protruding lips a complacent smile the concession already soiled and dogeared was spread out before them  it was da souza who did most of the talking trent indeed had the appearance of a man only indirectly interested in the proceedings  you see my dear sir da souza was saying this little concession of yours is after all a very risky business these niggers have absolutely no sense honour do i not know italasto my cost  trent listened in contemptuous silence da souza had made a fortune trading fiery rum on the congo and had probably done more to debauch the niggers he spoke of so bitterly than any man in africa  the bekwando people have a bad namevery bad name as for any sense of commercial honourmy dear trent one might as well expect diamonds to spring up like mushrooms under our feet  the document trent said is signed by the king and witnessed by captain francis who is agentgeneral out here or something of the sort for the english government it was no gift and dont you think it but a piece of hard bartering forty bearers carried our presents to bekwando and it took us three months to get through there is enough in it to make us both millionaires  then why da souza asked looking up with twinkling eyes do you want to sell me a share in it  because i havent a darned cent to bless myself with trent answered curtly ive got to have ready money ive never had my fist on five thousand pounds beforeno nor five thousand pence but as im a living man let me have my start and ill hold my own with you all  da souza threw himself back in his chair with uplifted hands  but my dear friend he cried my dear young friend you were not thinkingdo not say that you were thinking of asking such a sum as five thousand pounds for this little piece of paper  the amazement half sorrowful half reproachful on the mans face was perfectly done but trent only snorted  that piece of paper as you call it cost us the hard savings of years it cost us weeks and months in the bush and amongst the swampsit cost a mans life not to mention the niggers we lost come im not here to play skittles are you on for a deal or not if youre doubtful about it ive another market say the word and well drink and part but if you want to do business here are my terms five thousand for a sixth share  sixth share the jew screamed sixth share  trent nodded  the things worth a million at least he said a sixth share is a great fortune dont waste any time turning up the whites of your eyes at me ive named my terms and i shant budge from them you can lay your bottom dollar on that  da souza took up the document and glanced it through once more  the concession he remarked is granted to scarlett trent and to one monty jointly who is this monty and what has he to say to it  trent set his teeth hard and he never blenched  he was my partner but he died in the swamps poor chap we had horrible weather coming back it pretty near finished me  trent did not mention the fact that for four days and nights they were hiding in holes and up trees from the natives whom the king of bekwando had sent after them that their bearers had fled away and that they had been compelled to leave the track and make their way through an unknown part of the bush  but your partners share the jew asked what of that  it belongs to me trent answered shortly we fixed it so before we started we neither of us took much stock in our relations if i had died monty would have taken the lot it was a fair deal youll find it there  the jew nodded  and your partner he said you saw him die there is no doubt about that  trent nodded  he is as dead he said as julius caesar  if i offered you da souza began  if you offered me four thousand nine hundred and ninetynine pounds trent interrupted roughly i would tell you to go to glory  da souza sighed it was a hard man to deal withthis  very well he said if i give way if i agree to your terms you will be willing to make over this sixth share to me both on your own account and on account of your late partner  youre right mate trent assented plank down the brass and its a deal  i will give you four thousand pounds for a quarter share da souza said  trent knocked the ashes from his pipe and stood up  here dont waste any more of my time he said stand out of the way im off  da souza kept his hands upon the concession  my dear friend he said you are so violent you are so abrupt now listen i will give you five thousand for a quarter share it is half my fortune  give me the concession trent said im off  for a fifth da souza cried  trent moved to the door without speech da souza groaned  you will ruin me he said i know it come then five thousand for a sixth share it is throwing money away  if you think so youd better not part trent said still lingering in the doorway just as you say i dont care  for a full minute da souza hesitated he had an immense belief in the richness of the country set out in the concession he knew probably more about it than trent himself but five thousand pounds was a great deal of money and there was always the chance that the government might not back the concession holders in case of trouble he hesitated so long that trent was actually disappearing before he had made up his mind  come back mr trent he called out i have decided i accept i join with you  trent slowly returned his manner showed no exultation  you have the money here he asked  da souza laid down a heap of notes and gold upon the table trent counted them carefully and thrust them into his pocket then he took up a pen and wrote his name at the foot of the assignment which the jew had prepared  have a drink he asked  da souza shook his head  the less we drink in this country he said the better i guess out here spirits come next to poison ill smoke with you if you have a cigar handy  trent drew a handful of cigars from his pocket theyre beastly he said but its a beastly country ill be glad to turn my back on it  there is a good deal da souza said which we must now talk about  tomorrow trent said curtly no more now i havent got over my miserable journey yet im going to try and get some sleep  he swung out into the heavy darkness the air was thick with unwholesome odours rising from the lakelike swamp beyond the drooping circle of trees he walked a little way towards the sea and sat down upon a log a faint landbreeze was blowing a melancholy soughing came from the edge of the forest only a few hundred yards back sullen black impenetrable he turned his face inland unwillingly with a superstitious little thrill of fear was it a coyote calling or had he indeed heard the moan of a dying man somewhere back amongst that dark gloomy jungle he scoffed at himself was he becoming as a girl weak and timid yet a moment later he closed his eyes and pressed his hands tightly over his hot eyeballs he was a man of little imaginative force yet the white face of a dying man seemed suddenly to have floated up out of the darkness to have come to him like a willothewisp from the swamp and the hollow lifeless eyes seemed ever to be seeking his mournful and eloquent with dull reproach trent rose to his feet with an oath and wiped the sweat from his forehead he was trembling and he cursed himself heartily  another fools hour like this he muttered and the fever will have me come out of the shadows you whitefaced skulking reptile youbah what a blithering fool i am there is no one there how could there be any one  he listened intently from afar off came the faint moaning of the wind in the forest and the night sounds of restless animals nearer there was no onenothing stirred he laughed out loud and moved away to spend his last night in his little wooden home on the threshold he paused and faced once more that black mysterious line of forest  well ive done with you now he cried a note of coarse exultation in his tone ive gambled for my life and ive won tomorrow ill begin to spend the stakes    chapter vii   in a handsomely appointed room of one of the largest hotels in london a man was sitting at the head of a table strewn with blottingpaper and writing materials of every description half a dozen chairs had been carelessly pushed back there were empty champagne bottles upon the sideboard the air was faintly odorous of tobacco smokeblue wreaths were still curling upwards towards the frescoed ceiling yet the gathering had not been altogether a festive one there were sheets of paper still lying about covered with figures a brassbound ledger lay open at the further end of the table in the background a young man slim pale illdressed in sober black was filling a large tin box with documents and letters  it had been a meeting of giants men whose names were great in the world of finance had occupied those elaborately decorated leather chairs there had been cynicism criticism and finally enthusiasm for the man who remained it had been a triumph he had appeared to do but little in the way of persuasion his manners had been brusque and his words had been few yet he remained the master of the situation he had gained a victory not only financial but moral over men whose experience and knowledge were far greater than his he was no city magnate nor had he ever received any training in those arts and practices which go to the making of one for his earlier life had been spent in a wilder country where the gambling was for life and not merely for gold it was scarlett trent who sat there in thoughtful and absorbed silence he was leaning a little back in a comfortably upholstered chair with his eyes fixed on a certain empty spot upon the table the few inches of polished mahogany seemed to himempty of all significance in themselvesto be reflecting in some mysterious manner certain scenes in his life which were now very rarely brought back to him the event of today he knew to be the culmination of a success as rapid as it had been surprising he was a millionaire this deal today in which he had held his own against the shrewdest and most astute men of the great city had more than doubled his already large fortune a few years ago he had landed in england friendless and unknown today he had stepped out from even amongst the chosen few and had planted his feet in the higher lands whither the faces of all men are turned with a grim smile upon his lips he recalled one by one the various enterprises into which he had entered the courage with which he had forced them through the solid strength with which he had thrust weaker men to the wall and had risen a little higher towards his goal upon the wreck of their fortunes where other men had failed he had succeeded today the triumph was his alone he was a millionaireone of the princes of the world  the young man who had filled his box and also a black bag was ready to go he ventured most respectfully to break in upon the reflections of his employer  is there anything more for me to do sir  trent woke from his daydream into the present he looked around the room and saw that no papers had been omitted then he glanced keenly into his clerks face  nothing more he said you can go  it was significant of the man that notwithstanding his hour of triumph he did not depart in the slightest degree from the cold gruffness of his tone the little speech which his clerk had prepared seemed to stick in his throat  i trust sir that you will forgivethat you will pardon the liberty if i presume to congratulate you upon such a magnificent stroke of business  scarlett trent faced him coldly what do you know about it he asked what concern is it of yours young man eh  the clerk sighed and became a little confused he had indulged in some wistful hopes that for once his master might have relaxed that an opportune word of congratulation might awaken some spark of generosity in the man who had just added a fortune to his great store he had a girlwife from whose cheeks the roses were slowly fading and very soon would come a time when a banknote even the smallest would be a priceless gift it was for her sake he had spoken he saw now that he had made a mistake  i am very sorry sir he said humbly of course i know that these men have paid an immense sum for their shares in the bekwando syndicate at the same time it is not my business and i am sorry that i spoke  it is not your business at any time to remember what i receive for properties scarlett trent said roughly havent i told you that before what did i say when you came to me you were to hear nothing and see nothing outside your duties speak up man dont stand there like a jay  the clerk was pale and there was an odd sensation in his throat but he thought of his girlwife and he pulled himself together  you are quite right sir he said to any one else i should never have mentioned it but we were alone and i thought that the circumstances might make it excusable  his employer grunted in an ominous manner  when i say forget i mean forget he declared i dont want to be reminded by you of my own business dye think i dont know it  i am very sure that you do sir the clerk answered humbly i quite see that my allusion was an error  scarlett trent had turned round in his chair and was eying the pale nervous figure with a certain hard disapproval  thats a beastly coat youve got on dickenson he said why dont you get a new one  i am standing in a strong light sir the young man answered with a new fear at his heart it wants brushing too i will endeavour to get a new onevery shortly  his employer grunted again  whats your salary he asked  two pounds fifteen shillings a week sir  and you mean to say that you cant dress respectably on that what do you do with your money eh how do you spend it drink and musichalls i suppose  the young man was able at last to find some spark of dignity a pink spot burned upon his cheeks  i do not attend musichalls sir nor have i touched wine or spirits for years ii have a wife to keep and perhapsi am expecting  he stopped abruptly how could he mention that other matter which for all its anxieties still possessed for him a sort of quickening joy in the face of that brutal stare he did not conclude his sentence the momentary light died out of his pale commonplace features he hung his head and was silent  a wife scarlett trent repeated with contempt and all the rest of it of course oh what poor donkeys you young men are here are you with your way to make in the world with your foot scarcely upon the bottom rung of the ladder grubbing along on a few bob a week and you choose to go and chuck away every chance you ever might have for a moments folly a poor pretty face i suppose a moonlight walk on a bank holiday a little maudlin sentiment and over you throw all your chances in life no wonder the herd is so great and the leaders so few he added with a sneer  the young man raised his head once more the pink spot was burning yet how hard to be dignified with the man from whom comes ones daily bread  you are mistaken sir he said i am quite happy and quite satisfied  scarlett trent laughed scornfully  then you dont look it he exclaimed  i may not sir the young man continued with a desperate courage but i am after all happiness is spelt with different letters for all of us you have denied yourselfworked hard carried many burdens and run great risks to become a millionaire i too have denied myself have worked and struggled to make a home for the girl i cared for you have succeeded and you are happy i can hold edithsi beg your pardon my wifes hand in mine and i am happy i have no ambition to be a millionaire i was very ambitious to win my wife  scarlett trent looked at him for a moment open mouthed and openeyed then he laughed outright and a chill load fell from the heart of the man who for a moment had forgotten himself the laugh was scornful perhaps but it was not angry  well youve shut me up he declared you seem a poor sort of a creature to me but if youre content its no business of mine here buy yourself an overcoat and drink a glass of wine im off  he rose from his seat and threw a banknote over the table the clerk opened it and handed it back with a little start  i am much obliged to you sir he said humbly but you have made a mistake this note is for fifty pounds  trent glanced at it and held out his hand then he paused  never mind he said with a short laugh i meant to give you a fiver but it dont make much odds only see that you buy some new clothes  the clerk half closed his eyes and steadied himself by grasping the back of a chair there was a lump in his throat in earnest now  youyou mean it sir he gasped iim afraid i cant thank you  dont try unless you want me to take it back trent said strolling to the sideboard lord how those city chaps can guzzle not a drop of champagne left two unopened bottles though here stick em in your bag and take em to the missis young man i paid for the lot so theres no use leaving any now clear out as quick as you can im off  you will allow me sir  scarlett trent closed the door with a slam and disappeared the young man passed him a few moments later as he stood on the steps of the hotel lighting a cigar he paused again intent on stammering out some words of thanks trent turned his back upon him coldly    chapter viii   trent on leaving the hotel turned for almost the first time in his life westwards for years the narrow alleys the thronged streets the great buildings of the city had known him day by day almost hour by hour its roar and clamour the strife of tongues and keen measuring of wits had been the salt of his life steadily sturdily almost insolently he had thrust his way through to the front ranks in many respects those were singular and unusual elements which had gone to the making of his success his had not been the victory of honied falsehoods of suave deceit of gentle but legalised robbery he had been a hard worker a daring speculator with nerves of iron and courage which would have glorified a nobler cause nor had his been the methods of good fellowship the sharing of good turns the camaraderie of finance the men with whom he had had large dealings he had treated as enemies rather than friends ever watching them covertly with close but unslackening vigilance and now for the present at any rate it was all over there had come a pause in his life his back was to the city and his face was set towards an unknown world half unconsciously he had undertaken a little voyage of exploration  from the strand he crossed trafalgar square into pall mall and up the haymarket into piccadilly he was very soon aware that he had wandered into a world whose ways were not his ways and with whom he had no kinship yet he set himself sedulously to observe them conscious that what he saw represented a very large side of life from the first he was aware of a certain difference in himself and his ways the careless glance of a lounger on the pavement of pall mall filled him with a sudden anger the man was wearing gloves an article of dress which trent ignored and smoking a cigarette which he loathed trent was carelessly dressed in a tweed suit and red tie his critic wore a silk hat and frock coat patentleather boots and a dark tie of invisible pattern yet trent knew that he was a type of that class which would look upon him as an outsider and a black sheep until he had bought his standing they would expect him to conform to their type to learn to speak their jargon to think with their puny brains and to see with their shortsighted eyes at the criterion he turned in and had a drink and bolder for the wine which he had swallowed at a gulp he told himself that he would do nothing of the sort he would not alter a jot they must take him as he was or leave him he suffered his thoughts to dwell for a moment upon his wealth on the years which had gone to the winning of it on a certain nameless day the memory of which even now sent sometimes the blood running colder through his veins on the weaker men who had gone under that he might prosper now that it was his he wanted the best possible value for it it was the natural desire of the man to be uppermost in the bargain the delights of the world behind it seemed to him that he had already drained the crushing of his rivals the homage of his less successful competitors the grosser pleasures of wine the musichalls and the unlimited spending of money amongst people whom he despised had long since palled upon him he had a keen strong desire to escape once and for ever from his surroundings he lounged along smoking a large cigar keeneyed and observant laying up for himself a store of impressions unconsciously irritated at every step by a sense of ostracism of being in some indefinable manner without kinship and wholly apart from this world in which it seemed natural now that he should find some place he gazed at the great houses without respect or envy at the men with a fierce contempt at the women with a sore feeling that if by chance he should be brought into contact with any of them they would regard him as a sort of wild animal to be humoured or avoided purely as a matter of selfinterest the very brightness and brilliancy of their toilettes the rustling of their dresses the trim elegance and daintiness which he was able to appreciate without being able to understand only served to deepen his consciousness of the gulf which lay between him and them they were of a world to which even if he were permitted to enter it he could not possibly belong he returned such glances as fell upon him with fierce insolence he was indeed somewhat of a strange figure in his illfitting and inappropriate clothes amongst a gathering of smart people a lady looking at him through raised lorgnettes turned and whispered something with a smile to her companiononce before he had heard an audible titter from a little group of loiterers he returned the glance with a lightninglike look of diabolical fierceness and turning round stood upon the curbstone and called a hansom  a sense of depression swept over him as he was driven through the crowded streets towards waterloo the halfscornful halfearnest prophecy to which he had listened years ago in a squalid african hut flashed into his mind for the first time he began to have dim apprehensions as to his future all his life he had been a toiler and joy had been with him in the fierce combat which he had waged day by day he had fought his battle and he had wonwhere were the fruits of his victory a puny miserable little creature like dickenson could prate of happiness and turn a shining face to the futuredickenson who lived upon a pittance who depended upon the whim of his employer and who confessed to ambitions which were surely pitiable trent lit a fresh cigar and smiled things would surely come right with himthey must what dickenson could gain was surely his by right a thousand times over  he took the train for walton travelling first class and treated with much deference by the officials on the line as he alighted and passed through the bookinghall into the stationyard a voice hailed him he looked up sharply a carriage and pair of horses was waiting and inside a young woman with a very smart hat and a profusion of yellow hair  come on general she cried ive done a skip and driven down to meet you such jokes when they miss me the old lady will be as sick as they make em cant we have a drive round for an hour eh  her voice was highpitched and penetrating listening to it trent unconsciously compared it with the voices of the women of that other world into which he had wandered earlier in the afternoon he turned a frowning face towards her  you might have spared yourself the trouble he said shortly i didnt order a carriage to meet me and i dont want one i am going to walk home  she tossed her head  what a beastly temper youre in she remarked im not particular about driving do you want to walk alone  exactly he answered i do  she leaned back in the carriage with heightened colour  well theres one thing about me she said acidly i never go where i aint wanted  trent shrugged his shoulders and turned to the coachman  drive home gregg he said im walking  the man touched his hat the carriage drove off and trent with a grim smile upon his lips walked along the dusty road soon he paused before a little white gate marked private and unlocking it with a key which he took from his pocket passed through a little plantation into a large parklike field he took off his hat and fanned himself thoughtfully as he walked the one taste which his long and absorbing struggle with the giants of capel court had never weakened was his love for the country he lifted his head to taste the breeze which came sweeping across from the surrey downs keenly relishing the fragrance of the newmown hay and the faint odour of pines from the distant darkcrested hill as he came up the field towards the house he looked with pleasure upon the great bed of gorgeouscoloured rhododendrons which bordered his lawn the dark cedars which drooped over the smooth shaven grass and the faint flush of colour from the rosegardens beyond the house itself was small but picturesque it was a grey stone building of two stories only and from where he was seemed completely embowered in flowers and creepers in a way he thought he would be sorry to leave it it had been a pleasant summerhouse for him although of course it was no fit dwellinghouse for a millionaire he must look out for something at once nowa country house and estate all these things would come as a matter of course  he opened another gate and passed into an inner plantation of pines and shrubs which bordered the grounds a winding path led through it and coming round a bend he stopped short with a little exclamation a girl was standing with her back to him rapidly sketching upon a little block which she had in her left hand  hullo he remarked another guest and who brought you down young lady eh  she turned slowly round and looked at him in cold surprise trent knew at once that he had made a mistake she was plainly dressed in white linen and a cool muslin blouse but there was something about her unmistakable even to trent which placed her very far apart indeed from any woman likely to have become his unbidden guest he knew at once that she was one of that class with whom he had never had any association she was the first lady whom he had ever addressed and he could have bitten out his tongues when he remembered the form of his doing so  i beg your pardon miss he said confusedly my mistake you see your back was turned to me  she nodded and smiled graciously  if you are mr scarlett trent she said it is i who should apologise for i am a flagrant trespasser you must let me explain    chapter ix   the girl had moved a step towards him as she spoke and a gleam of sunlight which had found its way into the grove flashed for a moment on the stray little curls of her browngold hair and across her face her lips were parted in a delightful smile she was very pretty and inclined to be apologetic but scarlett trent had seen nothing save that first glance when the sun had touched her face with fire a strong man at all times and more than commonly selfmasterful he felt himself now as helpless as a child a sudden pallor had whitened his face to the lips there were strange singings in his ears and a mist before his eyes it was she there was no possibility of any mistake it was the girl for whose picture he had gambled in the hut at bekwandomontys babygirl of whom he had babbled even in death he leaned against a tree stricken dumb and she was frightened you are ill she cried im so sorry let me run to the house and fetch some one  he had strength enough to stop her a few deep breaths and he was himself again shaken and with a heart beating like a steamengine but able at least to talk intelligently  im sorrydidnt mean to frighten you he said its the heat i get an attack like this sometimes yes im mr trent i dont know what youre doing here but youre welcome  how nice of you to say so she answered brightly but then perhaps youll change your mind when you know what i have been doing  he laughed shortly  nothing terrible i should say looks as though youve been making a picture of my house i dont mind that  she dived in her pocket and produced a cardcase  ill make full confession she said frankly im a journalist  a what he repeated feebly  a journalist im on the hour this isnt my work as a rule but the man who should have come is ill and his junior cant sketch so they sent me dont look as though i were a ghost please havent you ever heard of a girl journalist before  never he answered emphatically i didnt know that ladies did such things  she laughed gaily but softly and trent understood then what was meant by the music of a womans voice  oh its not at all an uncommon thing she answered him you wont mind my interviewing you will you  doing what he asked blankly  interviewing you thats what ive come for you know and we want a little sketch of your house for the paper i know you dont like it i hear youve been awfully rude to poor little morrison of the post but ill be very careful what i say and very quick  he stood looking at her a dazed and bewildered man from the trim little hat with its white band and jaunty bunch of cornflowers to the wellshaped patent shoes she was neatly and daintily dressed a journalist he gazed once more into her face at the brown eyes watching him now a little anxiously the mouth with the humorous twitch at the corner of her lips the little wisps of hair flashed again in the sunlight it was she he had found her  she took his silence for hesitation and continued a little anxiously  i really wont ask you many questions and it would do me quite a lot of good to get an interview with you of course i oughtnt to have begun this sketch without permission if you mind that ill give it up  he found his tongue awkwardly but vigorously  you can sketch just as long as ever you please and make what use of it you like he said its only a bit of a place though  how nice of you and the interview  ill tell you whatever you want to know he said quietly  she could scarcely believe in her good fortune especially when she remembered the description of the man which one of the staff had given he was gruff vulgar illtempered the chief ought to be kicked for letting her go near him this was what she had been told she laughed softly to herself  it is very good indeed of you mr trent she said earnestly i was quite nervous about coming for i had no idea that you would be so kind shall i finish my sketch first and then perhaps you will be able to spare me a few minutes for the interview  just as you like he answered may i look at it  certainly she answered holding out the block but it isnt half finished yet  will it take long  about an hour i think  you are very clever he said with a little sigh  she laughed outright  people are calling you the cleverest man in london today she said  pshaw it isnt the cleverness that counts for anything that makes money  then he set his teeth hard together and swore vigorously but silently she had become suddenly interested in her work a shrill burst of laughter from the lawn in front had rung sharply out startling them both a young woman with fluffy hair and in a pale blue dinnerdress was dancing to an unseen audience trents eyes flashed with anger and his cheeks burned the dance was a musichall one and the gestures were not refined before he could stop himself an oath had broken from his lips after that he dared not even glance at the girl by his side  im very sorry he muttered ill stop that right away  you mustnt disturb your friends on my account she said quietly she did not look up but trent felt keenly the alteration in her manner  theyre not my friends he exclaimed passionately ill clear them out neck and crop  she looked up for a moment surprised at his sudden vehemence there was no doubt about his being in earnest she continued her work without looking at him but her tone when she spoke was more friendly  this will take me a little longer than i thought to finish properly she said i wonder might i come down early tomorrow morning what time do you leave for the city  not until afternoon at any rate he said come tomorrow certainlywhenever you like you neednt be afraid of that rabble ill see you dont have to go near them  you must please not make any difference or alter your arrangements on my account she said i am quite used to meeting all sorts of people in my profession and i dont object to it in the least wont you go now i think that that was your dinnerbell  he hesitated obviously embarrassed but determined there is one question he said which i should very much like to ask you it will sound impertinent i dont mean it so i cant explain exactly why i want to know but i have a reason  ask it by all means she said ill promise that ill answer it if i can  you say that you area journalist have you taken it up for a pastime orto earn money  to earn money by all means she answered laughing i like the work but i shouldnt care for it half so much if i didnt make my living at it did you think that i was an amateur  i didnt know he answered slowly thank you you will come tomorrow  of course good evening  good evening  trent lifted his hat and turned away unwillingly towards the house full of a sense that something wonderful had happened to him he was absentminded but he stopped to pat a little dog whose attentions he usually ignored and he picked a creamywhite rose as he crossed the lawn and wondered why it should remind him of her    chapter x   trents appearance upon the lawn was greeted with a shout of enthusiasm the young lady in blue executed a pas seut and came across to him on her toes and the girl with the yellow hair although sulky gave him to understand by a sidelong glance that her favour was not permanently withdrawn they neither of the noticed the somewhat ominous air of civility with which he received their greetings or the contempt in his eyes as he looked them silently over  where are the lost tribe he inquired as the girls one on either side escorted him to the house  they received his witticism with a piercing shriek of laughter  mamma and her rag of a daughter are in the drawing room explained miss montressorthe young lady with fluffy hair who dressed in blue and could dance such a joke general they dont approve of us mamma says that she shall have to take her julie away if we remain we are not fit associates for her rich isnt it the old chaps screwing up his courage now with brandy and soda to tell you so  trent laughed heartily the situation began to appeal to him there was humour in it which he alone could appreciate  does he expect me to send you away he asked  thats a cert miss montressor affirmed the old womans been playing the respectable all day turning up the whites of her eyes at me because i did a high kick in the hall and groaning at flossie because she had a few brandies aint that so flossie  the young lady with yellow hair confirmed the statement with much dignity  i had a toothache she said and mrs da souza or whatever the old cat calls herself was most rude i reckon myself as respectable as she is any day dragging that yellowfaced daughter of hers about with her and throwing her at mens heads  miss montressor who had stopped to pick a flower rejoined them  i say general she remarked fairs fair and a promise is a promise we didnt come down here to be made fools of by a fat old jewess you wont send us away because of the old wretch  i promise said trent that when she goes you go and not before is that sufficient  right oh the young lady declared cheerfully now you go and prink up for dinner were ready flossie and i the little jew girls got a new dressblack covered with sequins it makes her look yellower than ever there goes the bell and were both as hungry as hunters look sharp  trent entered the house da souza met him in the hall sleek curly and resplendent in a black dinnersuit the years had dealt lightly with him or else the climate of england was kinder to his yellow skin than the moist heat of the gold coast he greeted trent with a heartiness which was partly tentative partly boisterous  back from the coining of the shekels my dear friend he exclaimed back from the spoiling of the egyptians eh how was money today  an eighth easier trent answered ascending the stairs  da souza fidgeted about with the banisters and finally followed him  there was just a word he remarked a little word i wanted with you  come and talk while i wash trent said shortly dinners on and im hungry  certainly certainly da souza murmured closing the door behind them as they entered the lavatory it is concerning these young ladies  what miss montressor and her friend trent remarked thrusting his head into the cold water phew  exactly two very charming young ladies my dear friend very charming indeed but a littledont you fancy just a little fast  hadnt noticed it trent answered drying himself what about it  da souza tugged at his little black imperial and moved uneasily about  weermen of the world my dear trent we need not be so particular ehbut the ladiesthe ladies are so observant  what ladies trent asked coolly  it is my wife who has been talking to me da souza continued you see julie is so youngour dear daughter she is but a child and as my wife says we cannot be too particular too careful eh you understand  you want them to go is that it  da souza spread out his handsan old trick only now the palms were white and the diamonds real  for myself he declared i find them charming it is my wife who says to me hiram those young persons they are not fit company for our dear innocent julie you shall speak to mr trent he will understand eh  trent had finished his toilet and stood the hairbrushes still in his hands looking at da souzas anxious face with a queer smile upon his lips  yes i understand da souza he said no doubt you are right you cannot be too careful you do well to be particular  da souza winced he was about to speak but trent interrupted him  well ill tell you this and you can let the missis know my fond father they leave tomorrow is that good enough  da souza caught at his hosts hand but trent snatched it away  my dearmy noble  here shut up and dont paw me trent interrupted mind not a word of this to any one but your wife the girls dont know theyre going themselves yet  they entered the diningroom where every one else was already assembled mrs da souza a jewess portly and typical resplendent in black satin and many gold chains and bangles occupied the seat of honour and by her side was a little brown girl with dark timid eyes and dusky complexion pitiably overdressed but with a certain elflike beauty which it was hard to believe that she could ever have inherited miss montressor and her friend sat on either side of their hostan arrangement which mrs da souza lamented but found herself powerless to prevent and her husband took the vacant place dinner was served and with the opening of the champagne which was not long delayed tongues were loosened  it was very hot in the city today mrs da souza remarked to her host dear julie was saying what a shame it seemed that you should be there and we should be enjoying your beautiful gardens she is so thoughtful so sympathetic dear girl  very kind of your daughter trent answered looking directly at her and rather inclined to pity her obvious shyness come drink up da souza drink up girls ive had a hard day and i want to forget for a bit that theres any such thing as work  miss montressor raised her glass and winked at her host  it dont take much drinking this general she remarked cheerily draining her glass different to the pop they give us down at the star eh flossie good old gooseberry i call that  da souza look after miss flossie trent said why dont you fill her glass thats right  hiram  da souza removed his hand from the back of his neighbours chair and endeavoured to look unconscious the girl titteredmrs da souza was severely dignified trent watched them all half in amusement half in disgust what a pandemonium it was time indeed for him to get rid of them all from where he sat he could see across the lawn into the little pine plantation it was still lightif she could look in at the open window what would she think his cheeks burned and he thrust the hand which was seeking his under the table savagely away and then an idea flashed in upon hima magnificent irresistible idea he drank off a glass of champagne and laughed loud and long at one of his neighbours silly sayings it was a glorious joke the more he thought of it the more he liked it he called for more champagne and all save the little brown girl greeted the magnum which presently appeared with cheers even mrs da souza unbent a little towards the young women against whom she had declared war faces were flushed and voices grew a little thick da souzas arm unchidden sought once more the back of his neighbours chair miss montressors eyes did their utmost to win a tender glance from their lavish host suddenly trent rose to his feet he held a glass high over his head his face was curiously unmoved but his lips were parted in an enigmatic smile  a toast my friends he cried fill up the lot of you come to our next meeting may fortune soon smile again and may i have another home before long as worthy a restingplace for you as this  bewilderment reigned no one offered to drink the toast it was miss montressor who asked the question which was on every ones lips  whats up she exclaimed whats the matter with our next meeting here tomorrow night and whats all that rot about your next home and fortune  trent looked at them all in wellsimulated amazement  lord he exclaimed you dont knownone of you i thought da souza would have told you the news  what news da souza cried his beady eyes protuberant and his glass arrested halfway to his mouth  what are you talking about my friend  trent set down his glass  my friends he said unsteadily let me explain to you as shortly as i can what an uncertain position is that of a great financier  da souza leaned across the table his face was livid and the corners of his eyes were bloodshot  i thought there was something up he muttered you would not have me come into the city this morning dn it you dont mean that you  im bust trent said roughly is that plain enough ive been bulling on west australians and they boomed and this afternoon the government decided not to back us at bekwando and the mines are to be shut down tell you all about it if you like  no one wanted to hear all about it they shrunk from him as though he were a robber only the little brown girl was sorry and she looked at him with dark soft eyes  ive given a bill of sale here trent continued theyll be round tomorrow better pack tonight these valuers are such robbers come another bottle itll all have to be sold well make a night of it  mrs da souza rose and swept from the roomda souza had fallen forward with his head upon his hands he was only half sober but the shock was working like madness in his brain the two girls after whispering together for a moment rose and followed mrs da souza trent stole from his place and out into the garden with footsteps which were steady enough now he crossed the velvety lawns and plunged into the shrubbery then he began to laugh softly as he walked they were all duped they had accepted his story without the slightest question he leaned over the gate which led into the little plantation and he was suddenly grave and silent a nightwind was blowing fragrant and cool the dark boughs of the trees waved to and fro against the background of deep blue sky the lime leaves rustled softly the perfume of roses came floating across from the flowergardens trent stood quite still listening and thinking  god what a beast i am he muttered it was there she sat im not fit to breathe the same air  he looked back towards the house the figures of the two girls with da souza standing now between them were silhouetted against the window his face grew dark and fierce  faugh he exclaimed what a kennel i have made of my house what a lowdown thing i have begun to make of life yeti was a beggarand i am a millionaire is it harder to change oneself tomorrowhe looked hard at the place where she had sattomorrow i will ask her  on his way back to the house a little cloaked figure stepped out from behind a shrub he looked at her in amazement it was the little brown girl and her eyes were wet with tears  listen she said quickly i have been waiting to speak to you i want to say goodbye and to thank you i am very very sorry and i hope that some day very soon you will make some more money and be happy again  her lips were quivering a single glance into her face assured him of her honesty he took the hand which she held out and pressed her fingers  little julie he said you are a brick dont you bother about me it isnt quite so bad as i made outonly dont tell your mother that  im very glad she murmured i think that it is hateful of them all to rush away and i made up my mind to say goodbye however angry it made them let me go now please i want to get back before mamma misses me  he passed his arm around her tiny waist she looked at him with frightened eyes  please let me go she murmured  he kissed her lips and a moment afterwards vaguely repented it she buried her face in her hands and ran away sobbing trent lit a cigar and sat down upon a garden seat  its a queer thing he said reflectingly the girls been thrown repeatedly at my head for a week and i might have kissed her at any moment before her father and mother if i had liked and theyd have thanked me now ive done it im sorry she looked prettier than ive ever seen her tooand shes the only decent one of the lot lord what a hubbub therell be in the morning  the stars came out and the moon rose and still scarlett trent lingered in the scented darkness he was a man of limited imagination and little given to superstitions yet that night there came to him a presentiment he felt that he was on the threshold of great events something new in life was looming up before him he had cut himself adrift from the oldit was a very wonderful and a very beautiful figure which was beckoning him to follow in other paths the triumph of the earlier part of the day seemed to lie far back in a misty and unimportant past there was a new world and a greater if fortune willed that he should enter it    chapter xi   trent was awakened next morning by the sound of carriage wheels in the drive below he rang his bell at once after a few moments delay it was answered by one of his two menservants  whose carriage is that in the drive he asked it is a fly for mr da souza sir  what has he gone trent exclaimed  yes sir he and mrs da souza and the young lady  and miss montressor and her friend  they shared the fly sir the luggage all went down in one of the carts  trent laughed outright half scornfully half in amusement  listen mason he said as the sound of wheels died away if any of those people come back again they are not to be admitteddo you hear if they bring their luggage you are not to take it in if they come themselves you are not to allow them to enter the house you understand that  yes sir  very good now prepare my bath at once and tell the cook breakfast in half an hour let her know that i am hungry breakfast for one mind those fools who have just left will get a morning paper at the station and they may come back be on the lookout for them and let the other servants know better have the lodge gate locked  very good sir  the man who had been lamenting the loss of an easy situation and possibly even a months wages hastened to spread more reassuring news in the lower regions it was a practical joke of the governorsvery likely a ruse to get rid of guests who had certainly been behaving as though the lodge was their permanent home there was a chorus of thanksgiving groves the butler who read the money articles in the standard every morning with solemn interest and who was suspected of investments announced that from what he could make out the governor must have landed a tidy little lump yesterday whereupon the cook set to work to prepare a breakfast worthy of the occasion  trent had awakened with a keen sense of anticipated pleasure a new and delightful interest had entered into his life it is true that at times it needed all his strength of mind to keep his thoughts from wandering back into that unprofitable and most distasteful pastin the middle of the night even he had woke up suddenly with an old mans cry in his earsor was it the whispering of the nightwind in the tall elms but he was not of an imaginative nature he felt himself strong enough to set his heel wholly upon all those memories if he had not erred on the side of generosity he had at least played the game fairly monty if he had lived could only have been a disappointment and a humiliation the picture was hersof that he had no doubt even then he was not sure that monty was her father in any case she would never know he recognised no obligation on his part to broach the subject the man had done his best to cut himself altogether adrift from his former life his reasons doubtless had been sufficient it was not necessary to pry into themit might even be unkindness the picture which no man save himself had ever seen was the only possible link between the past and the presentbetween scarlett trent and his drunken old partner starved and feverstricken making their desperate effort for wealth in unknown africa and the millionaire of today the picture remained his dearest possessionbut save his own no other eyes had ever beheld it  he dressed with more care than usual and much less satisfaction he was a man who rather prided himself upon neglecting his appearance and so far as the cut and pattern of his clothes went he usually suggested the artisan out for a holiday today for the first time he regarded his toilet with critical and disparaging eyes he found the pattern of his tweed suit too large and the colour too pronounced his collars were oldfashioned and his ties hideous it was altogether a new experience with him this selfdissatisfaction and sensitiveness to criticism which at any other time he would have regarded with a sort of insolent indifference he remembered his walk westward yesterday with a shudder as though indeed it had been a sort of nightmare and wondered whether she too had regarded him with the eyes of those loungers on the pavementwhether she too was one of those who looked for a man to conform to the one arbitrary and universal type finally he tied his necktie with a curse and went down to breakfast with little of his goodhumour left  the fresh air sweeping in through the long open windows the glancing sunlight and the sense of freedom for which the absence of his guests was certainly responsible soon restored his spirits blest with an excellent morning appetitethe delightful heritage of a clean lifehe enjoyed his breakfast and thoroughly appreciated his cooks efforts if he needed a sauce fate bestowed one upon him for he was scarcely midway through his meal before a loud ringing at the lodge gates proved the accuracy of his conjectures mr da souza had purchased a morning paper at the junction and their hosts perfidy had become apparent obviously they had decided to treat the whole matter as a practical joke and to brave it out for outside the gates in an open fly were the whole party they had returned only to find that according to trents orders the gates were closed upon them  trent moved his seat to where he could have a better view and continued his breakfast the party in the cab looked hot and tumbled and cross da souza was on his feet arguing with the lodgekeeperthe women seemed to be listening anxiously trent turned to the servant who was waiting upon him  send word down he directed that i will see mr da souza alone no one else is to be allowed to enter pass me the toast before you go  da souza entered presently apologetic and abject prepared at the same time to extenuate and deny trent continued his breakfast coolly  my dear friend da souza exclaimed depositing his silk hat upon the table it is a very excellent joke of yours you see we have entered into the spirit of itoh yes we have done so indeed we have taken a little drive before breakfast but we have returned you knew of course that we would not dream of leaving you in such a manner do you not think my dear friend that the joke was carried now far enough the ladies are hungry will you send word to the lodgekeeper that he may open the gate  trent helped himself to coffee and leaned back in his chair stirring it thoughtfully  you are right da souza he said it is an excellent joke the cream of it is too that i am in earnest neither you nor any of those ladies whom i see out there will sit at my table again  you are not in earnest you do not mean it  i can assure you trent replied grinning that i do  but do you mean da souza spluttered that we are to go like thisto be turned outthe laughingstock of your servants after we have come back too all the wayoh it is nonsense its not to be endured  you can go to the devil trent answered coolly there is not one of you whom i care a fig to see again you thought that i was ruined and you scudded like rats from a sinking ship well i found you out and a jolly good thing too all i have to say is now be off and the quicker the better  then da souza cringed no longer and there shot from his black eyes the venomous twinkle of the serpent whose fangs are out he leaned over the table and dropped his voice  i speak he said for my wife my daughter and myself and i assure you that we decline to go    chapter xii   trent rose up with flashing eyes da souza shrank back from his outstretched hands the two men stood facing one another da souza was afraid but the ugly look of determination remained upon his white face trent felt dimly that there was something which must be explained between them there had been hints of this sort before from da souza it was time the whole thing was cleared up the lion was ready to throw aside the jackal  i give you thirty seconds he said to clear out if you havent come to your senses then youll be sorry for it  thirty seconds is not long enough da souza answered for me to tell you why i decline to go better listen to me quietly my friend it will be best for you afterwards you will admit it  go ahead trent said im anxious to hear what youve got to say only look here im a bit shorttempered this morning and i shouldnt advise you to play with your words  this is no play at all da souza remarked with a sneer i ask you to remember my friend our first meeting  trent nodded  never likely to forget it he answered  i came down from elmina to deal with you da souza continued i had made money trading in ashanti for palmoil and mahogany i had money to investand you needed it you had land a concession to work goldmines and build a road to the coast it was speculative but we did business i came with you to england i found more money  you made your fortune trent said drily i had to have the money and you ground a share out of me which is worth a quarter of a million to you  perhaps it is da souza answered perhaps it is not perhaps it is worth nothing at all perhaps instead of being a millionaire you yourself are a swindler and an adventurer  if you dont speak out in half a moment trent said in a low tone ill twist the tongue out of your head  i am speaking out da souza answered it is an ugly thing i have to say but you must control yourself  the little black eyes were like the eyes of a snake he was showing his teeth he forgot to be afraid  you had a partner he said the concession was made out to him together with yourself  he died trent answered shortly i took over the lot by arrangement  a very nice arrangement da souza drawled with a devilish smile he is old and weak you were with him up at bekwando where there are no white menno one to watch you you gave him brandy to drinkyou watch the fever come and you write on the concession if one should die all goes to the survivor and you gave him brandy in the bush where the fever is andbehold you return alone when people know this they will say oh yes it is the way millionaires are made  he stopped out of breath for the veins were standing out upon his forehead and he remembered what the english doctor at cape coast castle had told him so he was silent for a moment wiping the perspiration away and struggling against the fear which was turning the blood to ice in his veins for trents face was not pleasant to look upon  anything else  da souza pulled himself together yes he said what i have said is as nothing it is scandalous and it would make talk but it is nothing there is something else  well  you had a partner whom you deserted  it is a lie i carried him on my back for twenty hours with a pack of yelling niggers behind we were lost and i myself was nigh upon a dead man who would have cumbered himself with a corpse curse you and your vile hints you mongrel you hangeron you scurrilous beast out and spread your stories before my fingers get on your throat out  da souza slunk away before the fire in trents eyes but he had no idea of going he stood in safety near the door and as he leaned forward speaking now in a hoarse whisper he reminded trent momentarily of one of those hideous fetish gods in the sacred grove at bekwando  your partner was no corpse when you left him he hissed out you were a fool and a bungler not to make sure of it the natives from bekwando found him and carried him bound to the king and your english explorer captain francis rescued him hes alive now  trent stood for a moment like a man turned to stone alive monty alive the impossibility of the thing came like a flash of relief to him the man was surely on the threshold of death when he had left him and the age of miracles was past  youre talking like a fool da souza do you mean to take me in with an old womans story like that  theres no old womans story about what ive told you da souza snarled the mans alive and i can prove it a dozen times over you were a fool and a bungler  trent thought of the night when he had crept back into the bush and had found no trace of monty and gradually there rose up before him a lurid possibility da souzas story was true the very thought of it worked like madness in his brains when he spoke he strove hard to steady his voice and even to himself it sounded like the voice of one speaking a long way off  supposing that this were true he said what is he doing all this time why does he not come and claim his share  da souza hesitated he would have liked to have invented another reason but it was not safe the truth was best  he is halfwitted and has lost his memory he is working now at one of the basle missionplaces near attra  and why have you not told me this before  da souza shrugged his shoulders it was not necessary he said our interests were the same it was better for you not to know  he remembers nothing then  da souza hesitated oom sam he said my halfbrother keeps an eye on him sometimes he gets restless he talks but what matter he has no money soon he must die he is getting an old man  i shall send for him trent said slowly he shall have his share  it was the one fear which had kept da souza silent the muscles of his face twitched and his fingernails were buried in the flesh of his fat white hands side by side he had worked with trent for years without being able to form any certain estimate of the man or his character many a time he had asked himself what trent would do if he knewonly the fear of his complete ignorance of the man had kept him silent all these years now the crisis had come he had spoken it might mean ruin  send for him da souza said why his memory has gonesave for occasional fits of passion in which he raves at you what would people saythat you tried to kill him with brandy that the clause in the concession was a direct incentive for you to get rid of him and you left him in the bush only a few miles from buckomari to be seized by the natives besides how can you pay him half i know pretty well how you stand on paper beyond doubt you are a millionaire but what if all claims were suddenly presented against you to be paid in sovereigns i tell you this my friend mr scarlett trent and i am a man of experience and i know today in the city it is true that you could raise a million pounds in cash but let me whisper a word one little word and you would be hard pressed to raise a thousand it is true there is the syndicate that great scheme of yours yesterday from which you were so careful to exclude meyou are to get great monies from them in cash bah dont you see that montys existence breaks up that syndicatesmashes it into tiny atoms for you have sold what was not yours to sell and they do not pay for that eh they call it fraud  he paused out of breath and trent remained silent he knew very well that he was face to face with a great crisis of all things this was the most fatal which could have happened to him monty alive he remembered the old mans passionate cry for life for pleasure to taste once more for however short a time the joys of wealth monty alive penniless halfwitted the servant of a few illpaid missionaries toiling all day for a living perhaps fishing with the natives or digging a slave still without hope or understanding with the end of his days well in view surely it were better to risk all things to have him back at any cost then a thought more terrible yet than any rose up before him like a spectre there was a sudden catch at his heartstrings he was cold with fear what would she think of the man who deserted his partner an old man while life was yet in him and safety close at hand was it possible that he could ever escape the everlasting stigma of cowardiceay and before him in great red letters he saw written in the air that fatal clause in the agreement to which she and all others would point with bitter scorn indubitable overwhelming evidence against him he gasped for breath and walked restlessly up and down the room other thoughts came crowding in upon him he was conscious of a new element in himself the last few years had left their mark upon him with the handling of great sums of money and the acquisition of wealth had grown something of the financiers fever he had become a power solidly and steadfastly he had hewn his way into a little circle whose fascination had begun to tell in his blood was he to fall without a struggle from amongst the high places to be stripped of his wealth shunned as a man who was morally if not in fact a murderer to be looked upon with neverending scorn by the woman whose picture for years had been a religion to him and whose appearance only a few hours ago had been the most inspiring thing which had entered into his life he looked across the lawn into the pine grove with steadfast eyes and knitted brows and da souza watched him ghastly and nervous at least he must have time to decide  if you send for him da souza said slowly you will be absolutely ruined it will be a triumph for those whom you have made jealous who have measured their wits with yours and gone under oh but the newspapers will enjoy itthat is very certain our latest millionaire his rise and fall cannot you see it in the placards and for what to give wealth to an old man long past the enjoyment of itay imbecile already you will not be a madman trent  trent winced perceptibly da souza saw it and rejoiced there was another awkward silence trent lit a cigar and puffed furiously at it  i will think it over at least he said in a low tone bring back your wife and daughter and leave me alone for a while  i knew da souza murmured that my friend would be reasonable  and the young ladies  send them to  i will send them back to where they came from da souza interrupted blandly    chapter xiii   it is probable that mrs da souza excellent wife and mother though she had proved herself to be had never admired her husband more than when followed by the malevolent glances of miss montressor and her friend she with her daughter and da souza reentered the gates of the lodge the young ladies had announced their intention of sitting in the fly until they were allowed speech with their late host to which he had replied that they were welcome to sit there until doomsday so long as they remained outside his gates mr da souza lingered for a moment behind and laid his finger upon his nose  it aint no use my dears he whispered confidentially hes fairly got the hump between you and me hed give a bit not to have us but me and him being old friendsyou see we know a bit about one another  oh thats it is it miss montressor remarked with a toss of her head well you and your wife and your little chit of a daughter are welcome to him so far as we are concerned arent they flossie  well i should say so agreed the young lady who rather affected americanisms  da souza stroked his little imperial and winked solemnly  you are young ladies of spirit he declared now  hiram  i am coming my dear he called over his shoulder one word more my charming young friends no 7 rackets court city is my address look in sometime when youre that way and well have a bit of lunch together and just at present take my advice get back to london and write him from there he is not in a good humour at present  we are much obliged mr da souza the young lady answered loftily as we have engagements in london this afternoon we may as well go noweh flossie  right along answered the young lady im with you but as to writing mr trent you can tell him from me mr da souza that we want to have nothing more to do with him a fellow that can treat ladies as he has treated us is no gentleman you can tell him that hes an ignorant common fellow and for my part i despise him  same here echoed miss montressor heartily we aint used to associate with such as him  hiram  mr da souza raised his hat and bowed the ladies were tolerably gracious and the fly drove off whereupon mr da souza followed his wife and daughter along the drive and caught them up upon the doorstep with mingled feelings of apprehension and elation he ushered them into the morningroom where trent was standing looking out of the window with his hands behind him at their entrance he did not at once turn round mr da souza coughed apologetically  here we are my friend he remarked the ladies are anxious to wish you good morning  trent faced them with a sudden gesture of impatience he seemed on the point of an angry exclamation when his eyes met julie da souzas he held his breath for a moment and was silent her face was scarlet with shame and her lips were trembling for her sake trent restrained himself  glad to see you back again julie he said ignoring her mothers outstretched hand and beaming smile of welcome going to be a hot day i think you must get out in the hayfield order what breakfast you please da souza he continued on his way to the door you must be hungryafter such an early start  mrs da souza sat down heavily and rang the bell  he was a little cool she remarked but that was to be expected did you observe the notice he took of julie dear child  da souza rubbed his hands and nodded meaningly the girl who between the two was miserable enough sat down with a little sob her mother looked at her in amazement  my julie she exclaimed my dear child you see hiram she is faint she is overcome  the child she was very little more broke out at last in speech passionately yet with a miserable foreknowledge of the ineffectiveness of anything she might say  it is horrible she cried it is maddening why do we do it are we paupers or adventurers oh let me go away i am ashamed to stay in this house  her father his thumbs in the armholes of his waistcoat and his legs far apart looked at her in blank and speechless amazement her mother with more consideration but equal lack of sympathy patted her gently on the back of her hand  silly julie she murmured what is there that is horrible little one  the dark eyes blazed with scorn the delicately curved lips shook  why the way we thrust ourselves upon this man is horrible she cried can you not see that we are not welcome that he wishes us gone  da souza smiled in a superior manner the smile of a man who if only he would could explain all things he patted his daughter on the head with a touch which was meant to be playful  my little one he said you are mistaken leave these matters to those who are older and wiser than you it is but just now that my good friend said to me da souza he say i will not have you take your little daughter away oh we shall see we shall see  julies tears crept through the fingers closely pressed over her eyes  i do not believe it she sobbed he has scarcely looked at me all the time and i do not want him to he despises us alland i dont blame him it is horrid  mrs da souza with a smile which was meant to be arch had something to say but the arrival of breakfast broke up for a while the conversation her husband whom nature had blessed with a hearty appetite at all times was this morning after his triumph almost disposed to be boisterous he praised the cooking chaffed the servants to their infinite disgust and continually urged his wife and daughter to keep pace with him in his onslaught upon the various dishes which were placed before him before the meal was over julie had escaped from the table crying softly mr da souzas face darkened as he looked up at the sound of her movement only to see her skirt vanishing through the door  shall you have trouble with her my dear he asked his wife anxiously  that estimable lady shook her head with a placid smile julie is so sensitive she muttered but she is not disobedient when the time comes i can make her mind  but the time has come da souza exclaimed it is here now and julie is sulky she will have red eyes and she is not gay she will not attract him you must speak with her my dear  i will go nowthis instant she answered rising but hiram there is one thing i would much like to know  ugh you women you are always like that there is so much that you want to know  most women hiramnot me do i ever seek to know your secrets but this timeyes it would be wiser to tell me a little  well  this mr trent he asked us here but it is plain that our company is not pleasant to him he does his best to get rid of ushe succeedshe plans that we shall not return you see him alone and all that is altered his little scheme has been in vain we remain he does not look at our julie he speaks of marriage with contempt yet you say he will marry herhe a millionaire what does it mean hiram  the man he is in my power da souza says in a ponderous and stealthy whisper i know something  she rose and imprinted a solemn kiss upon his forehead there was something sacramental about the deliberate caress  hiram she said you are a wonderful man    chapter xiv   scarlett trent spent the first part of the morning to which he had been looking forward so eagerly alone in his study with locked door to keep out all intruders he had come face to face with the first serious check in his career and it had been dealt him too by the one man whom of all his associates he disliked and despised in the halfopen drawer by his side was the barrel of a loaded revolver he drew it out laid it on the table before him and regarded it with moody fascinated eyes if only it could be safely done if only for one moment he could find himself face to face with da souza in bekwando village where human life was cheap and the slaying of a man an incident scarcely worth noting in the days events the thing was easy enough therehere it was too risky he thrust the weapon back into the drawer with a sigh of regret just as da souza himself appeared upon the scene  you sent for me trent the latter remarked timidly i am quite ready to answer any more questions  answer this one then was the gruff reply in buckomari village before we left for england i was robbed of a letter i dont think i need ask you who was the thief  really trenti  dont irritate me im in an ill humour for anything of that sort you stole it i can see why now have you got it still  the jew shrugged his shoulders  yes  hand it over  da souza drew a large folding case from his pocket and after searching through it for several moments produced an envelope the handwriting was shaky and irregular and so faint that even in the strong sweet light of the morning sunshine trent had difficulty in reading it he tore it open and drew out a halfsheet of coarse paper it was a message from the man who for long he had counted dead   bekwando  my dear trenti have been drinking as usual some men see snakes but i have seen death leering at me from the dark corners of this vile hut and death is an evil thing to look at when ones life has been evil as mine has been never mind i have sown and i must reap but my friend a last word with you i have a notion and more than a notion that i shall never pass back alive through these pestilential swamps if you should arrive as you doubtless will here is a charge which i lay upon you that agreement of ours is scarcely a fair one is it trent when i signed it i wasnt quite myself never mind ill trust to you to do whats fair if the thing turns out a great success put some sort of a share at any rate to my credit and let my daughter have it you will find her address from messrs harris and culsom solicitors lincolns inn fields you need only ask them for montys daughter and show them this letter they will understand i believe you to be a just man scarlett trent although i know you to be a hard one do then as i ask  monty   da souza had left the room quietly trent read the letter through twice and locked it up in his desk then he rose and lit a pipe knocking out the ashes carefully and filling the bowl with dark but fragrant tobacco presently he rang the bell  tell mr da souza i wish to see him here at once he told the servant and though the message was a trifle peremptory from a host to his guest da souza promptly appeared suave and cheerful  shut the door trent said shortly  da souza obeyed with unabashed amiability trent watched him with something like disgust da souza returning caught the look and felt compelled to protest  my dear trent he said i do not like the way you address me or your manners towards me you speak as though i were a servant i do not like it all and it is not fair i am your guest am i not  you are my guest by your own invitation trent answered roughly and if you dont like my manners you can turn out i may have to endure you in the house till i have made up my mind how to get rid of you but i want as little of your company as possible do you hear  da souza did hear it and the worm turned he sat down in the most comfortable easychair and addressed trent directly  my friend he said you are out of temper and that is a bad thing now listen to me you are in my power i have only to go into the city tomorrow and breathe here and there a word about a certain old gentleman who shall be nameless and you would be a ruined man in something less than an hour added to this my friend you would most certainly be arrested for conspiracy and fraud that syndicate of yours was a very smart stroke of business no doubt and it was clever of you to keep me in ignorance of it but as things have turned out now that will be your condemnation they will say why did you keep me in ignorance of this move and the answerwhy it is very clear i knew you were selling what was not yours to sell  i kept you away trent said scornfully because i was dealing with men who would not have touched the thing if they had known that you were in it  who will believe it da souza asked with a sneer they will say that it is but one more of the fairy tales of this wonderful mr scarlett trent  the breath came through trents lips with a little hiss and his eyes were flashing with a dull fire but da souza held his ground he had nerved himself up to this and he meant going through with it  you think i dare not breathe a word for my own sake he continued there is reason in that but i have other monies i am rich enough without my sixth share of that bekwando land and mining company which you and the syndicate are going to bring out but then i am not a fool i have no wish to throw away money now i propose to you therefore a friendly settlement my daughter julie is very charming you admire her i am sure you shall marry her and then we will all be one family our interests will be the same and you may be sure that i shall look after them come is that not a friendly offer  for several minutes trent smoked furiously but he did not speak at the end of that time he took the revolver once more from the drawer of his writingtable and fingered it  da souza he said if i had you just for five minutes at bekwando we would talk together of blackmail you and i we would talk of marrying your daughter we would talk then to some purposeyou hound get out of the room as fast as your legs will carry you this revolver is loaded and im not quite master of myself  da souza made off with amazing celerity trent drew a short quick breath there was a great deal of the wild beast left in him still at that moment the desire to kill was hot in his blood his eyes glared as he walked up and down the room the years of civilisation seemed to have become as nothing the veneer of the city speculator had fallen away he was once more as he had been in those wilder days when men made their own laws and a mans hold upon life was a slighter thing than his thirst for gold as such he found the atmosphere of the little room choking him he drew open the french windows of his little study and strode out into the perfumed and sunlit morning as such he found himself face to face unexpectedly and without warning with the girl whom he had discovered sketching in the shrubbery the day before    chapter xv   probably nothing else in the world could so soon have transformed scarlett trent from the gold coast buccaneer to the lawabiding tenant of a surrey villa before her full inquiring eyes and calm salute he found himself at once abashed and confused he raised his hand to his head only to find that he had come out without a hat and he certainly appeared as he stood there to his worst possible advantage  good morning miss he stammered im afraid i startled you  she winced a little at his address but otherwise her manner was not ungracious  you did a little she admitted do you usually stride out of your windows like that bareheaded and muttering to yourself  i was in a beastly temper he admitted if i had known who was outsideit would have been different  she looked into his face with some interest what an odd thing she remarked why i should have thought that today you would have been amiability itself i read at breakfasttime that you had accomplished something more than ordinarily wonderful in the city and had madei forget how many hundreds of thousands of pounds when i showed the sketch of your house to my chief and told him that you were going to let me interview you today i really thought that he would have raised my salary at once  its more luck than anything he said ive stood next door to ruin twice i may again although im a millionaire today  she looked at him curiouslyat his ugly tweed suit his yellow boots and up into the strong forceful face with eyes set in deep hollows under his protruding brows at the heavy jaws giving a certain coarseness to his expression which his mouth and forehead wellshaped though they were could not altogether dispel and at he same time he looked at her slim tall and elegant daintily clothed from her shapely shoes to her sailor hat her brown hair parted in the middle escaping a little from its confinement to ripple about her forehead and show more clearly the delicacy of her complexion trent was an ignorant man on many subjects on others his taste seemed almost intuitively correct he knew that this girl belonged to a class from which his descent and education had left him far apart a class of which he knew nothing and with whom he could claim no kinship she too was realising ither interest in him was however none the less deep he was a type of those powers which today hold the world in their hands make kingdoms tremble and change the fate of nations perhaps he was all the more interesting to her because by all the ordinary standards of criticism he would fail to be ranked in the jargon of her class as a gentleman he represented something in flesh and blood which had never seemed more than half real to herpower without education she liked to consider herselfbeing a writer with ambitions who took herself seriouslya student of human nature here was a specimen worth impaling an original being a creature of a new type such as never had come within the region of her experience it was worth while ignoring small idiosyncrasies which might offend in order to annex him besides from a journalistic point of view the man was more than interestinghe was a veritable treasure  you are going to talk to me about africa are you not she reminded him couldnt we sit in the shade somewhere i got quite hot walking from the station  he led the way across the lawn and they sat under a cedartree he was awkward and ill at ease but she had tact enough for both  i cant understand he began how people are interested in the stuff which gets into papers nowadays if you want horrors though i can supply you for one man who succeeds over there there are a dozen who find it a short cut down into hell i can tell you if you like of my days of starvation  go on  like many men who talk but seldom he had the gift when he chose to speak of reproducing his experiences in vivid though unpolished language he told her of the days when he had worked on the banks of the congo with the coolies a slave in everything but name when the sun had burned the brains of men to madness and the palm wine had turned them into howling devils he told her of the natives of bekwando of the days they had spent amongst them in that squalid hut when their fate hung in the balance day by day and every shout that went up from the warriors gathered round the house of the king was a cry of death he spoke of their ultimate success of the granting of the concession which had laid the foundation of his fortunes and then of that terrible journey back through the bush followed by the natives who had already repented of their action and who dogged their footsteps hour after hour waiting for them only to sleep or rest to seize upon them and haul them back to bekwando prisoners for the sacrifice  it was only our revolvers which kept them away he went on i shot eight or nine of them at different times when they came too close and to hear them wailing over the bodies was one of the most hideous things you can imagine why for months and months afterwards i couldnt sleep id wake up in the night and fancy that i heard that cursed yelling outside my windoway even on the steamer at nighttime if i was on deck before moonlight id seem to hear it rising up out of the water ugh  she shuddered  but you both escaped she said  there was a moments silence the shade of the cedartree was deep and cool but it brought little relief to trent the perspiration stood out on his forehead in great beads he breathed for a moment in little gasps as though stifled  no he answered my partner died within a mile or two of the coast he was very ill when we started and i pretty well had to carry him the whole of the last day i did my best for him i did indeed but it was no good i had to leave him there was no use sacrificing oneself for a dead man  she inclined her head sympathetically  was he an englishman she asked  he faced the question just as he had faced death years before leering at him a few feet from the muzzle of his revolver  he was an englishman the only name we had ever heard him called by was monty some said he was a brokendown gentleman i believe he was  she was unconscious of his passionate breathless scrutiny unconscious utterly of the great wave of relief which swept into his face as he realised that his words were without any special meaning to her  it was very sad indeed she said if he had lived he would have shared with you i suppose in the concession  trent nodded  yes we were equal partners we had an arrangement by which if one died the survivor took the lot i didnt want it though id rather he had pulled through i would indeed he repeated with nervous force  i am quite sure of that she answered and now tell me something about your career in the city after you came to england do you know i have scarcely ever been in what you financiers call the city in a way it must be interesting  you wouldnt find it so he said it is not a place for such as you it is a life of lies and gambling and deceit there are times when i have hated it i hate it now  she was unaffectedly surprised what a speech for a millionaire of yesterday  i thought she said that for those who took part in it it possessed a fascination stronger than anything else in the world  he shook his head  it is an ugly fascination he said you are in the swim and you must hold your own you gamble with other men and when you win you chuckle all the time youre whittling your conscience awayif ever you had any youre never quite dishonest and youre never quite honest you come out on top and afterwards you hate yourself its a dirty little life  well she remarked after a moments pause you have surprised me very much at any rate you are rich enough now to have no more to do with it  he kicked a fir cone savagely away  if i could he said i would shut up my office tomorrow sell out and live upon a farm but ive got to keep what ive made the more you succeed the more involved you become its a sort of slavery  have you no friends she asked  i have never he answered had a friend in my life  you have guests at any rate  i sent em away last night  what the young lady in blue she asked demurely  yes and the other one too packed them clean off and theyre not coming back either  i am very pleased to hear it she remarked  theres a man and his wife and daughter here i cant get rid of quite so easily he went on gloomily but theyve got to go  they would be less objectionable to the people round here who might like to come and see you she remarked than two unattached young ladies  may be he answered yet id give a lot to be rid of them  he had risen to his feet and was standing with his back to the cedartree looking away with fixed eyes to where the sunlight fell upon a distant hillside gorgeous with patches and streaks of yellow gorse and purple heather presently she noticed his abstraction and looked also through the gap in the trees  you have a beautiful view here she said you are fond of the country are you not  very he answered  it is not every one she remarked who is able to appreciate it especially when their lives have been spent as yours must have been  he looked at her curiously i wonder he said if you have any idea how my life has been spent  you have given me she said a very fair idea about some part of it at any rate  he drew a long breath and looked down at her  i have given you no idea at all he said firmly i have told you a few incidents that is all you have talked to me as though i were an equal listen you are probably the first lady with whom i have ever spoken i do not want to deceive you i never had a scrap of education my father was a carpenter who drank himself to death and my mother was a factory girl i was in the workhouse when i was a boy i have never been to school i dont know how to talk properly but i should be worse even than i am if i had not had to mix up with a lot of men in the city who had been properly educated i am utterly and miserably ignorant ive got low tastes and lots of em i was drunk a few nights agoive done most of the things men who are beasts do there now dont you want to run away  she shook her head and smiled up at him she was immensely interested  if that is the worst she said gently i am not at all frightened you know that it is my profession to write about men and women i belong to a world of wornout types and to meet any one different is quite a luxury  the worst a sudden fear sent an icy coldness shivering through his veins his heart seemed to stop beating his cheeks were blanched the worst of him he had not told her that he was a robber that the foundation of his fortunes was a lie that there lived a man who might bring all this great triumph of his shattered and crumbling about his ears a passionate fear lest she might ever knew of these things was born in his heart at that moment never altogether to leave him  the sound of a footstep close at hand made them both turn their heads along the winding path came da souza with an ugly smirk upon his white face smoking a cigar whose odour seemed to poison the air trent turned upon him with a look of thunder  what do you want here da souza he asked fiercely  da souza held up the palms of his hands  i was strolling about he said and i saw you through the trees i did not know that you were so pleasantly engaged he added with a wave of his hat to the girl or i would not have intruded  trent kicked open the little iron gate which led into the garden beyond  well get out and dont come here again he said shortly theres plenty of room for you to wander about and poison the air with those abominable cigars of yours without coming here  da souza replaced his hat upon his head the cigars my friend are excellent we cannot all smoke the tobacco of a millionaire can we miss  the girl who was making some notes in her book continued her work without the slightest appearance of having heard him  da souza snorted but at that moment he felt a grip like iron upon his shoulder and deemed retreat expedient  if you dont go without another word came a hot whisper in his ear ill throw you into the horsepond  he went swiftly ungracious scowling trent returned to the girl she looked up at him and closed her book  you must change your friends she said gravely what a horrible man  he is a beast trent answered and go he shall i would to heaven that i had never seen him  she rose slipped her notebook into her pocket and drew on her gloves  i have taken up quite enough of your time she said i am so much obliged to you mr trent for all you have told me it has been most interesting  she held out her hand and the touch of it sent his heart beating with a most unusual emotion he was aghast at the idea of her imminent departure he realised that when she passed out of his gate she passed into a world where she would be hopelessly lost to him so he took his courage into his hands and was very bold indeed  you have not told me your name he reminded her  she laughed lightly  how very unprofessional of me i ought to have given you a card for all you know i may be an impostor indulging an unpardonable curiosity my name is wendermotternestine wendermott  he repeated it after her  thank you he said i am beginning to think of some more things which i might have told you  why i should have to write a novel then to get them all in she said i am sure you have given me all the material i need here  i am going he said abruptly to ask you something very strange and very presumptuous  she looked at him in surprise scarcely understanding what he could mean  may i come and see you some time  the earnestness of his gaze and the intense anxiety of his tone almost disconcerted her he was obviously very much in earnest and she had found him far from uninteresting  by all means she answered pleasantly if you care to i have a little flat in culpole streetno 81 you must come and have tea with me one afternoon  thank you he said simply with a sigh of immense relief  he walked with her to the gate and they talked about rhododendrons  then he watched her till she became a speck in the dusty roadshe had refused a carriage and he had had tact enough not to press any hospitality upon her  his little girl he murmured montys little girl    chapter xvi   ernestine wendermott travelled back to london in much discomfort being the eleventh occupant of a thirdclass carriage in a particularly unpunctual and dilatory train arrived at waterloo she shook out her skirts with a little gesture of relief and started off to walk to the strand halfway across the bridge she came face to face with a tall goodlooking young man who was hurrying in the opposite direction he stopped short as he recognised her dropped his eyeglass and uttered a little exclamation of pleasure  ernestine by all thats delightful i am in luck today  she smiled slightly and gave him her hand but it was evident that this meeting was not wholly agreeable to her  i dont quite see where the luck comes in she answered i have no time to waste talking to you now i am in a hurry  you will allow me he said hopefully to walk a little way with you  i am not able to prevent itif you think it worth while she answered  he looked downhe was by her side nowin goodhumoured protest  come ernestine he said you mustnt bear malice against me perhaps i was a little hasty when i spoke so strongly about your work i dont like your doing it and never shall like it but ive said all i want to you wont let it divide us altogether will you  for the present she answered it occupies the whole of my time and the whole of my thoughts  to the utter exclusion i suppose he remarked of me  she laughed gaily  my dear cecil when have i ever led you to suppose for a moment that i have ever wasted any time thinking of you  he was determined not to be annoyed and he ignored both the speech and the laugh  may i inquire how you are getting on  i am getting on she answered very well indeed the editor is beginning to say very nice things to me and already the men treat me just as though i were a comrade it is so nice of them  is it he muttered doubtfully  i have just finished she continued the most important piece of work they have trusted me with yet and i have been awfully lucky i have been to interview a millionaire  a man  she nodded of course  it isnt fit work for you he exclaimed hastily  you will forgive me if i consider myself the best judge of that she answered coldly i am a journalist and so long as it is honest work my sex doesnt count if every one whom i have to see is as courteous to me as mr trent has been i shall consider myself very lucky indeed  as who he cried  she looked up at him in surprise they were at the corner of the strand but as though in utter forgetfulness of their whereabouts he had suddenly stopped short and gripped her tightly by the arm she shook herself free with a little gesture of annoyance  whatever is the matter with you cecil dont gape at me like that and come along at once unless you want to be left behind yes we are very shorthanded and the chief let me go down to see mr trent he didnt expect for a moment that i should get him to talk to me but i did and he let me sketch the house i am awfully pleased with myself i can tell you  the young man walked by her side for a moment in silence she looked up at him casually as they crossed the street and something in his face surprised her  why cecil what on earth is the matter with you she exclaimed  he looked down at her with a new seriousness  i was thinking he said how oddly things turn out so you have been down to interview mr scarlett trent for a newspaper and he was civil to you  well i dont see anything odd about that she exclaimed impatiently dont be so enigmatical if youve anything to say say it dont look at me like an owl  i have a good deal to say to you he answered gravely how long shall you be at the office  about an hourperhaps longer  i will wait for you  id rather you didnt i dont want them to think that i go trailing about with an escort  then may i come down to your flat i have something really important to say to you ernestine it does not concern myself at all it is wholly about you it is something which you ought to know  you are trading upon my curiosity for the sake of a tea she laughed very well about five oclock  he bowed and walked back westwards with a graver look than usual upon his boyish face for he had a task before him which was very little to his liking ernestine swung open the entrance door to the hour and passed down the rows of desks until she reached the door at the further end marked subeditor she knocked and was admitted at once  a thin dark young man wearing a pincenez and smoking a cigarette looked up from his writing as she entered he waved her to a seat but his pen never stopped for a second  back miss wendermott very good what did you get  interview and sketch of the house she responded briskly  interview by jove thats good was he very difficult  ridiculously easy told me everything i asked and a lot more if i could have got it all down in his own language it would have been positively thrilling  the subeditor scribbled in silence for a moment or two he had reached an important point in his own work his pen went slower hesitated for a moment and then dashed on with renewed vigour  read the first few sentences of what youve got he remarked  ernestine obeyed to all appearance the man was engrossed in his own work but when she paused he nodded his head appreciatively  itll do he said dont try to polish it give it down and see that the proofs are submitted to me wheres the sketch  she held it out to him for a moment he looked away from his own work and took the opportunity to light a fresh cigarette then he nodded hastily scrawled some dimensions on the margin of the little drawing and settled down again to work  itll do he said give it to smith come back at eight to look at your proofs after ive done with them good interview good sketch youll do miss wendermott  she went out laughing softly this was quite the longest conversation she had ever had with the chief she made her way to the side of the first disengaged typist and sitting in an easychair gave down her copy here and there adding a little but leaving it mainly in the rough she knew whose hand with a few vigorous touches would bring the whole thing into the form which the readers of the hour delighted in and she was quite content to have it so the work was interesting and more than an hour had passed before she rose and put on her gloves  i am coming back at eight she said but the proofs are to go in to mr darrel nothing come in for me i suppose  the girl shook her head so ernestine walked out into the street then she remembered cecil davenant and his strange mannerthe story which he was even now waiting to tell her she looked at her watch and after a moments hesitation called a hansom  81 culpole street she told him this is a little extravagant she said to herself as the man wheeled his horse round but today i think that i have earned it    chapter xvii   ernestine he said gravely i am going to speak to you about your father  she looked up at him in swift surprise  is it necessary  i think so he answered you wont like what im going to tell you youll think youve been badly treated so you have i pledged my word in a weak hour with the others today im going to break it i think it best  well  youve been deceived you were told always that your father had died in prison he didnt  what  her sharp cry rang out strangely into the little room already he could see signs of the coming storm and the task which lay before him seemed more hateful than ever  listen he said i must tell you some things which you know in order to explain others which you do not know your father was a younger son born of extravagant parents virtually penniless and without the least capacity for earning money i dont blame himwho could i couldnt earn money myself if i hadnt got it i daresay that i should go to the bad as he did  the girls lips tightened and she drew a little breath through her teeth davenant hesitated  you know all about that company affair of course they made your father the butt of the whole thing although he was little more than a tool he was sent to prison for seven years you were only a child then and your mother was dead well when the seven years were up your relations and mine too ernestine concocted what i have always considered an illbegotten and a miserably selfish plot your father unfortunately yielded to them for your sake you were told that he had died in prison he did not he lived through his seven years there and when he came out did so in another name and went abroad on the morning of the day of his liberation  good god she cried and now  he is dead davenant answered hastily but only just lately wait a minute you are going to be furiously angry i know it and i dont blame you only listen for a moment the scheme was hatched up between my father and your two uncles i have always hated it and always protested against it remember that and be fair to me this is how they reasoned your fathers health they said was ruined and if he lives the seven years what is there left for him when he comes out he was a man as you know of aristocratic and fastidious tastes he would have the best of everythingsociety clubs sport now all these were barred against him if he had reappeared he could not have shown his face in pall mall or on the racecourses and every moment of his life would be full of humiliations and bitterness virtually then for such a man as he was life in england was over then there was you you were a pretty child and the earl had no children if your father was dead the story would be forgotten you would marry brilliantly and an ugly page in the family history would be blotted out that was how they looked at itit was how they put it to your father  he consented  yes he consented he saw the wisdom of it for your sake for the sake of the family even for his own sake the earl settled an income upon him and he left england secretly on the morning of his release we had the news of his death only a week or two ago  she stood up her eyes blazing her hands clenched together  i thank god she said that i have found the courage to break away from those people and take a little of my life into my own hands you can tell them this if you will cecilmy uncle lord davenant your mother and whoever had a say in this miserable affair tell them from me that i know the truth and that they are a pack of cowardly unnatural old women tell them that so long as i live i will never willingly speak to one of them again  i was afraid youd take it like that he remarked dolefully  take it like that she repeated in fierce scorn how else could a woman hear such news how else do you suppose she could feel to be told that she had been hoodwinked and kept from her duty and a mans heart very likely broken to save the respectability of a wornout old family oh how could they have dared to do it how could they have dared to do it  it was a beastly mistake he admitted  a whirlwind of scorn seemed to sweep over her she could keep still no longer she walked up and down the little room her hands were clenched her eyes flashing  to tell me that he was deadto let him live out the rest of his poor life in exile and alone did they think that i didnt care cecil she exclaimed suddenly turning and facing him i always loved my father you may think that i was too young to remember himi wasnt i loved him always when i grew up and they told me of his disgrace i was bitterly sorry for i loved his memorybut it made no difference and all the time it was a weak silly lie they let him come out poor father without a friend to speak to him and they hustled him out of the country and i whose place was there with him never knew  you were only a child ernestine it was twelve years ago  child i may have been only a child but i should have been old enough to know where my place was thank god i have done with these people and their disgusting shibboleth of respectability  you are a little violent he remarked  pshaw she flashed a look of scorn upon him you dont understand how should you you are of their kidneyyoure only half a man thank god that my mother was of the people id have died to have gone smirking through life with a brick for a heart and milk and water in my veins of all the stupid pieces of brutality i ever heard of this is the most callous and the most heartbreaking  it was a great mistake he said but i believe they did it for the best  she sat down with a little gesture of despair  i really think youd better go away cecil she said you exasperate me too horribly i shall strike you or throw something at you soon did it for the best what a miserable whine poor dear old dad to think that they should have done this thing  she buried her face in her handkerchief and sobbed for the second time since her childhood davenant was wise enough to attempt no sort of consolation he leaned a little forward and hid his own face with the palm of his hand when at last she looked up her face had cleared and her tone was less bitter it would have gone very hard with the earl of eastchester however if he had called to see his niece just then  well she said i want to know now why after keeping silent all this time you thought it best to tell me the truth this afternoon  because he answered you told me that you had just been to see scarlett trent  and what on earth had that to do with it  because scarlett trent was with your father when he died they were on an excursion somewhere up in the bushthe very excursion that laid the foundation of trents fortune  go on she cried tell me all that you know this is wonderful  well i am glad to tell you this at any rate he said i always liked your father and i saw him off when he left england and have written to him often since i believe i was his only correspondent in this country except his solicitors he had a very adventurous and i am afraid not a very happy time he never wrote cheerfully and he mortgaged the greater part of his income i dont blame him for anything he did a man needs some responsibility or some one dependent upon him to keep straight to be frank with you i dont think he did  poor dad she murmured of course he didnt i know id have gone to the devil as fast as i could if id been treated like it  well he drifted about from place to place and at last he got to the gold coast here i half lost sight of him and his few letters were more bitter and despairing than ever the last i had told me that he was just off on an expedition into the interior with another englishman they were to visit a native king and try to obtain from him certain concessions including the right to work a wonderful goldmine somewhere near the village of bekwando  why the great bekwando land company she cried it is the one scarlett trent has just formed a syndicate to work  davenant nodded  yes it was a terrible risk they were running he said for the people were savage and the climate deadly he wrote cheerfully for him though he had a partner he said who was strong and determined and they had presents to get which he had mortgaged the last penny of his income it was a desperate enterprise perhaps but it suited him and he went on to tell me this ernestine if he succeeded and he became wealthy he was returning to england just for a sight of you he was so changed he said that no one in the world would recognise him poor fellow it was the last line i had from him  and you are sure ernestine said slowly that scarlett trent was his partner  absolutely trents own story clinches the matter the prospectus of the mine quotes the concession as having been granted to him by the king of bekwando in the same month as your father wrote to me  and what news she asked have you had since  only this letteri will read it to youfrom one of the missionaries of the basle society i heard nothing for so long that i made inquiries and this is the result  ernestine took it and read it out steadily   fortnrenig  dear sirin reply to your letter and inquiry respecting the whereabouts of a mr richard grey the matter was placed in my hands by the agent of messrs castle and i have personally visited buckoman the village at which he was last heard of it seems that in february 18he started on an expedition to bekwando in the interior with an englishman by the name of trent with a view to buying land from a native king or obtaining the concession to work the valuable goldmines of that country the expedition seems to have been successful but trent returned alone and reported that his companion had been attacked by bushfever on the way back and had died in a few hours  i regret very much having to send you such sad and scanty news in return for your handsome donation to our funds i have made every inquiry but cannot trace any personal effects or letter mr grey i find was known out here altogether by the nickname of monty  i deeply regret the pain which this letter will doubtless cause you and trusting that you may seek and receive consolation where alone it may be found  i am  yours most sincerely  chas addison   ernestine read the letter carefully through and instead of handing it back to davenant put it into her pocket when she rose up cecil she said i want you to leave me at once you may come back tomorrow at the same time i am going to think this out quietly  he took up his hat there is one thing more ernestine he said slowly enclosed in the letter from the missionary at attra was another and a shorter note which in accordance with his request i burnt as soon as i read it i believe the man was honest when he told me that for hours he had hesitated whether to send me those few lines or not eventually he decided to do so but he appealed to my honour to destroy the note as soon as i had read it  well  he thought it his duty to let me know that there had been rumours as to how your father met his death trent it seems had the reputation of being a reckless and daring man and according to some agreement which they had he profited enormously by your fathers death there seems to have been no really definite ground for the rumour except that the body was not found where trent said that he had died apart from that life is held cheap out there and although your father was in delicate health his death under such conditions could not fail to be suspicious i hope i havent said too much ive tried to put it to you exactly as it was put to me  thank you ernestine said i think i understand    chapter xviii   dinner at the lodge that night was not a very lively affair trent had great matters in his brain and was not in the least disposed to make conversation for the sake of his unbidden guests da souzas few remarks he treated with silent contempt and mrs da souza he answered only in monosyllables julie nervous and depressed stole away before dessert and mrs da souza soon followed her very massive and frowning with an air of offended dignity da souza who opened the door for them returned to his seat moodily flicking the crumbs from his trousers with his serviette  hang it all trent he remarked in an aggrieved tone you might be a bit more amiable nice lively dinner for the women i must say  one isnt usually amiable to guests who stay when theyre not asked trent answered gruffly however if i hadnt much to say to your wife and daughter i have a word or two to say to you so fill up your glass and listen  da souza obeyed but without heartiness he stretched himself out in his chair and looked down thoughtfully at the large expanse of shirtfront in the centre of which flashed an enormous diamond  ive been into the city today as you know trent continued and i found as i expected that you have been making efforts to dispose of your share in the bekwando syndicate  i can assure you  oh rot trent interrupted i know what im talking about i wont have you sell out do you hear if you try it on ill queer the market for you at any risk i wont marry your daughter i wont be blackmailed and i wont be bullied were in this together sink or swim if you pull me down youve got to come too ill admit that if monty were to present himself in london tomorrow and demand his full pound of flesh we should be ruined but he isnt going to do it by your own showing there is no immediate risk and youve got to leave the thing in my hands to do what i think best if you play any hankypanky trickslook here da souza ill kill you sure do you hear i could do it and no one would be the wiser so far as i was concerned you take notice of what i say da souza youve made a fortune and be satisfied thats all  you wont marry julie then da souza said gloomily  no im shot if i will trent answered and look here da souza im leaving here for town tomorrowtaken a furnished flat in dover streetyou can stay here if you want but therell only be a caretaker in the place thats all ive got to say make yourself at home with the port and cigars last night you know youll excuse me i want a breath of fresh air  trent strolled through the open window into the garden and breathed a deep sigh of relief he was a free man again now he had created new dangersa new enemy to facebut what did he care all his life had been spent in facing dangers and conquering enemies what he had done before he could do again as he lit a pipe and walked to and fro he felt that this new state of things lent a certain savour to lifetook from it a certain sensation of finality not altogether agreeable which his recent great achievements in the financial world seemed to have inspired after all what could da souza do his prosperity was altogether bound up in the success of the bekwando syndicatehe was never the man to kill the goose which was laying such a magnificent stock of golden eggs the affair so far as he was concerned troubled him scarcely at all on cool reflection as he drew near the little plantation he even forgot all about it something else was filling his thoughts  the change in him became physical as well as mental the hard face of the man softened what there was of coarseness in its rugged outline became altogether toned down he pushed open the gate with fingers which were almost reverent he came at last to a halt in the exact spot where he had seen her first perhaps it was at that moment he realised most completely and clearly the curious thing which had come to himto him of all men hardhearted material an utter stranger in the world of feminine things with a pleasant sense of selfabandonment he groped about searching for its meaning he was a man who liked to understand thoroughly everything he saw and felt and this new atmosphere in which he found himself was a curious source of excitement to him only he knew that the central figure of it all was this girl that he had come out here to think about her and that henceforth she had become to him the standard of those things which were worth having in life everything about her had been a revelation to him the women whom he had come across in his battle upwards barmaids and their fellows fifthrate actresses occasionally the suburban wife of a prosperous city man had impressed him only with a sort of coarse contempt it was marvellous how thoroughly and clearly he had recognised ernestine at once as a type of that other world of womenkind of which he admittedly knew nothing yet it was so short a time since she had wandered into his life so short a time that he was even a little uneasy at the wonderful strength of this new passion a thing which had leaped up like a forest tree in a world of magic a live fullygrown thing mighty and immovable in a single night he found himself thinking of all the other things in life from a changed standpoint his sense of proportions was altered his financial triumphs were no longer omnipotent he was inclined even to brush them aside to consider them more as an incident in his career he associated her now with all those plans concerning the future which he had been dimly formulating since the climax of his successes had come she was of the world which he sought to enterat once the stimulus and the object of his desires he forgot all about da souza and his threats about the brokendown halfwitted old man who was gazing with wistful eyes across the ocean which kept him there an exilehe remembered nothing save the wonderful new thing which had come into his life a month ago he would have scoffed at the idea of there being anything worth considering outside the courts and alleys of the moneychangers market tonight he knew of other things tonight he knew that all he had done so far was as nothingthat as yet his foot was planted only on the threshold of life and in the path along which he must hew his way lay many fresh worlds to conquer tonight he told himself that he was equal to them all there was something out here in the dim moonlight something suggested by the shadows the roseperfumed air the delicate and languid stillness which crept into his veins and coursed through his blood like magic                                                     yet every now and then the same thought came it lay like a small but threatening black shadow across all those brilliant hopes and dreams which were filling his brain so far he had played the game of life as a hard man perhaps and a selfish one but always honestly now for the first time he had stepped aside from the beaten track he told himself that he was not bound to believe da souzas story that he had left monty with the honest conviction that he was past all human help yet he knew that such consolation was the merest sophistry through the twilight as he passed to and fro he fancied more than once that the wan face of an old man with wistful sorrowing eyes was floating somewhere before himand he stopped to listen with bated breath to the wind rustling in the elmtrees fancying he could bear that same passionate cry ringing still in his earsthe cry of an old man parted from his kin and waiting for death in a lonely land     chapter xix   ernestine found a letter on her plate a few mornings afterwards which rather puzzled her it was from a firm of solicitors in lincolns innthe eastchester family solicitorsrequesting her to call that morning to see them on important business there was not a hint as to the nature of it merely a formal line or two and a signature ernestine who had written insulting letters to all her relatives during the last few days smiled as she laid it down perhaps the family had called upon mr cuthbert to undertake their defence and bring her round to a reasonable view of things the idea was amusing enough but her first impulse was not to go nothing but the combination of an idle morning and a certain measure of curiosity induced her to keep the appointment  she was evidently expected for she was shown at once into the private office of the senior partner the clerk who ushered her in pronounced her name indistinctly and the elderly man who rose from his chair at her entrance looked at her inquiringly  i am miss wendermott she said coming forward i had a letter from you this morning you wished to see me i believe  mr cuthbert dropped at once his eyeglass and his inquiring gaze and held out his hand  my dear miss wendermott he said you must pardon the failing eyesight of an old man to be sure you are to be sure sit down miss wendermott if you please dear me what a likeness  you mean to my father she asked quietly  to your father certainly poor dear old boy you must excuse me miss wendermott your father and i were at eton together and i think i may say that we were always something more than lawyer and clienta good deal more a good deal more he was a fine fellow at hearta fine dear fellow bless me to think that you are his daughter  its very nice to hear you speak of him so mr cuthbert she said my father may have been very foolishi suppose he was really worse than foolishbut i think that he was most abominably and shamefully treated and so long as i live i shall never forgive those who were responsible for it i dont mean you mr cuthbert of course i mean my grandfather and my uncle mr cuthbert shook his head slowly  the earl he said was a very proud mana very proud man  you may call it pride she exclaimed i call it rank and brutal selfishness they had no right to force such a sacrifice upon him he would have been content i am sure to have lived quietly in englandto have kept out of their way to have conformed to their wishes in any reasonable manner but to rob him of home and friends and family and namewell may god call them to account for it and judge them as they judged him  i was against it he said sadly always  so mr davenant told me she said i cant quite forgive you mr cuthbert for letting me grow up and be so shamefully imposed upon but of course i dont blame you as i do the others i am only thankful that i have made myself independent of my relations i think after the letters which i wrote to them last night they will be quite content to let me remain where they put my fatheroutside their lives  i had heard mr cuthbert said hesitatingly that you were following some occupation something literary is it not  i am a journalist ernestine answered promptly and im proud to say that i am earning my own living  he looked at her with a fine and wonderful curiosity in his way he was quite as much one of the old school as the earl of eastchester and the idea of a ladya wendermott toocalling herself a journalist and proud of making a few hundreds a year was amazing enough to him he scarcely knew how to answer her  yes yes he said you have some of your fathers spirit some of his pluck too and that reminds mewe wrote to you to call  yes  mr davenant has told you that your father was engaged in some enterprise with this wonderful mr scarlett trent when he died  yes he told me that  well i have had a visit just recently from that gentleman it seems that your father when he was dying spoke of his daughter in england and mr trent is very anxious now to find you out and speaks of a large sum of money which he wishes to invest in your name  he has been a long time thinking about it ernestine remarked  he explained that mr cuthbert continued in this way your father gave him our address when he was dying but the envelope on which it was written got mislaid and he only came across it a day or two ago he came to see me at once and he seems prepared to act very handsomely he pressed very hard indeed for your name and address but i did not feel at liberty to disclose them before seeing you  you were quite right mr cuthbert she answered i suppose this is the reason why mr davenant has just told me the whole miserable story  it is one reason he admitted but in any case i think that mr davenant had made up his mind that you should know  mr trent i suppose talks of this money as a present to me  he did not speak of it in that way mr cuthbert answered but in a sense that is of course what it amounts to at the same time i should like to say that under the peculiar circumstances of the case i should consider you altogether justified in accepting it  ernestine drew herself up once more in her finely flashing eyes and resolute air the lawyer was reminded of his old friend  i will tell you what i should call it mr cuthbert she said i will tell you what i believe it is it is bloodmoney  mr cuthbert dropped his eyeglass and rose from his chair startled  bloodmoney my dear young lady bloodmoney  yes you have heard the whole story i suppose what did it sound like to you a valuable concession granted to two men one old the other young one strong the other feeble yet the concession read if one should die the survivor should take the whole who put that in do you suppose not my father you may be sure of that and one of them does die and scarlett trent is left to take everything do you think that reasonable i dont now you say after all this time he is fired with a sudden desire to behave handsomely to the daughter of his dead partner fiddlesticks i know scarlett trent although he little knows who i am and he isnt that sort of man at all hed better have kept away from you altogether for i fancy hes put his neck in the noose now i do not want his money but there is something i do want from mr scarlett trent and that is the whole knowledge of my fathers death  mr cuthbert sat down heavily in his chair  but my dear young lady he said you do not suspect mr trent ofermaking away with your father  and why not according to his own showing they were alone together when he died what was to prevent it i want to know more about it and i am going to if i have to travel to the gold coast myself i will tell you frankly mr cuthberti suspect mr scarlett trent no dont interrupt me it may seem absurd to you now that he is mr scarlett trent millionaire with the odour of civilisation clinging to him and the respectability of wealth but i too have seen him and i have heard him talk he has helped me to see the other manhalfsavage splendidly masterful forging his way through to success by sheer pluck and unswerving obstinacy listen i admire your mr trent he is a man and when he speaks to you you know that he was born with a destiny but there is the other side do you think that he would let a mans life stand in his way not he hed commit a murder or would have done in those days as readily as you or i would sweep away a fly and it is because he is that sort of man that i want to know more about my fathers death  you are talking of serious things miss wendermott mr cuthbert said gravely  why not why shirk them my fathers death was a serious thing wasnt it i want an account of it from the only man who can render it  when you disclose yourself to mr trent i should say that he would willingly give you  she interrupted him coming over and standing before him leaning against his table and looking him in the face  you dont understand i am not going to disclose myself you will reply to mr trent that the daughter of his old partner is not in need of charity however magnificently tendered you understand  i understand miss wendermott  as to her name or whereabouts you are not at liberty to disclose them you can let him think if you will that she is tarred with the same brush as those infamous and hypocritical relatives of hers who sent her father out to die  mr cuthbert shook his head  i think young lady if you will allow me to say so that you are making a needless mystery of the matter and further that you are embarking upon what will certainly prove to be a wildgoose chase we had news of your father not long before his sad death and he was certainly in illhealth  she set her lips firmly together and there was a look in her face which alone was quite sufficient to deter mr cuthbert from further argument  it may be a wildgoose chase she said it may not at any rate nothing will alter my purpose justice sleeps sometimes for very many years but i have an idea that mr scarlett trent may yet have to face a day of settlement                                                     she walked through the crowded streets homewards her nerves tingling and her pulses throbbing with excitement she was conscious of having somehow ridded herself of a load of uncertainty and anxiety she was committed now at any rate to a definite course there had been moments of indecisionmoments in which she had been inclined to revert to her first impressions of the man which before she had heard davenants story had been favourable enough that was all over now that pitifully tragic figurethe man who died with a tardy fortune in his hands an outcast in a far off countryhad stirred in her heart a passionate sympathyreason even gave way before it she declared war against mr scarlett trent    chapter xx   ernestine walked from lincolns inn to the office of the hour where she stayed until nearly four then having finished her days work she made her way homewards davenant was waiting for her in her rooms she greeted him with some surprise  you told me that i might come to tea he reminded her if youre expecting any one else or im in the way at all dont mind saying so please  she shook her head  im certainly not expecting any one she said to tell you the truth my visitinglist is a very small one scarcely any one knows where i live sit down and i will ring for tea  he looked at her curiously what a colour you have ernestine he remarked have you been walking fast  she laughed softly and took off her hat straightening the wavy brown hair which had escaped bounds a little in front of the mirror she looked at herself long and thoughtfully at the delicately cut but strong features the clear grey eyes and finely arched eyebrows the curving humorous mouth and dainty chin davenant regarded her in amazement  why ernestine he exclaimed are you taking stock of your good looks  precisely what i am doing she answered laughing at that moment i was wondering whether i possessed any  if you will allow me he said to take the place of the mirror i think that i could give you any assurances you required  she shook her head  you might be more flattering she said but you would be less faithful  he remained standing upon the hearthrug ernestine returned to the mirror  may i know he asked for whose sake is this sudden anxiety about your appearance  she turned away and sat in a low chair her hands clasped behind her head her eyes fixed upon vacancy  i have been wondering she said whether if i set myself to it as to a task i could make a man for a moment forget himselfdid i say forgeti mean betray  if i were that man he remarked smiling i will answer for it that you could  you but then you are only a boy you have nothing to conceal and you are partial to me arent you no the man whom i want to influence is a very different sort of person it is scarlett trent  he frowned heavily a boor he said what have you to do with him the less the better i should say  and from my point of view the more the better she answered i have come to believe that but for him my father would be alive today  i do not understand if you believe that surely you do not wish to see the manto have him come near you  i want him punished  he shook his head there is no proof there never could be any proof  there are many ways she said softly in which a man can be made to suffer  and you would set yourself to do this  why not is not anything better than letting him go scotfree would you have me sit still and watch him blossom into a millionaire peer a man of society drinking deep draughts of all the joys of life with never a thought for the man he left to rot in an african jungle oh any way of punishing him is better than that i have declared war against scarlett trent  how long he asked will it last  until he is in my power she answered slowly until he has fallen back again to the ruck until he has tasted a little of the misery from which at least he might have saved my father  i think he said that you are taking a great deal too much for granted i do not know scarlett trent and i frankly admit that i am prejudiced against him and all his class yet i think that he deserves his chance like any man go to him and ask him face to face how your father died declare yourself press for all particulars seek even for corroboration of his word treat him if you will as an enemy but as an honourable one  she shook her head  the man she said has all the plausibility of his class he has learned it in the money school where these things become an art he believes himself securehe is even now seeking for me he is all prepared with his story no my way is best  i do not like your way he said it is not like you ernestine  for the sake of those whom one loves she said one will do much that one hates when i think that but for this man my father might still have been alive might have lived to know how much i loathed those who sent him into exilewell i feel then that there is nothing in the world i would not do to crush him  he rose to his feethis fresh rather boyish face was wrinkled with care  i shall live to be sorry ernestine he said that i ever told you the truth about your father  if i had discovered it for myself she said and sooner or later i should have discovered it and had learned that you too had been in the conspiracy i should never have spoken to you again as long as i lived  then i must not regret it he said only i hate the part you are going to play i hate to think that i must stand by and watch and say nothing  there is no reason she said why you should watch it why do you not go away for a time  i cannot he answered sadly and you know why  she was impatient but she looked at him for a moment with a gleam of sadness in her eyes  it would be much better for you she said if you would make up your mind to put that folly behind you  it may be folly but it is not the sort of folly one forgets  you had better try then cecil she said for it is quite hopeless you know that be a man and leave off dwelling upon the impossible i do not wish to marry and i do not expect to but if ever i did it would not be you  he was silent for a few momentslooking gloomily across at the girl loathing the thought that she his ideal of all those things which most become a woman graceful handsome perfectly bred should ever be brought into contact at all with such a man as this one whose confidence she was planning to gain no he could not go away and leave her he must be at hand must remain her friend  i wonder he said couldnt we have one of our old evenings again listen  i would rather not she interrupted softly if you will persist in talking of a forbidden subject you must go away be reasonable cecil  he was silent for a moment when he spoke again his tone was changed  very well he said i will try to let things be as you wishfor the present now do you want to hear some news  she nodded  of course  its about dickseems rather a coincidence too he was at the cape you know with a firm of surveyors and hes been offered a post on the gold coast  the gold coast how odd anywhere near  the offer came from the bekwando company  is he going  yes  she was full of eager interest how extraordinary he might be able to make some inquiries for me  he nodded  what there is to be discovered about mr scarlett trent he can find out but ernestine i want you to understand this i have nothing against the man and although i dislike him heartily i think it is madness to associate him in any way with your fathers death  you do not know him i do  i have only told you my opinion he answered it is of no consequence i will see with your eyes he is your enemy and he shall be my enemy if there is anything shady in his past out there depend upon it dick will hear of it  she pushed the wavy hair back from her foreheadher eyes were bright and there was a deep flush of colour in her cheeks but the man was not to be deceived he knew that these things were not for him it was the accomplice she welcomed and not the man  it is a splendid stroke of fortune she said you will write to fred today wont you dont prejudice him either way write as though your interest were merely curiosity it is the truth i want to get at that is all if the man is innocent i wish him no harmonly i believe him guilty  there was a knock at the doorboth turned round ernestines trim little maidservant was announcing a visitor who followed close behind  mr scarlett trent    chapter xxi   ernestine was a delightful hostess she loved situations and her social tact was illimitable in a few minutes trent was seated in a comfortable and solid chair with a little round table by his side drinking tea and eating buttered scones and if not altogether at his ease very nearly so opposite him was davenant dying to escape yet constrained to be agreeable and animated too with a keen distasteful curiosity to watch ernestines methods and ernestine herself chatted all the time diffused good fellowship and teashe made an atmosphere which had a nameless fascination for the man who had come to middleage without knowing what a home meant davenant studied him and became thoughtful he took note of the massive features the iron jaw the eyes as bright as steel and his thoughtfulness became anxiety ernestine too was strong but this man was a rock what would happen if she carried out her purpose fooled betrayed him led him perhaps to ruin some day her passion would leap up she would tell him they would be face to face injured man and taunting woman davenant had an ugly vision as he sat there he saw the mans eyes catch fire the muscles of his face twitch he saw ernestine shrink back white with terror and the man followed her  cecil arent you well youre looking positively ghastly  he pulled himself togetherit had been a very realistic little interlude  bad headache he said smiling by the by i must go  if you ever did such a thing as work she remarked i should say that you had been doing too much as it is i suppose you have been sitting up too late goodbye i am so glad that you were here to meet mr trent mr davenant is my cousin you know she continued turning to her visitor and he is almost the only one of my family who has not cast me off utterly  davenant made his adieux with a heavy heart he hated the hypocrisy with which he hoped for scarlett trents better acquaintance and the latters bluff acceptance of an invitation to look him up at his club he walked out into the street cursing his mad offer to her and the whole business but ernestine was very well satisfied  she led trent to talk about africa again and he plunged into the subject without reserve he told her stories and experiences with a certain graphic and picturesque force which stamped him as the possessor of an imaginative power and command of words for which she would scarcely have given him credit she had the unusual gift of making the best of all those with whom she came in contact trent felt that he was interesting her and gained confidence in himself  all the time she was making a social estimate of him he was not by any means impossible on the contrary there was no reason why he should not become a success that he was interested in her was already obvious but that had become her intention the task began to seem almost easy as she sat and listened to him  then he gave her a start quietly and without any warning he changed the subject into one which was fraught with embarrassment for her at his first words the colour faded from her cheeks  ive been pretty lucky since i got back things have gone my way a bit and the only disappointment ive had worth speaking of has been in connection with a matter right outside money ive been trying to find the daughter of that old partner of minei told you about herand i cant  she changed her seat a little there was no need for her to affect any interest in what he was saying she listened to every word intently  monty he said reflectingly was a good old sort in a way and i had an idea somehow that his daughter would turn out something like the man himself and at heart monty was all right i didnt know who she was or her namemonty was always precious close but i had the address of a firm of lawyers who knew all about her i called there the other day and saw an old chap who questioned and crossquestioned me until i wasnt sure whether i was on my head or my heels and after all he told me to call again this afternoon for her address i told him of course that monty died a pauper and hed no share of our concession to will away but id done so well that i thought id like to make over a trifle to herin fact id put away 10000 pounds worth of bekwando shares for her i called this afternoon and do you know miss wendermott the young lady declined to have anything to say to mewouldnt let me know who she was that i might have gone and talked this over in a friendly way with her didnt want money didnt want to hear about her father  you must have been disappointed  ill admit it he replied i was id come to think pretty well of monty although he was a loose fish and id a sort of fancy for seeing his daughter  she took up a screen as though to shield the fire from her face would the mans eyes never cease questioning hercould it be that he suspected surely that was impossible  why have you never tried to find her before she asked  thats a natural question enough he admitted well first i only came across a letter monty wrote with the address of those lawyers a few days ago and secondly the bekwando mine and land company has only just boomed and you see that made me feel that id like to give a lift up to any one belonging to poor old monty i could find ive a mind to go on with the thing myself and find out somehow who this young lady is  who were the lawyers  cuthbert and cuthbert  they are most respectable people she said i know mr cuthbert and their standing is very high if mr cuthbert told you that the young lady wished to remain unknown to you i am quite sure that you may believe him  thats all right trent said but heres what puzzles me the girl may be small enough and mean enough to decline to have anything to say to me because her father was a bad lot and she doesnt want to be reminded of him but for that very reason can you imagine her virtually refusing a large sum of money i told old cuthbert all about it there was 10000 pounds worth of shares waiting for her and no need for any fuss can you understand that  it seems very odd she said perhaps the girl objects to being given money it is a large sum to take as a present from a stranger  if she is that sort of girl he said decidedly she would at least want to meet and talk with the man who saw the last of her father no theres something else in it and i think that i ought to find her dont you  she hesitated  im afraid i cant advise you she said only if she has taken so much pains to remain unknown i am not surei think that if i were you i would assume that she has good reason for it  i can see no good reason he said and there is a mystery behind it which i fancy would be better cleared up some day i will tell you more about it  evidently ernestine was weary of the subject for she suddenly changed it she led him on to talk of other things when at last he glanced at the clock he was horrified to see how long he had stayed  youll remember i hope miss wendermott he said that this is the first afternoon call ive ever paid ive no idea how long i ought to have stayed but certainly not two hours  the time has passed quickly she said smiling upon him so that his momentary discomfort passed away i have been very interested in the stories of your past mr trent but do you know i am quite as much interested more so even in your future  tell me what you mean he asked  you have so much before you so many possibilities there is so much that you may gain so much that you may miss  he looked puzzled  i have a lot of money he said thats all i havent any friends nor any education worth speaking of i dont see quite where the possibilities come in  she crossed the room and came over close to his side resting her arm upon the mantelpiece she was still wearing her walkingdress prim and straight in its folds about her tall graceful figure and her hair save for the slight waviness about the forehead was plainly dressed there were none of the cheap arts about her to which trent had become accustomed in women who sought to attract yet as she stood looking down at him a faint smile half humorous half satirical playing about the corners of her shapely mouth he felt his heart beat faster than ever it had done in any african jungle it was the nervous and emotional side of the man to which she appealed he felt unlike himself undergoing a new phase of development there was something stirring within him which he could not understand  you havent any friends she said softly nor any education but you are a millionaire that is quite sufficient you are a veritable caesar with undiscovered worlds before you  i wish i knew what you meant he said with some hesitation  she laughed softly  dont you understand she said that you are the fashion last year it was indian potentates the year before it was actors this year it is millionaires you have only to announce yourself and you may take any place you choose in society you have arrived at the most auspicious moment i can assure you that before many months are past you will know more people than ever you have spoken to in your life beforemen whose names have been household words to you and nothing else will be calling you old chap and wanting to sell you horses and women who last week would look at you through lorgnettes as though you were a denizen of some unknown world will be lavishing upon you their choicest smiles and whispering in your ear their not at home afternoon oh its lucky im able to prepare you a little for it or you would be taken quite by storm  he was unmoved he looked at her with a grim tightening of the lips  i want to ask you this he said what should i be the better for it all what use have i for friends who only gather round me because i am rich shouldnt i be better off to have nothing to do with them to live my own life and make my own pleasures  she shrugged her shoulders  these people she said of whom i have been speaking are masters of the situation you cant enjoy money alone you want to race hunt entertain shoot join in the revels of country houses you must be one of them or you can enjoy nothing  montys words were ringing back in his ears after all pleasures could be boughtbut happiness  and you he said you too think that these things you have mentioned are the things most to be desired in life  a certain restraint crept into her manner  yes she answered simply  i have been told he said that you have given up these things to live your life differently that you choose to be a worker you have rich relationsyou could be rich yourself  she looked him steadily in the face  you are wrong she said i have no money i have not chosen a profession willinglyonly because i am poor  ah  the monosyllable was mysterious to her but for the wild improbability of the thing she would have wondered whether indeed he knew her secret she brushed the idea away it was impossible  at least he said you belong to these people  yes she answered i am one of the poor young women of society  and you would like he continued to be one of the rich onesto take your place amongst them on equal terms that is what you are looking forward to in life  she laughed gaily  of course i am if there was the least little chance of it i should be delighted you mustnt think that im different from other girls in that respect because im more independent in this country theres only one way of enjoying life thoroughly and that you will find out for yourself very soon  he rose and held out his hand  thank you very much he said for letting me come may i  you may come she said quietly as often as you like    chapter xxii   mr scarlett trent the gold king left for africa on thursday last on the dunottar castle to pay a brief visit to his wonderful possessions there before the great bekwando mining and exploration company is offered to the public mr trent is already a millionaire and should he succeed in floating the company on the basis of the prospectus he will be a multimillionaire and certainly one of the richest of englishmen during his absence workmen are to be kept going night and day at his wonderful palace in park lane which he hopes to find ready for occupation on his return mr trents long list of financial successes are too well known to be given here but who will grudge wealth to a man who is capable of spending it in such a lordly fashion we wish mr trent a safe voyage and a speedy return  the paper slipped from his fingers and he looked thoughtfully out seaward it was only one paragraph of many and the tone of all was the same ernestines words had come truehe was already a man of note a few months had changed his life in the most amazing waywhen he looked back upon it now it was with a sense of unrealitysurely all these things which had happened were part of a chimerical dream it was barely possible for him to believe that it was he scarlett trent who had developed day by day into what he was at that moment for the man was changed in a hundred ways his grey flannel clothes was cut by the saville row tailor of the moment his hands and hair his manner of speech and carriage were all altered he recalled the men he had met the clubs he had joined his stud of horses at newmarket the countryhouses at which he had visited his most clear impression of the whole thing was how easy everything had been made for him his oddness of speech his gaucheries his ignorances and nervousness had all been so lightly treated that they had been brushed away almost insensibly he had been able to do so little that was wronghis mistakes were ignored or admired as originality and yet in some delicate way the right thing had been made clear to him ernestine had stood by his side always laughing at this swift fulfilment of her prophecy always encouraging him always enigmatic yet at the thought of her a vague sense of trouble crept into his heart he took a worn photograph from his pocket and looked at it long and searchingly and when he put it away he sighed it made no difference of course but he would rather have found her like that the child with sweet trustful eyes and a laughing mouth was there no life at all then outside this little vortex into which at her bidding he had plunged would she never have been content with anything else he looked across the placid blue sea to where the sun gleamed like silver on a white sail and sighed again he must make himself what she would have him there was no life for him without her  the captain came up for his morning chat and some of the passengers who eyed him with obvious respect lingered for a moment about his chair on their promenade trent lit a cigar and presently began to stroll up and down himself the salt seaair was a wonderful tonic to him after the nervous life of the last few months he found his spirits rapidly rising this voyage had been undertaken in obedience to a sudden but overpowering impulse it had come to him one night that he must know for himself how much truth there was in da souzas story he could not live with the thought that a thunderbolt was ever in the skies that at any moment his life might lie wrecked about him he was going out by one steamer and back by the next the impending issue of his great company afforded all the excuse that was necessary if da souzas story was truewell there were many things which might be done short of a complete disclosure monty might be satisfied if plenty of money were forthcoming to abandon his partnership and release the situation from its otherwise endless complications trent smoked his cigar placidly and taking off his cap bared his head to the sweeping seawind which seemed laden with life and buoyancy suddenly as he swung round by the companionway he found himself confronted by a newcomer who came staggering out from the gangway there was a moments recoil and a sharp exclamation trent stood quite still and a heavy frown darkened his face  da souza he exclaimed how on earth came you on board  da souzas face was yellower than ever and he wore an ulster buttoned up to his chin yet there was a flash of malice in his eyes as he answered  i came by late tender at southampton he said  it cost me a special from london and the agents told me i couldnt do it but here i am you see  and a poorlooking object you are trent said contemptuously if youve life enough in you to talk be so good as to tell me what the devil you mean by following me like this  i came da souza answered in both our interestschiefly in my own  i can believe that trent answered shortly now speak up tell me what you want  da souza groaned and sank down upon a vacant deckchair  i will sit down he said i am not well the sea disagrees with me horribly well well you want to know why i came here i can answer that question by another what are you doing here why are you going to africa  i am going trent said to see how much truth there was in that story you told me i am going to see old monty if he is alive  da souza groaned  it is cruel madness he said and you are such an obstinate man oh dear oh dear  i prefer trent said a crisis now to ruin in the future besides i have the remnants of a conscience  you will ruin yourself and you will ruin me da souza moaned how am i to have a quarter share if monty is to come in for half and how are you to repay him all that you would owe on a partnership account you couldnt do it trent ive heard of your fourinhand and your yacht and your racers and that beautiful house in park lane i tell you that to part with half your fortune would ruin you and the bekwando company could never be floated  i dont anticipate parting with half trent said coolly monty hasnt long to liveand he ought not to be hard to make terms with  da souza beat his hands upon the handles of his deckchair  but why go near him at all he thinks that you are dead he has no idea that you are in england why should he know why do you risk ruin like this  there are three reasons trent answered first he may find his way to england and upset the applecart secondly ive only the shreds of a conscience but i cant leave a man whom im robbing of a fortune in a state of semislavery as i daresay he is and the third reason is perhaps the strongest of all but im not going to tell it you  da souza blinked his little eyes and looked up with a cunning smile  your first reason he said is a poor sort of one do you suppose i dont have him looked after a bitno chance of his getting back to england i can tell you as for the second hes only halfwitted and if he was better off he wouldnt know it  even if i gave way to you in this trent answered the third reason is strong enough  da souzas face was gloomy i know its no use trying to move you he said but youre on a silly dangerous wild goosechase  and what about yourself trent asked i imagine you have some other purpose in taking this voyage than just to argue with me  i am going to see da souza said that you do as little mischief as possible  trent walked the length of the deck and back da souza he said stopping in front of him youre a fool to take this voyage you know me well enough to be perfectly assured that nothing you could say would ever influence me theres more behind it youve a game of your own to play over there now listen if i catch you interfering with me in any way we shall meet on more equal terms than when you laughed at my revolver at walton lodge i never was overscrupulous in those old days da souza you know that and i have a fancy that when i find myself on african soil again i may find something of the old man in me yet so look out my friend ive no mind to be trifled with and mark meif harm comes to that old man it will be your life for his as im a living man you were afraid of me once da souza i havent changed so much as you may think and the gold coast isnt exactly the centre of civilisation there ive said my say the less i see of you now till we land the better i shall be pleased  he walked away and was challenged by the doctor to a game of shuffleboard da souza remained in his chair his eyes blinking as though with the sun and his hands gripping nervously the sides of his chair    chapter xxiii  after six weeks incessant throbbing the great engines were still and the dunottar castle lay at anchor a mile or two from the african coast and off the town of attra the heat which in motion had been hard enough to bear was positively stifling now the sun burned down upon the glassy sea and the white deck till the varnish on the rails cracked and blistered and the sweat streamed like water from the faces of the labouring seamen below at the ships side half a dozen surf boats were waiting manned by kru boys who alone seemed perfectly comfortable and cheerful as usual all around were preparations for landingboxes were being hauled up from the hold and people were going about in reach of small parcels and deckchairs and missing acquaintances trent in white linen clothes and puggaree was leaning over the railing gazing towards the town when da souza came up to him  last morning mr trent  trent glanced round and nodded  are you disembarking here he asked  da souza admitted the fact my brother will meet me he said he is very afraid of the surfboats or he would have come out to the steamer you remember him  yes i remember him trent answered he was not the sort of person one forgets  he is a very rough diamond da souza said apologetically he has lived here so long that he has become almost half a native  and the other half a thief trent muttered  da souza was not in the least offended  i am afraid he admitted that his morals are not up to the threadneedle street pitch eh mr trent but he has made quite a great deal of money oh quite a sum i can assure you he sends me some over to invest  well if hes carrying on the same old game trent remarked he ought to be coining it by the by of course he knows exactly where monty is  it is what i was about to say da souza assented with a vigorous nod of the head now my dear mr trent i know that you will have your way it is no use my trying to dissuade you so listen you shall waste no time in searching for monty my brother will tell you exactly where he is  trent hesitated he would have preferred to have nothing at all to do with da souza and the very thought of oom sam made him shudder on the other hand time was valuable to him and he might waste weeks looking for the man whom oom sam could tell him at once where to find on the whole it was better to accept da souzas offer  very well da souza he said i have no time to spare in this country and the sooner i get back to england the better for all of us if your brother knows where monty is so much the better for both of us we will land together and meet him  already the disembarking had commenced da souza and trent took their places side by side on the broad flatbottomed boat and soon they were off shorewards and the familiar song of the kru boys as they bent over their oars greeted their ears the excitement of the last few strokes was barely over before they sprang upon the beach and were surrounded by a little crowd on the outskirts of whom was oom sam trent was seized upon by an englishman who was representing the bekwando land and mining investment company and before he could regain da souza a few rapid sentences had passed between the latter and his brother in portuguese oom sam advanced to trent hat in hand  welcome back to attra senor  trent nodded curtly  place isnt much changed he remarked  it is very slowly here oom sam said that progress is made the climate is too horrible it makes dead sheep of men  you seem to hang on pretty well trent remarked carelessly been up country lately  i was trading with the king of bekwando a month ago oom sam answered  palmoil and mahogany for vile rum i suppose trent said  the man extended his hands and shrugged his shoulders the old gesture  they will have it he said shall we go to the hotel senor trent and rest  trent nodded and the three men scrambled up the beach across an open space and gained the shelter of a broad balcony shielded by a striped awning which surrounded the plain white stone hotel a kru boy welcomed them with beaming face and fetched them drinks upon a brummagem tray trent turned to the englishman who had followed them up  tomorrow he said i shall see you about the contracts my first business is a private matter with these gentlemen will you come up here and breakfast with me  the englishman a surveyor from a london office assented with enthusiasm  i cant offer to put you up he said gloomily living out heres beastly see you in the morning then  he strolled away fanning himself trent lit a long cigar  i understand he said turning to oom sam that old monty is alive still if so its little short of a miracle for i left him with scarcely a gasp in his body and i was nearly done myself  it was oom sam said veree wonderful the natives who were chasing you they found him and then the englishman whom you met in bekwando on his way inland he rescued him you see that little white house with a flagstaff yonder  he pointed to a little onestorey building about a mile away along the coast trent nodded  that is oom sam said a station of the basle mission and old monty is there you can go and see him any time you like but he will not know you  is he as far gone as that trent asked slowly  his mind oom sam said is gone one little flickering spark of life goes on a day a week who can tell how long  has he a doctor trent asked  the missionary he is a medical man oom sam explained yet he is long past the art of medicine  it seemed to trent turning at that moment to relight his cigar that a look of subtle intelligence was flashed from one to the other of the brothers he paused with the match in his fingers puzzled suspicious anxious so there was some scheme hatched already between these precious pair it was time indeed that he had come  there was something else i wanted to ask he said a moment or two later what about the man francis has he been heard of lately  oom sam shook his head  ten months ago he answered a trader from lulabulu reported having passed him on his way to the interior he spoke of visiting sugbaroo another country beyond if he ventured there he will surely never return  trent set down his glass without a word and called to some kru boys in the square who carried litters  i am going he said to find monty    chapter xxiv   an old man with his face turned to the sea was making a weary attempt at digging upon a small potato patch the blaze of the tropical sun had become lost an hour or so before in a strange grey mist rising not from the sea but from the swamps which lay here and therebrilliant verdant patches of poison and pestilence with the mist came a moist sticky heat the air was fetid trent wiped the perspiration from his forehead and breathed hard this was an evil moment for him  monty turned round at the sound of his approaching footsteps the two men stood face to face trent looked eagerly for some sign of recognitionnone came  dont you know me trent said huskily im scarlett trentwe went up to bekwando together you know i thought you were dead monty or i wouldnt have left you  eh what  monty mumbled for a moment or two and was silent a look of dull disappointment struggled with the vacuity of his face trent noticed that his hands were shaking pitifully and his eyes were bloodshot  try and think monty he went on drawing a step nearer to him dont you remember what a beastly time we had up in the bushhow they kept us day after day in that villainous hut because it was a fetish week and how after we had got the concessions those confounded niggers followed us they meant our lives monty and i dont know how you escaped come make an effort and pull yourself together were rich men now both of us you must come back to england and help me spend a bit  monty had recovered a little his power of speech he leaned over his spade and smiled benignly at his visitor  there was a trentham in the guards he said slowly the honourable george trentham you know one of poor abercrombies sons but i thought he was dead you must dine with me one night at the travellers ive given up eating myself but im always thirsty  he looked anxiously away towards the town and began to mumble trent was in despair presently he began again  i used to belong to the guardsalways dined there till jacques left afterwards the cooking was beastly andi cant quite remember where i went then you seei think i must be getting old i dont remember things between you and me he sidled a little closer to trent i think i must have got into a bit of a scrape of some sorti feel as though there was a blank somewhere  again he became unintelligible trent was silent for several minutes he could not understand that strained anxious look which crept into montys face every time he faced the town then he made his last effort  monty do you remember this  zealously guarded yet a little worn at the edges and faded he drew the picture from its case and held it before the old mans blinking eyes there was a moment of suspense then a sharp breathless cry which ended in a wail  take it away monty moaned i lost it long ago i dont want to see it i dont want to think  i have come trent said with an unaccustomed gentleness in his tone to make you think i want you to remember that that is a picture of your daughter you are rich now and there is no reason why you should not come back to her dont you understand monty  it was a grey white face shrivelled and pinched weak eyes without depth a vapid smile in which there was no meaning trent carried away for a moment by an impulse of pity felt only disappointment at the hopelessness of his task he would have been honestly glad to have taken the monty whom he had known back to england but not this man for already that brief flash of awakened life seemed to have died away montys head was wagging feebly and he was casting continually little furtive glances towards the town  please go away he said i dont know you and you give me a pain in my head dont you know what it is to feel a buzz buzz buzzing inside i cant remember things its no use trying  monty why do you look so often that way trent said quietly is some one coming out from the town to see you  monty threw a quick glance at him and trent sighed for the glance was full of cunning the low cunning of the lunatic criminal  no one no one he said hastily who should come to see me im only poor monty poor old montys got no friends go away and let me dig  trent walked a few paces apart and passed out of the garden to a low shelving bank and looked downward where a sea of glass rippled on to the broad firm sands what a picture of desolation the grey hot mist the whitewashed cabin the long ugly potato patch the weird pathetic figure of that old man from whose brain the light of life had surely passed for ever and yet trent was puzzled montys furtive glance inland his halffrightened halfcunning denial of any anticipated visit suggested that there was some one else who was interested in his existence and some one too with whom he shared a secret trent lit a cigar and sat down upon the sandy turf monty resumed his digging trent watched him through the leaves of a stunted tree underneath which he had thrown himself  for an hour or more nothing happened trent smoked and monty who had apparently forgotten all about his visitor plodded away amongst the potato furrows with every now and then a long searching look towards the town then there came a black speck stealing across the broad ricefield and up the steep hill a speck which in time took to itself the semblance of a man a kru boy naked as he was born save for a ragged loincloth and clutching something in his hand he was invisible to trent until he was close at hand it was monty whose changed attitude and deportment indicated the approach of something interesting he had relinquished his digging and after a long stealthy glance towards the house had advanced to the extreme boundary of the potato patch his behaviour here for the first time seemed to denote the hopeless lunatic he swung his long arms backward and forwards cracking his fingers and talked unintelligibly to himself hoarse guttural murmurings without sense or import trent changed his place and for the first time saw the kru boy his face darkened and an angry exclamation broke from his lips it was something like this which he had been expecting  the kru boy drew nearer and nearer finally he stood upright on the rank coarse grass and grinned at monty whose lean hands were outstretched towards him he fumbled for a moment in his loincloth then he drew out a long bottle and handed it up trent stepped out as montys nervous fingers were fumbling with the cork he made a grab at the boy who glided off like an eel instantly he whipped out a revolver and covered him  come here he cried  the boy shook his head no understand  who sent you here with that filthy stuff he asked sternly youd best answer me  the kru boy shrinking away from the dark muzzle of that motionless revolver was spellbound with fear he shook his head  no understand  there was a flash of light a puff of smoke a loud report the kru boy fell forward upon his face howling with fear monty ran off towards the house mumbling to himself  the next time trent said coolly i shall fire at you instead of at the tree remember i have lived out here and i know all about you and your kind you can understand me very well if you choose and youve just got to who sends you here with that vile stuff  massa i tell massa oom sam he send me  and what is the stuff  hamburgh gin massa very good liquor please massa point him pistol the other way  trent took up the flask smelt its contents and threw it away with a little exclamation of disgust  how often have you been coming here on this errand he asked sternly  most every day massawhen him mr price away  trent nodded  very good he said now listen to me if ever i catch you round here again or anywhere else on such an errand ill shoot you like a dog now be off  the boy bounded away with a broad grin of relief trent walked up to the house and asked for the missionarys wife she came to him soon in what was called the parlour a frail anaemiclooking woman with tired eyes and weary expression  im sorry to trouble you mrs price trent said plunging at once into his subject but i want to speak to you about this old man monty youve had him some time now havent you  about four years she answered captain francis left him with my husband i believe he found him in one of the villages inland a prisoner  trent nodded  he left you a little money with him i believe  the woman smiled faintly  it was very little she said but such as it is we have never touched it he eats scarcely anything and we consider that the little work he has done has about paid us for keeping him  did you know trent asked bluntly that he had been a drunkard  captain francis hinted as much the woman answered that was one reason why he wanted to leave him with us he knew that we did not allow anything in the house  it was a pity trent said that you could not have watched him a little more out of it why his brain is sodden with drink now  the woman was obviously honest in her amazement how can that be she exclaimed he has absolutely no money and he never goes off our land  he has no need trent answered bitterly there are men in attra who want him dead and they have been doing their best to hurry him off i caught a kru boy bringing him gin this afternoon evidently it has been a regular thing  i am very sorry indeed to hear this the woman said and i am sure my husband will be too he will feel that in a certain measure he has betrayed captain franciss trust at the same time we neither of us had any idea that anything of this sort was to be feared or we would have kept watch  you cannot be blamed trent said i am satisfied that you knew nothing about it now i am going to let you into a secret monty is a rich man if he had his rights and i want to help him to them i shall take him back to england with me but i cant leave for a week or so if you can keep him till then and have some one to watch him day and night ill give your husband a hundred pounds for your work here and build you a church its all right dont look as though i were mad im a very rich man thats all and i shant miss the money but i want to feel that monty is safe till i can start back to england will you undertake this  yes the woman answered promptly we will well do our honest best  trent laid a banknote upon the table  just to show im in earnest he remarked rising i shall be upcountry for about a month look after the old chap well and youll never regret it  trent went thoughtfully back to the town he had committed himself now to a definite course of action he had made up his mind to take monty back with him to england and face the consequences    chapter xxv   on the summit of a little knoll with a pipe between his teeth and his back against a palmtree trent was lounging away an hour of the breathless night usually a sound sleeper the wakefulness which had pursued him from the instant his head had touched his travelling pillow an hour or so back was not only an uncommon occurrence but one which seemed proof against any effort on his part to overcome it so he had risen and stolen away from the little camp where his companions lay wrapped in heavy slumber they had closed their eyes in a dense and tropical darknessso thick indeed that they had lit a fire notwithstanding the stifling heat to remove that vague feeling of oppression which chaos so complete seemed to bring with it its embers burnt now with a faint and sickly glare in the full flood of yellow moonlight which had fallen upon the country from this point of vantage trent could trace backwards their days march for many miles the white posts left by the surveyor even were visible and in the background rose the mountains of bekwando it had been a hard weeks work for trent he had found chaos discontent despair the english agent of the bekwando land company was on the point of cancelling his contract the surveyors were spending valuable money without making any real attempt to start upon their undoubtedly difficult task everywhere the feeling seemed to be that the prosecution of his schemes was an impossibility the road was altogether in the clouds trent was flatly told that the labour they required was absolutely unprocurable fortunately trent knew the country and he was a man of resource from the moment when he had appeared upon the spot things had begun to right themselves he had found oom sam established as a sort of taskmaster and contractor and had promptly dismissed him with the result that the supply of kru boys was instantly doubled he had found other sources of labour and started them at once on clearing work scornfully indifferent to the oftenexpressed doubts of the english surveyor as to possibility of making the road at all he had chosen overseers with that swift and intuitive insight into character which in his case amounted almost to genius with a halfsheet of notepaper and a pencil he had mapped out a road which had made one at least of the two surveyors thoughtful and had largely increased his respect for the english capitalist now he was on his way back from a tour almost to bekwando itself by the route of the proposed road already the work of preparation had begun hundreds of natives left in their track were sawing down palmtrees cutting away the bush digging and making ready everywhere for that straight wide thoroughfare which was to lead from bekwando village to the seacoast cables as to his progress had already been sent back to london apart from any other result trent knew that he had saved the syndicate a fortune by his journey here  the light of the moon grew strongerthe country lay stretched out before him like a map with folded arms and a freshlylit pipe trent leaned with his back against the tree and fixed eyes at first he saw nothing but that road broad and white stretching to the horizon and thronged with oxendrawn wagons then the fancy suddenly left him and a girls face seemed to be laughing into hisa face which was ever changing gay and brilliant one moment calm and seductively beautiful the next he smoked his pipe furiously perplexed and uneasy one moment the face was ernestines the next it was montys little girl laughing up at him from the worn and yellow tintype the promise of the onehad it been fulfilled in the woman at least he knew that here was the one great weakness of his life the curious flood of sentiment which had led him to gamble for the childs picture had merged with equal suddenness into passion at the coming of her later presentment high above all his plans for the accumulation of power and wealth he set before him now a desire which had become the moving impulse of his lifea desire primitive but overmasteringthe desire of a strong man for the woman he loves in london he had scarcely dared admit so much even to himself here in this vast solitude he was more master of himselfdreams which seemed to him the most beautiful and the most daring which he had ever conceived filled his brain and stirred his senses till the blood in his veins seemed flowing to a new and wonderful music those were wonderful moments for him  his pipe was nearly out and a cooler breeze was stealing over the plain after all perhaps an hour or sos sleep would be possible now he stretched himself and yawned cast one more glance across the moonlit plain and then stood suddenly still stiffened into an attitude of breathless interest yonder between two lines of shrubs were moving bodiesmen footsore and weary crawling along with slow painful movements one at least of them was a european and even at that distance trent could tell that they were in grievous straits he felt for his revolver and finding that it was in his belt descended the hill quickly towards them  with every step which he took he could distinguish them more plainly there were five kru boys a native of a tribe which he did not recognise and a european who walked with reeling footsteps and who it was easy to see was on the point of exhaustion soon they saw him and a feeble shout greeted his approach trent was within hailing distance before he recognised the european then with a little exclamation of surprise he saw that it was captain francis  they met face to face in a moment but francis never recognised him his eyes were bloodshot a coarse beard disguised his face and his clothes hung about him in rags evidently he was in a terrible plight when he spoke his voice sounded shrill and cracked  we are starving men he said can you help us  of course we can trent answered quickly this way weve plenty of stores  the little party stumbled eagerly after him in a few moments they were at the camp trent roused his companions packages were hastily undone and a meal prepared scarcely a word was said or a question asked one or two of the kru boys seemed on the verge of insanityfrancis himself was hysterical and faint trent boiled a kettle and made some beeftea himself the first mouthful francis was unable to swallow his throat had swollen and his eyes were hideously bloodshot trent who had seen men before in dire straits fed him from a spoon and forced brandy between his lips certainly at the time he never stopped to consider that he was helping back to life the man who in all the world was most likely to do him ill  better he asked presently  much what luck to find you what are you aftergold  trent shook his head  not at present were planning out the new road from attra to bekwando  francis looked up with surprise  never heard of it he said but theres trouble ahead for you they are dancing the wardance at bekwando and the king has been shut up for three days with the priest and never opened his mouth we were on our way from the interior and relied upon them for food and drink theyve always been friendly but this time we barely escaped with our lives  trents face grew serious this was bad news for him and he was thankful that they had not carried out their first plan and commenced their prospecting at bekwando village  we have a charter he said and if necessary we must fight im glad to be prepared though  a charter francis pulled himself together and looked curiously at the man who was still bending over him  great heavens he exclaimed why you are scarlett trent the man whom i met with poor villiers in bekwando years ago  trent nodded  we waited for you he said to witness our concession i thought that you would remember  i thought francis said slowly that there was something familiar about you i remember it all now you were gambling with poor old monty for his daughters picture against a bottle of brandy  trent winced a little  you have an excellent memory he said drily  francis raised himself a little and a fiercer note crept into his tone  it is coming back to me he said i remember more about you now scarlett trent you are the man who left his partner to die in a jungle that you might rob him of his share in the concession oh yes you see my memory is coming back i have an account against you my man  its a lie said trent passionately when i left him i honestly believed him to be a dead man   how many people will believe that francis scoffed i shall take monty with me to england i have finished with this country for awhileand thenand then  he was exhausted and sank back speechless trent sat and watched him smoking in thoughtful silence they two were a little apart from the others and francis was fainting a hand upon his throata drop from that phial in the medicinechestand his faint would carry him into eternity and still trent sat and smoked    chapter xxvi   it was trent himself who kept watch through that last long hour of moonlit darkness till the wan morning broke with its faint grey streaks came the savages of bekwando crawling up in a semicircle through the long rough grass then suddenly at a signal bounding upright with spears poised in their handsan ugly sight in the dim dawn for men chilled with the moist damp air and only halfawake but trent had not been caught napping his stealthy call to arms had aroused them in time at least to crawl behind some shelter and grip their rifles the warcry of the savages was met with a deathlike quietthere were no signs of confusion nor terror a kru boy who called out with fright was felled to the ground by trent with a blow which would have staggered an ox with their rifles in hand and every man stretched flat upon the ground trents little party lay waiting barely a hundred yards separated them yet there was no sign of life from the camp the long line of savages advanced a few steps more their spears poised above their heads their halfnaked forms showing more distinctly as they peered forward through the grey gloom savage and ferocious the white men were surely sleeping still they were as near now as they could get there was a signal and then a wild chorus of yells they threw aside all disguise and darted forward the still morning air hideous with their cry of battle then with an awful suddenness their cry became the cry of death for out from the bushes belched a yellow line of fire as the rifles of trent and his men rang out their welcome a dozen at least of the men of bekwando looked never again upon the faces of their wives the rest hesitated trent in whom was the love of fighting made then his first mistake he called for a sally and rushed out revolver in hand upon the broken line half the blacks ran away like rabbits the remainder greatly outnumbering trent and his party stood firm in a moment it was handtohand fighting and trent was cursing already the bravado which had brought him out to the open  for a while it was a doubtful combat then with a shout of triumph the chief a swarthy thickset man of herculean strength recognised francis and sprang upon him the blow which he aimed would most surely have killed him but that trent with the buttend of a rifle broke its force a little then turning round he blew out the mans brains as francis sank backwards a dismal yell from his followers was the chiefs requiem then they turned and fled followed by a storm of bullets as trents men found time to reload more than one leaped into the air and fell forward upon their faces the fight was over and when they came to look round francis was the only man who had suffered  morning had dawned even whilst they had been fighting little wreaths of mist were curling upwards and the sun shone down with a cloudless golden light every moment more clear as the vapours melted away francis was lying upon his face groaning heavily the kru boys to whom he was well known were gathered in a little circle around him trent brushed them on one side and made a brief examination then he had him carried carefully into one of the tents while he went for his medicinechest  preparations for a start were made but trent was thoughtful for the second time within a few hours this man in whose power it was to ruin him lay at his mercy that he had saved his life went for nothing in the heat of battle there had been no time for thought or calculation trent had simply obeyed the generous instinct of a brave man whose blood was warm with the joy of fighting now it was different trent was seldom sentimental but from the first he had had an uneasy presentiment concerning this man who lay now within his power and so near to death a mutual antipathy seemed to have been born between them from the first moment when they had met in the village of bekwando as though it were yesterday he remembered that leavetaking and franciss threatening words trent had always felt that the man was his enemycertainly the power to do him incalculable harm if not to altogether ruin him was his now and he would not hesitate about it trent knew that although broadly speaking he was innocent of any desire to harm or desert monty no power on earth would ever convince francis of that appearances were and always must be overwhelmingly against him without interference from any one he had already formulated plans for quietly putting monty in his rightful position and making over to him his share in the bekwando syndicate but to arrange this without catastrophe would need skill and tact interference from any outside source would be fatal and francis meant to interferenothing would stop him trent walked backwards and forwards with knitted brows glancing every now and then at the unconscious man francis would certainly interfere if he were allowed to recover    chapter xxvii   a fortnight afterwards trent rode into attra pale gaunt and holloweyed the whole history of those days would never be known by another man upon trent they had left their mark for ever every hour of his time in this country he reckoned of great valueyet he had devoted fourteen days to saving the life of john francis such days tooand such nights they had carried him sometimes in a dead stupor sometimes a raving madman along a wild bushtrack across rivers and swamps into the town of garba where years ago a congo trader who had made a fortune had built a little whitewashed hospital he was safe now but surely never a man before had walked so near the valley of the shadow of death a single moments vigilance relaxed a blanket displaced a dose of brandy forgotten and trent might have walked this life a multimillionaire a peer a little god amongst his fellows freed for ever from all anxiety but francis was tended as never a man was tended before trent himself had done his share of the carrying ever keeping his eyes fixed upon the deathlit face of their burden every ready to fight off the progress of the fever and ague as the twitching lips or shivering limbs gave warning of a change for fourteen days he had not slept until they had reached garba his clothes had never been changed since they had started upon their perilous journey as he rode into attra he reeled a little in his saddle and he walked into the office of the agent more like a ghost than a man  two men cathcart and his assistant who was only a boy were lounging in low chairs as he entered they looked up exchanging quick startled glances then cathcart gave vent to a little exclamation  great heavens trent what have you been doing trent sank into a chair get me some wine he said i am all right but overtired  cathcart poured champagne into a tumbler trent emptied it at a gulp and asked for biscuits the mans recuperative powers were wonderful already the deathly whiteness was passing from his cheeks  where is da souza he asked  gone back to england cathcart answered looking out of the open casement shaded from the sun by the sloping roof his steamer started yesterday  trent was puzzled he scarcely understood this move  did he give any reason  cathcart smoked for a moment in silence after all though a disclosure would be unpleasant it was inevitable and as well now as any time i think cathcart said that he has gone to try and sell his shares in the bekwando concessions  gonetosellhisshares trent repeated slowly you mean to say that he has gone straight from here to put a hundred thousand bekwando shares upon the market  cathcart nodded  he said so  and why did he tell you that  he has come to the conclusion cathcart said that the scheme is impracticable altogether and the concessions worthless he is going to get what he can for his shares while he has the chance  trent drained his tumbler and lit a cigar so much for da souza he said and now i should like to know mr stanley cathcart what the devil you and your assistant are doing shacking here in the cool of the day when you are the servants of the bekwando company and theres work to be done of the utmost importance the whole place seems to be asleep wheres your labour theres not a soul at work we planned exactly when to start the road what the mischief do you mean by wasting a fortnight  cathcart coughed and was obviously illatease but he answered with some show of dignity  i have come to the conclusion mr trent that the making of the road is impracticable and useless there is insufficient labour and poor tools no satisfactory method of draining the swampy country and further i dont think any one would work with the constant fear of an attack from those savages  so thats your opinion is it trent said grimly  that is my opinion cathcart answered i have embodied it in a report which i despatched to the secretary of the company by mr da souza  trent rose and opened the door which swung into the little room  out you go he said fiercely  cathcart looked at him in blank astonishment  what do you mean he exclaimed these are my quarters  theyre nothing of the sort trent answered they are the headquarters in this country of the bekwando company with which you have nothing to do out you go  dont talk rubbish cathcart said angrily im the authorised and properly appointed surveyor here  youre a liar trent answered youve no connection at all with the company youre dismissed sir for incompetence and cowardice and if youre not off the premises in three minutes itll be the worse for you  youyouhavent the power to do this cathcart stuttered  trent laughed  well see about that he said i never had much faith in you sir and i guess you only got the job by a rig but out you go now sharp if theres anything owing you you can claim it in london  there are all my clothes cathcart began  trent laid his hands upon his shoulders and threw him softly outside  ill send your clothes to the hotel he said take my advice young man and keep out of my sight till you can find a steamer to take you where theyll pay you for doing nothing youre the sort of man who irritates me and its a nasty climate for getting angry in  cathcart picked himself up well i should like to know whos going to make your road he said spitefully  ill make it myself trent roared dont you think a little thing like some stupid laws of science will stand in my way or the way of a man who knows his own mind i tell you ill level that road from the tree there which we marked as the startingpoint to the very centre of bekwando  he slammed the door and reentered the room the boy was there sitting upon the office stool hard at work with a pair of compasses  what the devil are you doing there trent asked out you go with your master  the boy looked up he had a fair smooth face but lips like trents own  im just thinking about that first bend by kurru corner sir he said im not sure about the level  trents face relaxed he held out his hand  my boy he said ill make your fortune as sure as my name is scarlett trent  well make that road anyway the boy answered with a smile                                                     after a rest trent climbed the hill to the basle mission house there was no sign of monty on the potato patch and the woman who opened the door started when she saw him  how is he trent asked quickly  the woman looked at him in wonder  why hes gone sirgone with the jewish gentleman who said that you had sent him  where to trent asked quickly  why to england in the ophir the woman answered  then trent began to feel that after all the struggle of his life was only beginning    chapter xxviii   it was then perhaps that trent fought the hardest battle of his life the start was made with only a dozen kru boys trent himself stripped to the shirt labouring amongst them spade in hand in a week the fishing boats were deserted every one was working on the road the labour was immense but the wages were magnificent real progress was made and the boys calculations were faultless trent used the cable freely  have dismissed cathcart for incompetenceroad startedprogress magnificent he wired one week and shortly afterwards a message came backcathcart cables resignedscheme impossibleshares droppingwire reply  trent clenched his fist and his language made the boy who had never heard him violent look up in surprise then he put on his coat and walked out to the cable station  cathcart lies i dismissed him for cowardice and incompetence the road is being made and i pledge my word that it will be finished in six months let our friends sell no shares  then trent went back and hard as he had worked before he surpassed it all now far and wide he sent ever with the same inquiryfor labour and stores he spent money like water but he spent from a bottomless purse day after day kru boys natives and europeans down on their luck came creeping in far away across the rolling plain the straight belt of flintlaid roadbed stretched to the horizon one gang in advance cutting turf another beating in the small stones the boy grew thin and bronzed trent and he toiled as though their lives hung upon the work so they went on till the foremost gang came close to the forests beyond which lay the village of bekwando  then began the period of the greatest anxiety for trent and the boy and a handful of the others knew what would have sent half of the natives flying from their work if a whisper had got abroad a few soldiers were drafted down from the fort arms were given out to all those who could be trusted to use them and by night men watched by the great red fires which flared along the path of their labours trent and the boy took it by turns to watch their revolvers loaded by their side and their eyes ever turned towards that dark line of forest whence came nothing but the singing of night birds and the calling of wild animals yet trent would have no caution relaxed the more they progressed the more vigilant the watch they kept at last came signs of the men of bekwando in the small hours of the morning a burning spear came hurtling through the darkness and fell with a hiss and a quiver in the ground only a few feet from where trent and the boy lay trent stamped on it hastily and gave no alarm but the boy stole round with a whispered warning to those who could be trusted to fight  yet no attack came on that night or the next on the third trent and the boy sat talking and the latter frankly owned that he was nervous  its not that im afraid he said smiling you know it isnt that but all day long ive had the same feelingwere being watched im perfectly certain that the beggars are skulking round the borders of the forest there before morning we shall hear from them  if they mean to fight trent said the sooner they come out the better id send a messenger to the king only im afraid theyd kill him oom sam wont come ive sent for him twice  the boy was looking backwards and forwards along the long line of disembowelled earth  trent he said suddenly youre a wonderful man honestly this road is a marvellous feat for untrained labour and with such rotten odds and ends of machinery i dont know what experience youd had of roadmaking  none trent interjected  then its wonderful  trent smiled upon the boy with such a smile as few people had ever seen upon his lips  theres a bit of credit to you davenant he said id never have been able to figure out the levelling alone whether i go down or not this shall be a good step up on the ladder for you  the boy laughed  ive enjoyed it more than anything else in my life he said fancy the difference between this and life in a london office its been magnificent i never dreamed what life was like before  trent looked thoughtfully into the red embers you had the mail today the boy continued how were things in london  not so bad trent answered cathcart has been doing all the harm he can but it hasnt made a lot of difference my cables have been published and our letters will be in print by now and the photographs you took of the work that was a splendid idea  and the shares  down a bitnot much da souza seems to be selling out carefully a few at a time and my brokers are buying most of them pound shares are nineteen shillings today theyll be between three and four pounds a week after i get back  and when shall you go the boy asked  directly i get a man out here i can trust and things are fixed with his majesty the king of bekwando well both go then and you shall spend a week or two with me in london  the boy laughed  what a time well have he cried say do you know your way round  trent shook his head  im afraid not he said youll have to be my guide  right you are was the cheerful answer ill take you to jimmys and the empire and down the river and to a match at lords and to henley if were in time and ill take you to see my aunt youll like her  trent nodded  ill expect to he said is she anything like you  much cleverer the boy said but weve been great chums all our life shes the cleverest woman ever knew earns lots of money writing for newspapers  here youve dropped your cigar trent  trent groped for it on the ground with shaking fingers  writes for newspapers he repeated slowly i wonderher name isnt davenant is it  the boy shook his head  no shes my mothers cousin reallyonly i call her aunty we always got on so she isnt really much older than me her name is wendermotternestine wendermott ernestines a pretty name dont you think  trent rose to his feet muttering something about a sound in the forest he stood with his back to the boy looking steadily at the dark line of outlying scrub seeing in reality nothing yet keenly anxious that the red light of the dancing flames should not fall upon his face the boy leaned on his elbow and looked in the same direction he was puzzled by a fugitive something which he had seen in trents face  afterwards trent liked sometimes to think that it was the sound of her name which had saved them all for whereas his gaze had been idle at first it became suddenly fixed and keen he stooped down and whispered something to the boy the word was passed along the line of sleeping men and one by one they dropped back into the deepcut trench the red fire danced and crackledonly a few yards outside the flamelit space came the dark forms of men creeping through the rough grass like snakes    chapter xxix  the attack was a fiasco the fighting was all over in ten minutes a hundred years ago the men of bekwando who went naked and knew no drink more subtle than palm wine had one virtuebravery but civilisation pressing upon their frontiers had brought oom sam greedy for ivory and gold and oom sam had bought rum and strong waters the nerve of the savage had gone and his muscle had become a flaccid thing when they had risen from the long grass with a horrid yell and had rushed in upon the hated intruders with couched spears only to be met by a blinding fire of leemetford and revolver bullets their bravery vanished like breath from the face of a lookingglass they hesitated and a rain of bullets wrought terrible havoc amongst their ranks on every side the fightingmen of bekwando went down like ninepinsabout half a dozen only sprang forward for a handtohand fight the remainder with shrieks of despair fled back to the shelter of the forest and not one of them again ever showed a bold front to the white man trent for a moment or two was busy for a burly savage who had marked him out by the light of the gleaming flames had sprung upon him spear in hand and behind him came others the first one dodged trents bullet and was upon him when the boy shot him through the cheek and he went rolling over into the fire with a deathcry which rang through the camp high above the din of fighting another behind him trent shot himself but the third was upon him before he could draw his revolver and the two rolled over struggling fiercely at too close quarters for weapons yet with the thirst for blood fiercely kindled in both of them for a moment trent had the worst of ita blow fell upon his forehead the scar of which he never lost and the wooden club was brandished in the air for a second and more deadly stroke but at that moment trent leaped up dashed his unloaded revolver full in the mans face and while he staggered with the shock a soldier from behind shot him through the heart trent saw him go staggering backwards and then himself sank down giddy with the blow he had received afterwards he knew that he must have fainted for when he opened his eyes the sun was up and the men were strolling about looking at the dead savages who lay thick in the grass trent sat up and called for water  any one hurt he asked the boy who brought him some the boy grinned but shook his head  plenty savages killed he said no white man or kru boy  wheres mr davenant trent asked suddenly  the boy looked round and shook his head  no seen mr davnant he said him fight well though him not hurt  trent stood up with a sickening fear at his heart he knew very well that if the boy was about and unhurt he would have been at his side up and down the camp he strode in vain at last one of the kru boys thought he remembered seeing a great savage bounding away with some one on his back he had thought that it was one of their woundedit might have been the boy trent with a sickening sense of horror realised the truth the boy had been taken prisoner  even then he preserved his selfcontrol to a marvellous degree first of all he gave directions for the days workthen he called for volunteers to accompany him to the village there was no great enthusiasm to fight in trenches against a foe who had no cover nor any firearms was rather a different thing from bearding them in their own lair nevertheless about twenty men came forward including a guide and trent was satisfied  they started directly after breakfast and for five hours fought their way through dense undergrowth and shrubs with never a sign of a path though here and there were footsteps and broken boughs by noon some of the party were exhausted and lagged behind an hour later a long line of exhausted stragglers were following trent and the native guide yet to all their petitions for a rest trent was adamant every minutes delay might lessen the chance of saving the boy even now they might have begun their horrible tortures the thought inspired him with fresh vigour he plunged on with long reckless strides which soon placed a widening gap between him and the rest of the party  by degrees he began to recollect his whereabouts the way grew less difficultoccasionally there were signs of a path every moment the soft damp heat grew more intense and clammy every time he touched his forehead he found it dripping but of these things he recked very little for every step now brought him nearer to the end of his journey faintly through the midday silence he could hear the clanging of copper instruments and the weird mourning cry of the defeated natives a few more steps and he was almost within sight of them he slackened his pace and approached more stealthily until only a little screen of bushes separated him from the village and peering through them he saw a sight which made his blood run cold within him  they had the boy he was there in that fantastic circle bound hand and foot but so far as he could see at present unhurt his face was turned to trent white and a little scared but his lips were closeset and he uttered no sound by his side stood a man with a native knife dancing around and singingall through the place were sounds of wailing and lamentation and in front of his hut the king was lying with an empty bottle by his side drunk and motionless trents anger grew fiercer as he watched was this a people to stand in his way to claim the protection and sympathy of foreign governments against their own bond that they might keep their land for misuse and their bodies for debauchery he looked backwards and listened as yet there was no sign of any of his followers and there was no telling how long these antics were to continue trent looked to his revolver and set his teeth there must be no risk of evil happening to the boy he walked boldly out into the little space and called to them in a loud voice  there was a wild chorus of fear the women fled to the hutsthe men ran like rats to shelter but the executioner of bekwando who was a fetish man and holy stood his ground and pointed his knife at trent two others seeing him firm also remained the moment was critical  cut those bonds trent ordered pointing to the boy  the fetish man waved his hands and drew a step nearer to trent his knife outstretched the other two backed him up already a spear was couched  trents revolver flashed out in the sunlight  cut that cord he ordered again  the fetish man poised his knife trent hesitated no longer but shot him deliberately through the heart he jumped into the air and fell forward upon his face with a deathcry which seemed to find an echo from every hut and from behind every tree of bekwando it was like the knell of their last hope for had he not told them that he was fetish that his body was proof against those wicked fires and that if the white men came he himself would slay them and now he was dead the last barrier of their superstitious hope was broken down even the drunken king sat up and made strange noises  trent stooped down and picking up the knife cut the bonds which had bound the boy he staggered up to his feet with a weak little laugh  i knew youd find me he said did i look awfully frightened  trent patted him on the shoulder if i hadnt been in time he said id have shot every man here and burned their huts over their heads pick up the knife old chap quick i think those fellows mean mischief  the two warriors who had stood by the priest were approaching but when they came within a few yards of trents revolver they dropped on their knees it was their token of submission trent nodded and a moment afterwards the reason for their nonresistance was made evident the remainder of the expedition came filing into the little enclosure  trent lit a cigar and sat down on a block of wood to consider what further was best to be done in the meantime the natives were bringing yams to the white men with timid gestures after a brief rest trent called them to follow him he walked across to the dwelling of the fetish man and tore down the curtain of dried grass which hung before the opening even then it was so dark inside that they had to light a torch before they could see the walls and the stench was horrible  a little chorus of murmurs escaped the lips of the europeans as the interior became revealed to them opposite the door was a lifesize and hideous effigy of a grinning god made of wood and painted in many colours by its side were other more horrible images and a row of human skulls hung from the roof the hand of a white man blackened with age was stuck to the wall by a spearhead the stench and filth of the whole place were pestilential yet outside a number of women and several of the men were on their knees hoping still against hope for aid from their ancient gods there was a cry of horror when trent unceremoniously kicked over the nearest idola yell of panic when the boy with a gleam of mischief in his eyes threw out amongst them a wormeaten hideous effigy and with a hearty kick stove in its hollow side it lay there bald and ugly in the streaming sunshine a block of misshapen wood illpainted in flaring daubs the thing which they had worshipped in gloom and secret they and a generation before themall the mystery of its shrouded existence the terrible fetish words of the dead priest the reverence which an allpowerful and inherited superstition had kept alive within them came into their minds as they stood there trembling and then fled away to be out of the reach of the empty staring eyesout of reach of the vengeance which must surely fall from the skies upon these white savages so they watched the women beating their bosoms and uttering strange cries the men stolid but scared trent and the boy came out coughing and halfstupefied with the rank odour and a little murmur went up from them it was a device of the godsa sort of madness with which they were afflicted but soon their murmurs turned again into lamentation when they saw what was to come men were running backwards and forwards piling up dried wood and branches against the idolhouse a single spark and the thing was done a tongue of flame leaped up a thick column of smoke stole straight up in the breathless air amazed the people stood and saw the home of dreadful mystery whence came the sentence of life and death the voice of the kingmaker the omens of war and fortune enveloped in flames already a ruined and shapeless mass trent stood and watched it smoking fiercely and felt himself a civiliser but the boy seemed to feel some of the pathos of the moment and he looked curiously at the little crowd of wailing natives  and the people he asked  they are going to help me make my road trent said firmly i am going to teach them to work    chapter xxx   my dear aunt ernieat last i have a chance of sending you a letterand this time at any rate you wont have to complain about my sending you no news ill promise you that before i begin and you neednt get scared either because its all good ive been awfully lucky and all because that fellow cathcart turned out such a funk and a bounder its the oddest thing in the world too that old cis should have written me to pick up all the news i could about scarlett trent and send it to you why hes within a few feet of me at this moment and ive been seeing him continually ever since i came here but there ill try and begin at the beginning  you know cathcart got the post of consulting surveyor and engineer to the bekwando syndicate and he was head man at our london place well they sent me from capetown to be junior to him and a jolly good move for me too i never did see anything in cathcart hes a lazy sort of chap hates work and i guess he only got the job because his uncle had got a lot of shares in the business it seems he never wanted to come hates any place except london which accounts for a good deal  all the time when we were waiting he wasnt a bit keen and kept on rotting about the good times he might have been having in london and what a fearful country we were stranded in till he almost gave me the blues and if there hadnt been some jolly good shooting and a few nice chaps up at the fort i should have been miserable as it was i left him to himself a good deal and he didnt like that either i think attra was a jolly place and the landing in surf boats was no end of fun cathcart got beastly wet and you should have seen what a stew he was in because hed put on a beautiful white suit and it got spoilt well things werent very lively at attra at first im bound to admit no one seemed to know much about the bekwando land company and the country that way was very rough however we got sent out at last and cathcart he simply scoffed at the whole thing from the first there was no proper labour not half enough machinery and none of the right sortand the gradients and country between bekwando and the sea were awful cathcart made a few reports and we did nothing but kick our heels about until he came youll see ive written that in big letters and i tell you if ever a man deserved to have his name written in capitals scarlett trent does and the oddest part of it is he knows you and he was awfully decent to me all the time  well out he went prospecting before hed been in the country twentyfour hours and he came back quite cheerful then he spoke to cathcart about starting work and cathcart was a perfect beast he as good as told him that hed come out under false pretences that the whole affair was a swindle and that the road could not be made trent didnt hesitate i can tell you there were no arguments or promises with him he chucked cathcart on the spot turned him out of the place and swore hed make the road himself i asked if i might stop and i think he was glad anyhow weve been ever such pals ever since and i never expect to have such a time again as long as i live but do you know auntie weve about made that road when i see what weve done sometimes i cant believe it i only wish some of the bigwigs whove never been out of an office could see it i know ill hate to come away  youd never believe the time we hadleaving out the fighting which i am coming to by and by we were beastly short of all sorts of machinery and our labour was awful we had scarcely any at first but trent found em somehow kru boys and native zulus and brokendown europeansany one who could hold a pick more came every day and we simply cut our way through the country i think i was pretty useful for you see i was the only chap there who knew even a bit about engineering or practical surveying and id sit up all night lots of times working the thing out we had a missionary came over the first sunday and wanted to preach but trent stopped him weve got to work here he said and sunday or no sunday i cant let my men stop to listen to you in the cool of the day if you want to preach come and take a pick now and preach when theyre resting and he did and worked well too and afterwards when we had to knock off he preached and trent took the chair and made em all listen well when we got a bit inland we had the natives to deal with and if you ask me i believe thats one reason cathcart hated the whole thing so hes a beastly coward i think and he told me once hed never let off a revolver in his life well they tried to surprise us one night but trent was up himself watching and i tell you we did give em beans great uglylooking black chaps they were aunt ernie i shall never forget how i felt when i saw them come creeping through the long rough grass with their beastly spears all poised ready to throw and now for my own special adventure wont you shiver when you read this i was taken prisoner by one of those chaps carried off to their beastly village and very nearly murdered by a chap who seemed to be a cross between an executioner and a highpriest and who kept dancing round me singing a lot of rot and pointing a knife at me you see i was right on the outside of the fighting and i got a knock on the head with the buttend of a spear and was a bit silly for a moment and a great chap whod seen me near trent and guessed i was somebody picked me up as though id been a baby and carried me off of course i kicked up no end of a row as soon as i came to but what with the firing and the screeching no one heard me and trent said it was half an hour before he missed me and an hour before they started in pursuit anyhow there i was about morningtime when you were thinking of having your cup of tea trussed up like a fowl in the middle of the village and all the natives beastly creatures promenading round me and making faces and bawling out thingsoh it was beastly i can tell you then just as they seemed to have made up their mind to kill me up strode scarlett trent alone if you please and he walked up to the whole lot of em as bold as brass hed got a long way ahead of the rest and thought they meant mischief so he wouldnt wait for the others but faced a hundred of them with a revolver in his hand and i can tell you things were lively then id never be able to describe the next few minutesone man trent knocked down with his fist and you could hear his skull crack then he shot the chap who had been threatening me and cut my bonds and then they tried to resist us and i thought it was all over they were horribly afraid of trent though and while they were closing round us the others came up and the natives chucked it at once they used to be a very brave race but since they were able to get rum for their timber and ivory theyre a lazy and drunken lot well i must tell you what trent did then he went to the priests house where the gods were keptsuch a beastly holeand he burned the place before the eyes of all the natives i believe they thought every moment that we should be struck dead and they stood round in a ring making an awful row but they never dared interfere he burnt the place to the ground and then what do you think he did from the king downward he made every jack one of them come and work on his road youll never believe it but its perfectly true they looked upon him as their conqueror and they came like lambs when he ordered it they think theyre slaves you know and dont understand their pay but they get it every week and same as all the other labourersand oh aunt ernie you should see the king work with a pickaxe he is fat and so clumsy and so furiously angry but hes too scared of trent to do anything but obey orders and there he works hour after hour groaning and the perspiration rolls off him as though he were in a turkish bath i could go on telling you odd things that happen here for hours but i must finish soon as the chap is starting with the mail i am enjoying it it is something like life i can tell you and arent i lucky trent made me take cathcarts place i am getting 800 pounds a year and only fancy it he says hell see that the directors make me a special grant everything looks very different here now and i do hope the company will be a success theres whole heaps of mining machinery landed and waiting for the road to be finished to go up and people seem to be streaming into the place i wonder what cathcart will say when he knows that the road is as good as done and that ive got his job  chap called for mail goodbye  ever your affectionate  fred  trent is a brick  ernestine read the letter slowly line by line word by word to tell the truth it was absorbingly interesting to her already there had come rumours of the daring and blunt resistless force with which this newmade millionaire had confronted a gigantic task his terse communications had found their way into the press and in them and in the boys letter she seemed to discover something caesaric that night it was more than usually difficult for her to settle down to her own work she read her nephews letter more than once and continually she found her thoughts slipping awaytraveling across the ocean to a tropical strip of country where a heterogeneous crowd of men were toiling and digging under a blazing sun and continually too she seemed to see a mans face looking steadily over the sea to her as he stood upright for a moment and rested from his toil she was very fond of the boybut the face was not his    chapter xxxi   a special train from southampton had just steamed into waterloo with the passengers from the royal mail steamer ophir little groups of sunburnt men were greeting old friends upon the platform surrounded by piles of luggage canvas trunks and steamer chairs the demand for hansoms was brisk cab after cab heavily loaded was rolling out of the yard there were grizzled men and men of fair complexion men in white helmets and puggarees and men in silk hats all sorts were represented there from the successful diamond digger who was spasmodically embracing a lady in black jet of distinctly jewish proclivities to a sporting lord who had been killing lions for a few minutes the platforms were given over altogether to a sort of pleasurable confusion a vivid scene full of colour and human interest then the people thinned away and very nearly last of all a wizenedlooking greyheaded man carrying a black bag and a parcel left the platform with hesitating footsteps and turned towards the bridge he was followed almost immediately by hiram da souza who curiously enough seemed to have been on the platform when the train came in and to have been much interested in this shabby lonely old man who carried himself like a waif stranded in an unknown land da souza was gorgeous in frock coat and silk hat a carnation in his buttonhole a diamond in his black satin tie yet he was not altogether happy this little man hobbling along in front represented fate to him on the platform at waterloo he had heard him timidly ask a bystander the way to the offices of the bekwando land and gold exploration company limited if ever he got there what would be the price of bekwando shares on the morrow  on the bridge da souza saw him accost a policeman and brushing close by heard him ask the same question the man shook his head but pointed eastwards  i cant say exactly sir but somewhere in the city for certain he answered i should make for the bank of england a penny bus along that way will take youand ask again there  the old man nodded his thanks and stepped along da souza felt that his time had come he accosted him with an urbane smile  excuse me he said but i think i heard you ask for the offices of the bekwando land company  the old man looked up eagerly if you can direct me there sir he said i shall be greatly obliged  i can do so da souza said falling into step and will with pleasure i am going that way myself i hope he continued in a tone of kindly concern that you are not a shareholder in the company  the old man dropped his bag with a clatter upon the pavement and his lips moved for a moment without any speech coming from them da souza picked up the bag and devoutly hoped that none of his city friends were in the way  i dont exactly know about being a shareholder the old man said nervously but ive certainly something to do with it i am or should have been joint vendor the company is wealthy is it not  da souza changed the bag into his other hand and thrust his arm through his companions  you havent seen the papers lately have you  no ive just landedtodayfrom africa  then im sorry to say theres some bad news for you da souza said the bekwando land and gold company has gone into liquidationsmashed up altogether they say that all the directors and the vendor will be arrested it seems to have been a gigantic swindle  monty had become a dead weight upon his arm they were in the strand now and he pushed open the swingdoor of a publichouse and made his way into the private bar when monty opened his eyes he was on a cushioned seat and before him was a tumbler of brandy half empty he stared round him wildly his lips were moist and the old craving was hot upon him what did it mean after all he had broken his vow then had he not sworn to touch nothing until he had found his little girl and his fortune yet the fire of spirits was in his veins and the craving was tearing him to pieces then he remembered there was no fortune no little girl his dreams were all shattered the last effort of his life had been in vain he caught hold of the tumbler with fingers that shook as though an ague were upon him lifted it to his lips and drank then there came the old blankness and he saw nothing but what seemed to him the face of a satyrdark and evilmocking him through the shadows which had surely fallen now for ever da souza lifted him up and conveyed him carefully to a fourwheel cab                                                     an hour afterwards da souza with a grin of content upon his unshapely mouth exchanged his frock coat for a gaudy smokingjacket and with a freshlylit cigar in his mouth took up the letters which had arrived by the evening post seeing amongst them one with an african stamp he tore it open hastily and read  my dear hiramyou was in luck now or never if you really want to stop that halfwitted creature from doing mischief in london i sometimes think my brother that you would do better to give me even more of your confidence you are a very clever man but you do keep yourself so secret if i too were not clever how would i know to send you this news how would i know that it will make you glad but there you will go your way i know it  now for the news monty as i cabled i send the bill has gone secretly to london since scarlett trent found our hausa friend and the rum flask there have been no means of getting liquor to him so i suppose he has very near regained his senses anyhow he shipped off very cunning not even missionary walsh knowing but he made a very big mistake the news of which i send to you knowing it will be good hiram he stole the money to pay for his passage from the missionarys cashbox all one day he stood under a tree looking out to sea and a steamer from capetown called and when he heard the whistle and saw the surf boats he seemed to wake up he walked up and down restlessly for a long time muttering to himself mrs walsh came out to him and he was still staring at the steamer she told him to come in out of the sun which was very hot but he shook his head shes calling me he kept on saying calling me she heard him in the room where the money was and then saw no more of him but others saw him running to the shore and he paid to be taken out to the steamer they wouldnt take him on at first because he hadnt secured a passage but he laid down and wouldnt move so as he had the money they took him and when i heard i cabled to you but what harm can he do for you are his master he is a thief and you know it surely you can do with him what you will  trent was here yesterday and heard for the first time of his flight how he took it i cannot tell you for i was not the one to tell him but this i know for a fact he cabled to capetown offering 100 pounds if the star line steamer leaving tomorrow would call for him here hiram he is a great man this trent i hate him for he has spoilt much trade for me and he treats me as though i were the dirt under his feet but never a man before who has set foot upon the coast could have done what he has done without soldiers he has beaten the bekwando natives and made them even work for him he has stirred the whole place here into a state of fever a thousand men are working upon his road and sinking shafts upon the bekwando hills gold is already coming down nuggets of it and he is opening a depot to buy all the mahogany and ivory in the country he spends money like water he never rests what he says must be done is done the authorities are afraid of him but day by day they become more civil the agent here called him once an adventurer and threatened him with arrest for his fighting with the bekwandos now they go to him cap in hand for they know that he will be a great power in this country and hiram my brother you have not given me your trust though i speak to you so openly but here is the advice of a brother for blood is blood and i would have you make monies dont you put yourself against trent be on his side for his is the winning side i dont know what you got in your head about that poor scarecrow monty but i tell you hiram trent is the man to back right through he has the knack of success and he is a genius my hes a great man and hes a king out here you be on his side hiram and youre all right  now goodbye but send me the money for the cable when you write and remembermonty is a thief and trent is the man to back which reminds me that trent repaid to missionary walsh all the money which monty took which it seems was left with walsh by him for montys keep but monty does not know that so you have the string to make him dance  which comes from your brother  samuel  psdo not forget the small account for disbursements   da souza folded up the letter and a look of peace shone in his face presently he climbed the stairs to a little backroom and noiselessly unlocked the door monty with pale face and bloodshot eyes was walking up and down mumbling to himself he addressed da souza eagerly  i think i will go away now he said i am very much obliged to you for looking after me  da souza gazed at him with wellaffected gravity one moment first he said didnt i understand you that you had just come from africa  monty nodded  the gold coast  monty nodded again but with less confidence  by any chancewere you called monty there  monty turned ghastly pale surely his last sin had not found him out he was silent but there was no need for speech da souza motioned him to sit down  i am very sorry he said of course its true the police have been here  the police monty moaned  da souza nodded benevolence was so rare a part for him to play that he rather enjoyed it  dont be scared he said yes your description is out and you are wanted for stealing a few pounds from a man named walsh never mind i wont give you up you shall lie snug here for a few days  monty fell on his knees you wont let any one know that i am here he pleaded  not i da souza answered fervently  monty rose to his feet his face full of dumb misery  now he muttered i shall never see hernevernevernever  there was a bottle half full of spirits upon the table and a tumbler as yet unused a gleam flashed in his eyes he filled the tumbler and raised it to his lips da souza watched him curiously with the benevolent smile still upon his face    chapter xxxii   you are very smart ernestine he said looking her admiringly  one must be smart at ascot she answered or stay away  ive just heard some news he continued  yes  who do you think is here  she glanced at him sideways under her lace parasol every one i should think  including he said mr scarlett trent she grew a shade paler and leaned for a moment against the rail of the paddock in which they were lounging  i thought she said that the mazetta castle was not due till today  she touched at plymouth in the night and he had a special train up he has some horses running you know  i suppose she remarked that he is more of a celebrity than ever now  much more he answered if he chooses he will be the lion of the season by the by you had nothing of interest from fred  she shook her head impatiently  nothing but praises according to fred hes a hero  i hate him davenant said sulkily  and so she answered softly do i do you see him coming cecil  in good company too the young man laughed bitterly  a little group of men before whom every one fell back respectfully were strolling through the paddock towards the horses amongst them was royalty and amongst them also was scarlett trent but when he saw the girl in the white foulard smile at him from the paling he forgot etiquette and everything else he walked straight across to her with that keen bright light in his eyes which fred had described so well in his letter  i am very fortunate he said taking the delicately gloved hand into his fingers to find you so soon i have only been in england a few hours  she answered him slowly subjecting him the while to a somewhat close examination his face was more sunburnt than ever she had seen a mans but there was a wonderful force and strength in his features which seemed to have become refined instead of coarsened by the privations through which he had passed his hand as she had felt was as hard as iron and it was not without reluctance that she felt compelled to take note of his correct attire and easy bearing after all he must be possessed of a wonderful measure of adaptability  you have become famous she said do you know that you are going to be made a lion  i suppose the papers have been talking a lot of rot he answered bluntly ive had a fairly rough time and im glad to tell you this miss wendermotti dont believe id ever have succeeded but for your nephew fred hes the pluckiest boy i ever knew  i am very pleased to hear it she answered hes a dear boy  hes a brick trent answered weve been in some queer scrapes togetherive lots of messages for you by the by are you alone  for the moment she answered mr davenant left me as you came up im with my cousin lady tresham shes on the lawn somewhere  he looked down the paddock and back to her  walk with me a little way he said and i will show you iris before she starts  you she exclaimed  he pointed to the card it was surely an accident that she had not noticed it before mr trents iris was amongst the entries for the gold cup  why iris is the favourite  he nodded  so they tell me ive been rather lucky havent i for a beginner i found a good trainer and i had second call on cannon whos riding him if you care to back him for a trifle i think youll be all right although the odds are nothing to speak of  she was walking by his side now towards the quieter end of the paddock  i hear you have been to torquay he said looking at her critically it seems to have agreed with you you are looking well  she returned his glance with slightly uplifted eyebrows intending to convey by that and her silence a rebuke to his boldness he was blandly unconscious however of her intent being occupied just then in returning the greetings of passersby she bit her lip and looked straight ahead  after all he said unless you are very keen on seeing iris i think wed better give it up there are too many people around her already  just as you like she answered only it seems a shame that you shouldnt look over your own horse before the race if you want to would you like to try alone  certainly not he answered i shall see plenty of her later are you fond of horses  very  go to many racemeetings  whenever i get the chancei always come here  it is a great sight he said thoughtfully looking around him are you here just for the pleasure of it or are you going to write about it  she laughed  im going to write about some of the dresses she said im afraid no one would read my racing notes  i hope youll mention your own he said coolly its quite the prettiest here  she scarcely knew whether to be amused or offended  you are a very downright person mr trent she said  you dont expect me to have acquired manners yet do you he answered drily  you have acquired a great many things she said with surprising facility why not manners  he shrugged his shoulders  no doubt they will come but i shall want a lot of polishing i wonder  well  whether any one will ever think it worth while to undertake the task  she raised her eyes and looked him full in the face she had made up her mind exactly what to expressand she failed altogether to do it there was a fire and a strength in the clear grey eyes fixed so earnestly upon hers which disconcerted her altogether she was desperately angry with herself and desperately uneasy  you have the power she said with slight coldness to buy most things by the by i was thinking only just now how sad it was that your partner did not live he shared the work with you didnt he it seems such hard lines that he could not have shared the reward  he showed no sign of emotion such as she had expected and for which she had been narrowly watching him only he grew at once more serious and he led her a little further still from the crush of people it was the luncheon interval and though the next race was the most important of the day the stream of promenaders had thinned off a little  it is strange he said that you should have spoken to me of my partner i have been thinking about him a good deal lately  in what way  well first of all i am not sure that our agreement was altogether a fair one he said he had a daughter and i am very anxious to find her i feel that she is entitled to a certain number of shares in the company and i want her to accept them  have you tried to find her she asked  he looked steadily at her for a moment but her parasol had dropped a little upon his side and he could not see her face  yes i have tried he said slowly and i have suffered a great disappointment she knows quite well that i am searching for her and she prefers to remain undiscovered  that sounds strange she remarked with her eyes fixed upon the distant surrey hills do you know her reason  i am afraid he said deliberately that there can be only one its a miserable thing to believe of any woman and id be glad  he hesitated she kept her eyes turned away from him but her manner denoted impatience  over on this side he continued it seems that monty was a gentleman in his day and his people werewell of your order there was an earl i believe in the family and no doubt they are highly respectable he went wrong once and of course they never gave him another chance it isnt their waythat sort of people ill admit he was pretty low down when i came across him but i reckon that was the fault of those who sent him adriftand after all there was good in him even then i am going to tell you something now miss wendermott which ive often wanted tothat is if youre interested enough to care to hear it  all the time she was asking herself how much he knew she motioned him to proceed  monty had few things left in the world worth possessing but there was one which he had never parted with which he carried with him always it was the picture of his little girl as she had been when his trouble happened  he stooped a little as though to see over the white rails but she was too adroit her face remained hidden from him by that little cloud of white lace  it is an odd thing about that picture he went on slowly but he showed it to me once or twice and i too got very fond of it it was just a little girls face very bright and very winsome and over there we were lonely and it got to mean a good deal to both of us and one night monty would gambleit was one of his faults poor chapand he had nothing left but his picture and i played him for itand won  brute she murmured in an odd choked tone  sounds so doesnt it but i wanted that picture afterwards came our terrible journey back to the coast when i carried the poor old chap on my back day by day and stood over him at night potting those black beasts when they crept up too closefor they were on our track all the time i wouldnt tell you the whole story of those days miss wendermott for it would keep you awake at night but ive a fancy for telling you this id like you to believe it for its gospel truth i didnt leave him until i felt absolutely and actually certain that he couldnt live an hour he was passing into unconsciousness and a crowd of those natives were close upon our heels so i left him and took the picture with meand i think since then that it has meant almost as much to me as ever it had been to him  that she remarked sounds a little farfetchednot to say impossible  some day he answered boldly i shall speak to you of this again and i shall try to convince you that it is truth  he could not see her face but he knew very well in some occult manner that she had parted with some at least of her usual composure as a matter of fact she was nervous and illatease  you have not yet told me she said abruptly what you imagine can be this girls reasons for remaining unknown  i can only guess them he said gravely i can only suppose that she is ashamed of her father and declines to meet any one connected with him it is very wrong and very narrow of her if i could talk to her for ten minutes and tell her how the poor old chap used to dream about her and kiss her picture i cant think but shed be sorry  try and think she said looking still away from him that she must have another reason you say that you liked her picture try and be generous in your thoughts of her for its sake  i will try he answered especially  yes  especiallybecause the picture makes me thinksometimesof you    chapter xxxiii   trent had done many brave things in his life but he had never been conscious of such a distinct thrill of nervousness as he experienced during those few minutes silence ernestine for her part was curiously exercised in her mind he had shaken her faith in his guilthe had admitted her to his point of view she judged herself from his standpoint and the result was unpleasant she had a sudden impulse to tell him the truth to reveal her identity tell him her reasons for concealment perhaps her suspicions had been hasty then the personal note in his last speech had produced a serious effect on her and all the time she felt that her silence was emboldening him as indeed it was  the first time i saw you he went on the likeness struck me i felt as though i were meeting some one whom i had known all my life  she laughed a little uneasily and you found yourself instead the victim of an interviewer what a drop from the romantic to the prosaic  there has never been any drop at all he answered firmly and you have always seemed to me the same as that picturesomething quite precious and apart from my life its been a poor sort of thing perhaps i came from the people i never had any education i was as rough as most men of my sort and i have done many things which i would sooner cut off my right hand than do again but that was when i lived in the darkness it was before you came  mr trent will you take me back to lady tresham please  in a moment he answered gravely dont think that i am going to be too rash i know the time hasnt come yet i am not going to say any more only i want you to know this the whole success of my life is as nothing compared with the hope of one day  i will not hear another word she interrupted hastily and underneath her white veil he could see a scarlet spot of colour in her cheeks in her speech too there was a certain tremulousness if you will not come with me i must find lady tresham alone  they turned round but as they neared the middle of the paddock progress became almost impossible the bell had rung for the principal race of the day and the numbers were going up the paddock was crowded with others beside loiterers looking the horses over and stolidly pushing their way through the little groups to the front rank from tattersalls came the roar of clamorous voices all around were evidences of that excitement which always precedes a great race  i think he said that we had better watch the race from these railings your gown will be spoilt in the crowd if we try to get out of the paddock and you probably wouldnt get anywhere in time to see it  she acquiesced silently recognising that although he had not alluded to it in words he had no intention of saying anything further at present trent who had been looking forward to the next few minutes with all the eagerness of a man who for the first time in his life runs the favourite in a great race smiled as he realised how very content he was to stay where nothing could be seen until the final struggle was over they took up their places side by side and leaned over the railing  have you much money on iris she asked  a thousand both ways he answered i dont plunge but as i backed her very early i got 10 to 1 and 7 to 2 listen theyre off  there was a roar from across the course followed by a moments breathless silence the clamour of voices from tattersalls subsided and in its place rose the buzz of excitement from the stands the murmur of many voices gradually growing in volume far away down the straight ernestine and trent leaning over the rail could see the little coloured specks come dancing into sight the roar of voices once more beat upon the air  nero the second wins  the favourites done  nero the second for a monkey  nero the second romps in   iris iris iris wins  it was evident from the last shout and the gathering storm of excitement that after all it was to be a race they were well in sight now nero the second and iris racing neckandneck drawing rapidly away from the others the air shook with the sound of hoarse and fiercely excited voices  nero the second wins  iris wins  neckandneck they passed the post so it seemed at least to ernestine and many others but trent shook his head and looked at her with a smile  iris was beaten by a short neck he said good thing you didnt back her thats a fine horse of the princes though  im so sorry she cried are you sure  he nodded and pointed to the numbers which were going up she flashed a sudden look upon him which more than compensated him for his defeat at least he had earned her respect that day as a man who knew how to accept defeat gracefully they walked slowly up the paddock and stood on the edge of the crowd whilst a great person went out to meet his horse amidst a storm of cheering it chanced that he caught sight of trent on the way and pausing for a moment he held out his hand  your horse made a magnificent fight for it mr trent he said im afraid i only got the verdict by a fluke another time may you be the fortunate one  trent answered him simply but without awkwardness then his horse came in and he held out his hand to the crestfallen jockey whilst with his left he patted iriss head  never mind dick he said cheerfully you rode a fine race and the best horse won better luck next time  several people approached trent but he turned away at once to ernestine  you will let me take you to lady tresham now he said  if you please she answered quietly  they left the paddock by the underground way when they emerged upon the lawn the band was playing and crowds of people were strolling about under the trees  the boxes trent suggested must be very hot now  he turned down a sidewalk away from the stand towards an empty seat under an elmtree and after a moments scarcely perceptible hesitation she followed his lead he laughed softly to himself if this was defeat what in the world was better  this is your first ascot is it not she asked  my first  and your first defeat  i suppose it is he admitted cheerfully i rather expected to win too  you must be very disappointed i am afraid  i have lost he said thoughtfully a gold cup i have gained  she half rose and shook out her skirts as though about to leave him he stopped short and found another conclusion to his sentence  experience  a faint smile parted her lips she resumed her seat  i am glad to find you she said so much of a philosopher now talk to me for a few minutes about what you have been doing in africa  he obeyed her and very soon she forgot the well dressed crowd of men and women by whom they were surrounded the light hum of gay conversation the band which was playing the fashionable air of the moment she saw instead the long line of men of many races stripped to the waist and toiling as though for their lives under a tropical sun she saw the great brown waterjars passed down the line men fainting beneath the burning sun and their places taken by others she heard the shrill whistle of alarm the beaten drum she saw the spade exchanged for the rifle and the long line of toilers disappear behind the natural earthwork which their labours had created she saw black forms rise stealthily from the long rank grass a flight of quivering spears the horrid battlecry of the natives rang in her ears the whole drama of the mans great past rose up before her eyes made a living and real thing by his simple but vigorous language that he effaced himself from it went for nothing she saw him there perhaps more clearly than anything else the central and domineering figure a man of brains and nerve who with his life in his hands faced with equal immovability a herculean task and the chances of death certain phrases in freds letter had sunk deep into her mind they were recalled very vividly by the presence of the man himself telling his own story she sat in the sunlight with the music in her ears listening to his abrupt vivid speech and a fear came to her which blanched her cheeks and caught at her throat the hand which held her dainty parasol of lace shook and an indescribable thrill ran through her veins she could no more think of this man as a clodhopper a coarse upstart without manners or imagination in many ways he fell short of all the usual standards by which the men of her class were judged yet she suddenly realised that he possessed a touch of that quality which lifted him at once far over their heads the man had genius without education or culture he had yet achieved greatness by his side the men who were passing about on the lawn became suddenly puppets form and style manners and easy speech became suddenly stripped of their significance to her the man at her side had none of these things yet he was of a greater world she felt her enmity towards him suddenly weakened only her pride now could help her she called upon it fiercely he was the man whom she had deliberately believed to be guilty of her fathers death the man whom she had set herself to entrap she brushed all those other thoughts away and banished firmly that dangerous kindness of manner into which she had been drifting  and he on his part felt a glow of keen pleasure when he realised how the events of the day had gone in his favour if not yet of her world he knew now that his becoming so would be hereafter purely a matter of time he looked up through the green leaves at the blue sky bedappled with white fleecy clouds and wondered whether she guessed that his appearance here his ownership of iris the studious care with which he had placed himself in the hands of a seville row tailor were all for her sake it was true that she had condescended to bohemianism that he had first met her as a journalist working for her living in a plain serge suit and a straw hat but he felt sure that this had been to a certain extent a whim with her he stole a sidelong glance at hershe was the personification of daintiness from the black patent shoes showing beneath the flouncing of her skirt to the white hat with its clusters of roses her foulard gown was as simple as genius could make it and she wore no ornaments save a fine clasp to her waistband of dull gold quaintly fashioned and the fine gold chain around her neck from which hung her racingglasses she was to him the very type of everything aristocratic it might be as she had told him that she chose to work for her living but he knew as though by inspiration that her people and connections were of that world to which he could never belong save on sufferance he meant to belong to it for her saketo win her he admitted the presumption but then it would be presumption of any man to lift his eyes to her he estimated his chances with common sense he was not a man disposed to undervalue himself he knew the power of his wealth and his advantage over the crowd of young men who were her equals by birth for he had met some of them had inquired into their lives listened to their jargon and had come in a faint sort of way to understand them it had been an encouragement to him after all it was only serious work life lived out face to face with the great realities of existence which could make a man in a dim way he realised that there were few in her own class likely to satisfy ernestine he even dared to tell himself that those things which rendered him chiefly unfit for her the acquired vulgarities of his rougher life were things which he could put away that a time would come when he would take his place confidently in her world and that the end would be success and all the while from out of the blue sky fate was forging a thunderbolt to launch against him    chapter xxxiv   and now she said rising you really must take me to lady tresham they will think that i am lost  are you still at your rooms he asked  she nodded  yes only im having them springcleaned for a few days i am staying at tresham house  may i come and see you there  the mans quiet pertinacity kindled a sort of indignation in her the sudden weakness in her defences was unbearable  i think not she answered shortly you dont know lady tresham and they might not approve lady tresham is rather oldfashioned  oh lady tresham is all right he answered i suppose i shall see you tonight if you are staying there they have asked me to dinner  she was taken aback and showed it again he had the advantage he did not tell her that on his return he had found scores of invitations from people he had never heard of before  you are by way of going into society then she answered insolently  i dont think ive made any particular efforts he answered  money she murmured is an everlasting force  the people of your world he answered with a flash of contempt are the people who find it so  she was silent then and trent was far from being discouraged by her momentary irritability he was crossing the lawn now by her side carrying himself well with a new confidence in his air and bearing which she did not fail to take note of the sunlight the music and the pleasant air of excitement were all in his veins he was full of the strong joy of living and then in the midst of it all came a dull crashing blow it was as though all his castles in the air had come toppling about his ears the blue sky had turned to stony grey and the sweet waltz music had become a dirge always a keen watcher of mens faces he had glanced for a second time at a gaunt sallow man who wore a loose check suit and a grey homburg hat the eyes of the two men met then the blood had turned to ice in trents veins and the ground had heaved beneath his feet it was the one terrible chance which fate had held against him and she had played the card  considering the nature and suddenness of the blow which had fallen upon him trents recovery was marvellous the two men had come face to face upon the short turf involuntarily each had come to a standstill ernestine looked from one to the other a little bewildered  i should like a word with you trent captain francis said quietly  trent nodded  in five minutes he said i will return hereon the other side of the bandstand say  francis nodded and stood aside trent and ernestine continued their progress towards the stand  your friend ernestine remarked seemed to come upon you like a modern banquo  trent who did not understand the allusion was for once discreet  he is a man with whom i had dealings abroad he said i did not expect him to turn up here  in west africa she asked quickly  trent smiled enigmatically  there are many foreign countries besides africa he said and ive been in most of them this is box no 13 then i shall see you this evening  she nodded and trent was free again he did not make his way at once to the bandstand instead he entered the small refreshmentroom at the base of the building and called for a glass of brandy he drank it slowly his eyes fixed upon the long row of bottles ranged upon the shelf opposite to him he himself carried back upon a long wave of thoughts to a little west african station where the moist heat rose in fever mists and where an endless stream of men passed backward and forward to their tasks with wan weary faces and slowly dragging limbs what a cursed chance which had brought him once more face to face with the one weak spot in his life the one chapter which had he the power he would most willingly seal for ever from outside came the ringing of a bell the hoarse shouting of many voices in the ring through the open door a vision of fluttering waves of colour lace parasols and picture hats little trills of feminine laughter the soft rustling of muslins and silks a few moments ago it had all seemed so delightful to himand now there lay a hideous blot upon the day  it seemed to him when he left the little bar that he had been there for hours as a matter of fact barely five minutes had passed since he had left ernestine he stood for a moment on the edge of the walk dazzled by the sunlight then he stepped on to the grass and made his way through the throng the air was full of soft gay music and the skirts and flounces of the women brushed against him at every step laughter and excitement were the order of the day trent with his suddenly pallid face and unseeing eyes seemed a little out of place in such a scene of pleasure francis who was smoking a cigar looked up as he approached and made room for him upon the seat  i did not expect to see you in england quite so soon captain francis trent said  i did not expect francis answered ever to be in england again i am told that my recovery was a miracle i am also told that i owe my life to you  trent shrugged his shoulders  i would have done as much for any of my people he said and you dont owe me any thanks to be frank with you i hoped youd die  you could easily have made sure of it francis answered  it wasnt my way trent answered shortly now what do you want with me  francis turned towards him with a curious mixture of expressions in his face  look here he said i want to believe in you you saved my life and im not overanxious to do you a mischief but you must tell me what you have done with villmonty  dont you know where he is trent asked quickly  i certainly not how should i  perhaps not trent said but heres the truth when i got back to attra monty had disappearedran away to england and as yet ive heard never a word of him id meant to do the square thing by him and bring him back myself instead of that he gave us all the slip but unless hes a lot different to what he was last time i saw him hes not fit to be about alone  i heard that he had left francis said from mr walsh  he either came quite alone trent said in which case it is odd that nothing has been heard of him or da souza has got hold of him  oom sams brother  trent nodded  and his interest francis asked  well he is a large shareholder in the company trent said of course he could upset us all if he liked i should say that da souza would try all he could to keep him in the background until he had disposed of his shares  and how does your stock hold  i dont know trent said i only landed yesterday im pretty certain though that theres no market for the whole of da souzas holding  he has a large interest then  a very large one trent answered drily  i should like francis said to understand this matter properly as a matter of fact i suppose that monty is entitled to half the purchasemoney you received for the company  trent assented  it isnt that i grudge him that he said although with the other financial enterprises i have gone into i dont know how i should raise half a million of money to pay him off but dont you see my sale of the charter to the company is itself monty being alive an illegal act the title will be wrong and the whole affair might drift into chancery just when a vigorous policy is required to make the venture a success if monty were here and in his right mind i think we could come to terms but when i saw him last at any rate he was quite incapable and he might become a tool to anything the bears might get hold of him and ruin us all in short its a beastly mess  francis looked at him keenly  what do you expect me to do he asked  i have no right to expect anything trent said however i saved your life and you may consider yourself therefore under some obligation to me i will tell you then what i would have you do in the first place i know no more where he is than you do he may be in england or he may not i shall go to da souza who probably knows you can come with me if you like i dont want to rob the man of a penny he shall have all he is entitled toonly i do want to arrange terms with him quietly and not have the thing talked about its as much for the others sake as my own the men who came into my syndicate trusted me and i dont want them left  francis took a little silver case from his pocket lit a cigarette and smoked for a moment or two thoughtfully  it is possible he said at last that you are an honest man on the other hand you must admit that the balance of probability from my point of view is on the other side let us travel backwards a little wayto my first meeting with you i witnessed the granting of this concession to you by the king of bekwando according to its wording you were virtually montys heir and monty was lying drunk in a climate where strong waters and death walk handinhand you leave him in the bush proclaim his death and take sole possession i find him alive do the best i can for him and here the first act ends then what afterwards i hear of you as an empiremaker and a millionaire nevertheless monty was alive and you knew he was alive but when i reach attra he has been spirited away i want to know where you say you dont know it may be true but it doesnt sound like it  trents underlip was twitching a sure sign of the tempest within but he kept himself under restraint and said never a word  francis continued now i do not wish to be your enemy scarlett trent or to do you an ill turn but this is my word to you produce monty within a week and open reasonable negotiations for treating him fairly and i will keep silent but if you cant produce him at the end of that time i must go to his relations and lay all these things before them  trent rose slowly to his feet  give me your address he said i will do what i can  francis tore a leaf from his pocketbook and wrote a few words upon it  that will find me at any time he said one moment trent when i saw you first you were witha lady  well  i have been away from england so long francis continued slowly that my memory has suffered yet that ladys face was somehow familiar may i ask her name  miss ernestine wendermott trent answered slowly  francis threw away his cigarette and lit another  thank you he said    chapter xxxv   da souzas office was neither furnished nor located with the idea of impressing casual visitors it was in a backstreet off an alley and although within a stones throw of lothbury its immediate surroundings were not exhilarating a blank wall faced it a greengrocers shop shared with a wonderful cellarlike publichouse the honour of its more immediate environment trent whose first visit it was looked about him with surprise mingled with some disgust  he pushed open the swing door and found himself face to face with da souzas one clerka youth of unkempt appearance shabbily but flashily dressed with sallow complexion and eyes set close together he was engaged at that particular moment in polishing a large diamond pin upon the sleeve of his coat which operation he suspended to gaze with much astonishment at this unlockedfor visitor trent had come straight from ascot straight indeed from his interview with francis and was still wearing his racingglasses  i wish to see mr da souza trent said is he in  i believe so sir the boy answered what name  trent mr scarlett trent  the door of an inner office opened and da souza sleek and curled presented himself he showed all his white teeth in the smile with which he welcomed his visitor the light of battle was in his small keen eyes in his cringing bow his mock humility  i am most honoured mr trent sir he declared welcome back to england when did you return  yesterday trent said shortly  and you have come da souza continued fresh from the triumphs of the racecourse it is so i trust  i have come straight from ascot trent replied but my horse was beaten if that is what you mean i did not come here to talk about racing though i want a word with you in private  with much pleasure sir da souza answered throwing open with a little flourish the door of his sanctum will you step in this way the chair is dusty permit me  trent threw a swift glance around the room in which he found himself it was barely furnished and a window thick with dust looked out on the dingy backwall of a bank or some public building the floor was uncovered the walls were hung with yellow maps of goldmines all in the west african district da souza himself spick and span with glossy boots and a flower in his buttonhole was certainly the least shabby thing in the room  you know very well trent said what i have come about of course youll pretend you dont so to save time ill tell you what have you done with monty  da souza spread outwards the palms of his hands he spoke with wellaffected impatience  monty always monty what do i want with him it is you who should look after him not i  trent turned quietly round and locked the door da souza would have called out but a paroxysm of fear had seized him his fat white face was pallid and his knees were shaking trents hand fell upon his shoulder and da souza felt as though the claws of a trap had gripped him  if you call out ill throttle you trent said now listen francis is in england and unless monty is produced will tell the whole story i shall do the best i can for all of us but im not going to have monty done to death come lets have the truth  da souza was grey now with a fear greater even than a physical one he had been so near wealth was he to lose everything  mr trent he whispered my dear friend have reason monty i tell you is only half alive he hangs on but it is a mere thread of life leave it all to me tomorrow he shall be deadoh quite naturally there shall be no risk trent trent  his cry ended in a gurgle for trents hand was on his throat  listen you miserable hound he whispered take me to him this moment or ill shake the life out of you did you ever know me go back from my word  da souza took up his hat with an ugly oath and yielded the two men left the office together                                                     listen  the two women sat in silence waiting for some repetition of the sound this time there was certainly no possibility of any mistake from the room above their heads came the feeble quavering sobbing of an old man julie threw down her book and sprang up  mother i cannot bear it any longer she cried i know where the key is and i am going into that room  mrs da souzas portly frame quivered with excitement  my child she pleaded dont julie do remember your father will know and thenoh i shall be frightened to death  it is nothing to do with you mother the girl said i am going  mrs da souza produced a capacious pockethandkerchief reeking with scent and dabbed her eyes with it from the days when she too had been like julie slim and pretty she had been every hour in dread of her husband long ago her spirit had been broken and her independence subdued to her friend and confidants no word save of pride and love for her husband had ever passed her lips yet now as she watched her daughter she was conscious of a wild passionate wish that her fate at least might be a different one and while she mopped her eyes and looked backward julie disappeared  even julie as she ascended the stairs with the key of the locked room in her hand was conscious of unusual tremors if her position with regard to her father was not the absolute condition of serfdom into which her mother had been ground down she was at least afraid of him and she remembered the strict commands he had laid upon them all the room was not to be open save by himself all cries and entreaties were to be disregarded every one was to behave as though that room did not exist they had borne it already for days the heartstirring moans the faint despairing cries of the prisoner and she could bear it no longer she had a tender little heart and from the first it had been moved by the appearance of the pitiful old man leaning so heavily upon her fathers arm as they had come up the garden walk together she made up her mind to satisfy herself at least that his isolation was of his own choice so she went boldly up the stairs and thrust the key into the lock a moments hesitation then she threw it open  her first impulse when she had looked into the face of the man who stumbled up in fear at her entrance was to then and there abandon her enterprisefor monty just then was not a pleasant sight to look upon the room was foul with the odour of spirits and tobacco smoke monty himself was unkempt and unwashed his eyes were bloodshot and he had fallen half across the table with the gesture of a drunken man at the sight of him her pity died away after all then the sobbing they had heard was the maudlin crying of a drunken man yet he was very old and there was something about the childish breathless fear with which he was regarding her which made her hesitate she lingered instead and finding him tonguetied spoke to him  we heard you talking to yourself downstairs she said and we were afraid that you might be in pain  ah he muttered that is all then there is no one behind youno one who wants me  there is no one in the house she assured him save my mother and myself  he drew a little breath which ended in a sob you see he said vaguely i sit up here hour by hour and i think that i fancy things only a little while ago i fancied that i heard mr walshs voice and he wanted the missionbox the wooden box with the cross you know i keep on thinking i hear him stupid isnt it  he smiled weakly and his bony fingers stole round the tumbler which stood by his side she shook her head at him smiling and crossed over to him she was not afraid any more  i wouldnt drink if i were you she said it cant be good for you im sure  good he answered slowly its poisonrank poison  if i were you she said i would put all this stuff away and go for a nice walk it would do you much more good  he shook his head  i darent he whispered theyre looking for me now i must hidehide all the time  who are looking for you she asked  dont you know mr walsh and his wife they have come over after me  why  didnt you know he muttered that i am a thief  she shook her head  no i certainly didnt im very sorry  he nodded his head vigorously a great many times  wont you tell me about it she asked was it anything very bad  i dont know he said its so hard to remember it is something like this i seem to have lived for such a long time and when i look back i can remember things that happened a very long time ago but then there seems a gap and everything is all misty and it makes my head ache dreadfully to try and remember he moaned  then dont try she said kindly ill read to you for a little time if you like and you shall sit quite quiet  he seemed not to have heard her he continued presently  once before i died it was all i wanted just to have heard her speak to have seen my little girl grown into a woman and the sea was always there and oom sam would always come with that cursed rum then one day came trent and talked of money and spoke of england and when he went away it rang for ever in my ears and at night i heard her calling for me across the sea so i stole out and the great steamer was lying there with red fires at her funnel and i was mad she was crying for me across the sea so i took the money  she patted his hand gently there was a lump in her throat and her eyes were wet  was it your daughter you wanted so much to see she asked softly  my daughter my little girl he answered and i heard her calling to me with her mothers voice across the sea so i took the money  no one would blame you very much for that i am sure she said cheerfully you are frightening yourself needlessly i will speak to father and he shall help you  he held up his hand  he is hiding me he whispered it is through him i knew that they were after me i dont mind for myself but she might get to know and i have brought disgrace enough upon her listen  there were footsteps upon the stairs he clung to her in an agony of terror  they are coming he cried hide me oh hide me  but she too was almost equally terrified for she had recognised her fathers tread the door was thrown open and de souza entered followed by scarlett trent    chapter xxxvi   the old man and the girl were equally terrified both without cause da souza forgot for a moment to be angry at his daughters disobedience and was quick to see that her presence there was all to his advantage monty as white as death was stricken dumb to see trent he sank back gasping into a chair trent came up to him with outstretched hands and with a look of keen pity in his hard face  monty old chap he said what on earth are you scared at dont you know im glad to see you didnt i come to attra to get you back to england shake hands partner ive got lots of money for you and good news  montys hand was limp and cold his eyes were glazed and expressionless trent looked at the halfempty bottle by his side and turned savagely to da souza  you blackguard he said in a low tone you wanted to kill him did you dont you know that to shut him up here and ply him with brandy is as much murder as though you stood with a knife at his throat  he goes mad without something to drink da souza muttered  hell go mad fast enough with a bottle of brandy within reach and you know it trent answered fiercely i am going to take him away from here  da souza was no longer cringing he shrugged his shoulders and thrust his fat little hands into his trousers pockets  very well he said darkly you go your own way you wont take my advice ive been a city man all my life and i know a thing or two you bring monty to the general meeting of the bekwando company and explain his position and i tell you youll have the whole market toppling about your ears no concern of mine of course i have got rid of a few of my shares and ill work a few more off before the crash but what about you what about scarlett trent the millionaire  i can afford to lose a bit trent answered quietly im not afraid  da souza laughed a little hysterically  you think youre a financial genius i suppose he said because youve brought a few things off why you dont know the a b c of the thing i tell you this my friend a company like the bekwando company is very much like a womans reputation drop a hint or two start just a bit of talk and i tell you the flamesll soon do the work  trent turned his back upon him  monty he said you arent afraid to come with me  monty looked at him perplexed and troubled  youve nothing to be afraid of trent continued as to the money at mr walshs house i settled that all up with him before i left attra it belonged to you really for id left more than that for you  there is no one then monty asked in a slow painful whisper who will put me in prison  i give you my word monty trent declared that there is not a single soul who has any idea of the sort  you see it isnt that i mind monty continued in a low quivering voice but theres my little girl my real name might come out and i wouldnt have her know what ive been for anything  she shall not know trent said ill promise youll be perfectly safe with me  monty rose up weakly his knees were shaking and he was in a pitiful state he cast a sidelong glance at the brandy bottle by his side and his hand stole out towards it but trent stopped him gently but firmly  not now monty he said youve had enough of that  the mans hand dropped to his side he looked into trents face and the years seemed to fade away into a mist  you were always a hard man scarlett trent he said you were always hard on me  maybe so trent answered yet youd have died in dt before now but for me i kept you from it as far as i could im going to keep you from it now  monty turned a woebegone face around the little room  i dont know he said im comfortable here and im too old trent to live your life id begin again trent i would indeed if i were ten years younger its too late now i couldnt live a day without something to keep up my strength  hes quite right trent da souza put in hastily hes too old to start afresh now hes comfortable here and well looked after make him an allowance or give him a good lump sum in lieu of all claims ill draw it out youll sign it wont you monty be reasonable trent its the best course for all of us  but trent shook his head i have made up my mind he said he must come with me monty there is the little girl  too late monty moaned look at me  but if you could leave her a fortune make her magnificent presents  monty wavered then his dull eyes shone once more  if i could do that he murmured  i pledge my word that you shall trent answered monty rose up  i am ready he said simply let us start at once  da souza planted himself in front of them  you defy me he said you will not trust him with me or take my advice very well my friend now listen you want to ruin me well if i go the bekwando company shall go too you understand ruin for me shall mean ruin for mr scarlett trentah ruin and disgrace it shall mean imprisonment if i can bring it about and i have friends dont you know that you are guilty of fraud you sold what wasnt yours and put the money in your pocket you left your partner to rot in a fever swamp or to be done to death by those filthy blacks the law will call that swindling you will find yourself in the dock my friend in the prisoners dock i say come how do you like that mr scarlett trent if you leave this room with him you are a ruined man i shall see to it  trent swung him out of the waya single contemptuous turn of the wrist and da souza reeled against the mantelpiece he held out his hand to monty and they left the room together    chapter xxxvii   from a conversational point of view lady tresham remarked our guest tonight seems scarcely likely to distinguish himself  ernestine looked over her fan across the drawingroom  i have never seen such an alteration in a man she said in so short a time this morning he amazed me he knew the right people and did the right thingscarried himself too like a man who is sure of himself tonight he is simply a booby  perhaps it is his evening clothes lady tresham remarked they take some getting used to i believe  this morning ernestine said he had passed that stage altogether this is i suppose a relapse such a nuisance for you  lady tresham rose and smiled sweetly at the man who was taking her in  well he is to be your charge so i hope you may find him more amusing than he looks she answered  it was an early dinner to be followed by a visit to a popular theatre a few hours ago trent was looking forward to his evening with the keenest pleasurenow he was dazedhe could not readjust his point of view to the new conditions he knew very well that it was his wealth and his wealth only which had brought him as an equal amongst these people all so far as education and social breeding was concerned of so entirely a different sphere he looked around the table what would they say if they knew he would be thrust out as an interloper opposite to him was a peer who was even then engaged in threading the meshes of the bankruptcy court what did they care for thatnot a whit he was of their order though he was a beggar but as regards himself he was fully conscious of the difference the measure of his wealth was the measure of his standing amongst them without it he would be thrust forthhe could make no claim to association with them the thought filled him with a slow bitter anger he sent away his soup untasted and he could not find heart to speak to the girl who had been the willothewisp leading him into this evil plight  presently she addressed him  mr trent  he turned round and looked at her  is it necessary for me to remind you i wonder she said that it is usual to address a few remarksquite as a matter of form you knowto the woman whom you bring in to dinner  he eyed her dispassionately  i am not used to making conversation he said is there anything in the world which i could talk about likely to interest you  she took a salted almond from a silver dish by his side and smiled sweetly upon him dear me she said how fierce dont attempt it if you feel like that please what have you been doing since i saw you lastlosing your money or your temper or both  he looked at her with a curiously grim smile  if i lost the former he said i should very soon cease to be a person of interest or of any account at all amongst your friends  she shrugged her shoulders  you do not strike one she remarked as the sort of person likely to lose a fortune on the racecourse  you are quite right he answered i think that i won money a couple of thousand at least  two thousand pounds she actually sighed and lost her appetite for the oyster patty with which she had been trifling trent looked around the table  at the same time he continued in a lower key ill make a confession to you miss wendermott i wouldnt care to make to any one else here ive been pretty lucky as you know made money fastpiled it up in fact today for the first time i have come face to face with the possibility of a reverse  is this a new character she murmured are you becoming fainthearted  it is no ordinary reverse he said slowly it is collapseeverything  ooh  she looked at him attentively her own heart was beating if he had not been engrossed by his care lest any one might overhear their conversation he would have been astonished at the change in her face  you are talking in enigmas surely she said nothing of that sort could possibly happen to you they tell me that the bekwando land shares are priceless and that you must make millions  this afternoon he said raising his glass to his lips and draining it i think that i must have dozed upon the lawn at ascot i sat there for some time back amongst the trees and i think that i must have fallen to sleep there was a whisper in my ears and i saw myself stripped of everything how was it i forget now a concession repudiated a bank failure a big slumpwhat does it matter the money was gone and i was simply myself again scarlett trent a labourer penniless and of no account  it must have been an odd sensation she said thoughtfully  i will tell you what it made me realise he said i am drifting into a dangerous position i am linking myself to a little world to whom personally i am as nothing and less than nothing i am tolerated for my belongings if by any chance i were to lose these what would become of me  you are a man she said looking at him earnestly you have the nerve and wits of a man what you have done before you might do again  in the meantime i should be ostracised  by a good many people no doubt  he held his peace for a time and ate and drank what was set before him he was conscious that his was scarcely a dinnertable manner he was too eager too deeply in earnest people opposite were looking at them ernestine talked to her visavis it was some time before he spoke again when he did he took up the thread of their conversation where he had left it  by the majority of course he said i have wondered sometimes whether there might be any one who would be different  i should be sorry she said demurely  sorry yes so would the tradespeople who had had my money and the men who call themselves my friends and forget that they are my debtors  you are cynical  i cannot help it he answered it is my dream today you know i have stood face to face with evil things  do you know she said i should never have called you a dreamer a man likely to fancy things i wonder if anything has really happened to make you talk like this  he flashed a quick glance at her underneath his heavy brows nothing in her face betrayed any more than the most ordinary interest in what he was saying yet somehow from that moment he had uneasy doubts concerning her whether there might be by any chance some reason for the tolerance and the interest with which she had regarded him from the first the mere suspicion of it was a shock to him he relapsed once more into a state of nervous silence ernestine yawned and her hostess threw more than one pitying glance towards her  afterwards the whole party adjourned to the theatre altogether in an informal manner some of the guests had carriages waiting others went down in hansoms ernestine was rather late in coming downstairs and found trent waiting for her in the hall she was wearing a wonderful black satin opera cloak with pale green lining her maid had touched up her hair and wound a string of pearls around her neck he watched her as she came slowly down the stairs buttoning her gloves and looking at him with eyebrows faintly raised to see him waiting there alone after all what folly was it likely that wealth however great could ever make him of her world could ever bring him in reality one degree nearer to her that night he had lost all confidence he told himself that it was the rankest presumption to even think of her  the others he said have gone on lady tresham left word that i was to take you  she glanced at the oldfashioned clock which stood in the corner of the hall  how ridiculous to have hurried so she said one might surely be comfortable here instead of waiting at the theatre  she walked towards the door with him his own little nightbrougham was waiting there and she stepped into it  i am surprised at lady tresham she said smiling i really dont think that i am at all properly chaperoned this comes i suppose from having acquired a character for independence  her gown seemed to fill the carriagea little sea of frothy lace and muslin he hesitated on the pavement  shall i ride outside he suggested i dont want to crush you  she gathered up her skirt at once and made room for him he directed the driver and stepped in beside her  i hope she said that your cigarette restored your spirits you are not going to be as dull all the evening as you were at dinner are you  he sighed a little wistfully id like to talk to you he said simply but somehow tonight you know it was much easier when you were a journalist from the hour  well that is what i am now she said laughing only i cant get away from all my old friends at once the day after tomorrow i shall be back at work  do you mean it he asked incredulously  of course i do you dont suppose i find this sort of thing particularly amusing do you hasnt it ever occurred to you that there must be a terrible sameness about people who have been brought up amongst exactly the same surroundings and taught to regard life from exactly the same point of view  but you belong to themyou have their instincts  i may belong to them in some ways but you know that i am a revolted daughter havent i proved it havent i gone out into the world to the horror of all my relatives for the sole purpose of getting a firmer grip of life and yet do you know mr trent i believe that tonight you have forgotten that you have remembered my present character only and in despair of interesting a fashionable young lady you have not talked to me at all and i have been very dull  it is quite true he assented all around us they were talking of things of which i knew nothing and you were one of them  how foolish you could have talked to me about fred and the roadmaking in africa and i should have been more interested than in anything they could have said to me  they were passing a brilliantlylit corner and the light flashed upon his strong set face with its heavy eyebrows and firm lips he leaned back and laughed hoarsely was it her fancy she wondered or did he seem not wholly at his ease  havent i told you a good deal i should have thought that fred and i between us had told you all about africa that you would care to hear  she shook her head what she said next sounded to him in a certain sense enigmatic  there is a good deal left for you to tell me she said some day i shall hope to know everything  he met her gaze without flinching  some day he said i hope you will    chapter xxxviii   the carriage drew up at the theatre and he handed her outa little awkwardly perhaps but without absolute clumsiness they found all the rest of the party already in their seats and the curtain about to go up they took the two end stalls trent on the outside one chair only next to him remained unoccupied  you people havent hurried lady tresham remarked leaning forward  we are in time at any rate ernestine answered letting her cloak fall upon the back of the stall  the curtain was rung up and the play began it was a modern society drama full of all the most uptodate fashionable jargon and topical illusions trent grew more and more bewildered at every moment suddenly towards the end of the first act a fine dramatic situation leaped out like a tongue of fire the interest of the whole audience up to then only mildly amused became suddenly intense trent sat forward in his seat ernestine ceased to fan herself the man and the woman stood face to facethe light badinage which had been passing between them suddenly endedthe man with his sin stripped bare mercilessly exposed the woman his accuser passionately eloquent pouring out her scorn upon a mute victim the audience knew what the woman in the play did not know that it was for love of her that the man had sinned to save her from a terrible danger which had hovered very near her life the curtain fell the woman leaving the room with a final taunt flung over her shoulder the man seated at a table looking steadfastly into the fire with fixed unseeing eyes the audience drew a little breath and then applauded the orchestra struck up and a buzz of conversation began  it was then that ernestine first noticed how absorbed the man at her side had become his hands were gripping the arms of the stall his eyes were fixed upon the spot somewhere behind the curtain where this sudden little drama had been played out as though indeed they could pierce the heavy upholstery and see beyond into the room where the very air seemed quivering still with the vehemence of the womans outpoured scorn ernestine spoke to him at last the sound of her voice brought him back with a start to the present  you like it  the latter part he answered what a sudden change at first i thought it rubbish afterwards it was wonderful  hubert is a fine actor she remarked fanning herself it was his first opportunity in the play and he certainly took advantage of it  he turned deliberately round in his seat towards her and she was struck with the forceful eagerness of his dark set face  the man he whispered hoarsely sinned for the love of the woman was he right would a woman forgive a man who deceived her for her own sakewhen she knew  ernestine held up her programme and studied it deeply  i cannot tell she said it depends  trent drew a little breath and turned away a quiet voice from his other side whispered in his earthe woman would forgive if she cared for the man                                                     trent turned sharply and the light died out of his voice surely it was an evil omen this mans coming for it was captain francis who had taken the vacant seat and who was watching his astonishment with a somewhat saturnine smile  rather a stupid play isnt it by the by trent i wish you would ask miss wendermotts permission to present me i met her young cousin out at attra  ernestine heard and leaned forward smiling trent did as he was asked with set teeth and an ill grace from then until the curtain went up for the next act he had only to sit still and listen  afterwards the play scarcely fulfilled the promise of its commencement at the third act trent had lost all interest in it suddenly an idea occurred to him he drew a card from his pocket and scribbling a word or two on it passed it along to lady tresham she leaned forward and smiled approval upon him  delightful  trent reached for his hat and whispered in ernestines ear  you are all coming to supper with me at the milan he said i am going on now to see about it  she smiled upon him evidently pleased  what a charming idea but do you mean all of us  why not  he found his carriage outside without much difficulty and drove quickly round to the milan restaurant the director looked doubtful  a table for eighteen sir it is quite too late to arrange it except in a private room  the ladies prefer the large room trent answered decidedly and you must arrange it somehow ill give you carte blanche as to what you serve but it must be of the best  the man bowed this must be a millionaire for the restaurant was the milan  and the name sir  scarlett trentyou may not know me but lady tresham lord colliston and the earl of howton are amongst my guests  the man saw no more difficulties the name of scarlett trent was the name which impressed him the english aristocrat he had but little respect for but a millionaire was certainly next to the gods  we must arrange the table crossways sir at the end of the room he said and about the flowers  the best and as many as you can get trent answered shortly i have a 100 pound note with me i shall not grumble if i get little change out of it but i want value for the money  you shall have it sir the man answered significantlyand he kept his word  trent reached the theatre only as the people were streaming out in the lobby he came face to face with ernestine and francis they were talking together earnestly but ceased directly they saw him  i have been telling captain francis ernestine said of your delightful invitation  i hope that captain francis will join us trent said coldly  francis stepped behind for a moment to light a cigarette  i shall be delighted he answered                                                     the supper party was one of those absolute and complete successes which rarely fall to the lot of even the most carefully thought out of social functions every one of lady treshams guests had accepted the hurried invitation every one seemed in good spirits and delighted at the opportunity of unrestrained conversation after several hours at the theatre the supper itself absolutely the best of its kind from the caviare and plovers eggs to the marvellous ices and served in one of the handsomest rooms in london was really beyond criticism to trent it seemed almost like a dream as he leaned back in his chair and looked down at the little partythe women with their bare shoulders and jewels bathed in the soft glow of the roseshaded electric lights the piles of beautiful pink and white flowers the gleaming silver and the wine which frothed in their glasses the music of the violins on the balcony blended with the soft gay voices of the women ernestine was by his side every one was goodhumoured and enjoying his hospitality only one face at the table was a reminder of the instability of his fortunesa face he had grown to hate during the last few hours with a passionate concentrated hatred yet the man was of the same race as these people his connections were known to many of them he was making new friends and reviving old ties every moment during a brief lull in the conversation his clear soft voice suddenly reached trents ears he was telling a story  africa he was saying is a country of surprises attra seems to be a city of hopeless exile for all white people last time i was there i used to notice every day a very old man making a pretence of working in a kitchen garden attached to a little white missionhousea basle society depot he always seemed to be leaning on his spade always gazing out seawards in the same intent fascinated way some one told me his history at last he was an englishman of good position who had got into trouble in his younger days and served a term of years in prison when he came out sooner than disgrace his family further he published a false account of his death and sailed under a disguised name for africa there he has lived ever since growing older and sinking lower often near fortune but always missing it a slave to bad habits weak and dissolute if you like but ever keeping up his voluntary sacrifice ever with that unconquerable longing for one last glimpse of his own country and his own people i saw him not many months ago still there still with his eyes turned seawards and with the same wistful droop of the head somehow i cant help thinking that that old man was also a hero  the tinkling of glasses and the sort murmuring of whispered conversation had ceased during francis story every one was a little affectedthe soft throbbing of the violins upon the balcony was almost a relief then there was a little murmur of sympathetic remarksbut amongst it all trent sat at the head of the table with white set face but with red fire before his eyes this man had played him false he dared not look at ernestineonly he knew that her eyes were wet with tears and that her bosom was heaving  the spirits of men and women who sup are mercurial things and it was a gay leavetaking half an hour or so later in the little moorish room at the head of the staircase but ernestine left her host without even appearing to see his outstretched hand and he let her go without a word only when francis would have followed her trent laid a heavy hand upon his shoulder  i must have a word with you francis he said  i will come back he said i must see miss wendermott into her carriage  but trents hand remained there a grip of iron from which there was no escaping he said nothing but francis knew his man and had no idea of making a scene so he remained till the last had gone and a tall black servant had brought their coats from the cloakroom  you will come with me please trent said i have a few words to say to you  francis shrugged his shoulders and obeyed    chapter xxxix   scarcely a word passed between the two men until they found themselves in the smokingroom of trents house a servant noiselessly arranged decanters and cigars upon the sideboard and in response to an impatient movement of trents withdrew francis lit a cigarette trent contrary to his custom did not smoke he walked to the door and softly locked it then he returned and stood looking down at his companion  francis he said you have been my enemy since the day i saw you first in bekwando village  scarcely that francis objected i have distrusted you since then if you like  call it what you like trent answered only tonight you have served me a scurvy trick you were a guest at my table and you gave me not the slightest warning on the contrary this morning you offered me a weeks respite  the story i told francis answered could have had no significance to them  i dont know whether you are trying to deceive me or not trent said only if you do not know let me tell youmiss wendermott is that old mans daughter  the mans start was real there was no doubt about that and she knew  she knew that he had been in africa but she believed that he had died there what she believes at this moment i cannot tell your story evidently moved her she will probably try to find out from you the truth  francis nodded  she has asked me to call upon her tomorrow  exactly now forgive my troubling you with personal details but youve got to understand i mean miss wendermott to be my wife  francis sat up in his chair genuinely surprised something like a scowl was on his dark sallow face  your wife he exclaimed arent you joking trent  i am not trent answered sharply from the moment i saw her that has been my fixed intention every one thinks of me as simply a speculator with the money fever in my veins perhaps that was true once it isnt now i must be rich to give her the position she deserves thats all i care for money  i am very much interested francis said slowly to hear of your intentions hasnt it occurred to you however that your behaviour toward miss wendermotts father will take a great deal of explanation  if there is no interference trent said i can do it there is mystery on her part too for i offered a large reward and news of him through my solicitor and she actually refused to reply she has refused any money accruing to her through her father or to be brought into contact with any one who could tell her about him  the fact francis remarked drily is scarcely to her credit monty may have been disreputable enough ive no doubt he was but his going away and staying there all these years was a piece of noble unselfishness  monty has been hardly used in some ways trent said ive done my best by him though  that francis said coldly is a matter of opinion  i know very well trent answered what yours is you are welcome to it you can blackguard me all round london if you like in a weekbut i want a weeks grace  why should i grant it you  trent shrugged his shoulders  i wont threaten he said and i wont offer to bribe you but ive got to have that weeks grace were both men francis whove been accustomed to our own way i think i want to know on what terms youll grant it me  francis knocked the ash off his cigarette and rose slowly to his feet  you want to know he repeated meditatively on what terms ill hold my tongue for a week well heres my answer on no terms at all  you dont mean that trent said quietly  we shall see francis answered grimly ill be frank with you trent when we came in here you called me your enemy well in a sense you were right i distrusted and disliked you from the moment i first met you in bekwando village with poor old monty for a partner and read the agreement you had drawn up and the clause about the death of either making the survivor sole legatee in a regular fever swamp monty was drinking poison like waterand you were watching that may have seemed all right to you to me it was very much like murder it was my mistrust of you which made me send men after you both through the bush and sure enough they found poor monty abandoned left to die while you had hastened off to claim your booty after that i had adventures enough of my own for a bit and i lost sight of you until i came across you and your gang roadmaking and i am bound to admit that you saved my life thats neither here nor there i asked about monty and you told me some plausible tale i went to the place you spoke ofto find him of course spirited away we have met again in england scarlett trent and i have asked once more for monty once more i am met with evasions this morning i granted you a weeknow i take back my word i am going to make public what i know tomorrow morning  since this morning then trent said your illwill toward me has increased  quite true francis answered we are playing with the cards upon the table so i will be frank with you what you told me about your intentions towards miss wendermott makes me determined to strike at once  you yourself i fancy trent said quietly admired her  more than any woman i have ever met francis answered promptly and i consider your attitude towards her grossly presumptuous  trent stood quite still for a momentthen he unlocked the door  you had better go francis he said quietly i have a defence prepared but i will reserve it and listen when i locked that door it was with a purpose i had no mind to let you leave as you are leaving never mind you can goonly be quick  francis paused upon the threshold you understand he said significantly  i understand trent answered                                                     an hour passed and trent still remained in the chair before his writingtable his head upon his hand his eyes fixed upon vacancy afterwards he always thought of that hour as one of the bitterest of his life a strong and selfreliant man he had all his life ignored companionship had been well content to live without friends selfcontained and selfsufficient tonight the spectre of a great loneliness sat silently by his side his heart was sore his pride had been bitterly touched the desire and the whole fabric of his life was in imminent and serious danger  the man who had left him was an enemy and a prejudiced man but trent knew that he was honest he was the first human being to whom he had ever betrayed the solitary ambition of his life and his scornful words seemed still to bite the air ifhe was right why not trent looked with keen merciless eyes through his past and saw never a thing there to make him glad he had started life a workman with a few ambitions all of a material naturehe had lived the life of a cold scheming moneygetter absolutely selfish negatively moral doing little evil perhaps but less good there was nothing in his life to make him worthy of a womans love most surely there was nothing which could ever make it possible that such a woman as ernestine wendermott should ever care for him all the wealth of africa could never make him anything different from what he was and yet as he sat and realised this he knew that he was writing down his life a failure for beside his desire for her there were no other things he cared for in life already he was weary of financial warfarethe city life had palled upon him he looked around the magnificent room in the mansion which his agents had bought and furnished for him he looked at the pile of letters waiting for him upon his desk little square envelopes many of them but all telling the same tale all tributes to his great success and the mockery of it all smote hard upon the walls of his fortitude lower and lower his head drooped until it was buried in his folded armsand the hour which followed he always reckoned the bitterest of his life    chapter xl   a little earlier than usual next morning trent was at his office in the city prepared for the worst and in less than half an hour he found himself face to face with one of those crises known to most great financiers at some time or other during their lives his credit was not actually assailed but it was suspended the general public did not understand the situation even those who were in a measure behind the scenes found it hard to believe that the attack upon the bekwando gold and land shares was purely a personal one for it was da souza who had fired the train who had flung his large holding of shares upon the market and finding them promptly taken up had gone about with many pious exclamations of thankfulness and sinister remarks many smaller holders followed suit and yet never for a moment did the market waver gradually it leaked out that scarlett trent was the buyer and public interest leaped up at once would trent be able to face settlingday without putting his vast holdings upon the market if so the bulls were going to have the worst knock they had had for yearsand yetand yetthe murmur went round from friend to friendsell your bekwandos  at midday there came an urgent message from trents bankers and as he read it he cursed it was short but eloquent  dear sirwe notice that your account today stands 119000 pounds overdrawn against which we hold as collateral security shares in the bekwando land company to the value of 150000 pounds as we have received certain very disquieting information concerning the value of these shares we must ask you to adjust the account before closing hours today or we shall be compelled to place the shares upon the market  yours truly  a sinclair general manager   trent tore the letter into atoms but he never quailed telegraph and telephone worked his will he saw all callers a cigar in his mouth and flower in his buttonhole perfectly at his ease sanguine and confident a few minutes before closing time he strolled into the bank and no one noticed a great bead of perspiration which stood out upon his forehead he made out a credit slip for 119000 pounds and passing it across the counter with a roll of notes and cheques asked for his shares  they sent for the manager trent was ushered with much ceremony into his private room the manager was flushed and nervous  i am afraid you must have misunderstood my note mr trent he stammered but trent remembering all that he had gone through to raise the money stopped him short  this is not a friendly call mr sinclair he said but simply a matter of business i wish to clear my account with you to the last halfpenny and i will take my shares away with me i have paid in the amount i owe let one of your clerks make out the interest account  the manager rang the bell for the key of the security safe he opened it and took out the shares with fingers which trembled a good deal  did i understand you mr trent that you desired to absolutely close the account he asked  most decidedly trent answered  we shall be very sorry to lose you  the sorrow will be all on your side then trent answered grimly you have done your best to ruin me you and that blackguard da souza who brought me here if you had succeeded in lumping those shares upon the market today or tomorrow you know very well what the result would have been i dont know whose game you have been playing but i can guess  i can assure you mr trent the manager declared in his suavest and most professional manner that you are acting under a complete misapprehension i will admit that our notice was a little short suppose we withdraw it altogether eh i am quite satisfied we will put back the shares in the safe and you shall keep your money  no im dd if you do trent answered bluntly youve had your money and ill have the shares i dont leave this bank without them and ill be shot if ever i enter it again  so trent with his back against the wall and not a friend to help him faced for twentyfour hours the most powerful bull syndicate which had ever been formed against a single company inquiries as to his right of title had poured in upon him and to all of them he had returned the most absolute and final assurances yet he knew when closingtime came that he had exhausted every farthing he possessed in the worldit seemed hopeless to imagine that he could survive another day but with the morning came a booming cable from bekwando there had been a great find of gold before ever a shaft had been sunk an expert from whom as yet nothing had been heard wired an excited and wonderful report then the men who had held on to their bekwandos rustled their morning papers and walked smiling to their offices prices leaped up trents directors ceased to worry him and wired invitations to luncheon at the west end the bulls were the sport of everybody when closingtime came trent had made 100000 pounds and was looked upon everywhere as one of the rocks of finance  only then he began to realise what the strain had been to him his hard impassive look had never altered he had been seen everywhere in his accustomed city haunts his hat a little better brushed than usual his clothes a little more carefully put on his buttonhole more obvious and his laugh readier no one guessed the agony through which he had passed no one knew that he had spent the night at a little inn twelve miles away to which he had walked after nine oclock at night he had not a single confidant even his cashier had no idea whence came the large sums of money which he had paid away right and left but when it was all over he left the city and leaning back in the corner of his little brougham was driven away to pont street here he locked himself in his room took off his coat and threw himself upon a sofa with a big cigar between his teeth  if you let any one in to see me miles he told the footman ill kick you out of the house so though the bell rang often he remained alone but as he lay there with halfclosed eyes living again through the tortures of the last few hours he heard a voice that startled him it was surely hersalready he sprang up and opened the door ernestine and captain francis were in the hall  he motioned them to follow him into the room ernestine was flushed and her eyes were very bright she threw up her veil and faced him haughtily where is he she asked i know everything i insist upon seeing him at once  that he said coolly will depend upon whether he is fit to see you  he rang the bell  tell miss fullagher to step this way a moment he ordered  he is in this house then she cried he took no notice in a moment a young woman dressed in the uniform of one of the principal hospitals entered  miss fullagher he asked how is the patient  weve had a lot of trouble with him sir she said significantly he was terrible all last night and hes very weak this morning is this the young lady sir  this is the young lady who i told you would want to see him when you thought it advisable  the nurse looked doubtful sir henry is upstairs sir she said i had better ask his advice  trent nodded and she withdrew the three were left alone ernestine and francis remained apart as though by design trent was silent  she returned in a moment or two  sir henry has not quite finished his examination sir she announced the young lady can come up in half an hour  again they were left alone then trent crossed the room and stood between them and the door  before you see your father miss wendermott he said i have an explanation to make to you    chapter xli   she looked at him calmly but in her set white face he seemed to read already his sentence  do you think it worth while mr trent there is so much as you put it to be explained that the task even to a man of your versatility seems hopeless  i shall not trouble you long he said at least one mans word should be as good as anothersand you have listened to what my enemyhe motioned towards francishas to say  francis shrugged his shoulders  i can assure you he interrupted that i have no feeling of enmity towards you in the slightest my opinion you know i have never troubled to conceal it but i deny that i am prejudiced by any personal feeling  trent ignored his speech  what i have to say to you he continued addressing ernestine i want to say before you see your father i wont take up your time i wont waste words i take you back ten years to when i met him at attra and we became partners in a certain enterprise your father at that time was a harmless wreck of a man who was fast killing himself with brandy he had some money i had none with it we bought the necessary outfit and presents for my enterprise and started for bekwando the whole of the work fell to my share and with great trouble i succeeded in obtaining the concessions we were working for your father spent all his time drinking and playing cards when i would play with him the agreement as to the sharing of the profits was drawn up it is true by me but at that time he made no word of complaint i had no relations he described himself as cut off wholly from his it was here francis first came on the scene he found your father half drunk and when he read the agreement it was plain what he thought he thought that i was letting your father kill himself that the whole thing might be mine he has probably told you so i deny it i did all i could to keep him sober  on our homeward way your father was ill and our bearers deserted us we were pursued by the natives who repented their concession and i had to fight them more than once half a dozen strong with your father unconscious at my feet it is true that i left him in the bush but it was at his bidding and i believed him dying it was my only chance and i took it i escaped and reached attra then to raise money to reach england i had to borrow from a man named da souza and afterwards in london to start the company i had to make him my partner in the profits of the concession one day i quarrelled with himit was just at the time i met youand then for the first time i heard of your fathers being alive i went out to africa to bring him back and da souza followed me in abject fear for as my partner he lost half if your fathers claim was good i found your father infirm and only half sane i did all i could for him whilst i worked in the interior and meant to bring him back to england with me when i came unfortunately he recovered a little and suddenly seized upon the idea of visiting england he left before me and fell into the hands of da souza who had the best possible reasons in the world for keeping him in the background i rescued him from them in time to save him from death and brought him to my own house sent for doctors and nurses and when he was fit for you to see i should have sent for you i did not ill admit make any public declaration of his existence for the simple reason that it would have crippled our company and there are the interests of the shareholders to be considered but i executed and signed a deed of partnership days ago which makes him an equal sharer in every penny i possess now this is the truth miss wendermott and if it is not a story i am particularly proud of i dont very well see what else i could have done it is my story and it is a true one will you believe it or will you take his word against mine  she would have spoken but francis held up his hand  my story he said coolly has been told behind your back it is only fair to repeat it to your face i have told miss wendermott thisthat i met you first in the village of bekwando with a concession in your hand made out to you and her father jointly with the curious proviso that in the event of the death of one the other was his heir i pointed out to miss wendermott that you were in the prime of life and in magnificent condition while her father was already on the threshold of the grave and drinking himself into a fever in a squalid hut in a village of swamps i told her that i suspected foul play that i followed you both and found her father left to the tender mercies of the savages deserted by you in the bush i told her that many months afterwards he disappeared simultaneously with your arrival in the country that a day or two ago you swore to me you had no idea where he was that has been my story trent let miss wendermott choose between them  i am content trent cried fiercely your story is true enough but it is cunningly linked together you have done your worst choose  for ever afterwards he was glad of that single look of reproach which seemed to escape her unwittingly as her eyes met his but she turned away and his heart was like a stone  you have deceived me mr trent i am very sorry and very disappointed  and you he cried passionately are you yourself so blameless were you altogether deceived by your relations or had you never a suspicion that your father might still be alive you had my message through mr cuthbert i met you day by day after you knew that i had been your fathers partner and never once did you give yourself away were you tarred with the same brush as those canting snobs who doomed a poor old man to a living death doesnt it look like it what am i to think of you  your judgment mr trent she answered quietly is of no importance to me it does not interest me in any way but i will tell you this if i did not disclose myself it was because i distrusted you i wanted to know the truth and i set myself to find it out  your friendship was a lie then he cried with flashing eyes to you i was nothing but a suspected man to be spied upon and betrayed  she faltered and did not answer him outside the nurse was knocking at the door trent waved them away with an imperious gesture  be off he cried both of you you can do your worst i thank heaven that i am not of your class whose men have flints for hearts and whose women can lie like angels  they left him alone and trent with a groan plucked from his heart the one strong sweet hope which had changed his life so wonderfully upstairs monty was sobbing with his little girls arms about him    chapter xlii   with the darkness had come a wind from the sea and the boy crept outside in his flannels and planters hat and threw himself down in a cane chair with a little murmur of relief below him burned the white lights of the town a little noisier than usual tonight for out in the bay a steamer was lyingto and there had been a few passengers and cargo to land the boy had had a hard days work or he would have been in the town himself to watch for arrivals and wait for the mail he closed his eyes half asleep for the sun had been hot and the murmurs of the sea below was almost like a lullaby as he lay there a mans voice from the path reached him he sprang up listening intently it must have been fancyand yet he leaned over the wooden balcony the figure of a man loomed out through the darkness came nearer became distinct fred recognised him with a glad shout  trent he cried scarlett trent by all thats amazing  trent held out his hand quickly somehow the glad young voice quivering with excitement touched his heart in an unexpected and unusual manner it was pleasant to be welcomed like thisto feel that one person in the world at least was glad of his coming for trent was a sorely stricken man and the flavour of life had gone from him many a time he had looked over the steamers side during that long lonely voyage and gazed almost wishfully into the sea in whose embrace was rest it seemed to him that he had been a gambler playing for great stakes and the turn of the wheel had gone against him  fred  they stood with hands locked together the boy breathless with surprise then he saw that something was wrong  what is it trent he asked quickly have we gone smash after all or have you been ill  trent shook his head and smiled gravely  neither he said the company is booming i believe civilised ways didnt agree with me im afraid thats all ive come back to have a month or twos hard workthe best physic in the world  i am delighted to see you fred said heartily everythings going a1 here and theyve built me this little bungalow only got in it last weekstunning isnt it butjust fancy your being here again so soon are your traps coming up  i havent many trent answered theyre on the way have you got room for me  room for you the boy repeated scornfully why im all alone here its the only thing against the place being a bit lonely room for you i should think there is here dick dinner at once and some wine  trent was taken to see his room the boy talking all the time and later on dinner was served and the boy did the honours chaffing and talking lightly but later on when they sat outside smoking furiously to keep off the mosquitoes and watching the fireflies dart in and out amongst the trees the boy was silent then he leaned over and laid his hand on trents arm  tell me all about itdo he begged  trent was startled touched and suddenly filled with a desire for sympathy such as he had never before in his life experienced he hesitated but it was only for a moment  i never thought to tell any one he said slowly i think id like to  and he did he told his whole story he did not spare himself he spoke of the days of his earlier partnership with monty and he admitted the apparent brutality of his treatment of him on more than one occasion he spoke of ernestine tooof his strange fancy for the photograph of montys little girl a fancy which later on when he met her became almost immediately the dominant passion of his life then he spoke of the coming of francis of the awakening of ernestines suspicions and of that desperate moment when he risked everything on her faith in himand lost there was little else to tell and afterwards there was a silence but presently the boys hand fell upon his arm almost caressingly and he leaned over through the darkness  women are such idiots the boy declared with all the vigour and certainty of long experience if only aunt ernestine had known you half as well as i do she would have been quite content to have trusted you and to have believed that what you did was for the best but i say trent you ought to have waited for it after she had seen her father and talked with him she must have understood you better i shall write to her  but trent shook his head  no he said sternly it is too late now that moment taught me all i wanted to know it was her love i wanted fred andthatno use hoping for that or she would have trusted me after all i was half a madman ever to have expected ita rough coarse chap like me with only a smattering of polite ways it was madness some day i shall get over it well chuck work for a bit soon fred and go for some lions thatll give us something to think about at any rate    but the lions which trent might have shot lived in peace for on the morrow he was restless and ill and within a week the deadly fever of the place had him in its clutches the boy nursed him and the german doctor came up from attra and when he learnt who his patient was took up his quarters in the place but for all his care and the boys nursing things went badly with scarlett trent  to him ended for a while all measure of daystime became one long night full of strange tormenting flashes of thought passing like red fire before his burning eyes sometimes it was monty crying to him from the bush sometimes the yelling of those savages at bekwando seemed to fill the air sometimes ernestine was there listening to his passionate pleading with cold set face in the dead of night he saw her and the still silence was broken by his hoarse passionate cries which they strove in vain to check and when at last he lay white and still with exhaustion the doctor looked at the boy and softly shook his head he had very little hope  trent grew worse in those rare flashes of semiconsciousness which sometimes come to the feverstricken he reckoned himself a dying man and contemplated the end of all things without enthusiasm and without regret the one and only failure of his life had eaten like canker into his heart it was death he craved for in the hot burning nights and death came and sat a grisly shadow at his pillow the doctor and the boy did their best but it was not they who saved him  there came a night when he raved and the sound of a womans name rang out from the open windows of the little bungalow rang out through the drawn mosquito netting amongst the palmtrees across the surftopped sea to the great steamer which lay in the bay perhaps she heard itperhaps after all it was a fancy only in the midst of his fever a hand as soft as velvet and as cool as the night seawind touched his forehead and a voice sounded in his ears so sweetly that the blood burned no longer in his veins so sweetly that he lay back upon his pillow like a man under the influence of a strong narcotic and slept then the doctor smiled and the boy sobbed  i came she said softly because it was the only atonement i could make i ought to have trusted you do you know even my father told me that  i have made mistakes he said and of course behaved badly to him  now that everything has been explained she said i scarcely see what else you could have done at least you saved him from da souza when his death would have made you a freer man he is looking forward to seeing you you must make haste and get strong  for his sake he murmured  she leaned over and caressed him lightly for mine dear
