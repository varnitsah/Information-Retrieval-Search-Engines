philosophyin two expositions   first exposition a story of seven devils   second exposition grandisons quandary  plain fishing      amos kilbright his adscititious experiences  this story is told by mr richard colesworthy an attorneyatlaw in a large town in one of our eastern states the fact that mr colesworthy is a practical man and but little given outside of his profession to speculative theorizing adds a weight to his statements which they might not otherwise possess  in the practice of my profession i am in the habit of meeting with all sorts and conditions of men women and even children but i do not know that i ever encountered anyone who excited in me a greater interest than the man about whom i am going to tell you  i was busily engaged one morning in my office which is on the ground floor of my dwelling and opens upon the street when after a preliminary knock a young man entered and asked leave to speak with me he was tall and well made plainly but decently dressed and with a fresh healthy color on his smoothly shaven face there was something in his air a sort of respectful awkwardness which was not without a suggestion of good breeding and in his countenance there was an annoyed or troubled expression which did not sit well upon it i asked him to take a chair and as he did so the thought came to me that i should like to be of service to him of course i desire to aid and benefit all my clients but there are some persons whose appearance excites in one an instinctive sympathy and toward whom there arise at first sight sentiments of kindliness the man had said almost nothing it was simply his manner that had impressed me i mention these points because generally i do not take an interest in persons until i know a good deal about them  what can i do for you i asked  the man did not immediately answer but began searching for something in one of the pockets of his coat the little awkwardness which i had first noticed now became more apparent he appeared to be looking for his pockets rather than for what might be in one of them he was conscious of his ungainliness and reddened a little as he fumbled on the inside and outside of his coat  i pray you pardon me he said but i will bring before you instantly the matter of my business  and so saying he got his hand into a breast pocket and drew out a little packet there was a certain intonation of his voice which at first made me think that he was not an american but in that intonation there was really nothing foreign he was certainly a stranger he might be from the backwoods and both his manner and speech appeared odd to me but soon i had no doubt about his being my countryman in fact there was something in his general appearance which seemed to me to be distinctively american  i came to you sir he said to ask if you would have the goodness to purchase one or more of these tickets and he held out to me a card entitling one person to admission to a séance to be given by a party of spiritualists in one of the public buildings of the town  a feeling of anger arose within me i was chagrined to think that i had begun to interest myself in a person who merely came to interrupt me in my business by trying to sell me tickets to a spiritualistic exhibition my instant impulse was to turn from the man and let him see that i was offended by his intrusion but my reason told me that he had done nothing that called for resentment if i had expected something more important from him that was my affair he had not pretended to have any other business than that which brought him  and besides he offered me something which in fact i wanted i am a member of a society for psychical research which about a year before had been organized in our town it is composed almost exclusively of persons who are desirous of honestly investigating the facts as well as theories connected with the spiritual phenomena not only of our own day but of all ages we had heard of the spiritualistic exhibitions which were to be given in our town and i with a number of my fellowmembers had determined to attend them if there was anything real or tangible in the performances of these people we wanted to know it considering all this it would be foolish for me to be angry with a man who had brought me the very tickets i intended to buy and instead of turning away from him i took out my pocketbook  i will take one ticket for each of the three séances i said and i placed the money on the table  i should have been glad to buy two sets of tickets one for my wife but i knew this would be useless she did not belong to our society and took no interest in its investigations  these things are all tricks and nonsense she said i dont want to know anything about them and if they were true i most certainly would not want to know anything about them  so i contented myself with the tickets for my own use and as the man slowly selected them from his little package i asked him if he had sold many of them  these you now buy are the first of which i have made disposal he answered for two days i have endeavored to sell them but to no purpose there are many people to whom i cannot bring myself to speak upon the matter and those i have asked care not for these things i would not have come to you but having twice passed your open window i liked your face and took courage  i smiled so this man had been studying me before i began to study him and this discovery revived in me the desire that he had come on some more interesting business than that of selling tickets a thing he did so badly as to make me wonder why he had undertaken it  i imagine said i that this sort of business is out of your line  he looked at me a moment and then with earnestness exclaimed entirely utterly absolutely i am altogether unfitted for this calling and it is an injustice to those who send me out for me to longer continue in it some other person might sell their tickets i cannot and yet he said with a sigh what is there that i may do  the idea that that strong wellgrown man should have any difficulty in finding something to do surprised me if he chose to go out and labor with his handsand surely no man who was willing to wander about selling tickets should object to thatthere would be no difficulty in his obtaining a livelihood in our town  if you want regular employment i said i think you can easily find it  i want it he answered his face clouded by a troubled expression but i cannot take it  cannot take it i exclaimed  no he said i am not my own master i am as much a slave as any negro hereabouts  i was rather surprised at this meaningless allusion but contented myself with asking him what he meant by not being his own master  he looked on the floor and then he looked at me with a steady earnest gaze i should like well to tell you my story he said i have been ordered not to tell it but i have resolved that when i should meet a man to whom i should be moved to speak i would speak  now i felt a very natural emotion of pride my perception of objects of interest was a quick and a correct one speak on i said i shall be very glad to hear what you have to say  he looked toward the open door i arose and closed it when i had resumed my seat he drew his chair closer to me leaned toward me and said  in the first place you should know that i am a materialized spirit  i sat up hard pressed against the back of my chair  nay start not he said i am now as truly flesh and blood as you are but a short three weeks ago i was a spirit in the realms of endless space i know he continued that my history is a sore thing to inflict upon any man and there are few to whom i would have broached it but i will make it brief three weeks ago these spiritualists held privately in this town what they call a séance and at that time i was impelled by a power i understood not to appear among them after i had come it was supposed that a mistake had been made and that i was not the spirit wanted in the temporary confusion occasioned by this supposition and while the attention of the exhibitors was otherwise occupied i was left exposed to the influence of the materializing agencies for a much longer time than had been intended so long indeed that instead of remaining in the misty indistinct form in which spirits are presented by these men to their patrons i became as thoroughly embodied as full of physical life and energy and as complete a mortal man as i was when i disappeared from this earth one hundred and two years ago  one hundred and two years i mechanically ejaculated there was upon me the impulse to get up and go where i could breathe the outer air to find my wife and talk to her about marketing or some household affair to get away from this beinghuman or whatever he wasbut this was impossible that interest which dawned upon me when i first perceived my visitor now held me as if it had been a spell  yes he said i deceased in 1785 being then in my thirtieth year i was a citizen of bixbury on the massachusetts coast but i am not unconnected with this place old mr scott of your town is my grandson  i am obliged to chronicle the fact that my present part in this conversation consisted entirely of ejaculations old mr scott your grandson i said  yes he replied my daughter who was but two years old when i left her married lemuel scott of bixbury who moved to this town soon after old mr scott was born it was indeed on account of this good old man that i became materialized he was present at the private séance of which i have spoken and being asked if he would like to see a person from the other world he replied that he should be pleased to behold his grandfather when the necessary influences were set to work i appeared the spiritualists who without much thought had conceived the idea that the grandfather of old mr scott ought in the ordinary nature of things to be a very venerable personage were disappointed when they saw me and concluded i was one who by some mistake had been wrongfully summoned they therefore set me aside as it were and occupied themselves with other matters old mr scott went away unsatisfied and strengthened in his disbelief in the powers of the spiritualists while i as i have before said was left unnoticed under the power of the materializing force until i was made corporeal as i am now when the spiritualists discovered what had happened they were much disturbed and immediately set about to dematerialize me for it is not their purpose or desire to cause departed spirits to again become inhabitants of this world but all their efforts were of no avail i remained as much a man as anyone of themselves they found me in full health and vigor for i had never had a days sickness in my life having come to my death by drowning while foolishly swimming too far from land in a strong ebb tide and my body being carried out to sea was never recovered being thus put to their wits end they determined to keep the matter privy and to make the best of it and the first necessity was to provide me with clothing for on my second entrance into this world i was as totally without apparel as when i first came into it they gave me these garments of the ordinary fashion of the day but to which i find myself much unaccustomed and enjoined upon me to keep silent in regard to what had happened fearing as i was made aware by some unguarded words that their efforts to dematerialize me might bring them into trouble  my professional instincts now came to the front that would be murder i said and nothing less  so i myself told them he continued for i had come to the determination that i would choose to finish out the life i had broken off so suddenly but they paid little heed to my words and continued their experiments but as i have told you their efforts were without avail and they have ceased to make further trial of dematerialization as of course it would be impossible to keep a fullgrown man for any considerable length of time secluded and unseen they judged it wise to permit me to appear as an ordinary human being and having no other use to which they could put me they set me to selling tickets for them and in this business i have fared so badly that i shall restore to them these that are left and counsel them to seek another agent i being of detriment to them rather than profit what may then happen i do not know for as i told you i am not my own master  i do not understand you i said if you have been in this unparalleled manner restored to your physical existence surely you are free to do as you please what these spiritualists have done for you was done by accident they intended you no benefit and they have no claim upon you  that is true he said with a sigh but they have a hold upon me it was but yesterday that they informed me that although so far they had failed to restore me to what they call my normal spiritual existence they had every reason to believe that they soon would be able to do so a psychic scientist of germany has discovered a process of dematerialization and they have sent to him for his formula this in a short time they expect to receive and they assure me that they will not hesitate to put it in force if i should cause them trouble now sir he continued and as he spoke there was a moisture about his eyes i am very fond of life i have been restored to that mortality from which i was suddenly snatched by the cruel sea and i do not wish to lose it again until i have lived out my natural term of years my family is one of long life and i feel that i have a right to fifty more years of existence and this strong desire for the natural remainder of my life is that which gives these men their power over me i was never a coward but i cannot but fear those who may at any moment cause this form these limbs my physical state and life to vanish like a candleflame blown out  my sympathies were now strongly aroused in behalf of the subject of these most extraordinary conditions that which you fear must not be allowed i said no man has the right to take away the life of another no matter what plan or method he may use i will see the spiritualists and make it plain to them that what they threaten they cannot be allowed to do  the man arose sir he said i feel that i have truly found a friend whatever may happen to me i shall never forget your kindness to a very stranger he held out his hand and i stood up by him and took it it was as much a flesh and blood hand as my own  what is your name i asked you have not yet told me that  i am amos kilbright of bixbury he answered  you have not revisited your native place i said  no he replied i much desire to do so but i have no money for a journey even on foot and i doubt me much if those men would suffer me to go to bixbury  and have you spoken to your grandson old mr scott i said it is but right that you should make yourself known to him  so have i thought he answered and i have felt an earnest drawing toward my daughters child i have seen him thrice but have not had the heart to speak to him and declare myself the progenitor of that mother whose memory i know he cherishes  you shall make yourself known to him i said i will prepare the way  he shook me again by the hand and took his leave without a word he was deeply affected  i reseated myself by my table one thought after another rushing through my mind had ever man heard a story such as this what were all the experiences of the members of the society for psychical research their stories of apparitions their instances of occult influences their best authenticated incidents of supernaturalism compared to this experience of mine should i hasten and tell it all to my wife i hesitated if what i had heard should not be trueand this my first doubt or suspicion impressed upon me how impossible to me had been doubt or suspicion during the presence of my visitorit would be wrong to uselessly excite her mind on the other hand if i had heard nothing but the truth what would happen should she sympathize as deeply with amos kilbright as i did and then should that worthy man suddenly become dematerialized perhaps before her very eyes no i would not tell herat least not yet but i must see the spiritualists and that afternoon i went to them  the leader and principal worker of the men who were about to give a series of spiritual manifestations in our town was mr corbridge a man of middleage with a large head and earnest visage when i spoke to him of amos kilbright he was very much annoyed  so he has been talking to you he said and after all the warnings i gave him well he does that sort of thing at his own risk  we all do things at our own risk i said and he has as much right to choose his line of conduct as anybody else  no he hasnt said mr corbridge he belongs to us and it is for us to choose his line of conduct for him  that is nonsense said i you have no more right over him than i have  now then said mr corbridge his eyes beginning to sparkle i may as well talk plainly to you my associates and myself have considered this matter very carefully at first we thought that if this fellow should tell his story we would simply poohpooh the whole of it and let people think he was a little touched in his mind which would be so natural a conclusion that everybody might be expected to come to it but as we have determined to dematerialize him his disappearance would bring suspicion upon us and we might get into trouble if he should be considered a mere commonplace person so we decided to speak out plainly say what we had done and what we were going to do and thus put ourselves at the head of the spirit operators of the world but we are not yet ready to do anything or to make our announcements and if he had held his tongue we might have given him a pretty long string  and do you mean i said that you and your associates positively intend to dematerialize mr kilbright  certainly he answered  then i declare such an act would be inhuman a horrible crime  no said mr corbridge it would be neither in the first place he isnt human it is by accident that he is what he is but it was our affair entirely and it was a most wonderfully fortunate thing for us that it happened at first it frightened us a little but we have got used to it now and we see the great opportunities that this entirely unparalleled case will give us as he is he is of no earthly good to anybody you cant take a man out of the last century and expect him to get on in any sort of business at the present day he is too oldfashioned he doesnt know how we do things in the year eighteen eightyseven we put this subject to work selling tickets just to keep him occupied but he cant even do that but as a spirit who can be materialized or dematerialized whenever we please he will be of the greatest value to us when a spirit has been brought out as strongly as he has been it will be the easiest thing in the world to do it again every time you bring one out the less trouble it is to make it appear the next time you want it and in this case the conditions are so favorable that it will be absolute business suicide in us if we allow ourselves to lose the chance of working it so you see sir that we have marked out our course and i assure you that we intend to stick to it  and i assure you said i rising to go that i shall make it my business to interfere with your wicked machinations  mr corbridge laughed youll find he said that we have turned this thing over pretty carefully and we are ready for whatever the courts may do if we are charged with making away with anybody we can if we like make him appear alive and well before judge and jury and then what will there be to say against us besides we are quite sure that no laws can be found against bringing beings from the other world or sending them back into it provided it can be proved by the subjects admission or in any other manner that he really died once in a natural way you cannot be tried for causing a mans death a second time  i was not prepared to make any answer on this point but i went away with a firm resolution to protect amos kilbright in the full enjoyment of his reassumed physical existence if the power of law or any other power could do it  the next morning mr corbridge called on me at my office i shall be very sorry he said if any of my remarks of yesterday should cause unpleasant feelings between us we are desirous of being on good terms with everybody especially with members of the society for psychical research you ought to work with us  we do not work with you i replied nor ever shall our object is to search earnestly and honestly into the subject of spiritual manifestation and not to make money out of unfortunate subjects of experiment  you misunderstand us said he but i am not going to argue the question i wish to be on good terms with you and to act fairly and plainly all around we find that we cannot make use of the dematerialization process as soon as we expected for the german scientist who controls it has declined to send us his formula but has consented to come over and work it on this subject himself his engagements will not allow him to visit this country immediately but he is very enthusiastic about it and he is bound to come before long now as you seem to be interested in this exkilbright we will make you an offer we will give him into your charge until we want him he is of no use to us as he cant tell us anything about spiritual matters his present memory beginning just where it broke off when he sank in the ocean in seventeen eightyfive but he might be very useful to a man who was inclined to study up oldtime manners and customs and so if it suits you we will make him over to you agreeing to give you three days notice before we take any measures to dematerialize him we are not afraid of your getting away with him for our power over him will be all the same no matter where he is  i will have no man made over to me said i and mr kilbright being his own master can do with himself what he pleases but as i said before i shall protect him and do everything in my power to thwart your schemes against him and you must remember he will have other friends besides me he has relatives in this town  none but old mr scott at least so far as i know said corbridge and he need not expect any help from him for that ancient personage is a most arrant disbeliever in spiritualism  and with this remark he took his leave  that very afternoon came to me amos kilbright his face shining with pleasure he greeted me warmly and thanked me for having so kindly offered to give him employment by which he might live and feel under obligations to no man  i had promised nothing of the kind and my mind was filled with abhorrence of such men as corbridge who would not only send a person into the other world simply to gratify a scientific curiosity or for purposes of profit but would rehabilitate a departed spirit with all his lost needs and appetites and then foist him upon a comparative stranger for care and sustenance such conduct was not only mean but criminal in its nature and if there was no law against it one ought to be made  kilbright then proceeded to tell me how happy he had been when corbridge informed him that his dematerialization had been indefinitely postponed and that i had consented to take him into my service it is now plain to me he said that they have no power to do this thing and cannot obtain it from others this discardment of me proves that they have abandoned their hopes  it was evident that corbridge had said nothing of the expected coming of the german scientist and i would not be cruel enough to speak of it myself besides i intended to have said scientist arrested and put under bonds as soon as he set foot on our shores  i do not feel continued kilbright that i am beginning a new life but that i am taking up my old one at the point where i left it off  you cannot do that i said things have changed very much and you will have to adapt yourself to those changes in many ways you must begin again  i know that he said and with respect to much that i see about me i am but a child but as i am truly a man i shall begin to do a mans work and what i know not of the things that are about me that will i learn as quickly as may be it is my purpose sir to labor with you in any manner which you may deem fit and in which i may be found serviceable until i have gained sufficient money to travel to bixbury and there endeavor to establish myself in some worthy employment i had at that place a small estate but of that i shall take no heed without doubt it has gone rightly to my heirs and even if i could deprive them of it i would not  have you living heirs besides your grandson here i asked  that i know not he said but if there be such i greatly long to see them  and how about old mr scott said i when shall we go to him and tell him who you are  i greatly desire that that may be done soon answered kilbright but first i wish to establish myself in some means of livelihood so that he may not think that i come to him for maintenance  of course it was not possible for me to turn this man away and tell him i had nothing for him to do and therefore i must devise employment for him i found that he wrote a fair hand a little stiff and labored but legible and neat and as i had a good deal of copying to do i decided to set him to work upon this i procured board and lodging for him in a house near by and a very happy being was amos kilbright  as for me i felt that i was doing my duty and a good work but the responsibility was heavy and my road was not at all clear before me my principal source of anxiety was in regard to my wife should i tell her the truth about my new copyist or not in the course of a night i resolved this question and determined to tell her everything when the man was merely mr corbridges subject the case was different but to have daily in my office a clerk who had been drowned one hundred and two years before and not tell mrs colesworthy of it would be an injustice to her  when i first made known to her the facts of the case my wife declared that she believed psychics had turned my brain but when i offered to show her the very man who had been materialized she consented to go down and look at him i informed kilbright that my wife knew his story and we three had a long and very interesting conversation after an hours talk during which my wife asked a great many questions which i should never have thought of we went upstairs and left kilbright to his work  his story is a most wonderful one said mrs colesworthy but i dont believe he is a materialized spirit because the thing is impossible still it will not do to make any mistakes and we must try all we can to help him in case he was drowned when he says he was and that german comes over to end his mortal career a second time science is getting to be such a wicked thing that i am sure if he crosses the ocean on purpose to dematerialize mr kilbright he will try to do it in some way or other whether the poor man was ever a spirit before or not one thing however is certain i want to be present when old mr scott is told that that young man is his grandfather  mr kilbright worked very assiduously and soon proved himself of considerable use to me when he had lived in bixbury he had been a surveyor and a farmer and now when he finished his copying duties for the day or when i had no work of that kind ready for him it delighted him much to go into my garden and rake and hoe among the flowers and vegetables i frequently walked with him about the town showing and explaining to him the great changes that had taken place since the former times in which he had lived but he was not impressed by these things as i expected him to be  it seems to me he said as though i were in a foreign country and i look upon what lies about me as if everything had always been as i see it this town is so different from anything i have ever known that i cannot imagine it has changed from a condition which was once familiar to me at bixbury however i think the case will be otherwise if there are changes there i shall notice them in a little place like that however i have hopes that the changes will not be great  he was very conservative and i could see that in many cases he thought the old ways of doing things much better than the new ones he was however a polite and sensible man and knew better than to make criticisms to one who had befriended him but in some cases he could not conceal his disapprobation he had seen a train of cars before i met him and i was not able to induce him to approach again a railroad track whatever other feelings he may have had at first sight of a train in motion were entirely swallowed up in his abhorrence of this mode of travelling  we must not be in a hurry said my wife when we talked of these matters when he gets more accustomed to these things he will be more surprised at them  there were some changes however which truly did astonish him and these were the alterationsin his opinion entirely uncalled for and unwarrantablewhich had been made in the spelling of the words of our language since he had gone to school no steamengine no application of electricity none of the modern inventions which i showed him caused him the emotions of amazement which were occasioned by the information that in this country honor was now spelled without a u  during this time mr kilbrights interest in his grandson seemed to be on the increase he would frequently walk past the house of that old gentleman merely for the purpose of looking at him as he sat by the open window reading his newspaper or quietly smoking his evening pipe on a bench in his side yard when he had been with me about ten days he said i now feel that i must go and make myself known to my grandson i am earning my own subsistence and however he may look upon me he need not fear that i am come to be a burden upon him you will not wonder sir that i long to meet with this son of the little baby girl i left behind me  i did not wonder and my wife and i agreed to go with him that very evening to old mr scotts house the old gentleman received us very cordially in his little parlor  you are a stranger in this town sir he said to kilbright i did not exactly catch your namekilbright he said when it had been repeated to him that is one of my family names but it is long since i have heard of anyone bearing it my mother was a kilbright but she had no brothers and no uncles of the name my grandfather was the last of our branch of the kilbrights his name was amos and he was a bixbury man from what part of the country do you come sir  my name is amos and i was born in bixbury  old mr scott sat up very straight in his chair young man that seems to me impossible he exclaimed how could there be any kilbrights in bixbury and i not know of it then taking a pair of big silver spectacles from his pocket he put them on and attentively surveyed his visitor whose countenance during this scrutiny was filled with emotion  presently the old gentleman took off his spectacles and rising from his chair went into another room quickly returning he brought with him a small oilpainting in a narrow oldfashioned frame he stood it up on a table in a position where a good light from the lamp fell upon it it was the portrait of a young man with a fresh healthy face dressed in an oldstyle highcollared coat with a wide cravat coming up under his chin and a bit of ruffle sticking out from his shirtbosom my wife and i gazed at it with awe  that said old mr scott is the picture of my grandfather amos kilbright taken at twentyfive he was drowned at sea some years afterward but exactly how i do not know my mother did not remember him at all and i must say he continued putting on his spectacles again that there is something of a family likeness between you sir and that picture if it wasnt for the continental clothes in the painting there would be a good deal of resemblanceyes a very great deal  it is my portrait said mr kilbright his voice trembling as he spoke it was painted by tatlow munson in the winter of seventeen eighty in payment for my surveying a large tract of land north of the town he having no money to otherwise compensate me he wrote his name in ink upon the back of the canvas  old mr scott took up the picture and turned it around and there we all saw plainly written upon the timestained back tatlow munson 1780  old mr scott laid the picture upon the table took off his spectacles and with wideopen eyes gazed first at mr kilbright and then at us  the sight of the picture had finished the conversion of my wife oh mr scott she cried leaning so far forward in her chair that it seemed as if she were about to go down on her knees before the old man this gentleman is your grandfather yes he is indeed oh dont discard him for it was you who were the cause of his being here dont you remember when you went to the spiritualist meeting and asked to see the spirit of your grandfather that spirit came but you didnt know it the people who materialized him were surprised when they saw this young man and they thought he couldnt be your grandfather and so they didnt say anything about it and they left him right in the middle of whatever they use and he kept on materializing without their thinking of him until he became just what you see him now and if he now wore oldfashioned clothes with a queue he would be the exact image of that portrait of him which you have only a little bit older looking and fuller in the face but the spiritualists made him cut off his long hair because they said that wouldnt do in these days and dressed him in those common clothes just like any other person and oh dear mr scott you must see for yourself that he is truly your grandfather  old mr scott made no answer but still sat with wideopen eyes gazing from one to the other of us as i looked at that aged whitehaired man and thought of his mother who must have died ever so long ago being the daughter of the young man who sat opposite to him it was indeed difficult to believe that these things could be so  mr scott exclaimed my wife will you not speak to him will you not give him your hand will you not acknowledge him as your grandfather whose picture you have always had near you and which when a little boy i expect your dear mother has often told you to look up to and try to be like and if you have grown old and he has not on account of differences in circumstances why should that make any difference in your feelings dear mr scott oh why dont you let him take you to his heart i dont see how you can help it she said with a sob and you his little daughters only child  old mr scott rose to his feet he pulled down the sleeves of his coat and gave an adjusting shake to its collar and lapels then he turned to my wife and said madam let us two dance a virginia reel while your husband and that other one take the poker and tongs and beat out the music on the shovel we might as well be durned fools one way as another and all go to the lunatic asylum together  now arose mr kilbright to his feet and stood up very tall grandson lemuel he said i leave not your house in anger i see well that too heavy a task has been laid upon your declining years when you are asked to believe that which you have heard today but i wish you to know that i am here to ask nothing of you save that you will give me your hand i earnestly crave that i may again touch one of my own flesh and blood  old mr scott picked up the portrait and looked at it then he laid it down and looked at mr kilbright young man said he can you stand there and put your hand upon your heart and say to me that you are truly amos kilbright my mothers father who was drowned in the last century and who was brought back and turned into a live man by those spiritualists and that you are willing to come here and let yourself be vouched for by mr and mrs colesworthy who belong to some sort of society of that kind and ought to know about such things  i was on the point of remarking that the society for psychical research had nothing to do with spiritualism except to investigate it but my wife saw my intention and checked me  mr kilbright put his hand upon his heart and bowed what you have heard is true he said on my honor i swear it  then grandfather said old mr scott here is my hand it doesnt do to doubt things in these days i didnt believe in the telephone when they first told me of it but when i had a talk with squire braddon through a wire and heard his new boots creak as he came up to see who it was wanted him and he in his own house a good two miles away i gave in fetch on your wonders says i i am ready and i dont suppose i ought to be any more dumfounded at seeing my grandfather than at any of the other wonders im getting too old now to try to find out the whys and the wherefores of the new things that turn up every day i must just take them as they come and so if you grandfather kilbright and our good friends mr and mrs colesworthy will come into the back room well have a cup of tea and a talk over old times to be sure there will be some gaps which none of us will be able to get over but we must do the best we can  after this mr kilbright and his grandson saw a good deal of each other and the old gentleman always treated his mothers father with the respectful deference which was due to such a relative  there are times he once said to me when this grandfather business looks to me about as big and tough as anything that any human being was ever called on to swallow but then i consider that you and mrs colesworthy have looked into these matters and i havent and that knowin nothin i ought to say nothin and if it ever happens to look particularly tough i just call to mind the telephone and squire braddons creaking boots and that settles it  mr kilbright became more and more useful to me particularly after he had disciplined his mind to the new style of spelling and when he had been with me about a month i insisted that he should take a holiday and visit bixbury for i knew that to do this was the great desire of his heart he could easily reach his native place by rail but believing that he would rather not go at all than travel on a train i procured a saddlehorse for him and when i had given him full directions as to the roads he set out  in four days he returned how did you find bixbury i asked of him  there is no longer such a place he answered sadly i found a town of that name but it is not the bixbury in which i was born that has utterly disappeared  and after this he never again alluded to his native place  the high character and many admirable qualities of this man daily increased the affectionate regard and esteem in which he was held by my wife and myself and feeling that we could do nothing better for him than to endeavor to make him forget the things of the past and take a lively and earnest interest in those of the present we set ourselves to work upon this task in a great degree our efforts were successful and we soon perceived that mr kilbright cared more and more for what he saw about him it was indeed natural that he should do this for he was still a young man and able to adapt himself to changes in his surroundings  as i have said he gradually did so adapt himself and in the course of the autumn this adaptation took a form which at first amused mrs colesworthy and myself and afterward enlisted our hearty sympathy he became attached to miss budworth the librarian of our town library he frequently went there for books and as she was a very intelligent young woman and very willing to aid him in his selections it was not strange that he should become interested in her very often he would remain at the library until it closed in the evening when he would walk to her home with her discoursing upon literary and historical subjects  my wife and i discussed this situation very thoroughly lilian budworth was a good girl a sensible one and a very goodlooking one her family was highly respectable and her years well proportioned to those of mr kilbright there seemed to be therefore no reason why this intimacy should not be encouraged but yet we talked over the matter night after night  you see said my wife it all seems plain and simple enough but on the other hand it isnt in the first place she does not know that he has had a wife or what old mr scott is to him he has promised us that he will never say anything to anybody about having lived in the last century without first consulting us and old mr scott has said over and over again that he doesnt intend to speak of it and the spiritualists have left town long ago so of course she knows nothing about it but if things go on she must be told and what will happen then i would like to know  i am very sorry indeed that i cannot tell you i answered  it would be a queer case anyway mrs colesworthy continued mr kilbright has had a wife but he never was a widower now having been married and never having been a widower it would seem as if he ought not to marry again but his first wife is dead now there can be no doubt about that  it was not long before there was no further need for suppositions in regard to this matter for mr kilbright came to us and announced that he had determined to offer himself in marriage to miss budworth  i think it is meet and proper he said that i should wed and take that position at the head of a family which a rightminded and respectable man of my age should fill i reasoned thus when for the first time i took upon me this pleasing duty and these reasons have now the selfsame weight as then i have been studying the surveying methods of the present day and i believe i could reestablish myself in my former profession thus could i maintain a wife if happily i get her  get her exclaimed mrs colesworthy of course you will get her she cant help accepting you  i should feel the more hope madam said mr kilbright were it not requisite that she be informed of all that has happened to me and all this must she know before i require her to make answer to me  i must admit i said that i am afraid you are going to have a tough job  i dont believe it warmly exclaimed my wife lilian budworth is a girl of good solid sense and when she knows just exactly what has happened it is my opinion she will not object a bit  madam said mr kilbright you greatly embolden me and i shall speak to miss budworth this very day  notwithstanding my wifes confidence in miss lilians good sense she was as much surprised as i when the next morning mr kilbright informed us that he had been accepted as it was yet an hour before the library would open she hurried around to miss budworths home to know all about it  the young lady was found pale but very happy when he left me last night she said my mind was in a strange hubbub he had told me that he loved me and had asked me to marry him and my heart would not let me say anything but yes and yet after he had gone his wondrous story came up before me as it had not come when he told it having just told something else i did not sleep all night thinking of it i have read and pondered a great deal upon these subjects but have never been able to make up my mind whether or not to put faith in the strange spiritual manifestations of which we are told so i determined a good while ago not to consider the matter at all i could do nothing with it and it would be better that i should let it alone to this same determination i came early this morning in the case of mr kilbright none of us know what we may once have been nor what we may become all we know is what we are mr kilbright may be mistaken as to what he was but i know what he is and to that man i give myself as i am i am perfectly satisfied with the present  mrs colesworthy enfolded her in an approbatory embrace and hurried home to tell me about it there now she exclaimed didnt i say that lilian budworth was a girl of good sound commonsense  that is what you said i answered but i must admit that i was afraid her commonsense would interfere with her acceptance of his story we had outside evidence in regard to it but she had only his simple statement  which is quite enough when a woman truly loves said mrs colesworthy  when old mr scott was informed what had happened he put down his newspaper took off his spectacles and smiled a strange wide smile i have been reading he said about a little machine or box that you can talk into and then cork up and send by mail across the ocean to anybody you know there and then he can uncork it and out will come all you have said in your very words and voice with the sniffles and sneezes that might have got in accidental so that if one of the old testament egyptians that theyve been diggin up lately had had one of these boxes with him it might have been uncorked and people could have heard in his own voice just who he was and what was his personal opinion of moses and his brother aaron now when an old man like me has just come to know of a thing of this kind it isnt for him to have a word to say when he is told that lilian budworth is to be his stepgrandmother he must take it in along with the other wonders  as to mr kilbright and his ladylove they troubled themselves about no wonders life was very real to them and very delightful and they were happy despite her resolutions to give no consideration whatever to her lovers previous existence miss budworth did consider it a good deal and talked and thought about it and at last came to understand and appreciate the fact as thoroughly as did mrs colesworthy and myself and she learned much more of mr kilbrights former life than his modesty had allowed him to tell us and some of these things she related with much pride he had been a soldier during the revolution having enlisted at the age of twentythree under general sullivan when his forces lay near newport he afterward followed that commander in his indian campaigns in western new york and served during the rest of the war it was when the army was in winter quarters in 1780 that tatlow munson painted his portrait in payment of an old debt miss budworths glowing rendition of mr kilbrights allusions to some of the revolutionary incidents in which he had had a part made us proud to shake hands with a man who had fought for our liberties and helped to give us the independence which we now enjoy  mr kilbrights business prospects soon began to look promising as was quite natural his ideas upon some subjects were a little antiquated but although many of the changes and improvements he saw about him met with no favor in his eyes he had sense enough to take advantage of certain modern progressive ideas especially such as related to his profession of surveying my introduction of him as a friend from bixbury helped him much in respect to patronage and having devoted all his spare time during the autumn and winter to study and the formation of business connections he secured enough profitable employment for the coming season to justify him in taking to himself a wife and his marriage with miss budworth was appointed for the middle of april  it was about the end of march when i received a letter from mr corbridge the spiritualist manager in which he informed me that dr hildstein the german scientist of whom he had previously spoken to me had set sail for america and would probably arrive in about ten days as soon as possible after his arrival wrote mr corbridge we shall resume possession of the subject of whom you have been kind enough to take charge during the time when we had no need of him he will then be dematerialized in order that we may cause him to manifest himself in our séances whenever it may be desirable but never i may say in the complete and perfect physical condition to which he was unintentionally materialized the first time i promised you that i would give you at least three days notice of our intention to resume work on this subject and i have now been much better than my word i have written very plainly of our intentions because we wish you to understand exactly what we are going to do and should we succeed in our proposed experiment which we certainly expect to do we shall probably make public our whole action in the affair for this course would most greatly benefit both ourselves and our cause it will not be necessary for you to inform the subject of our intention for our power over him will be as great at one time and at one place as at another and as his cooperation is not in any way needful you will see for yourself that it will be pleasanter for him not to concern himself with what we are about to do  when i had read this letter i sat for half an hour with it open in my hands it came upon me like a shower of iced water i had supposed that the spiritualists had utterly abandoned their endeavors to dematerialize mr kilbright therefore the news of the revival of these criminal intentions greatly shocked me to be sure the coming scientist might have no such power as he pretended to possess but this supposition did not comfort me if the man had not already had success in that sort of thing it is not likely that he would come over here to attempt it now  when i had sufficiently quieted my mental agitation i wrote instantly to mr corbridge and in my letter i assumed a very confident tone i told him that mr kilbrights circumstances had so changed that the intended action of the spiritualists in regard to him was now rendered impossible he had become an active member of society had gone into business and would be married in april the mere statement of these facts would i felt quite certainso i wrotecause the spiritualists to instantly relinquish all idea of carrying out their previous intention in regard to this most estimable man if however any inhuman craving for scientific investigation should cause them to persist in their cruel and criminal designs the utmost power of the law should be invoked against them to take away human life i wrote in a case like this is murder no matter how it is done and should you take away mr kilbrights life or even attempt it you shall be indicted and punished for this coldblooded and premeditated crime  before i had read this letter i found it absolutely necessary for my peace of mind that i should make my wife acquainted with the threatened danger and confer with her as to what it would be well to do of course mrs colesworthy was greatly shocked when i read her corbridges letter but she recovered courage sooner than i had done  its all stuff and nonsense she said the man is just as much alive as you and i are and i dont believe any human power can turn him into a spirit they might kill him but then he would be a dead man and not a spiritual mist or vapor i dont believe they even intend to try to do anything of the kind they merely wish you to hand him over to them so they can make him work for them for little or no pay they think and with good reason too that by this time you have taught him how to get along at the present day and that he may now be of some use to them  i showed her the letter i had written and she highly approved of it if i were you she said i would send that letter and then i would not do another thing take my word for it you will never hear from those people again  we resolved of course that we would say nothing to mr kilbright or lilian about this matter for it was unwise to needlessly trouble their minds but we could not help talking about it a great deal ourselves in spite of the reassuring arguments which we continually thought of or spoke of to each other we were troubled anxious and apprehensive  if we could only get them safely married said mrs colesworthy i should feel at ease certainly those people would not do anything to him then  i dont believe they can do anything to him at all i answered but how a marriage is going to protect him i cannot imagine  of course you cant explain such things said my wife but i do wish they were married and settled  not long after this she came to me with a supposition supposing she said that those people find it impossible to dematerialize him they might do something which would be a great deal worse  what could that possibly be i asked  they might materialize his first wife said she and could anything be more dreadful than that i suppose that woman lived to a good old age and to bring her forward now would be a height of cruelty of which i believe those people to be fully capable  my dear i exclaimed dont bring up any harrowing possibilities which no one but yourself is likely to think of  i wish i could be sure of that she said i have heard but i dont know how true it is that spirits cannot be called up and materialized unless somebody wants them and i dont suppose there is anybody who wants the first mrs kilbright but these men might so work on mr kilbrights mind as to make him think that he ought to want her  i groaned dear me i said i suppose if they did that they would also bring up old mr scotts mother and then we should have a united family  and a very funny one it would be said my wife smiling notwithstanding her fears for now i remember that old mr scott told me that his grandmother died before she was sixty but that his mother lived to be seventyfive now he is eighty if he is a day so there would be a regular gradation of ages in the family only it would run backward instead of in the usual way but thinking it over i dont believe the spiritualists will permanently bring up any more of that family if they did they would have to support them for they could not ask old mr scott to do it who hasnt money enough to satisfy his descendants and ought not to be expected to support his ancestors  my letter must have had a good deal of effect upon mr corbridge for in less than a week after it was written he came into my office he informed me that he and his associates were about to give a series of séances in our town but that he had come on before the others in order to talk to me i am extremely sorry he said to hear of this proposed marriage we want to do what is right and fair and we have no desire that any act of ours shall create a widow  then i exclaimed you relinquish your design against mr kilbright  not at all said he we shall carry out our plan before our subject marries if you choose to hurry up matters and have the wedding take place before we are ready to proceed with our dematerializing process we shall be very sorry but the blame must rest on you you should have had consideration enough for all parties to prevent any such complication as an engagement to marry as to what you said in your letter in regard to invoking the law against us i attach no weight whatever to that threat  you will find you have made a great mistake said i angrily when i have brought the law to bear upon you which now i shall not delay to do  you will merely bring ridicule upon yourself he said if you assert that the man you wish to protect is amos kilbright we can prove by records still to be seen in bixbury that said person died in seventeen eightyfive on the other hand if you choose to assert that he is or was anybody else how are you going to prove it all that you can say is that the person you refer to came from you knew not where and has gone you know not where if you declare that at one time he was a materialized spirit you know very well how such a statement as that would be received in a court of law it will be much wiser to let it be supposed that the person who has lately been seen about this town has run off to canada than to make any sort of legal inquiry into the matter if said person were really a man we could have nothing to do with his disappearance while if he were a materialized spirit the law would have nothing to do with him  i arose and paced the floor there was entirely too much force in this mans arguments but although i could not immediately answer him his cool determination to persevere in his iniquitous designs so angered me that i declared that he should be punished if i had to do it myself  then you admit he said with a smile that the law cannot do it the situation he continued is very plain to us although the law can take no cognizance of our action the case will be very different with all believers in spiritualism and those who are interested in us the news that we have done this thing will spread through the spiritualistic circles of the world  has your german arrived i asked abruptly  not yet answered corbridge but we expect him in a few days he will come directly to this town because we wish to give him an opportunity of observing the subject in his present form before beginning the dematerializing process  what refinement of cruelty i exclaimed  oh of course the doctor will not make himself known said corbridge he will merely wish to take a good look at the subject and see for himself how perfect his materialization has been then he will know just what work is before him  and so saying mr corbridge went away leaving me too angry to speak if indeed i could have thought of anything which it would have been worth my while to say  when mrs colesworthy heard what corbridge had said she turned white they must be married instantly she exclaimed i knew that was the only way  it was all very well to talk of an immediate marriage but it was not so easy to bring it about it was yet a week before the day fixed for the wedding and the happy lovers were busy with their preparations never dreaming of the danger which hung over them what reason could we give for hastening the marriage rites at one time we thought it might be wise to explain to them fully the state of the case but from this course we were deterred for fear of the terrible effect that the news might have on lilian should she hear of the design of dr hildstein she would never again have a moments peace married or unmarried once i advised that the two be dissuaded from marrying at least for a year in that time we could see if these people really had any power over mr kilbright  that will not do at all said mrs colesworthy it will be very long to postpone their happiness and besides if that german gets hold of mr kilbright while he is still unmarried he will snap him up or rather blow him out in no time  i thought we had persuaded ourselves i said sadly that no one could have any real power of dematerialization  so we had said she but that sort of persuasion does not always last  the result was that we did nothing but hope for the best but we could not blame ourselves for really there was nothing else to do i had given up all idea of endeavoring to put mr corbridge and his associates under legal restriction because if they had power to do the evil we feared they could do it in one place as well as another and no court could determine when how or by whom mr kilbright had been dematerialized  the day before the weddingday the german doctor arrived in our town and having heard this i went immediately to the hotel where mr corbridge and his party were staying the spiritualistic manager was not glad to see me and frankly said so  i had hoped he remarked that you had concluded to keep out of this thing it is no concern of yours you can be of no possible good to anybody and the wisest thing you can do will be to drop it  i assured him that i had no intention of dropping it and that i should do everything in my power to protect mr kilbright  then again continued corbridge there is really no need of giving yourself all this worry dr hildstein may succeed and he may not we have failed and so may he he has seen the subject and has come to a very philosophical and sensible conclusion in regard to him he will not believe merely on our assertion that the man is a materialized spirit he will proceed with his experiments and if they fail he will consider that the man is a man and was never anything else if they succeed then he will be quite satisfied that he had a perfect right to dematerialize what we had materialized  then you really believe i said that there is a chance that he may fail  of course there is said corbridge i do not know his methods and there may be nothing in them  i had no doubt that this change of tone in corbridge was intended to produce in me a feeling of security that they might thus rid themselves of me but though i saw through his purpose the mans words encouraged me of course there must be a good deal of doubt about the germans powers and after all there might be no cause whatever for our anxieties  now sir said corbridge as i left if i were you i would trouble myself no more about this matter if dr hildstein fails you will still have your man to do your copying or your surveying or anything you like if he succeeds we are all in the same condition we were a year ago that subject did not exist at that time he does not exist at this time that will be all we shall have to say about it  you forget i said severely the wife he may leave behind him  i have nothing to say about that said corbridge rather sharply it is a reprehensible business and i have nothing to do with it  i went away without seeing the german doctor but as i heard he spoke no english and as i did not know german an interview with him would have been of no avail  neither mrs colesworthy nor myself slept that night we were so filled with anxious fears but when the day broke bright and clear and i had hurried round to mr kilbrights lodgings and had found him as full of life and vigor as i had ever seen him we were greatly comforted and ate our breakfasts with fair appetites  if it had been a dark and lowering day said my wife i dont believe i could have swallowed a mouthful  the marriage was to take place at noon and the happy pair were to start by the first afternoon train for the seashore where they were to spend a week mr kilbright hated locomotives and railroads almost as much as ever but he had told me some time before that he intended to conquer this prejudice if such a thing were possible  being one of you i must do as you do he had said  the wedding was to be a very simple one miss budworth was to go from her mothers house to the church where mr kilbright was to meet her we insisted that he should dress at our house where he would find better accommodations than at his lodgings and we assigned him our best guestroom where he repaired in very good season to array himself in his wedding suit  it was not quite eleven oclock when i went upstairs to see if i could be of any use to mr kilbright in regard to the conclusion of his toilette i knocked at the door but received no answer waiting a few moments i opened it and entered on the floor in front of a tall dressingglass was a suit of clothes not only did i see the black broadcloth suitnot laid out at length but all in a compact heapbut i saw the shoes and stockings the collar and cravat everything near by lay a whisk broom  the truth was plain while giving the last touches to his wedding attire all that was amos kilbright had utterly disappeared  i stood where i had stopped just inside the door trembling scarcely breathing so stunned by the terrible sight of those clothes that i could not move nor scarcely think if i had seen his dead body there i should have been shocked but to see nothing it was awful to such an extent that my mind could not deal with it  presently i heard a step and slightly turning saw my wife close by me she had passed the open door and seeing me standing as if stricken into a statue had entered  it did not need that i should speak to her pale as a sheet she stood beside me her hand tightly grasping my arm and with her lips pallid with horror she formed the words they have done it  in a few moments she pulled me gently back and said in quick low tones as if we had been in presence of the dead in less than an hour she will be at the church we must not stay here  with this she turned and stepped quickly from the room i followed closing the door behind me  swiftly moving and without a word my wife put on her hat and left the house mechanically i followed i could speak no word of comfort to that poor girl at this moment the happiest of expectant brides i knew that i had not the power to even attempt to explain to her the nature of the dreadful calamity that had fallen upon her but i could not let my wife go alone she indeed must speak to lilian but there were other members of the family i might do something  to my great surprise mrs colesworthy did not turn into the street which led to the budworths house but went straight on i thought at first she was going to the church to countermand the wedding preparations but before i could put a question to her she had gone around a corner and was hurrying up the steps of the principal hotel in our town  is dr hildstein in she asked of the first person she met  the man gazing astonished at her pallid face replied that he was and immediately conducted us to a little parlor on the first floor the door of which stood partly open without knocking mrs colesworthy hastily entered i closely following a middleaged man suddenly arose from a small table at which he was sitting and turning quickly toward us made an abrupt exclamation in german  as i have said i do not understand german but mrs colesworthy knows the language well and stepping up to the man she said she afterward told me the meaning of the words that passed between them are you dr hildstein  i am he said his face agitated by emotion and his eyes sparkling but i can see no one speak to no one i go out this moment to observe the result of an important experiment  my wife motioned to me to close the door you need not go she said i can tell you that your experiment has succeeded you have dematerialized mr kilbright in one hour he was to be married to a noble loving woman and now all that remains where he stood is a pile of clothes  do you tell me that exclaimed the doctor wildly seizing his hat  stop cried mrs colesworthy her face glowing with excitement her eyes flashing and her right arm extended stir not one step do you know what you have done  i have done what i had a right to do exclaimed the doctor almost in a shout if he is gone he was nothing but a spirit tell me where  i will tell you this exclaimed my wife he was a great deal more than a spirit he was a man engaged to be married at twelve oclock this day you may think there is no law that will sweep down on you but i tell you there is and before the clock strikes twelve you shall know it do you imagine you have come upon a people who will endure the presence of an ogre a wretch who reduces to nothing a fellow human being and calls it an experiment when we tell what you have donemy husband cannot speak german but he is a leader in this town and he supports me in all i saywhen we have told what you have done there will be no need of courts or judges or lawyers for you like a wild beast you will be hunted down you will be trampled under foot you will be torn to pieces fire the sword the hangmans noose clubs and crowbars will not be enough to satisfy the vengeance of an outraged people upon a coldblooded wretch who came to this country solely for the purpose of perpetrating a crime more awful than anything that was ever known before did you ever hear of lynching i see by your face you know what that means you are in the midst of a people who in ten short minutes will be shrieking for your blood  the mans face changed and he looked anxiously at me i did not know what my wife had been saying but i had seen by her manner that she had been threatening him and i shook my uplifted fist  now heed what i say cried mrs colesworthy if you do not wish to perish at the hands of an infuriated mob to die a thousand deaths before your vile spirit leaves this world knowing that besides the torments you feel and those which are to come you will be in the power of men who will bring you back in a halffinished form to make sport at their meetings whenever they feel like it  drops of perspiration stood on the doctors face stop that he cried throwing up his arm i cannot stand that i did not know the subject had such friends  nothing shall be stopped exclaimed my wife and everything shall happen unless you immediately sit down at that table or wherever you do those things and rematerialize mr kilbright just as you found him and into the very clothes that were left lying upon the floor  the doctor stepped forwardhis face was now paleand addressed himself very deferentially to my wife totally ignoring me if you will retire he said i will try i swear to you that i will try  there is not a minute to be lost said mrs colesworthy not one second and if as much as a fingernail is missing remember what i have told you  and with this we quickly left the room  as we went down the steps of the hotel mrs colesworthy looked at her watch it is twentyfive minutes to twelve she said we must get home as fast as we can  we hurried along sometimes almost running when we reached our house mrs colesworthy motioned to me to go upstairs she had no breath left with which to speak i ran up and stood for a moment at the closed door of our guestroom with my hand on the knob i was unable to open it i heard a step on the stairs behind me and i opened the door  there stood mr kilbright in his wedding clothes with the whiskbroom in his hand  he turned at the sound of my entrance  do you know cried the cheery voice of my wife from just outside the door that we have barely fifteen minutes in which to get to the church  can that be cried mr kilbright the time has flown without my knowing it we must truly make haste  indeed we must said mrs colesworthy and as she stepped back from the door she whispered in my ear not a look not a tremble to let him know  in less than thirty seconds we were on our way to the church in the carriage which had been ordered for the purpose  on the church porch we found old mr scott he was dressed in his best clothes and greeted us cordially in good time he said i am glad to see that it promises well and then looking around to see that no one was within hearing he came nearer to us if i were you he continued i wouldnt say nothin to folks in general about relationships for there are people and very good people too whose minds havent got on far enough to make em able to understand telephones and the other new kinds of wonders  we acknowledged the force of his remarks and all went into the church  three days after the departure of mr and mrs kilbright on their wedding tour my wife received a letter from dr hildstein written by himself from new york but addressed in the handwriting of mr corbridge  i return he wrote to germany perfectly happy in having succeeded in my experiments but nevermore esteemed lady will i dematerialize a subject who has remained long enough in this world to make friends and i am the only man who can do this thing  this letter greatly satisfied us it shows that he has some heart after all said mrs colesworthy but as to that man corbridge i believe he would have kept poor mr kilbright dancing backward and forward between this world and the other as long as a dollar could be made out of him but there is only one way in which he can do us any harm now and that is by materializing the first mrs kilbright but knowing us as he now does i dont believe he will ever try that  no said i i dont believe he ever will  should you ever meet with mr amos kilbright you need not hesitate to entrust him with any surveying you may have on hand mr corbridge cannot dematerialize him the german scientist will not and there is no one else in the world who would even think of such a thing therefore you need feel no fear that he may suddenly vanish from your sight leaving nothing behind him but his clothes and the contents of his pockets unless indeed he should again be so foolish as to go to swim in the ocean at a point where there is a strong ebb tide     the reversible landscape   to look at me no one would suppose it but it is nevertheless a fact that i am a member of a fire company i am somewhat middleaged somewhat stout and at certain times of the year somewhat stiff in the joints and my general dress and demeanor that of a sober business man would not at all suggest the active and impetuous fireman of the period i do not belong to any paid department but to a volunteer hook and ladder company composed of the activebodied or activeminded male citizens of the country town where i live i am included in the activeminded portion of the company and in an organization like ours which is not only intended to assist in putting out the fires of burning buildings but to light the torch of the mind this sort of member is very valuable in the building which we occupy our truck with its hooks and ladders stands upon the lower floor while the large room above is used as a club and readingroom at the beginning of the first winter of our occupancy of the building we found that this room which had been very pleasant in summer was extremely uncomfortable in winter the long apartment had been originally intended for purposes of storage and although we had ornamented it and fitted it up very neatly a good deal of carpentry and some masons work was necessary before it could be made tight and draughtproof for cold weather but lately we had spent money very freely and our treasury was absolutely empty i was chairman of the committee which had charge of everything pertaining to our rooms and i felt the responsibilities of my position the necessary work should be begun immediately but how could the money be raised to pay for it subscriptions for this and that had been made until the members were tired of that sort of thing and the ill success of the last one showed that it would not do to try it again  i revolved in my mind a great many plans for raising the sum required and one morning as i was going to my place of business in the city i was seized with a happy idea at the moment of seizure i was standing in front of a large showwindow in which were a number of oil paintings all of them very fresh and bright how would it do thought i to myself to buy a picture at a moderate price and put it up at a raffle people who are not willing to give money outright will often enter into a scheme of this kind i will go in and make inquiries  when i entered i found myself in a large showroom the walls of which were covered with paintings a person advanced to meet me who as it soon became evident was the proprietor of the place he was a large man dressed in black with an open shirtfront and an expansive countenance his eyes and hair were black and his ears stood out from his head in a manner which according to a recent writer indicates the moneygetting faculty and he plainly belonged to that class of persons who in the middle ages did not as is the present custom pay money for having their teeth extracted but often disbursed large sums for the privilege of retaining them when i asked him if i could procure a good and effective picture at a moderate price he threw out his chest and waved his arms toward his walls there sir he said you can see oil paintings of every subject of every style and of every class and at prices sir lower than they can be found elsewhere in the known world mention the kind of picture you want and i can accommodate you  i replied that i did not know exactly what i wanted and that i would see what he had i now began to look at the pictures on the walls occasionally mentioning my ideas in regard to their merits when suddenly my companion turned to me and said  are you connected with the press sir  i replied that i was not although i occasionally wrote for periodicals  upon art subjects he asked  i answered in the negative  then you are unprejudiced he said and i believe from your appearance that you are a man of influence and there is nothing i would like better than to exhibit the workings of my art organization to a man of influence unprejudiced on the subject my object is sir to popularize art to place high art within the reach of the masses and thus to educate the artistic faculties of even the poorest citizens  i said that i supposed the chromo movement was intended to do all that  no sir he replied warmly chromos cannot accomplish the object they are too expensive and besides they are not the real thing they are printed not painted and what the public wants is the real thing the work of the brush and that is what i give them the pictures you see here and an immense stock besides are all copies of valuable paintings many of them in the finest galleries of europe i sell no originals i guarantee everything to be a copy honesty is at the bottom of all i do but my copies are exactly like the originals that is all i claim i would like sir to show you through my establishment and let you see how i am carrying on the great work of art education there are picturedealers in this city sir plenty of them who try to make the public believe that the vile daubs they sell are originals and the works of wellknown painters and when they do admit that the picture is a copy they say it is the work of some distinguished student that there is no other copy in the country or they make some other misstatement about it these people conceal their processes but their tricks are beginning to be well known to the public now sir i conceal nothing the day for that sort of thing is past i want men of influence to know the facilities i have for the production of artwork upon a grand scale we will first go into the basement sir said he as i followed him downstairs you know how the watchmaking business has been revolutionized by the great companies which manufacture watches by machinery the slow uncertain and expensive work of the poor toilers who made watches by hand has been superseded by the swift unerring and beautiful operations of machinery and steam now sir the great purpose of my life is to introduce machinery into art and ultimately steam and yet i will have no shams no chromos everything shall be realthe work of the brush here sir he continued showing me into a long room filled with workmen you see the men engaged in putting together the frames on which to stretch my canvases every stick is cut planed and jointed at a mill in vermont and sent on here by the carload beyond are the workmen cutting up stretching and preparing the canvas bales upon bales of which are used in a day at the far end are the mills for grinding and mixing colors and now we will go to the upper floors and see the true artwork here sir he said continuing to talk as we walked through the rooms on the various floors is the landscape and marine department that row of men are putting in skies they do nothing else each has his copy before him and day after day month after month paints nothing but that sky and of course he does it with great rapidity and fidelity above on those shelves are skypots of every variety blueserene pots tempest pots sunset pots in compartments morninggray pots and many others then the work passes to the middleground painters who have their halftone pots within easy reach after that the foreground men take it up and the figurists put in the men and animals that man there has been painting that foreground cow ever since the first of august he can now put her in three and a half times in fifteen minutes and will probably rise to sixteen cows an hour by the end of this month these girls do nothing but put whitecaps to waves theres a great demand at present for the windy marine this next room is devoted to portraits to order you see that row of old ladies without heads each holding a pair of spectacles and with one finger in the bible to keep the place thats very popular and we put in a head when the photograph is sent there is a great rage at present for portraits of babies without any clothes on here is a lot of undraped infants with bodies all finished but with no heads we can finish them to order at very short notice i have one girl who puts in all the dimples you would be surprised to see what a charming dimple she can make with one twist of her brush long practice at one thing sir is the foundation of the success of this great establishment take that girl away from her dimplepot and she is nothing she is now upstairs putting dimples into a large correggio order from the west this next room is our figure department battlepieces groups single figures everything as you have seen before each man only copies from the original that part which is his specialty in addition to its other advantages this system is a great protection to us none of my men can work at home at nights and sundays and forge pictures not one of them can do a whole one and now sir you have seen the greater part of my establishment the varnishing packing and storage rooms are in another building i am now perfecting plans for the erection of an immense edifice with steamengines in the cellar in which my paintings shall be done by machinery no chromos mind you but real oilpaintings done by brushes revolving on cylinders i shall have rolls of canvas a mile long like the paper on which our great dailies are printed and the machines shall do everything cut off the picture when it has passed among the cylinders whereupon fresh canvas will be rolled in for a new one another machine will stretch them and they will pass through a varnish bath in the twinkling of an eye but this is in the future what i want of you sir and of other men of influence in society is to let our people know of the great good that is ready for them now and of the greater benefit that is coming and more than that you can do incalculable good to our artists those poor toilers on the solitary canvas should know how to become prosperous great and happy tell them to go into some other business and now sir i must see what i can do for you we will return to my gallery and i will show you exactly what you want  when we reached the back part of the showroom downstairs he brought out an unframed picture about three feet long and two high and placed it in a favorable light there said he is a picture which will suit you it is what we call a reversible landscape and is copied from the only genuine picture of the kind in the world it is just as good as two pictures in this position you see a line of land stretches across the middle of the picture with trees houses and figures with a light sky above and a lake darker in hue below everything on the land is reflected accurately in the water it is a landscape in morning light turn it upside down so and it is an evening scene darkening sky above light water beneath the morning star which you saw faintly glimmering in the other picture is now the reflection of the evening star  i do not pretend to be a judge of pictures but i fancy i appreciate an original idea when i see it and i thought that this picture might answer my purpose  what is the price of the painting i asked  well sir said he to you as a man of influence i will fix the price of this great painting from a comparatively unknown work of gaspar poussin at four dollars and a half  in spite of what i had seen of the facilities possessed by this establishment for producing cheap work i must confess that i was surprised at the smallness of the sum asked for an oilpainting of that size i had expected to give forty or fifty dollars but although i am not a judge of paintings i am a business man and accustomed to make bargains therefore i said  i will give you two dollars and fifty cents for the picture  done said he where shall i send it  i gave him my city address and paid the money as he accompanied me to the door he said if you would like more of these pictures i will sell you one dozen for eighteen dollars or the whole lot of one hundred just finishedand there will be no more of them paintedfor one hundred dollars i told him one was all i wanted and departed i carried the picture home that afternoon and in the evening exhibited it at our clubroom and made known my scheme for raising the money we needed by getting up a raffle with this painting as the prize one hundred tickets at the low price of two dollars each the reversible landscape was set up first one way and then the other a great many times and created quite a sensation  i dont think its worth the half of two hundred dollars said mr buckby our president but as the money is for the use of our association i dont mind that but my objection to the scheme is that if i should gain the prize i should be laughed at by all my fellowmembers for to tell the truth i think that painting is a good deal more funny than otherwise its not what i call high art  the other members generally agreed with him they were very much amused by the picture but they did not care to possess it imagining that those who ridiculed it might also ridicule its owner this opposition discouraged me and i retired to reflect in about five minutes i returned to the company which had now greatly increased as it was one of our regular meeting nights and i asked if they would consent to this raffle if i would engage that the winner of the picture should not be laughed at by any other member  how will you guarantee that asked mr buckby  i will put the matter in the hands of the association i answered if after the raffle is over a majority of the members shall decide that any of us have reason to laugh at the winner of this painting i will refund all the money paid for tickets  there was something in this proposition which aroused the curiosity of my fellowfiremen and when the meeting was called to order a resolution was adopted that we would have the raffle and that the management of it should be placed in my hands subject to the conditions mentioned above there were a good many surmises as to what i was going to do to keep the people from laughing at the prizewinner the general opinion being that i intended to have the picture altered so that it would be like an ordinary landscape and not reversible but the affair was something novel and promised to put the muchneeded money into our treasury and several gentlemen assured me that they would make it their business to see that every member took a ticket one generous man promising in the interests of the association to present them to such of the few members as might decline to buy them for themselves this offer was made in consequence of my insistance that every one of us should have a chance in the raffle  the next morning i went to the artfactory and told the proprietor that i would take the lot of reversibles he had on hand if he would include the one already purchased and receive ninetyseven dollars and a half as the balance due  all right said he i have the ninetynine still on hand are you in the tea business sir  oh no said i the pictures are intended for a large association  no better way of extending the influence of art sir he said heartily i shall charge you nothing for boxing the same address sir  no they must be forwarded to my residence and i gave him the needful directions and a check  the next day the ninetynine pictures arrived and were stored in my barn my wife to whom i had told my plan made some objections to it saying it did not seem right to use half the money paid in to buy so many pictures but i told her that no one could expect in a raffle to clear all the money subscribed and that although we should not gain as much as i had hoped we should clear a hundred dollars and every man would have a picture this was surely fair and the fact was that the unsympathetic state of mind of our members made it necessary for me to do something of this kind if i expected to raise the needed money at all  the raffle was announced and on the appointed evening there was a full attendance the prize was won by a mr horter an artcollector of a nervous temperament who had objected to the raffle and who had consented to buy a ticket only after repeated solicitations  now mind he said to me you promised that the other men should not laugh at me and i hold you to your contract  i answered that i intended to stand by it and that the painting should be sent to him in the morning from my house whither it had been removed every member present announced his intention of calling on horter the following evening to see why he should not be laughed at  all the next forenoon my man with a horse and light wagon was engaged in delivering the reversible landscapes one to every member of our club these gentlemen were in almost every case absent at their places of business when they came home in the evening each found his picture with his name on the back of it and a printed slip informing him that in this raffle there had been no blanks and that every man had drawn a prize  not a man called upon mr horter that evening and he greatly wondered why they did not come in either to laugh or to say why they should not do so but every other member of our club was visited by nearly all his fellowfiremen who ran in to see if it were true that he also had one of those ridiculous reversible landscapes as everybody knew that mr horter had one there was no need to call on him and even if they had hoped to be able to laugh at him they could not do so when each of them had drawn one of the pictures himself a good many called on me and some were a little severe in their remarks saying that although it might be a very pretty joke i must have used up nearly all the money that they had given for the good of the association for of course none of them cared for the absurd prize  but when on the next meeting night i paid in one hundred dollars to the treasury a sum more than sufficient to make our room comfortable they were quite satisfied the only thing that troubled them was to know what to do with the pictures they had drawn not one of them was willing to keep his preposterous landscape in his house it was mrs buckby our presidents wife who suggested a way out of the difficulty  of course she said to her husband it would have been much better if each one of you had given the two dollars without any raffle and then you would have had all your money but one cant expect men to do a thing like that  not after we had all paid in our regular dues and had been subscribing and subscribing for this that and the other thing for nearly a year said i who was present at the time some extra inducement was necessary  but as you have all those horrid landscapes she continued why dont you take them and put them up along the top of your walls next the ceiling where those openings are which used to ventilate the room when it was used for storage that would save all the money that you would have to pay to carpenters and painters to have those places made tight and decentlooking and it would give your room a gorgeous appearance  this idea was hailed with delight every man brought his picture to the hall and we nailed the whole hundred in a row along the top of the four walls turning one with the darker half up and the next the other way so as to present alternate views of morning and evening along the whole distance the arrangement answered admirably the draughts of air from outside were perfectly excluded and as our walls were very lofty the general effect was good  art of that kind cannot be too high said mr horter  a week or two after this when i arrived at home one afternoon my wife told me that there was a present for me in the diningroom as such things were not common i hurried in to see what it was i found a very large flat package tied up in brown paper and on it a card with my name and a long inscription the latter was to the effect that my associates of the hook and ladder company desirous of testifying their gratitude to the originator and promoter of the raffle scheme took pleasure in presenting him with the accompanying work of art which when hung upon the walls of his house would be a perpetual reminder to him of the great and good work he had done for the association  i cannot deny that this pleased me much  well i exclaimed to my wife it is very seldom that a man gets any thanks for his gratuitous efforts in behalf of his fellowbeings and although i must say that my services in raising money for the association deserved recognition i did not expect that the members would do themselves the justice to make me a present  unwrapping the package i discovered to my intense disgust a copy of the reversible landscape my first thought was that some of the members for a joke had taken down one of the paintings from our meetingroom and had sent it to me but on carefully examining the canvas and frame i was quite certain that this picture had never been nailed to a wall it was evidently a new and fresh copy of the painting of which i had been assured no more would be produced i must admit that i had felt a certain pride in decorating our hall with the style of picture that could not be seen elsewhere and moreover i greatly dislike to be overreached in business matters and my wrath against the manufacturer of high art entirely overpowered and dissipated any little resentment i might have felt against my waggish fellowmembers who had sent me the painting  early the next morning i went direct to the artfactory and was just about entering when my attention was attracted by a prominent picture in the window i stepped back to look at it it was our reversible landscape mounted upon an easel and labelled a morning scene while i examined it to assure myself that it was really the landscape with which i was so familiar it was turned upside down by some concealed machinery and appeared labelled an evening scene at the foot of the easel i now noticed a placard inscribed the reversible landscape a new idea in art  i stood for a moment astounded the rascally picturemonger had not only made another of these pictures but he was prepared to furnish them in any number rushing into the gallery i demanded to see the proprietor  look here said i what docs this mean you told me that there were to be no more of those pictures painted that i was to possess a unique lot  thats not the same picture sir he exclaimed i am surprised that you should think so step outside with me sir and ill prove it to you there sir said he as we stood before the painting which was now morning side up you see that star in the pictures we sold you the morning star was venus in this one it is jupiter this is not the same picture do you imagine that we would deceive a customer that sir is a thing we never do     dusky philosophy  in two expositions   first exposition a story of seven devils   the negro church which stood in the pinewoods near the little village of oxford cross roads in one of the lower counties of virginia was presided over by an elderly individual known to the community in general as uncle pete but on sundays the members of his congregation addressed him as brudder pete he was an earnest and energetic man and although he could neither read nor write he had for many years expounded the scriptures to the satisfaction of his hearers his memory was good and those portions of the bible which from time to time he had heard read were used by him and frequently with powerful effect in his sermons his interpretations of the scriptures were generally entirely original and were made to suit the needs or what he supposed to be the needs of his congregation  whether as uncle pete in the garden and cornfield or brudder pete in the church he enjoyed the good opinion of everybody excepting one person and that was his wife she was a hightempered and somewhat dissatisfied person who had conceived the idea that her husband was in the habit of giving too much time to the church and too little to the acquisition of cornbread and pork on a certain saturday she gave him a most tremendous scolding which so affected the spirits of the good man that it influenced his decision in regard to the selection of the subject for his sermon the next day  his congregation was accustomed to being astonished and rather liked it but never before had their minds received such a shock as when the preacher announced the subject of his discourse he did not take any particular text for this was not his custom but he boldly stated that the bible declared that every woman in this world was possessed by seven devils and the evils which this state of things had brought upon the world he showed forth with much warmth and feeling subjectmatter principally from his own experience crowded in upon his mind and he served it out to his audience hot and strong if his deductions could have been proved to be correct all women were creatures who by reason of their sevenfold diabolic possession were not capable of independent thought or action and who should in tears and humility place themselves absolutely under the direction and authority of the other sex  when he approached the conclusion of his sermon brother peter closed with a bang the bible which although he could not read a word of it always lay open before him while he preached and delivered the concluding exhortation of his sermon  now my dear brevren ob dis congregation he said i want you to understan dat dars nuffin in dis yer sarmon wot youve jus heerd ter make you think yousefs angels by no means brevren you was all brung up by women an youve got ter lib wid em an ef anythin in dis yer worl is

splains how de debbils got inter woman de sarpint he done fotch mudder ebe seben apples an ebery one she take a bite out of gib her a debbil  as might have been expected this sermon produced a great sensation and made a deep impression on the congregation as a rule the men were tolerably well satisfied with it and when the services were over many of them made it the occasion of shy but very plainly pointed remarks to their female friends and relatives  but the women did not like it at all some of them became angry and talked very forcibly and feelings of indignation soon spread among all the sisters of the church if their minister had seen fit to stay at home and preach a sermon like this to his own wife who it may be remarked was not present on this occasion it would have been well enough provided he had made no allusions to outsiders but to come there and preach such things to them was entirely too much for their endurance each one of the women knew she had not seven devils and only a few of them would admit of the possibility of any of the others being possessed by quite so many  their preachers explanation of the manner in which every woman came to be possessed of just so many devils appeared to them of little importance what they objected to was the fundamental doctrine of his sermon which was based on his assertion that the bible declared every woman had seven devils they were not willing to believe that the bible said any such thing some of them went so far as to state it was their opinion that uncle pete had got this fool notion from some of the lawyers at the courthouse when he was on a jury a month or so before it was quite noticeable that although sunday afternoon had scarcely begun the majority of the women of the congregation called their minister uncle pete this was very strong evidence of a sudden decline in his popularity  some of the more vigorousminded women not seeing their minister among the other people in the clearing in front of the log church went to look for him but he was not to be found his wife had ordered him to be home early and soon after the congregation had been dismissed he departed by a short cut through the woods that afternoon an irate committee composed principally of women but including also a few men who had expressed disbelief in the new doctrine arrived at the cabin of their preacher but found there only his wife crossgrained old aunt rebecca she informed them that her husband was not at home  hes done gaged hissef she said ter cut an haul wood fur kunnel martin ober on little mountn fur de whole ob nex week its fourteen or thirteen mile from hyar an ef hed started termorrer mawnin hed los amos a whole day sides dat i done tole him dat ef he git dar ternight hed have his supper frowed in wot you all want wid him gwine to pay him fur preachin  any such intention as this was instantaneously denied and aunt rebecca was informed of the subject upon which her visitors had come to have a very plain talk with her husband  strange to say the announcement of the new and startling dogma had apparently no disturbing effect upon aunt rebecca on the contrary the old woman seemed rather to enjoy the news  reckin he oughter know all bout dat she said hes done had three wives an he aint got rid o dis one yit  judging from her chuckles and waggings of the head when she made this remark it might be imagined that aunt rebecca was rather proud of the fact that her husband thought her capable of exhibiting a different kind of diabolism every day in the week  the leader of the indignant church members was susan henry a mulatto woman of a very independent turn of mind she prided herself that she never worked in anybodys house but her own and this immunity from outside service gave her a certain preeminence among her sisters not only did susan share the general resentment with which the startling statement of old peter had been received but she felt that its promulgation had affected her position in the community if every woman was possessed by seven devils then in this respect she was no better nor worse than any of the others and at this her proud heart rebelled if the preacher had said some women had eight devils and others six it would have been better she might then have made a mental arrangement in regard to her relative position which would have somewhat consoled her but now there was no chance for that the words of the preacher had equally debased all women  a meeting of the disaffected church members was held the next night at susan henrys cabin or rather in the little yard about it for the house was not large enough to hold the people who attended it the meeting was not regularly organized but everybody said what he or she had to say and the result was a great deal of clamor and a general increase of indignation against uncle pete  look hyar cried susan at the end of some energetic remarks is dar enny pusson hyar who kin count up figgers  inquiries on the subject ran through the crowd and in a few moments a black boy about fourteen was pushed forward as an expert in arithmetic  now you jim said susan yous been to school an you kin count up figgers cordin ter de chuch books dars fortyseben women blongin to our meetin an ef each one ob dem dar has got seben debbils in her i jus wants you ter tell me how many debbils come to chuch ebery clear sunday ter hear dat ole uncle pete preach  this view of the case created a sensation and much interest was shown in the result of jims calculations which were made by the aid of a back of an old letter and a piece of pencil furnished by susan the result was at last announced as three hundred and nineteen which although not precisely correct was near enough to satisfy the company  now you jus turn dat ober in you alls minds said susan moren free hunderd debbils in chuch ebery sunday an we women fotchin em does anybody spose ise gwine ter blieve dat fool talk  a middleaged man now lifted up his voice and said ise been thinkin ober dis hyar matter and ise cluded dat praps de words ob de preacher was used in a figgeratous form o sense praps de seben debbils meant chillun  these remarks were received with no favor by the assemblage  oh you git out cried susan your ole womans got seben chillun shore nuf an i spec deys all debbils but dem sentments dont apply ter all de udder women hyar ticlarly ter dem dar young uns wot aint married yit  this was good logic but the feeling on the subject proved to be even stronger for the mothers in the company became so angry at their children being considered devils that for a time there seemed to be danger of an amazonian attack on the unfortunate speaker this was averted but a great deal of uproar now ensued and it was the general feeling that something ought to be done to show the deepseated resentment with which the horrible charge against the mothers and sisters of the congregation had been met many violent propositions were made some of the younger men going so far as to offer to burn down the church it was finally agreed quite unanimously that old peter should be unceremoniously ousted from his place in the pulpit which he had filled so many years  as the week passed on some of the older men of the congregation who had friendly feelings toward their old companion and preacher talked the matter over among themselves and afterward with many of their fellowmembers succeeded at last in gaining the general consent that uncle pete should be allowed a chance to explain himself and give his grounds and reasons for his astounding statement in regard to womankind if he could show biblical authority for this of course nothing more could be said but if he could not then he must get down from the pulpit and sit for the rest of his life on a back seat of the church this proposition met with the more favor because even those who were most indignant had an earnest curiosity to know what the old man would say for himself  during all this time of angry discussion good old peter was quietly and calmly cutting and hauling wood on the little mountain his mind was in a condition of great comfort and peace for not only had he been able to rid himself in his last sermon of many of the hard thoughts concerning women that had been gathering themselves together for years but his absence from home had given him a holiday from the harassments of aunt rebeccas tongue so that no new notions of womans culpability had risen within him he had dismissed the subject altogether and had been thinking over a sermon regarding baptism which he thought he could make convincing to certain of the younger members of his congregation  he arrived at home very late on saturday night and retired to his simple couch without knowing anything of the terrible storm which had been gathering through the week and which was to burst upon him on the morrow but the next morning long before church time he received warning enough of what was going to happen individuals and deputations gathered in and about his cabinsome to tell him all that had been said and done some to inform him what was expected of him some to stand about and look at him some to scold some to denounce but alas not one to encourage nor one to call him brudder pete that sunday appellation dear to his ears but the old man possessed a stubborn soul not easily to be frightened  wot i says in de pulpit he remarked ill splain in de pulpit an you all ud better git long to de chuch an when de time fur de sarvice come ill be dar  this advice was not promptly acted upon but in the course of half an hour nearly all the villagers and loungers had gone off to the church in the woods and when uncle peter had put on his high black hat somewhat battered but still sufficiently clerical looking for that congregation and had given something of a polish to his cowhide shoes he betook himself by the accustomed path to the log building where he had so often held forth to his people as soon as he entered the church he was formally instructed by a committee of the leading members that before he began to open the services he must make it plain to the congregation that what he had said on the preceding sunday about every woman being possessed by seven devils was scripture truth and not mere wicked nonsense out of his own brain if he could not do that they wanted no more praying or preaching from him  uncle peter made no answer but ascending the little pulpit he put his hat on the bench behind him where it was used to repose took out his red cotton handkerchief and blew his nose in his accustomed way and looked about him the house was crowded even aunt rebecca was there  after a deliberate survey of his audience the preacher spoke breveren an sisters i see afore me brudder bill hines who kin read de bible an has got one aint dat so brudder  bill hines having nodded and modestly grunted assent the preacher continued an dars aun priscillas boy jake who aint a brudder yit though hes plenty old nuf min i tell ye an he kin read de bible fus rate an has read it ter me ober an ober agin aint dat so jake  jake grinned nodded and hung his head very uncomfortable at being thus publicly pointed out  an dars good ole aun patty who knows more scripter dan ennybuddy hyar havin been teached by de little gals from kunnel jaspers an

log cabin in one of the southern states he was a man of an independent turn of mind and he much desired to own the house in which he lived and the small gardenpatch around it this valuable piece of property belonged to mr morris and as it was an outlying corner of his large farm he had no objection to sell it to grandison provided the latter could pay for it but of this he had great doubts the man was industrious enough but he often seemed to have a great deal of difficulty about paying the very small rental charged for his place and mr morris consequently had wellgrounded doubts about his ability to purchase it  but sah said grandison one day when these objections had been placed before him is been turnin dis thing ober in my min ober an ober i know jes how much i kin make an how much is got to spend an how i kin save ter buy the house an if i agree to pay you so much money on such a day an so much on such anudder day is gwine ter do it you kin jes put that down sah for sartin shuh  well grandison said mr morris ill give you a trial if at the end of six months you can pay me the first instalment ill have the necessary papers made out and you can go on and buy the place but if you are not up to time on the first payment i want to hear no more about the purchase  all right mahsr morris said grandison if i gibs you my word ter pay de money on de fus day ob october is gwine to do it dats sartin shuh  months passed on and although grandison worked as steadily as usual he found toward the end of september that in the ordinary course of things he would not be able to make up the sum necessary for the first payment other methods out of the ordinary course came into his mind but he had doubts about availing himself of them he was extremely anxious to make up the amount due for he knew very well that if he did not pay it on the day appointed he might bid farewell to his hope of becoming a freeholder in his perplexity he resolved to consult brother bijah the minister of the little church in the pinewoods to which grandison belonged  now lookaheah brudder bijah said he wots i gwine to do bout dis bizness i done promised ter pay dis money on de fus day ob de comin month an dars six dollars ob it dat i aint got yit  an aint dar any way ter git it asked bijah  yaas dars one way said grandison is been turnin dis matter ober an ober in my min an dars only one way i

call dat puffectly far an squar brudder bijah  bijah shook his head dis is a mighty dubersome question brudder granson a mighty dubersome question  grandison stood with a disappointed expression on his countenance he greatly desired to gain from his minister sanction for the financial operation he had proposed but this the solemn bijah did not appear prepared to give as the two men stood together by the roadside they saw riding toward them mr morris himself  now den exclaimed grandison heah comes mahsr morris and is gwine ter put dis question to hissef he oughter know how ter cide bout it if anybody does  you aint truly gwine ter put dat question to him is ye asked bijah quickly  no sah replied the other is gwine to put the case on a difrent showpint but twill be the same thing as de udder  mr morris was a genialnatured man who took a good deal of interest in his negro neighbors and was fond of listening to their peculiar humor therefore when he saw that grandison wished to speak to him he readily pulled up his horse  mahsr morris said grandison removing his hat brudder bijah an me has been argyin on de subjick ob truf an jes as you was comin up i was gwine ter tell him a parble bout sticken ter truf an if yous got time mahsr morris id be powful glad ter tell you de parble an let you cide tween us  very well said mr morris go on with your parable  dis yere parble said grandison has got a justifyin meanin in it an its bout a bar an a possum de possum he was agwine out early in de mawnin ter git a little corn fur his breakfus  very wrong in the opossum said mr morris for i am sure he hadnt planted any corn  well den sah said grandison praps twas akerns but anyway afore he was out ob de woods he see a big ole bar acomin straight long to him de possum he aint got no time ter climb a tree an git out on de leetlest end ob a long limb an so he lay hesef flat down on de groun an make blieve hes dead when de ole bar came up he sot down an look at de possum fus he turn his head on one side an den he turn his head on de udder but he look at de possum all de time dreckly he gits done lookin an he says  lookaheah possum is you dead or is you libin if yous dead i wont eat you fur i neber eats dead critters but if yous libin den i eats you for my breakfus fur i is bilin hungry not havin had nuffin sence sunup but a little smack dat i took afore gwine out inter de damp air ob de mawnin now den possum speak out and tell me is you libe or is you dead  dat are question frew de possum inter a powful sweat if he told de truf an said he was alibe he knowed well nuf dat de bar would gobble him up quickern if hed been a hot ash cake an a bowl of buttermilk but if he said he was dead sos de bar wouldnt eat him de bar like nuf would know he lied an would eat him all de same so he turn de matter ober an ober in his min an he wrastled with his victions but he couldnt come ter no clusion now dont you tink said de bar dat is got time to sit here de whole mawnin waitin fer you ter make up your mind whether yous dead or not if you dont cide pretty quick ill put a big rock atop o you an stop fer you answer when i come back in de ebenin now dis gib de possum a powful skeer an twas clar to his min dat he mus cide de question straight off if he tole de truf and said he was alibe hed be eat up shuh but if he said he was dead de bar mought blieve him twarnt very likely dat he would but dar was dat one leetle chance an he done took it i is dead says he yous a long time makin up your min bout it says de bar how long you been dead sence day fore yestidday says the possum all right says de bar when deyve ony been dead two or free days an kin talk i eats em all de same an he eat him up  and now grandison said mr morris where is the moral of that parable  de moral is dis said grandison stick ter de truf if de possum had tole de truf an said he was alibe de bar couldnt eat him no moren he did eat him no bar could do dat an i axes you mahsr morris don dat parble show dat ebrybody oughter stick ter de truf no matter what happens  well i dont think your moral is very clear said mr morris for it would have been about as bad for the possum one way as the other but after all it would have been better for the little beast to tell the truth and die with a clear conscience  dats so cried brother bijah speaking in his ministerial capacity de great thing in dis worl is ter die wid a clear conscience  but you cant do dat said grandison if you let dis thing an dat thing come in ter hinder ye now dats jes wot wes been disputin bout mahsr morris i clared dat we oughter stick ter de truf widout lookin to de right or de lef but brudder bijah his min wasnt quite made up on de subjick now wot you say mahsr morris  i say stick to the truth of course said mr morris gathering up his reins and by the way grandison do you expect to make that payment on your place which is due next week  yaas sah sartin shuh said grandison i done tole you id do it mahsr morris an i tends ter stick ter de truf  now den said grandison in a tone of triumph when mr morris had ridden away you see is right in my clusions and mahsr morris grees with me  dunno said brother bijah shaking his head dis is a mighty dubersome question you kep dem apples clar out o sight brudder granson clar out o sight  it was about a week after this quite early in the morning that grandison was slowly driving into town with a horse and a wagon which he had borrowed from a neighbor in the wagon were three barrels of fine apples suddenly at a turn in the road he was greatly surprised to meet mr morris riding homeward  what have you in those barrels grandison inquired his landlord  deys apples sah was the reply dat is got de job ob haulin ter town sah  mr morris rode up to the wagon and removed the piece of old canvas that was thrown over the tops of the barrels there was no need of asking any questions no one but himself for many miles around had belleflowers and jeannettes like these  how much do you lack grandison he said of making up the money you owe me tomorrow  six dollars sah said grandison  six dollarsthree barrelsvery good said mr morris i see you are determined to stick to the truth grandison and keep your engagement but i will trouble you to turn that wagon round and haul those apples to my house and if you still want to buy the place you can come on monday morning and work out the balance you have to make up on the first instalment and after this you can make all your payments in work a days labor is fair and plain but your ways of sticking to the truth are very crooked  it was not long after this that grandison was ploughing in one of mr morris fields when brother bijah came along and sat upon the fence  brudder granson said he when the ploughman had reached the end of the furrow and was preparing to turn jes you let your hoss res a minnit till i tells you a parble  wot parble said grandison in a tone of unconcern but stopping his horse all the same  why dis one said bijah dar was an ole mule an he blonged to a cullud man named harris who used to carry de mail from de coht house ter carys crossroads de ole mule was a powful triflin critter an he got lazier an lazier an fore long he got so dreffle slow dat it tuk him moren one day ter go from de coht house ter de crossroads an he allus come in de day ahfter mailday when de people was done gone home so de cullud man harris he says  you is too ole fur ter carry de mail you triflin mule an i haint got no udder use fur you  so he put him in a gullyfield whar dar was nuffin but bar groun an hog weed now dar was nuffin in dis worl dat triflin mule hated so much as hog weed an he says to hesef is boun ter do somefin bettern dis fur a libin i reckin ill go skeer dat ole harris an make him gib me a feed o corn so he jump ober de fence fur he was spry nuf when he had a min ter an he steals an ole bar skin dat hed seen hangin up in de store poch an he pretty nigh kivered himsef all up wid it den he go down to de pos offis whar de mail had jes come in when dis triflin ole mule seed de cullud man harris sittin on de bottom step ob de poch he begin to kick up his heels an make all de noise he could wid he mouf wots dat cried de cullud man harris is a big grizzly bar said de mule scaped from de nagerie when twas fordin scotts creek when did you git out said de cullud man harris i bus from de cage at half pas free oclock dis ebenin an is you reely a grizzly bar dats de truf said de triflin mule an is powful hungry an if you don go git me a feed o corn ill swaller you down whole an he begun to roar as like a grizzly bar as he knew how dat all de truf you tellin me de cullud man harris ask dats all true as is libin says de triflin mule all right den says de cullud man harris if you kin come from de ford on scotts creek in a hour an a half you kin carry de mail jes as well as any udder mule an is gwine ter buy a big cart whip an make you do it so take off dat bar skin an come long wid me so you see brudder granson continued bijah dars difrent kinds ob truf an yous got ter be mighty ticklar wot kind you sticks ter  git up said grandison to his drowsy horse as he started him on another furrow     plain fishing   well sir said old peter as he came out on the porch with his pipe so you came here to go fishin  peter gruse was the owner of the farmhouse where i had arrived that day just before suppertime he was a short strongbuilt old man with a pair of pretty daughters and little gold rings in his ears two things distinguished him from the farmers in the country round about one was the rings in his ears and the other was the large and comfortable house in which he kept his pretty daughters the other farmers in that region had fine large barns for their cattle and horses but very poor houses for their daughters old peters earrings were indirectly connected with his house he had not always lived among those mountains he had been on the sea where his ears were decorated and he had travelled a good deal on land where he had ornamented his mind with many ideas which were not in general use in the part of his state in which he was born his house stood a little back from the high road and if a traveller wished to be entertained peter was generally willing to take him in provided he had left his wife and family at home the old man himself had no objection to wives and children but his two pretty daughters had  these young women had waited on their father and myself at suppertime one continually bringing hot griddle cakes and the other giving me every opportunity to test the relative merits of the seven different kinds of preserved fruit which in little glass plates covered the otherwise unoccupied spaces on the tablecloth the latter when she found that there was no further possible way of serving us presumed to sit down at the corner of the table and begin her supper but in spite of this apparent humility which was only a custom of the country there was that in the general air of the pretty daughters which left no doubt in the mind of the intelligent observer that they stood at the wheel in that house there was a son of fourteen who sat at table with us but he did not appear to count as a member of the family  yes i answered i understood that there was good fishing hereabout and at any rate i should like to spend a few days among these hills and mountains  well said peter theres trout in some of our streams though not as many as there used to be and theres hills a plenty and mountains too if you choose to walk fur enough theyre a good deal furder off than they look what did you bring with you to fish with  nothing at all i answered i was told in the town that you were a great fisherman and that you could let me have all the tackle i would need  upon my word said old peter resting his pipehand on his knee and looking steadfastly at me youre the queerest fisherman ive seed yet nigh every year some two or three of em stop here in the fishin season and there was never a man who didnt bring his jinted pole and his reels and his lines and his hooks and his drygoods flies and his whiskeyflask with a long strap to it now if you want all these things i havent got em  whatever you use yourself will suit me i answered  all right then said he ill do the best i can for you in the mornin but its plain enough to me that youre not a game fisherman or you wouldnt come here without your tools  to this remark i made answer to the effect that though i was very fond of fishing my pleasure in it did not depend upon the possession of all the appliances of professional sport  perhaps you think said the old man from the way i spoke that i dont believe them fellers with the jinted poles can ketch fish but that aint so that old story about the little boy with the pinhook who ketched all the fish while the gentleman with the modern improvements who stood alongside of him kep throwin out his beautiful flies and never got nothin is a pure lie the fancy chaps who must have evrythin jist so genrally gits fish but for all that i dont like their way of fishin and i take no stock in it myself ive been fishin on and off ever since i was a little boy and ive caught nigh every kind there is from the big jewfish and cavalyoes down south to the trout and minnies round about here but when i ketch a fish the first thing i do is to try to git him on the hook and the next thing is to git him out of the water jist as soon as i kin i dont put in no time worryin him theres only two animals in the world that likes to worry smaller creeturs a good while afore they kill em one is the cat and the other is what they call the game fisherman this kind of a feller never goes after no fish that dont mind being ketched he goes fur them kinds that loves their home in the water and hates most to leave it and he makes it jist as hard fur em as he kin what the game fisher likes is the smallest kind of a hook the thinnest line and a fish that it takes a good while to weaken the longer the weaknin business kin be spun out the more the sport the idee is to let the fish think theres a chance fur him to git away thats jist like the cat with her mouse she lets the little creetur hop off but the minnit he gits fur enough away she jumps on him and jabs him with her claws and then if theres any game left in him she lets him try again of course the game fisher could have a strong line and a stout pole and git his fish in a good sight quicker if he wanted to but that wouldnt be sport he couldnt give him the butt and spin him out and reel him in and let him jump and run till his pluck is clean worn out now i likes to git my fish ashore with all the pluck in em it makes em taste better and as fur fun ill be bound ive had jist as much of that and more too than most of these fellers who are so dreadful anxious to have everythin jist right and think they cant go fishin till theyve spent enough money to buy a suit of sunday clothes as a genral rule theyre a solemn lot and work pretty hard at their fun when i work i want to be paid fur it and when i go in fur fun i want to take it easy and cheerful now i wouldnt say so much agen these fellers said old peter as he arose and put his empty pipe on a little shelf under the porchroof if it wasnt for one thing and that is that they think that their kind of fishin is the only kind worth considerin the way they look down upon plain christian fishin is enough to rile a hitchinpost i dont want to say nothin agen no mans way of attendin to his own affairs whether its kitchengardenin or whether its fishin if he says nothin agen my way but when he looks down on me and grins at me i want to haul myself up and grin at him if i kin and in this case i kin i spose the housecat and the catfisher by which i dont mean the man who fishes for catfish was both made as they is and they cant help it but that dont give em no right to put on airs before other beins who gits their meat with a square kill goodnight and sence ive talked so much about it ive a mind to go fishin with you tomorrow myself  the next morning found old peter of the same mind and after breakfast he proceeded to fit me out for a day of what he called plain christian troutfishin he gave me a reed rod about nine feet long light strong and nicely balanced the tackle he produced was not of the fancy order but his lines were of fine strong linen and his hooks were of good shape clean and sharp and snooded to the lines with a neatness that indicated the hand of a man who had been where he learned to wear little gold rings in his ears  here are some of these feather insects he said which you kin take along if you like and he handed me a paper containing a few artificial flies theyre pretty natral he said and the hooks is good a man who came here fishin gave em to me but i shant want em today at this time of year grasshoppers is the best bait in the kind of place where were goin to fish the stream after it comes down from the mountain runs through half a mile of medder land before it strikes into the woods agen a grasshopper is a little creetur thats got as much conceit as if his jinted legs was fishpoles and he thinks he kin jump over this narrer run of water whenever he pleases but he dont always do it and then if he doesnt git snapped up by the trout that lie along the banks in the medder he is floated along into the woods where theres always fish enough to come to the second table  having got me ready peter took his own particular pole which he assured me he had used for eleven years and hooking on his left arm a goodsized basket which his elder pretty daughter had packed with cold meat bread butter and preserves we started forth for a threemile walk to the fishingground the day was a favorable one for our purpose the sky being sometimes overclouded which was good for fishing and also for walking on a highroad and sometimes bright which was good for effects of mountainscenery not far from the spot where old peter proposed to begin our sport a small framehouse stood by the roadside and here the old man halted and entered the open door without knocking or giving so much as a premonitory stamp i followed imitating my companion in leaving my pole outside which appeared to be the only ceremony that the etiquette of those parts required of visitors in the room we entered a small man in his shirtsleeves sat mending a baskethandle he nodded to peter and peter nodded to him  weve come up afishin said the old man kin your boys give us some grasshoppers  i dont know that theyve got any ready ketched said he for i reckon i used what they had this mornin but they kin git you some here dan you and sile go and ketch mr gruse and this young man some grasshoppers take that mustardbox and see that you git it full  peter and i now took seats and the conversation began about a black cow which peter had to sell and which the other was willing to buy if the old man would trade for sheep which animals however the basketmender did not appear just at that time to have in his possession as i was not very much interested in this subject i walked to the backdoor and watched two small boys in scanty shirts and trousers and ragged straw hats who were darting about in the grass catching grasshoppers of which insects judging by the frequent pounces of the boys there seemed a plentiful supply  got it full said their father when the boys came in  crammed said dan  old peter took the little can pressed the top firmly on put it in his coattail pocket and rose to go youd better think about that cow barney said he he said nothing to the boys about the box of bait but i could not let them catch grasshoppers for us for nothing and i took a dime from my pocket and gave it to dan dan grinned and sile looked sheepishly happy and at the sight of the piece of silver an expression of interest came over the face of the father wait a minute said he and he went into a little room that seemed to be a kitchen returning he brought with him a small string of trout do you want to buy some fish he said these is nice fresh ones i ketched em this mornin  to offer to sell fish to a man who is just about to go out to catch them for himself might in most cases be considered an insult but it was quite evident that nothing of the kind was intended by barney he probably thought that if i bought grasshoppers i might buy fish you kin have em for a quarter he said  it was derogatory to my pride to buy fish at such a moment but the man looked very poor and there was a shade of anxiety on his face which touched me old peter stood by without saying a word it might be well i said turning to him to buy these fish for we may not catch enough for supper  such things do happen said the old man  well said i if we have these we shall feel safe in any case and i took the fish and gave the man a quarter it was not perhaps a professional act but the trout were well worth the money and i felt that i was doing a deed of charity  old peter and i now took our rods and crossed the road into an enclosed field and thence into a wide stretch of grass land bounded by hills in front of us and to the right while a thick forest lay to the left we had walked but a short distance when peter said ill go down into the woods and try my luck there and youd better go along up stream about a quarter of a mile to where its rocky praps you aint used to fishin in the woods and you might git your line cotched youll find the troutll bite in the rough water  where is the stream i asked  this is it he said pointing to a little brook which was scarcely too wide for me to step across and theres fish right here but theyre hard to ketch fur they git plenty of good livin and are mighty sassy about their eatin but you kin ketch em up there  old peter now went down toward the woods while i walked up the little stream i had seen troutbrooks before but never one so diminutive as this however when i came nearer to the point where the stream issued from between two of the foothills of the mountains which lifted their forestcovered heights in the distance i found it wider and shallower breaking over its rocky bottom in sparkling little cascades  fishing in such a jolly little stream surrounded by this mountain scenery and with the privileges of the beautiful situation all to myself would have been a joy to me if i had had never a bite but no such illluck befell me peter had given me the can of grasshoppers after putting half of them into his own baitbox and these i used with much success it was grasshopper season and the trout were evidently on the lookout for them i fished in the ripples under the little waterfalls and every now and then i drew out a lively trout most of these were of moderate size and some of them might have been called small the large ones probably fancied the forest shades where old peter went but all i caught were fit for the table and i was very well satisfied with the result of my sport  about noon i began to feel hungry and thought it time to look up the old man who had the lunchbasket i walked down the bank of the brook and some time before i reached the woods i came to a place where it expanded to a width of about ten feet the water here was very clear and the motion quiet so that i could easily see to the bottom which did not appear to be more than a foot below the surface gazing into this transparent water as i walked i saw a large trout glide across the stream and disappear under the grassy bank which overhung the opposite side i instantly stopped this was a much larger fish than any i had caught and i determined to try for him  i stepped back from the bank so as to be out of sight and put a fine grasshopper on my hook then i lay face downward on the grass and worked myself slowly forward until i could see the middle of the stream then quietly raising my pole i gave my grasshopper a good swing as if he had made a wager to jump over the stream at its widest part but as he certainly would have failed in such an ambitious endeavor especially if he had been caught by a puff of wind i let him come down upon the surface of the water a little beyond the middle of the brook grasshoppers do not sink when they fall into the water and so i kept this fellow upon the surface and gently moved him along as if with all the conceit taken out of him by the result of his illconsidered leap he was ignominiously endeavoring to swim to shore as i did this i saw the trout come out from under the bank move slowly toward the grasshopper and stop directly under him trembling with anxiety and eager expectation i endeavored to make the movements of the insect still more natural and as far as i was able i threw into him a sudden perception of his danger and a frenzied desire to get away but either the trout had had all the grasshoppers he wanted or he was able from long experience to perceive the difference between a natural exhibition of emotion and a histrionic imitation of it for he slowly turned and with a few slight movements of his tail glided back under the bank in vain did the grasshopper continue his frantic efforts to reach the shore in vain did he occasionally become exhausted and sink a short distance below the surface in vain did he do everything that he knew to show that he appreciated what a juicy and delicious morsel he was and how he feared that the trout might yet be tempted to seize him the fish did not come out again  then i withdrew my line and moved back from the stream i now determined to try mr trout with a fly and i took out the paper old peter gruse had given me i did not know exactly what kind of winged insects were in order at this time of the year but i was sure that yellow butterflies were not particular about just what month it was so long as the sun shone warmly i therefore chose that one of peters flies which was made of the yellowest feathers and removing the snood and hook from my line i hastily attached this fly which was provided with a hook quite suitable for my desired prize crouching on the grass i again approached the brook gaily flitting above the glassy surface of the water in all the fancied security of tender youth and innocence came my yellow fly backward and forward over the water he gracefully flew sometimes rising a little into the air as if to view the varied scenery of the woods and mountains and then settling for a moment close to the surface to better inspect his glittering image as it came up from below and showing in his every movement his intense enjoyment of summertime and life  out from his dark retreat now came the trout and settling quietly at the bottom of the brook he appeared to regard the venturesome insect with a certain interest but he must have detected the ironbarb of vice beneath the mask of blitheful innocence for after a short deliberation the trout turned and disappeared under the bank as he slowly moved away he seemed to be bigger than ever i must catch that fish surely he would bite at something it was quite evident that his mind was not wholly unsusceptible to emotions emanating from an awakening appetite and i believed that if he saw exactly what he wanted he would not neglect an opportunity of availing himself of it but what did he want i must certainly find out drawing myself back again i took off the yellow fly and put on another this was a white one with black blotches like a big miller moth which had fallen into an inkpot it was surely a conspicuous creature and as i crept forward and sent it swooping over the stream i could not see how any trout with a single insectivorous tooth in his head could fail to rise to such an occasion but this trout did not rise he would not even come out from under his bank to look at the swiftly flitting creature he probably could see it well enough from where he was  but i was not to be discouraged i put on another fly a green one with a red tail it did not look like any insect that i had ever seen but i thought that the trout might know more about such things than i he did come out to look at it but probably considering it a product of that modern æstheticism which sacrifices natural beauty to mediæval crudeness of color and form he retired without evincing any disposition to countenance this style of art  it was evident that it would be useless to put on any other flies for the two i had left were a good deal bedraggled and not nearly so attractive as those i had used just before leaving the house that morning peters son had given me a wooden matchbox filled with worms for bait which although i did not expect to need i put in my pocket as a last resort i determined to try the trout with a worm i selected the plumpest and most comely of the lot i put a new hook on my line i looped him about it in graceful coils and cautiously approached the water as before now a worm never attempts to wildly leap across a flowing brook nor does he flit in thoughtless innocence through the sunny air and over the bright transparent stream if he happens to fall into the water he sinks to the bottom and if he be of a kind not subject to drowning he generally endeavors to secrete himself under a stone or to burrow in the soft mud with this knowledge of his nature i gently dropped my worm upon the surface of the stream and then allowed him slowly to sink out sailed the trout from under the bank but stopped before reaching the sinking worm there was a certain something in his action which seemed to indicate a disgust at the sight of such plebeian food and a fear seized me that he might now swim off and pay no further attention to my varied baits suddenly there was a ripple in the water and i felt a pull on the line instantly i struck and then there was a tug my blood boiled through every vein and artery and i sprang to my feet i did not give him the butt i did not let him run with yards of line down the brook nor reel him in and let him make another mad course up stream i did not turn him over as he jumped into the air nor endeavor in any way to show him that i understood those tricks which his depraved nature prompted him to play upon the angler with an absolute dependence upon the strength of old peters tackle i lifted the fish out he came from the water which held him with a gentle suction as if unwilling to let him go and then he whirled through the air like a meteor flecked with rosy fire and landed on the fresh green grass a dozen feet behind me down on my knees i dropped before him as he tossed and rolled his beautiful spots and colors glistening in the sun he was truly a splendid trout fully a foot long round and heavy carefully seizing him i easily removed the hook from the bony roof of his capacious mouth thickly set with sparkling teeth and then i tenderly killed him with all his pluck as old peter would have said still in him  i covered the rest of the fish in my basket with wet plantain leaves and laid my trout king on this cool green bed then i hurried off to the old man whom i saw coming out of the woods when i opened my basket and showed him what i had caught peter looked surprised and taking up the trout examined it  why this is a big fellow he said at first i thought it was barney sloats boss trout but it isnt long enough for him barney showed me his trout that genrally keeps in a deep pool where a tree has fallen over the stream down there barney tells me he often sees him and hes been tryin fur two years to ketch him but he never has and i say he never will fur them big trouts got too much sense to fool round any kind of victuals thats got a string to it they let a little fish eat all he wants and then they eat him how did you ketch this one  i gave an account of the manner of the capture to which peter listened with interest and approval  if youd a stood off and made a cast at that feller youd either have caught him at the first flip which isnt likely as he didnt seem to want no feather flies or else youd a skeered him away thats all well enough in the tumblin water where you genrally go fur trout but the man thats got the true feelin fur fish will try to suit his idees to theirs and if he keeps on doin that hes like to learn a thing or two that may do him good thats a fine fish and you ketched him well ive got a lot of em but nothin of that heft  after luncheon we fished for an hour or two with no result worth recording and then we started for home a couple of partridges ran across the road some distance ahead of us and these gave peter an idea  do you know said he if things go on as theyre goin on now that therell come a time when it wont be considered hightoned sport to shoot a bird slambang dead the game gunners will pop em with little harpoons with long threads tied to em and the feller that can tire out his bird and haul him in with the longest and thinnest piece of spool thread will be the crackest sportsman  at this point i remarked to my companion that perhaps he was a little hard on the game fishermen  well said old peter with a smile on his corrugated visage i reckon id have to do a lot of talkin before id git even with em fur the way they give me the butt for my style of fishin what i say behind their backs i say to their faces i seed one of these fellers once with a fish on his hook that he was runnin up an down the stream like a chased chicken why dont you pull him in says i and break my rod an line says he why dont you have a stronger line and pole says i there wouldnt be no science in that says he if its your science you want to show off says i you ought to fish for mud eels theres more game in em than there is in any other fish round here and as theyre mighty lively out of water you might play one of em fur half an hour after you got him on shore and it would take all your science to keep him from reelin up his end of the line faster than you could yourn  when we reached the farm the old man went into the barn and i took the fish into the house i found the two pretty daughters in the large room where the eating and some of the cooking was done i opened my basket and with great pride showed them the big trout i had caught they evidently thought it was a large fish but they looked at each other and smiled in a way that i did not understand i had expected from them at least as much admiration for my prize and my skill as their father had shown  you dont seem to think much of this fine trout that i took such trouble to catch i remarked  you mean said the elder girl with a laugh that you bought of barney sloat  i looked at her in astonishment  barney was along here today she said and he told about your buying your fish of him  bought of him i exclaimed indignantly a little string of fish at the bottom of the basket i bought of him but all the others and this big one i caught myself  oh of course said the pretty daughter bought the little ones and caught all the big ones  barney sloat ought to have kept his mouth shut said the younger pretty daughter looking at me with an expression of pity hed got his money and he hadnt no business to go telling on people nobody likes that sort of thing but this big fish is a real nice one and you shall have it for your supper  thank you i said with dignity and left the room  i did not intend to have any further words with these young women on this subject but i cannot deny that i was annoyed and mortified this was the result of a charitable action i think i was never more proud of anything than of catching that trout and it was a good deal of a downfall to suddenly find myself regarded as a mere city man fishing with a silver hook but after all what did it matter  the boy who did not seem to be accounted a member of the family came into the house and as he passed me he smiled goodhumoredly and said buyed em  i felt like throwing a chair at him but refrained out of respect to my host before supper the old man came out on to the porch where i was sitting it seems said he that my gals has got it inter their heads that you bought that big fish of barney sloat and as i cant say i seed you ketch it theyre not willin to give in specially as i didnt git no such big one taint wise to buy fish when youre goin fishin yourself its pretty certain to tell agen you  you ought to have given me that advice before i said somewhat shortly you saw me buy the fish  you dont spose said old peter that im goin to say anythin to keep money out of my neighbors pockets we dont do that way in these parts but ive told the gals theyre not to speak another word about it so you neednt give your mind no worry on that score and now lets go in to supper if youre as hungry as i am there wont be many of them fish left fur breakfast  that evening as we were sitting smoking on the porch old peters mind reverted to the subject of the unfounded charge against me it goes pretty hard he remarked to have to stand up and take a thing you don like when theres no call fur it its bad enough when there is a call fur it that matter about your fish buyin reminds me of what happened two summers ago to my sister or ruther to her two little boysor more correct yit to one of em them was two curous little boys they was allus tradin with each other their father deals mostly in horses and they must have got it from him at the time im tellin of theyd traded everythin they had and when they hadnt nothin else left to swap they traded names joe he took johnnys name and johnny he took joes jist about when theyd done this they both got sick with sumthin or other the oldest one pretty bad the other not much now there aint no doctor inside of twenty miles of where my sister lives but theres one who sometimes has a call to go through that part of the country and the people about there is allus very glad when they chance to be sick when he comes along now this good luck happened to my sister fur the doctor come by jist at this time he looks into the state of the boys and while their mother has gone downstairs he mixes some medicine he has along with him whats your name he says to the oldest boy when hed done it now as hed traded names with his brother fair and square he wasnt goin back on the trade and he said joe and my names johnny up and says the other one then the doctor he goes and gives the bottle of medicine to their mother and says he this medicine is fur joe you must give him a tablespoonful every two hours keep up the treatment and hell be all right as fur johnny theres nothin much the matter with him he dont need no medicine and then he went away every two hours after that joe who wasnt sick worth mentionin had to swallow a dose of horrid stuff and pretty soon he took to his bed and johnny he jist played round and got well in the natral way joes mother kept up the treatment gittin up in the night to feed that stuff to him but the poor little boy got wuss and wuss and one mornin he says to his mother says he mother i guess im goin to die and id ruther do that than take any more of that medicine and i wish youd call johnny and well trade names back agen and if he dont want to come and do it you kin tell him he kin keep the old minkskin i gave him to boot on account of his name havin a wesley in it trade names says his mother what do you mean by that and then he told her what he and johnny had done and did you ever tell anybody about this says she nobody but dr barnes says he after that i got sick and forgot it when my sister heard that an idee struck into her like you put a fork into an apple dumplin traded names and told the doctor shed all along thought it strange that the boy that seemed wuss should be turned out and the other one put under treatment but it wasnt fur her to set up her opinion agen that of a man like dr barnes down she went in about seventeen jumps to where eli timmins the hired man was ploughin in the corn take that horse out of that she hollers and you may kill him if you have to but git dr barnes here before my little boy dies when the doctor come he heard the story and looked at the sick youngster and then says he if hed kept his minkskin and not hankered after a wesley to his name hed a had a better time of it stop the treatment and hell be all right which she did and he was now it seems to me that this is a good deal like your case youve had to take a lot of medicine that didnt belong to you and i guess its made you feel pretty bad but ive told my gals to stop the treatment and youll be all right in the mornin goodnight your candlestick is on the kitchen table  for two days longer i remained in this neighborhood wandering alone over the hills and up the mountainsides and by the brooks which tumbled and gurgled through the lonely forest each evening i brought home a goodly supply of trout but never a great one like the noble fellow for which i angled in the meadow stream  on the morning of my departure i stood on the porch with old peter waiting for the arrival of the mail driver who was to take me to the nearest railroad town  i dont want to say nothin remarked the old man that would keep them fellers with the jinted poles from stoppin at my house when they comes to these parts afishin i aint got no objections to their poles taint that and i dont mind nuther their standin off and throwin their flies as fur as theyve a mind to thats not it and it aint even the way they have of worryin their fish i wouldnt do it myself but if they like it thats their business but what does rile me is the cheeky way in which they stand up and say that there isnt no decent way of fishin but their way and that to a man thats ketched more fish of more different kinds with more game in em and had more fun at it with a lot less money and less tomfoolin than any fishin feller that ever come here and talked to me like an old cat tryin to teach a dog to ketch rabbits no sir agen i say that i dont take no money fur entertainin the only man that ever come out here to go afishin in a plain christian way but if you feel tetchy about not payin nothin you kin send me one of them poles in three pieces a good strong one thatll lift barney sloats trout if ever i hook him  i sent him the rod and next summer i am going out to see him use it
