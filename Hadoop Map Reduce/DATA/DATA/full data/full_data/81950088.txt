81950088	the rescue  a romance of the shallows   by joseph conrad   allas quod she that ever this sholde happe for wende i never by possibilitee that swich a monstre or merveille mighte bethe frankeleyns tale   to frederic courtland penfield last ambassador of the united states of america to the late austrian empire this old time tale is gratefully inscribed in memory of the rescue of certain distressed travellers effected by him in the worlds great storm of the year 1914     authors note  of the three long novels of mine which suffered an interruption the rescue was the one that had to wait the longest for the good pleasure of the fates i am betraying no secret when i state here that it had to wait precisely for twenty years i laid it aside at the end of the summer of 1898 and it was about the end of the summer of 1918 that i took it up again with the firm determination to see the end of it and helped by the sudden feeling that i might be equal to the task  this does not mean that i turned to it with elation i was well aware and perhaps even too much aware of the dangers of such an adventure the amazingly sympathetic kindness which men of various temperaments diverse views and different literary tastes have been for years displaying towards my work has done much for me has done allexcept giving me that overweening selfconfidence which may assist an adventurer sometimes but in the long run ends by leading him to the gallows  as the characteristic i want most to impress upon these short authors notes prepared for my first collected edition is that of absolute frankness i hasten to declare that i founded my hopes not on my supposed merits but on the continued goodwill of my readers i may say at once that my hopes have been justified out of all proportion to my deserts i met with the most considerate most delicately expressed criticism free from all antagonism and in its conclusions showing an insight which in itself could not fail to move me deeply but was associated also with enough commendation to make me feel rich beyond the dreams of avaricei mean an artists avarice which seeks its treasure in the hearts of men and women  no whatever the preliminary anxieties might have been this adventure was not to end in sorrow once more fortune favoured audacity and yet i have never forgotten the jocular translation of audaces fortuna juvat offered to me by my tutor when i was a small boy the audacious get bitten however he took care to mention that there were various kinds of audacity oh there are there are    there is for instance the kind of audacity almost indistinguishable from impudence    i must believe that in this case i have not been impudent for i am not conscious of having been bitten  the truth is that when the rescue was laid aside it was not laid aside in despair several reasons contributed to this abandonment and no doubt the first of them was the growing sense of general difficulty in the handling of the subject the contents and the course of the story i had clearly in my mind but as to the way of presenting the facts and perhaps in a certain measure as to the nature of the facts themselves i had many doubts i mean the telling representative facts helpful to carry on the idea and at the same time of such a nature as not to demand an elaborate creation of the atmosphere to the detriment of the action i did not see how i could avoid becoming wearisome in the presentation of detail and in the pursuit of clearness i saw the action plainly enough what i had lost for the moment was the sense of the proper formula of expression the only formula that would suit this of course weakened my confidence in the intrinsic worth and in the possible interest of the storythat is in my invention but i suspect that all the trouble was in reality the doubt of my prose the doubt of its adequacy of its power to master both the colours and the shades  it is difficult to describe exactly as i remember it the complex state of my feelings but those of my readers who take an interest in artistic perplexities will understand me best when i point out that i dropped the rescue not to give myself up to idleness regrets or dreaming but to begin the nigger of the narcissus and to go on with it without hesitation and without a pause a comparison of any page of the rescue with any page of the nigger will furnish an ocular demonstration of the nature and the inward meaning of this first crisis of my writing life for it was a crisis undoubtedly the laying aside of a work so far advanced was a very awful decision to take it was wrung from me by a sudden conviction that there only was the road of salvation the clear way out for an uneasy conscience the finishing of the nigger brought to my troubled mind the comforting sense of an accomplished task and the first consciousness of a certain sort of mastery which could accomplish something with the aid of propitious stars why i did not return to the rescue at once then was not for the reason that i had grown afraid of it being able now to assume a firm attitude i said to myself deliberately that thing can wait at the same time i was just as certain in my mind that youth a story which i had then so to speak on the tip of my pen could not wait neither could heart of darkness be put off for the practical reason that mr wm blackwood having requested me to write something for the no m of his magazine i had to stir up at once the subject of that tale which had been long lying quiescent in my mind because obviously the venerable maga at her patriarchal age of 1000 numbers could not be kept waiting then lord jim with about seventeen pages already written at odd times put in his claim which was irresistible thus every stroke of the pen was taking me further away from the abandoned rescue not without some compunction on my part but with a gradually diminishing resistance till at last i let myself go as if recognising a superior influence against which it was useless to contend  the years passed and the pages grew in number and the long reveries of which they were the outcome stretched wide between me and the deserted rescue like the smooth hazy spaces of a dreamy sea yet i never actually lost sight of that dark speck in the misty distance it had grown very small but it asserted itself with the appeal of old associations it seemed to me that it would be a base thing for me to slip out of the world leaving it out there all alone waiting for its fatethat would never come  sentiment pure sentiment as you see prompted me in the last instance to face the pains and hazards of that return as i moved slowly towards the abandoned body of the tale it loomed up big amongst the glittering shallows of the coast lonely but not forbidding there was nothing about it of a grim derelict it had an air of expectant life one after another i made out the familiar faces watching my approach with faint smiles of amused recognition they had known well enough that i was bound to come back to them but their eyes met mine seriously as was only to be expected since i myself felt very serious as i stood amongst them again after years of absence at once without wasting words we went to work together on our renewed life and every moment i felt more strongly that they who had waited bore no grudge to the man who however widely he may have wandered at times had played truant only once in his life  1920 j c     contents  part i   the man and the brig  part ii  the shore of refuge  part iii the capture  part iv  the

traduced in life the glory of his achievement has vindicated the purity of his motives he belongs to history but there were othersobscure adventurers who had not his advantages of birth position and intelligence who had only his sympathy with the people of forests and sea he understood and loved so well they can not be said to be forgotten since they have not been known at all they were lost in the common crowd of seamentraders of the archipelago and if they emerged from their obscurity it was only to be condemned as lawbreakers their lives were thrown away for a cause that had no right to exist in the face of an irresistible and orderly progresstheir thoughtless lives guided by a simple feeling  but the wasted lives for the few who know have tinged with romance the region of shallow waters and forestclad islands that lies far east and still mysterious between the deep waters of two oceans   i  out of the level blue of a shallow sea carimata raises a lofty barrenness of grey and yellow tints the drab eminence of its arid heights separated by a narrow strip of water suroeton to the west shows a curved and ridged outline resembling the backbone of a stooping giant and to the eastward a troop of insignificant islets stand effaced indistinct with vague features that seem to melt into the gathering shadows the night following from the eastward the retreat of the setting sun advanced slowly swallowing the land and the sea the land broken tormented and abrupt the sea smooth and inviting with its easy polish of continuous surface to wanderings facile and endless  there was no wind and a small brig that had lain all the afternoon a few miles to the northward and westward of carimata had hardly altered its position half a mile during all these hours the calm was absolute a dead flat calm the stillness of a dead sea and of a dead atmosphere as far as the eye could reach there was nothing but an impressive immobility nothing moved on earth on the waters and above them in the unbroken lustre of the sky on the unruffled surface of the straits the brig floated tranquil and upright as if bolted solidly keel to keel with its own image reflected in the unframed and immense mirror of the sea to the south and east the double islands watched silently the double ship that seemed fixed amongst them forever a hopeless captive of the calm a helpless prisoner of the shallow sea  since midday when the light and capricious airs of these seas had abandoned the little brig to its lingering fate her head had swung slowly to the westward and the end of her slender and polished jibboom projecting boldly beyond the graceful curve of the bow pointed at the setting sun like a spear poised high in the hand of an enemy right aft by the wheel the malay quartermaster stood with his bare brown feet firmly planted on the wheelgrating and holding the spokes at right angles in a solid grasp as though the ship had been running before a gale he stood there perfectly motionless as if petrified but ready to tend the helm as soon as fate would permit the brig to gather way through the oily sea  the only other human being then visible on the brigs deck was the person in charge a white man of low stature thickset with shaven cheeks a grizzled moustache and a face tinted a scarlet hue by the burning suns and by the sharp salt breezes of the seas he had thrown off his light jacket and clad only in white trousers and a thin cotton singlet with his stout arms crossed on his breastupon which they showed like two thick lumps of raw fleshhe prowled about from side to side of the halfpoop on his bare feet he wore a pair of straw sandals and his head was protected by an enormous pith hatonce white but now very dirtywhich gave to the whole man the aspect of a phenomenal and animated mushroom at times he would interrupt his uneasy shuffle athwart the break of the poop and stand motionless with a vague gaze fixed on the image of the brig in the calm water he could also see down there his own head and shoulders leaning out over the rail and he would stand long as if interested by his own features and mutter vague curses on the calm which lay upon the ship like an immovable burden immense and burning  at last he sighed profoundly nerved himself for a great effort and making a start away from the rail managed to drag his slippers as far as the binnacle there he stopped again exhausted and bored from under the lifted glass panes of the cabin skylight near by came the feeble chirp of a canary which appeared to give him some satisfaction he listened smiled faintly muttered dicky poor dick and fell back into the immense silence of the world his eyes closed his head hung low over the hot brass of the binnacle top suddenly he stood up with a jerk and said sharply in a hoarse voice  youve been sleepingyou shift the helm she has got stern way on her  the malay without the least flinch of feature or pose as if he had been an inanimate object called suddenly into life by some hidden magic of the words spun the wheel rapidly letting the spokes pass through his hands and when the motion had stopped with a grinding noise caught hold again and held on grimly after a while however he turned his head slowly over his shoulder glanced at the sea and said in an obstinate tone  no catch windno get way  no catchno catchthats all you know about it growled the redfaced seaman by and by catch ali he went on with sudden condescension by and by catch and then the helm will be the right way see  the stolid seacannie appeared to see and for that matter to hear nothing the white man looked at the impassive malay with disgust then glanced around the horizonthen again at the helmsman and ordered curtly  shift the helm back again dont you feel the air from aft you are like a dummy standing there  the malay revolved the spokes again with disdainful obedience and the redfaced man was moving forward grunting to himself when through the open skylight the hail on deck there arrested him short attentive and with a sudden change to amiability in the expression of his face  yes sir he said bending his ear toward the opening whats the matter up there asked a deep voice from below  the redfaced man in a tone of surprise said  sir  i hear that rudder grinding hard up and hard down what are you up to shaw any wind  yees drawled shaw putting his head down the skylight and speaking into the gloom of the cabin i thought there was a light air andbut its gone now not a breath anywhere under the heavens  he withdrew his head and waited a while by the skylight but heard only the chirping of the indefatigable canary a feeble twittering that seemed to ooze through the drooping red blossoms of geraniums growing in flowerpots under the glass panes he strolled away a step or two before the voice from down below called hurriedly  hey shaw are you there  yes captain lingard he answered stepping back have we drifted anything this afternoon  not an inch sir not an inch we might as well have been at anchor  its always so said the invisible lingard his voice changed its tone as he moved in the cabin and directly afterward burst out with a clear intonation while his head appeared above the slide of the cabin entrance  always so the currents dont begin till its dark when a man cant see against what confounded thing he is being drifted and then the breeze will come dead on end too i dont doubt  shaw moved his shoulders slightly the malay at the wheel after making a dive to see the time by the cabin clock through the skylight rang a double stroke on the small bell aft directly forward on the main deck a shrill whistle arose long drawn modulated dying away softly the master of the brig stepped out of the companion upon the deck of his vessel glanced aloft at the yards laid dead square then from the doorstep took a long lingering look round the horizon  he was about thirtyfive erect and supple he moved freely more like a man accustomed to stride over plains and hills than like one who from his earliest youth had been used to counteract by sudden swayings of his body the rise and roll of cramped decks of small craft tossed by the caprice of angry or playful seas  he wore a grey flannel shirt and his white trousers were held by a blue silk scarf wound tightly round his narrow waist he had come up only for a moment but finding the poop shaded by the maintopsail he remained on deck bareheaded the light chestnut hair curled close about his wellshaped head and the clipped beard glinted vividly when he passed across a narrow strip of sunlight as if every hair in it had been a wavy and attenuated gold wire his mouth was lost in the heavy moustache his nose was straight short slightly blunted at the end a broad band of deeper red stretched under the eyes clung to the cheek bones the eyes gave the face its remarkable expression the eyebrows darker than the hair pencilled a straight line below the wide and unwrinkled brow much whiter than the sunburnt face the eyes as if glowing with the light of a hidden fire had a red glint in their greyness that gave a scrutinizing ardour to the steadiness of their gaze  that man once so well known and now so completely forgotten amongst the charming and heartless shores of the shallow sea had amongst his fellows the nickname of redeyed tom he was proud of his luck but not of his good sense he was proud of his brig of the speed of his craft which was reckoned the swiftest country vessel in those seas and proud of what she represented  she represented a run of luck on the victorian goldfields his sagacious moderation long days of planning of loving care in building the great joy of his youth the incomparable freedom of the seas a perfect because a wandering home his independence his loveand his anxiety he had often heard men say that tom lingard cared for nothing on earth but for his brigand in his thoughts he would smilingly correct the statement by adding that he cared for nothing living but the brig  to him she was as full of life as the great world he felt her live in every motion in every roll in every sway of her tapering masts of those masts whose painted trucks move forever to a seamans eye against the clouds or against the stars to him she was always preciouslike old love always desirablelike a strange woman always tenderlike a mother always faithfullike the favourite daughter of a mans heart  for hours he would stand elbow on rail his head in his hand and listenand listen in dreamy stillness to the cajoling and promising whisper of the sea that slipped past in vanishing bubbles along the smooth blackpainted sides of his craft what passed in such moments of thoughtful solitude through the mind of that child of generations of fishermen from the coast of devon who like most of his class was dead to the subtle voices and blind to the mysterious aspects of the worldthe man ready for the obvious no matter how startling how terrible or menacing yet defenceless as a child before the shadowy impulses of his own heart what could have been the thoughts of such a man when once surrendered to a dreamy mood it is difficult to say  no doubt he like most of us would be uplifted at times by the awakened lyrism of his heart into regions charming empty and dangerous but also like most of us he was unaware of his barren journeys above the interesting cares of this earth yet from these no doubt absurd and wasted moments there remained on the mans daily life a tinge as that of a glowing and serene halflight it softened the outlines of his rugged nature and these moments kept close the bond between him and his brig  he was aware that his little vessel could give him something not to be had from anybody or anything in the world something specially his own the dependence of that solid man of bone and muscle on that obedient thing of wood and iron acquired from that feeling the mysterious dignity of love shethe crafthad all the qualities of a living thing speed obedience trustworthiness endurance beauty capacity to do and to sufferall but life hethe manwas the inspirer of that thing that to him seemed the most perfect of its kind his will was its will his thought was its impulse his breath was the breath of its existence he felt all this confusedly without ever shaping this feeling into the soundless formulas of thought to him she was unique and dear this brig of three hundred and fourteen tons registera kingdom  and now bareheaded and burly he walked the deck of his kingdom with a regular stride he stepped out from the hip swinging his arms with the free motion of a man starting out for a fifteenmile walk into open country yet at every twelfth stride he had to turn about sharply and pace back the distance to the taffrail  shaw with his hands stuck in his waistband had hooked himself with both elbows to the rail and gazed apparently at the deck between his feet in reality he was contemplating a little house with a tiny front garden lost in a maze of riverside streets in the east end of london the circumstance that he had not as yet been able to make the acquaintance of his sonnow aged eighteen monthsworried him slightly and was the cause of that flight of his fancy into the murky atmosphere of his home but it was a placid flight followed by a quick return in less than two minutes he was back in the brig all there as his saying was he was proud of being always all there  he was abrupt in manner and grumpy in speech with the seamen to his successive captains he was outwardly as deferential as he knew how and as a rule inwardly hostileso very few seemed to him of the all there kind of lingard with whom he had only been a short timehaving been picked up in madras roads out of a home ship which he had to leave after a thumping row with the masterhe generally approved although he recognized with regret that this man like most others had some absurd fads he defined them as bottomupwards notions  he was a manas there were manyof no particular value to anybody but himself and of no account but as the chief mate of the brig and the only white man on board of her besides the captain he felt himself immeasurably superior to the malay seamen whom he had to handle and treated them with lofty toleration notwithstanding his opinion that at a pinch those chaps would be found emphatically not there  as soon as his mind came back from his home leave he detached himself from the rail and walking forward stood by the break of the poop looking along the port side of the main deck lingard on his own side stopped in his walk and also gazed absentmindedly before him in the waist of the brig in the narrow spars that were lashed on each side of the hatchway he could see a group of men squatting in a circle around a wooden tray piled up with rice which stood on the just swept deck the darkfaced softeyed silent men squatting on their hams fed decorously with an earnestness that did not exclude reserve  of the lot only one or two wore sarongs the others having submittedat least at seato the indignity of european trousers only two sat on the spars one a man with a childlike light yellow face smiling with fatuous imbecility under the wisps of straight coarse hair dyed a mahogany tint was the tindal of the crewa kind of boatswains or serangs mate the other sitting beside him on the booms was a man nearly black not much bigger than a large ape and wearing on his wrinkled face that look of comical truculence which is often characteristic of men from the southwestern coast of sumatra  this was the kassab or storekeeper the holder of a position of dignity and ease the kassab was the only one of the crew taking their evening meal who noticed the presence on deck of their commander he muttered something to the tindal who directly cocked his old hat on one side which senseless action invested him with an altogether foolish appearance the others heard but went on somnolently feeding with spidery movements of their lean arms  the sun was no more than a degree or so above the horizon and from the heated surface of the waters a slight low mist began to rise a mist thin invisible to the human eye yet strong enough to change the sun into a mere glowing red disc a disc vertical and hot rolling down to the edge of the horizontal and coldlooking disc of the shining sea then the edges touched and the circular expanse of water took on suddenly a tint sombre like a frown deep like the brooding meditation of evil  the falling sun seemed to be arrested for a moment in his descent by the sleeping waters while from it to the motionless brig shot out on the polished and dark surface of the sea a track of light straight and shining resplendent and direct a path of gold and crimson and purple a path that seemed to lead dazzling and terrible from the earth straight into heaven through the portals of a glorious death it faded slowly the sea vanquished the light at last only a vestige of the sun remained far off like a red spark floating on the water it lingered and all at oncewithout warningwent out as if extinguished by a treacherous hand  gone cried lingard who had watched intently yet missed the last moment gone look at the cabin clock shaw  nearly right i think sir three minutes past six  the helmsman struck four bells sharply another barefooted seacannie glided on the far side of the poop to relieve the wheel and the serang of the brig came up the ladder to take charge of the deck from shaw he came up to the compass and stood waiting silently  the course is south by east when you get the wind serang said shaw distinctly  sou by eas repeated the elderly malay with grave earnestness  let me know when she begins to steer added lingard  ya tuan answered the man glancing rapidly at the sky wind coming he muttered  i think so too whispered lingard as if to himself  the shadows were gathering rapidly round the brig a mulatto put his head out of the companion and called out  ready sir  lets get a mouthful of something to eat shaw said lingard i say just take a look around before coming below it will be dark when we come up again  certainly sir said shaw taking up a long glass and putting it to his eyes blessed thing he went on in snatches while he worked the tubes in and out i cantnever somehowah ive got it right at last  he revolved slowly on his heels keeping the end of the tube on the skyline then he shut the instrument with a click and said decisively  nothing in sight sir  he followed his captain down below rubbing his hands cheerfully  for a good while there was no sound on the poop of the brig then the seacannie at the wheel spoke dreamily  did the malim say there was no one on the sea  yes grunted the serang without looking at the man behind him  between the islands there was a boat pronounced the man very softly  the serang his hands behind his back his feet slightly apart stood very straight and stiff by the side of the compass stand his face now hardly visible was as inexpressive as the door of a safe  now listen to me insisted the helmsman in a gentle tone  the man in authority did not budge a hairs breadth the seacannie bent down a little from the height of the wheel grating  i saw a boat he murmured with something of the tender obstinacy of a lover begging for a favour i saw a boat o haji wasub ya haji wasub  the serang had been twice a pilgrim and was not insensible to the sound of his rightful title there was a grim smile on his face  you saw a floating tree o sali he said ironically  i am sali and my eyes are better than the bewitched brass thing that pulls out to a great length said the pertinacious helmsman there was a boat just clear of the easternmost island there was a boat and they in her could see the ship on the light of the westunless they are blind men lost on the sea i have seen her have you seen her too o haji wasub  am i a fat white man snapped the serang i was a man of the sea before you were born o sali the order is to keep silence and mind the rudder lest evil befall the ship  after these words he resumed his rigid aloofness he stood his legs slightly apart very stiff and straight a little on one side of the compass stand his eyes travelled incessantly from the illuminated card to the shadowy sails of the brig and back again while his body was motionless as if made of wood and built into the ships frame thus with a forced and tense watchfulness haji wasub serang of the brig lightning kept the captains watch unwearied and wakeful a slave to duty  in half an hour after sunset the darkness had taken complete possession of earth and heavens the islands had melted into the night and on the smooth water of the straits the little brig lying so still seemed to sleep profoundly wrapped up in a scented mantle of star light and silence    ii  it was halfpast eight oclock before lingard came on deck again shawnow with a coat ontrotted up and down the poop leaving behind him a smell of tobacco smoke an irregularly glowing spark seemed to run by itself in the darkness before the rounded form of his head above the masts of the brig the dome of the clear heaven was full of lights that flickered as if some mighty breathings high up there had been swaying about the flame of the stars there was no sound along the brigs decks and the heavy shadows that lay on it had the aspect in that silence of secret places concealing crouching forms that waited in perfect stillness for some decisive event lingard struck a match to light his cheroot and his powerful face with narrowed eyes stood out for a moment in the night and vanished suddenly then two shadowy forms and two red sparks moved backward and forward on the poop a larger but a paler and oval patch of light from the compass lamps lay on the brasses of the wheel and on the breast of the malay standing by the helm lingards voice as if unable altogether to master the enormous silence of the sea sounded muffled very calmwithout the usual deep ring in it  not much change shaw he said  no sir not much i can just see the islandthe big onestill in the same place it strikes me sir that for calms this here sea is a devil of locality  he cut locality in two with an emphatic pause it was a good word he was pleased with himself for thinking of it he went on again  nowsince noon this big island  carimata shaw interrupted lingard  aye sir carimatai mean i must saybeing a stranger hereaboutsi havent got the run of those  he was going to say names but checked himself and said appellations instead sounding every syllable lovingly  having for these last fifteen years he continued sailed regularly from london in eastindiamen i am more at home over therein the bay  he pointed into the night toward the northwest and stared as if he could see from where he stood that bay of bengal whereas he affirmedhe would be so much more at home  youll soon get used muttered lingard swinging in his rapid walk past his mate then he turned round came back and asked sharply  you said there was nothing afloat in sight before dark hey  not that i could see sir when i took the deck again at eight i asked that serang whether there was anything about and i understood him to say there was no more as when i went below at six this is a lonely sea at timesaint it sir now one would think at this time of the year the homewardbounders from china would be pretty thick here  yes said lingard we have met very few ships since we left pedra branca over the stern yes it has been a lonely sea but for all that shaw this sea if lonely is not blind every island in it is an eye and now since our squadron has left for the china waters  he did not finish his sentence shaw put his hands in his pockets and propped his back against the skylight comfortably  they say there is going to be a war with china he said in a gossiping tone and the french are going along with us as they did in the crimea five years ago it seems to me were getting mighty good friends with the french ive not much of an opinion about that what do you think captain lingard  i have met their menofwar in the pacific said lingard slowly the ships were fine and the fellows in them were civil enough to meand very curious about my business he added with a laugh however i wasnt there to make war on them i had a rotten old cutter then for trade shaw he went on with animation  had you sir said shaw without any enthusiasm now give me a big shipa ship i say that one may  and later on some years ago interrupted lingard i chummed with a french skipper in ampanambeing the only two white men in the whole place he was a good fellow and free with his red wine his english was difficult to understand but he could sing songs in his own language about ahmoorahmoor means love in frenchshaw  so it does sirso it does when i was second mate of a sunderland barque in fortyone in the mediterranean i could pay out their lingo as easy as you would a fiveinch warp over a ships side  yes he was a proper man pursued lingard meditatively as if for himself only you could not find a better fellow for company ashore he had an affair with a bali girl who one evening threw a red blossom at him from within a doorway as we were going together to pay our respects to the rajahs nephew he was a goodlooking frenchman he wasbut the girl belonged to the rajahs nephew and it was a serious matter the old rajah got angry and said the girl must die i dont think the nephew cared particularly to have her krissed but the old fellow made a great fuss and sent one of his own chief men to see the thing doneand the girl had enemiesher own relations approved we could do nothing mind shaw there was absolutely nothing else between them but that unlucky flower which the frenchman pinned to his coatand afterward when the girl was dead wore under his shirt hung round his neck in a small box i suppose he had nothing else to put it into  would those savages kill a woman for that asked shaw incredulously  aye they are pretty moral there that was the first time in my life i nearly went to war on my own account shaw we couldnt talk those fellows over we couldnt bribe them though the frenchman offered the best he had and i was ready to back him to the last dollar to the last rag of cotton shaw no usethey were that blamed respectable so says the frenchman to me my friend if they wont take our gunpowder for a gift let us burn it to give them lead i was armed as you see now six eightpounders on the main deck and a long eighteen on the forecastleand i wanted to try em you may believe me however the frenchman had nothing but a few old muskets and the beggars got to windward of us by fair words till one morning a boats crew from the frenchmans ship found the girl lying dead on the beach that put an end to our plans she was out of her trouble anyhow and no reasonable man will fight for a dead woman i was never vengeful shaw andafter allshe didnt throw that flower at me but it broke the frenchman up altogether he began to mope did no business and shortly afterward sailed away i cleared a good many pence out of that trip i remember  with these words he seemed to come to the end of his memories of that trip shaw stifled a yawn  women are the cause of a lot of trouble he said dispassionately in the morayshire i remember we had once a passengeran old gentlemanwho was telling us a yarn about them oldtime greeks fighting for ten years about some woman the turks kidnapped her or something anyway they fought in turkey which i may well believe them greeks and turks were always fighting my father was masters mate on board one of the threedeckers at the battle of navarinoand that was when we went to help those greeks but this affair about a woman was long before that time  i should think so muttered lingard hanging over the rail and watching the fleeting gleams that passed deep down in the water along the ships bottom  yes times are changed they were unenlightened in those old days my grandfather was a preacher and though my father served in the navy i dont hold with war sinful the old gentleman called itand i think so too unless with chinamen or niggers or such people as must be kept in order and wont listen to reason having not sense enough to know whats good for them when its explained to them by their bettersmissionaries and such like authorities but to fight ten years and for a woman  i have read the tale in a book said lingard speaking down over the side as if setting his words gently afloat upon the sea i have read the tale she was very beautiful  that only makes it worse sirif anything you may depend on it she was no good those pagan times will never come back thank god ten years of murder and unrighteousness and for a woman would anybody do it now would you do it sir would you  the sound of a bell struck sharply interrupted shaws discourse high aloft some dry block sent out a screech short and lamentable like a cry of pain it pierced the quietness of the night to the very core and seemed to destroy the reserve which it had imposed upon the tones of the two men who spoke now loudly  throw the cover over the binnacle said lingard in his duty voice the thing shines like a full moon we mustnt show more lights than we can help when becalmed at night so near the land no use in being seen if you cant see yourselfis there bear that in mind mr shaw there may be some vagabonds prying about  i thought all this was over and done for said shaw busying himself with the cover since sir thomas cochrane swept along the borneo coast with his squadron some years ago he did a rare lot of fightingdidnt he we heard about it from the chaps of the sloop diana that was refitting in calcutta when i was there in the warwick castle they took some kings town up a river hereabouts the chaps were full of it  sir thomas did good work answered lingard but it will be a long time before these seas are as safe as the english channel is in peace time i spoke about that light more to get you in the way of things to be attended to in these seas than for anything else did you notice how few native craft weve sighted for all these days we have been drifting aboutone may sayin this sea  i cant say i have attached any significance to the fact sir  its a sign that something is up once set a rumour afloat in these waters and it will make its way from island to island without any breeze to drive it along  being myself a deepwater man sailing steadily out of home ports nearly all my life said shaw with great deliberation i cannot pretend to see through the peculiarities of them outoftheway parts but i can keep a lookout in an ordinary way and i have noticed that craft of any kind seemed scarce for the last few days considering that we had land aboard of usone side or anothernearly every day  you will get to know the peculiarities as you call them if you remain any time with me remarked lingard negligently  i hope i shall give satisfaction whether the time be long or short said shaw accentuating the meaning of his words by the distinctness of his utterance a man who has spent thirtytwo years of his life on saltwater can say no more if being an officer of home ships for the last fifteen years i dont understand the heathen ways of them there savages in matters of seamanship and duty you will find me all there captain lingard  except judging from what you said a little while agoexcept in the matter of fighting said lingard with a short laugh  fighting i am not aware that anybody wants to fight me i am a peaceable man captain lingard but when put to it i could fight as well as any of them flatnosed chaps we have to make shift with instead of a proper crew of decent christians fighting he went on with unexpected pugnacity of tone fighting if anybody comes to fight me he will find me all there i swear  thats all right thats all right said lingard stretching his arms above his head and wriggling his shoulders my word i do wish a breeze would come to let us get away from here i am rather in a hurry shaw  indeed sir well i never yet met a thorough seafaring man who was not in a hurry when a condemned spell of calm had him by the heels when a breeze comes    just listen to this sir  i hear it said lingard tiderip shaw  so i presume sir but what a fuss it makes seldom heard such a  on the sea upon the furthest limits of vision appeared an advancing streak of seething foam resembling a narrow white ribbon drawn rapidly along the level surface of the water by its two ends which were lost in the darkness it reached the brig passed under stretching out on each side and on each side the water became noisy breaking into numerous and tiny wavelets a mimicry of an immense agitation yet the vessel in the midst of this sudden and loud disturbance remained as motionless and steady as if she had been securely moored between the stone walls of a safe dock in a few moments the line of foam and ripple running swiftly north passed at once beyond sight and earshot leaving no trace on the unconquerable calm  now this is very curious began shaw  lingard made a gesture to command silence he seemed to listen yet as if the wash of the ripple could have had an echo which he expected to hear and a mans voice that was heard forward had something of the impersonal ring of voices thrown back from hard and lofty cliffs upon the empty distances of the sea it spoke in malayfaintly  what hailed shaw what is it  lingard put a restraining hand for a moment on his chief officers shoulder and moved forward smartly shaw followed puzzled the rapid exchange of incomprehensible words thrown backward and forward through the shadows of the brigs main deck from his captain to the lookout man and back again made him feel sadly out of it somehow  lingard had called out sharplywhat do you see the answer direct and quick wasi hear tuan i hear oars  whereabouts  the night is all around us i hear them near  port or starboard  there was a short delay in answer this time on the quarterdeck under the poop bare feet shuffled somebody coughed at last the voice forward said doubtfully  kanan  call the serang mr shaw said lingard calmly and have the hands turned up they are all lying about the decks look sharp now theres something near us its annoying to be caught like this he added in a vexed tone  he crossed over to the starboard side and stood listening one hand grasping the royal backstay his ear turned to the sea but he could hear nothing from there the quarterdeck was filled with subdued sounds suddenly a long shrill whistle soared reverberated loudly amongst the flat surfaces of motionless sails and gradually grew faint as if the sound had escaped and gone away running upon the water haji wasub was on deck and ready to carry out the white mans commands then silence fell again on the brig until shaw spoke quietly  i am going forward now sir with the tindal were all at stations  aye mr shaw very good mind they dont board youbut i can hear nothing not a sound it cant be much  the fellow has been dreaming no doubt i have good ears too and  he went forward and the end of his sentence was lost in an indistinct growl lingard stood attentive one by one the three seacannies off duty appeared on the poop and busied themselves around a big chest that stood by the side of the cabin companion a rattle and clink of steel weapons turned out on the deck was heard but the men did not even whisper lingard peered steadily into the night then shook his head  serang he called half aloud  the spare old man ran up the ladder so smartly that his bony feet did not seem to touch the steps he stood by his commander his hands behind his back a figure indistinct but straight as an arrow  who was looking out asked lingard  badroon the bugis said wasub in his crisp jerky manner  i can hear nothing badroon heard the noise in his mind  the night hides the boat  have you seen it  yes tuan small boat before sunset by the land now coming herenear badroon heard him  why didnt you report it then asked lingard sharply  malim spoke he said nothing there while i could see how could i know what was in his mind or yours tuan  do you hear anything now  no they stopped now perhaps lost the shipwho knows perhaps afraid  well muttered lingard moving his feet uneasily i believe you lie what kind of boat  white mens boat a fourmen boat i think small tuan i hear him now there  he stretched his arm straight out pointing abeam for a time then his arm fell slowly  coming this way he added with decision  from forward shaw called out in a startled tone  something on the water sir broad on this bow  all right called back lingard  a lump of blacker darkness floated into his view from it came over the water english wordsdeliberate reaching him one by one as if each had made its own difficult way through the profound stillness of the night  whatshipisthatpray  english brig answered lingard after a short moment of hesitation  a brig i thought you were something bigger went on the voice from the sea with a tinge of disappointment in its deliberate tone i am coming alongsideifyouplease  no you dont called lingard back sharply the leisurely drawl of the invisible speaker seemed to him offensive and woke up a hostile feeling no you dont if you care for your boat where do you spring from who are youanyhow how many of you are there in that boat  after these emphatic questions there was an interval of silence during that time the shape of the boat became a little more distinct she must have carried some way on her yet for she loomed up bigger and nearly abreast of where lingard stood before the selfpossessed voice was heard again  i will show you  then after another short pause the voice said less loud but very plain  strike on the gunwale strike hard john and suddenly a blue light blazed out illuminating with a livid flame a round patch in the night in the smoke and splutter of that ghastly halo appeared a white fouroared gig with five men sitting in her in a row their heads were turned toward the brig with a strong expression of curiosity on their faces which in this glare brilliant and sinister took on a deathlike aspect and resembled the faces of interested corpses then the bowman dropped into the water the light he held above his head and the darkness rushing back at the boat swallowed it with a loud and angry hiss  five of us said the composed voice out of the night that seemed now darker than before four hands and myself we belong to a yachta british yacht  come on board shouted lingard why didnt you speak at once i thought you might have been some masquerading dutchmen from a dodging gunboat  do i speak like a blamed dutchman pull a stroke boysoars tend bow john  the boat came alongside with a gentle knock and a mans shape began to climb at once up the brigs side with a kind of ponderous agility it poised itself for a moment on the rail to say down into the boatsheer off a little boys then jumped on deck with a thud and said to shaw who was coming aft good evening    captain sir  no on the poop growled shaw  come up here come up called lingard impatiently  the malays had left their stations and stood clustered by the mainmast in a silent group not a word was spoken on the brigs decks while the stranger made his way to the waiting captain lingard saw approaching him a short dapper man who touched his cap and repeated his greeting in a cool drawl  good evening   captain sir  yes i am the masterwhats the matter adrift from your ship or what  adrift no we left her four days ago and have been pulling that gig in a calm nearly ever since my men are done so is the water lucky thing i sighted you  you sighted me exclaimed lingard when what time  not in the dark you may be sure weve been knocking about amongst some islands to the southward breaking our hearts tugging at the oars in one channel then in anothertrying to get clear we got round an isleta barren thing in shape like a loaf of sugarand i caught sight of a vessel a long way off i took her bearing in a hurry and we buckled to but another of them currents must have had hold of us for it was a long time before we managed to clear that islet i steered by the stars and by the lord harry i began to think i had missed you somehowbecause it must have been you i saw  yes it must have been we had nothing in sight all day assented lingard wheres your vessel he asked eagerly  hard and fast on middling soft mudi should think about sixty miles from here we are the second boat sent off for assistance we parted company with the other on tuesday she must have passed to the northward of you today the chief officer is in her with orders to make for singapore i am second and was sent off toward the straits here on the chance of falling in with some ship i have a letter from the owner our gentry are tired of being stuck in the mud and wish for assistance  what assistance did you expect to find down here  the letter will tell you that may i ask captain for a little water for the chaps in my boat and i myself would thank you for a drink we havent had a mouthful since this afternoon our breaker leaked out somehow  see to it mr shaw said lingard come down the cabin mr  carter is my name  ah mr carter come down come down went on lingard leading the way down the cabin stairs  the steward had lighted the swinging lamp and had put a decanter and bottles on the table the cuddy looked cheerful painted white with gold mouldings round the panels opposite the curtained recess of the stern windows there was a sideboard with a marble top and above it a lookingglass in a gilt frame the semicircular couch round the stern had cushions of crimson plush the table was covered with a black indian tablecloth embroidered in vivid colours between the beams of the poopdeck were fitted racks for muskets the barrels of which glinted in the light there were twentyfour of them between the four beams as many swordbayonets of an old pattern encircled the polished teakwood of the ruddercasing with a double belt of brass and steel all the doors of the staterooms had been taken off the hinges and only curtains closed the doorways they seemed to be made of yellow chinese silk and fluttered all together the four of them as the two men entered the cuddy  carter took in all at a glance but his eyes were arrested by a circular shield hung slanting above the brass hilts of the bayonets on its red field in relief and brightly gilt was represented a sheaf of conventional thunderbolts darting down the middle between the two capitals t l lingard examined his guest curiously he saw a young man but looking still more youthful with a boyish smooth face much sunburnt twinkling blue eyes fair hair and a slight moustache he noticed his arrested gaze  ah youre looking at that thing its a present from the builder of this brig the best man that ever launched a craft its supposed to be the ships name between my initialsflash of lightningdyou see the brigs name is lightning and mine is lingard  very pretty thing that shows the cabin off well murmured carter politely  they drank nodding at each other and sat down  now for the letter said lingard  carter passed it over the table and looked about while lingard took the letter out of an open envelope addressed to the commander of any british ship in the java sea the paper was thick had an embossed heading schooneryacht hermit and was dated four days before the message said that on a hazy night the yacht had gone ashore upon some outlying shoals off the coast of borneo the land was low the opinion of the sailingmaster was that the vessel had gone ashore at the top of high water spring tides the coast was completely deserted to all appearance during the four days they had been stranded there they had sighted in the distance two small native vessels which did not approach the owner concluded by asking any commander of a homewardbound ship to report the yachts position in anjer on his way through sunda straitsor to any british or dutch manofwar he might meet the letter ended by anticipatory thanks the offer to pay any expenses in connection with the sending of messages from anjer and the usual polite expressions  folding the paper slowly in the old creases lingard saidi am not going to anjernor anywhere near  any place will do i fancy said carter  not the place where i am bound to answered lingard opening the letter again and glancing at it uneasily he does not describe very well the coast and his latitude is very uncertain he went on i am not clear in my mind where exactly you are stranded and yet i know every inch of that landover there  carter cleared his throat and began to talk in his slow drawl he seemed to dole out facts to disclose with sparing words the features of the coast but every word showed the minuteness of his observation the clear vision of a seaman able to master quickly the aspect of a strange land and of a strange sea he presented with concise lucidity the picture of the tangle of reefs and sandbanks through which the yacht had miraculously blundered in the dark before she took the ground  the weather seems clear enough at sea he observed finally and stopped to drink a long draught lingard bending over the table had been listening with eager attention carter went on in his curt and deliberate manner  i noticed some high trees on what i take to be the mainland to the southand whoever has business in that bight was smart enough to whitewash two of them one on the point and another farther in landmarks i guess    whats the matter captain  lingard had jumped to his feet but carters exclamation caused him to sit down again  nothing nothing    tell me how many men have you in that yacht  twentythree besides the gentry the owner his wife and a spanish gentlemana friend they picked up in manila  so you were coming from manila  aye bound for batavia the owner wishes to study the dutch colonial system wants to expose it he says one cant help hearing a lot when keeping watch aftyou know how it is then we are going to ceylon to meet the mailboat there the owner is going home as he came out overland through egypt the yacht would return round the cape of course  a lady said lingard you say there is a lady on board are you armed  not much replied carter negligently there are a few muskets and two sporting guns aft thats about alli fancy its too much or not enough he added with a faint smile  lingard looked at him narrowly  did you come out from home in that craft he asked  not i i am not one of them regular yacht hands i came out of the hospital in hongkong ive been two years on the china coast  he stopped then added in an explanatory murmur  opium clippersyou know nothing of brass buttons about me my ship left me behind and i was in want of work i took this job but i didnt want to go home particularly its slow work after sailing with old robinson in the lyemoon that was my ship heard of her captain  yes yes said lingard hastily look here mr carter which way was your chief officer trying for singapore through the straits of rhio  i suppose so answered carter in a slightly surprised tone why do you ask  just to know    what is it mr shaw  theres a black cloud rising to the northward sir and we shall get a breeze directly said shaw from the doorway  he lingered there with his eyes fixed on the decanters  will you have a glass said lingard leaving his seat i will go up and have a look  he went on deck shaw approached the table and began to help himself handling the bottles in profound silence and with exaggerated caution as if he had been measuring out of fragile vessels a dose of some deadly poison carter his hands in his pockets and leaning back examined him from head to foot with a cool stare the mate of the brig raised the glass to his lips and glaring above the rim at the stranger drained the contents slowly  you have a fine nose for finding ships in the dark mister he said distinctly putting the glass on the table with extreme gentleness  eh whats that i sighted you just after sunset  and you knew where to look too said shaw staring hard  i looked to the westward where there was still some light as any sensible man would do retorted the other a little impatiently what are you trying to get at  and you have a ready tongue to blow about yourselfhavent you  never saw such a man in my life declared carter with a return of his nonchalant manner you seem to be troubled about something  i dont like boats to come sneaking up from nowhere in particular alongside a ship when i am in charge of the deck i can keep a lookout as well as any man out of home ports but i hate to be circumvented by muffled oars and such ungentlemanlike tricks yacht officerindeed these seas must be full of such yachtsmen i consider you played a mean trick on me i told my old man there was nothing in sight at sunsetand no more there was i believe you blundered upon us by chancefor all your boasting about sunsets and bearings gammon i know you came on blindly on top of us and with muffled oars too dye call that decent  if i did muffle the oars it was for a good reason i wanted to slip past a cove where some native craft were moored that was common prudence in such a small boat and not armedas i am i saw you right enough but i had no intention to startle anybody take my word for it  i wish you had gone somewhere else growled shaw i hate to be put in the wrong through accident and untruthfulnessthere heres my old man calling me  he left the cabin hurriedly and soon afterward lingard came down and sat again facing carter across the table his face was grave but resolute  we shall get the breeze directly he said  then sir said carter getting up if you will give me back that letter i shall go on cruising about here to speak some other ship i trust you will report us wherever you are going  i am going to the yacht and i shall keep the letter answered lingard with decision i know exactly where she is and i must go to the rescue of those people its most fortunate youve fallen in with me mr carter fortunate for them and fortunate for me he added in a lower tone  yes drawled carter reflectively there may be a tidy bit of salvage money if you should get the vessel off but i dont think you can do much i had better stay out here and try to speak some gunboat  you must come back to your ship with me said lingard authoritatively never mind the gunboats  that wouldnt be carrying out my orders argued carter ive got to speak a homewardbound ship or a manofwarthats plain enough i am not anxious to knock about for days in an open boat butlet me fill my freshwater breaker captain and i will be off  nonsense said lingard sharply youve got to come with me to show the place andand help ill take your boat in tow  carter did not seem convinced lingard laid a heavy hand on his shoulder  look here young fellow i am tom lingard and theres not a white man among these islands and very few natives that have not heard of me my luck brought you into my shipand now ive got you you must stay you must  the last must burst out loud and sharp like a pistolshot carter stepped back  do you mean you would keep me by force he asked startled  force repeated lingard it rests with you i cannot let you speak any vessel your yacht has gone ashore in a most inconvenient placefor me and with your boats sent off here and there you would bring every infernal gunboat buzzing to a spot that was as quiet and retired as the heart of man could wish you stranding just on that spot of the whole coast was my bad luck and that i could not help you coming upon me like this is my good luck and that i hold  he dropped his clenched fist big and muscular in the light of the lamp on the black cloth amongst the glitter of glasses with the strong fingers closed tight upon the firm flesh of the palm he left it there for a moment as if showing carter that luck he was going to hold and he went on  do you know into what hornets nest your stupid people have blundered how much dye think their lives are worth just now not a brass farthing if the breeze fails me for another twentyfour hours you may well open your eyes it is so and it may be too late now while i am arguing with you here  he tapped the table with his knuckles and the glasses waking up jingled a thin plaintive finale to his speech carter stood leaning against the sideboard he was amazed by the unexpected turn of the conversation his jaw dropped slightly and his eyes never swerved for a moment from lingards face the silence in the cabin lasted only a few seconds but to carter who waited breathlessly it seemed very long and all at once he heard in it for the first time the cabin clock tick distinctly in pulsating beats as though a little heart of metal behind the dial had been started into sudden palpitation  a gunboat shouted lingard suddenly as if he had seen only in that moment by the light of some vivid flash of thought all the difficulties of the situation if you dont go back with me there will be nothing left for you to go back tovery soon your gunboat wont find a single ships rib or a single corpse left for a landmark that she wont it isnt a gunboat skipper you want i am the man you want you dont know your luck when you see it but i know mine i doandlook here  he touched carters chest with his forefinger and said with a sudden gentleness of tone  i am a white man inside and out i wont let inoffensive peopleand a woman toocome to harm if i can help it and if i cant help nobody can you understandnobody theres no time for it but i am like any other man that is worth his salt i wont let the end of an undertaking go by the board while there is a chance to hold onand its like this  his voice was persuasivealmost caressing he had hold now of a coat button and tugged at it slightly as he went on in a confidential manner  as it turns out mr carter i wouldin a manner of speakingi would as soon shoot you where you stand as let you go to raise an alarm all over this sea about your confounded yacht i have other lives to considerand friendsand promisesandand myself too i shall keep you he concluded sharply  carter drew a long breath on the deck above the two men could hear soft footfalls short murmurs indistinct words spoken near the skylight shaws voice rang out loudly in growling tones  furl the royals you tindal  its the queerest old go muttered carter looking down on to the floor you are a strange man i suppose i must believe what you sayunless you and that fat mate of yours are a couple of escaped lunatics that got hold of a brig by some means why that chap up there wanted to pick a quarrel with me for coming aboard and now you threaten to shoot me rather than let me go not that i care much about that for some time or other you would get hanged for it and you dont look like a man that will end that way if what you say is only half true i ought to get back to the yacht as quick as ever i can it strikes me that your coming to them will be only a small mercy anyhowand i may be of some usebut this is the queerest    may i go in my boat  as you like said lingard theres a rain squall coming  i am in charge and will get wet along of my chaps give us a good long line captain  its done already said lingard you seem a sensible sailorman and can see that it would be useless to try and give me the slip  for a man so ready to shoot you seem very trustful drawled carter if i cut adrift in a squall i stand a pretty fair chance not to see you again  you just try said lingard drily i have eyes in this brig young man that will see your boat when you couldnt see the ship you are of the kind i like but if you monkey with me i will find youand when i find you i will run you down as surely as i stand here  carter slapped his thigh and his eyes twinkled  by the lord harry he cried if it wasnt for the men with me i would try for sport you are so cocksure about the lot you can do captain you would aggravate a saint into open mutiny  his easy good humour had returned but after a short burst of laughter he became serious  never fear he said i wont slip away if there is to be any throatcuttingas you seem to hintmine will be there too i promise you and     he stretched his arms out glanced at them shook them a little  and this pair of arms to take care of it he added in his old careless drawl  but the master of the brig sitting with both his elbows on the table his face in his hands had fallen unexpectedly into a meditation so concentrated and so profound that he seemed neither to hear see nor breathe the sight of that mans complete absorption in thought was to carter almost more surprising than any other occurrence of that night had his strange host vanished suddenly from before his eyes it could not have made him feel more uncomfortably alone in that cabin where the pertinacious clock kept ticking off the useless minutes of the calm before it would with the same steady beat begin to measure the aimless disturbance of the storm    iii  after waiting a moment carter went on deck the sky the sea the brig itself had disappeared in a darkness that had become impenetrable palpable and stifling an immense cloud had come up running over the heavens as if looking for the little craft and now hung over it arrested to the south there was a livid trembling gleam faint and sad like a vanishing memory of destroyed starlight to the north as if to prove the impossible an incredibly blacker patch outlined on the tremendous blackness of the sky the heart of the coming squall the glimmers in the water had gone out and the invisible sea all around lay mute and still as if it had died suddenly of fright  carter could see nothing he felt about him people moving he heard them in the darkness whispering faintly as if they had been exchanging secrets important or infamous the night effaced even words and its mystery had captured everything and every soundhad left nothing free but the unexpected that seemed to hover about one ready to stretch out its stealthy hand in a touch sudden familiar and appalling even the careless disposition of the young exofficer of an opiumclipper was affected by the ominous aspect of the hour what was this vessel what were those people what would happen tomorrow to the yacht to himself he felt suddenly without any additional reason but the darkness that it was a poor show anyhow a dashed poor show for all hands the irrational conviction made him falter for a second where he stood and he gripped the slide of the companionway hard  shaws voice right close to his ear relieved and cleared his troubled thoughts  oh its you mister come up at last said the mate of the brig slowly it appears weve got to give you a tow now of all the rum incidents this beats all a boat sneaks up from nowhere and turns out to be a longexpected friend for you are one of them friends the skipper was going to meet somewhere here aint you now come i know more than you may think are we off toyou may just as well telloff tohm ha    you know  yes i know dont you articulated carter innocently  shaw remained very quiet for a minute  wheres my skipper he asked at last  i left him down below in a kind of trance wheres my boat  your boat is hanging astern and my opinion is that you are as uncivil as ive proved you to be untruthful egzzactly  carter stumbled toward the taffrail and in the first step he made came full against somebody who glided away it seemed to him that such a night brings men to a lower level he thought that he might have been knocked on the head by anybody strong enough to lift a crowbar he felt strangely irritated he said loudly aiming his words at shaw whom he supposed somewhere near  and my opinion is that you and your skipper will come to a sudden bad end before  i thought you were in your boat have you changed your mind asked lingard in his deep voice close to carters elbow  carter felt his way along the rail till his hand found a line that seemed in the calm to stream out of its own accord into the darkness he hailed his boat and directly heard the wash of water against her bows as she was hauled quickly under the counter then he loomed up shapeless on the rail and the next moment disappeared as if he had fallen out of the universe lingard heard him say  catch hold of my leg john there were hollow sounds in the boat a voice growled all right  keep clear of the counter said lingard speaking in quiet warning tones into the night the brig may get a lot of sternway on her should this squall not strike her fairly  aye aye i will mind was the muttered answer from the water  lingard crossed over to the port side and looked steadily at the sooty mass of approaching vapours after a moment he said curtly brace up for the port tack mr shaw and remained silent with his face to the sea a sound sorrowful and startling like the sigh of some immense creature travelling across the starless space passed above the vertical and lofty spars of the motionless brig  it grew louder then suddenly ceased for a moment and the taut rigging of the brig was heard vibrating its answer in a singing note to this threatening murmur of the winds a long and slow undulation lifted the level of the waters as if the sea had drawn a deep breath of anxious suspense the next minute an immense disturbance leaped out of the darkness upon the sea kindling upon it a livid clearness of foam and the first gust of the squall boarded the brig in a stinging flick of rain and spray as if overwhelmed by the suddenness of the fierce onset the vessel remained for a second upright where she floated shaking with tremendous jerks from trucks to keel while high up in the night the invisible canvas was heard rattling and beating about violently  then with a quick double report as of heavy guns both topsails filled at once and the brig fell over swiftly on her side shaw was thrown headlong against the skylight and lingard who had encircled the weather rail with his arm felt the vessel under his feet dart forward smoothly and the deck become less slantingthe speed of the brig running off a little now easing the overturning strain of the wind upon the distended surfaces of the sails it was only the fineness of the little vessels lines and the perfect shape of her hull that saved the canvas and perhaps the spars by enabling the ready craft to get way upon herself with such lightninglike rapidity lingard drew a long breath and yelled jubilantly at shaw who was struggling up against wind and rain to his commanders side  shell do hold on everything  shaw tried to speak he swallowed great mouthfuls of tepid water which the wind drove down his throat the brig seemed to sail through undulating waves that passed swishing between the masts and swept over the decks with the fierce rush and noise of a cataract from every spar and every rope a ragged sheet of water streamed flicking to leeward the overpowering deluge seemed to last for an age became unbearableand all at once stopped in a couple of minutes the shower had run its length over the brig and now could be seen like a straight grey wall going away into the night under the fierce whispering of dissolving clouds the wind eased to the northward low down in the darkness three stars appeared in a row leaping in and out between the crests of waves like the distant heads of swimmers in a running surf and the retreating edge of the cloud perfectly straight from east to west slipped along the dome of the sky like an immense hemispheric iron shutter pivoting down smoothly as if operated by some mighty engine an inspiring and penetrating freshness flowed together with the shimmer of light through the augmented glory of the heaven a glory exalted undimmed and strangely startling as if a new world had been created during the short flight of the stormy cloud it was a return to life a return to space the earth coming out from under a pall to take its place in the renewed and immense scintillation of the universe  the brig her yards slightly checked in ran with an easy motion under the topsails jib and driver pushing contemptuously aside the turbulent crowd of noisy and agitated waves as the craft went swiftly ahead she unrolled behind her over the uneasy darkness of the sea a broad ribbon of seething foam shot with wispy gleams of dark discs escaping from under the rudder far away astern at the end of a line no thicker than a black thread which dipped now and then its long curve in the bursting froth a toylike object could be made out elongated and dark racing after the brig over the snowy whiteness of her wake  lingard walked aft and with both his hands on the taffrail looked eagerly for carters boat the first glance satisfied him that the yachts gig was towing easily at the end of the long scope of line and he turned away to look ahead and to leeward with a steady gaze it was then half an hour past midnight and shaw relieved by wasub had gone below before he went he said to lingard i will be off sir if youre not going to make more sail yet not yet for a while had answered lingard in a preoccupied manner and shaw departed aggrieved at such a neglect of making the best of a good breeze  on the main deck darkskinned men whose clothing clung to their shivering limbs as if they had been overboard had finished recoiling the braces and clearing the gear the kassab after having hung the foretopsail halyards in the becket strutted into the waist toward a row of men who stood idly with their shoulders against the side of the long boat amidships he passed along looking up close at the stolid faces room was made for him and he took his place at the end  it was a great rain and a mighty wind o men he said dogmatically but no wind can ever hurt this ship that i knew while i stood minding the sail which is under my care  a dull and inexpressive murmur was heard from the men over the high weather rail a topping wave flung into their eyes a handful of heavy drops that stung like hail there were low groans of indignation a man sighed another emitted a spasmodic laugh through his chattering teeth no one moved away the little kassab wiped his face and went on in his cracked voice to the accompaniment of the swishing sounds made by the seas that swept regularly astern along the ships side  have you heard him shout at the windlouder than the wind i have heard being far forward and before too in the many years i served this white man i have heard him often cry magic words that make all safe yawa this is truth ask wasub who is a haji even as i am  i have seen white mens ships with their masts brokenalso wrecked like our own praus remarked sadly a lean lank fellow who shivered beside the kassab hanging his head and trying to grasp his shoulder blades  true admitted the kassab they are all the children of satan but to some more favour is shown to obey such men on the sea or in a fight is good i saw him who is master here fight with wild men who eat their enemiesfar away to the eastwardand i dealt blows by his side without fear for the charms he no doubt possesses protect his servants also i am a believer and the stoned one can not touch my forehead yet the reward of victory comes from the accursed for six years have i sailed with that white man first as one who minds the rudder for i am a man of the sea born in a prau and am skilled in such work and now because of my great knowledge of his desires i have the care of all things in this ship  several voices muttered true true they remained apathetic and patient in the rush of wind under the repeated short flights of sprays the slight roll of the ship balanced them stiffly all together where they stood propped against the big boat the breeze humming between the inclined masts enveloped their dark and silent figures in the unceasing resonance of its breath  the brigs head had been laid so as to pass a little to windward of the small islands of the carimata group they had been till then hidden in the night but now both men on the lookout reported land ahead in one long cry lingard standing to leeward abreast of the wheel watched the islet first seen when it was nearly abeam of the brig he gave his orders and wasub hurried off to the main deck the helm was put down the yards on the main came slowly square and the wet canvas of the maintopsail clung suddenly to the mast after a single heavy flap the dazzling streak of the ships wake vanished the vessel lost her way and began to dip her bows into the quick succession of the running head seas and at every slow plunge of the craft the song of the wind would swell louder amongst the waving spars with a wild and mournful note  just as the brigs boat had been swung out ready for lowering the yachts gig hauled up by its line appeared tossing and splashing on the lee quarter carter stood up in the stern sheets balancing himself cleverly to the disordered motion of his cockleshell he hailed the brig twice to know what was the matter not being able from below and in the darkness to make out what that confused group of men on the poop were about he got no answer though he could see the shape of a man standing by himself aft and apparently watching him he was going to repeat his hail for the third time when he heard the rattling of tackles followed by a heavy splash a burst of voices scrambling hollow soundsand a dark mass detaching itself from the brigs side swept past him on the crest of a passing wave for less than a second he could see on the shimmer of the night sky the shape of a boat the heads of men the blades of oars pointing upward while being got out hurriedly then all this sank out of sight reappeared once more far off and hardly discernible before vanishing for good  why theyve lowered a boat exclaimed carter falling back in his seat he remembered that he had seen only a few hours ago three native praus lurking amongst those very islands for a moment he had the idea of casting off to go in chase of that boat so as to find out    find out what he gave up his idea at once what could he do  the conviction that the yacht and everything belonging to her were in some indefinite but very real danger took afresh a strong hold of him and the persuasion that the master of the brig was going there to help did not by any means assuage his alarm the fact only served to complicate his uneasiness with a sense of mystery  the white man who spoke as if that sea was all his own or as if people intruded upon his privacy by taking the liberty of getting wrecked on a coast where he and his friends did some queer business seemed to him an undesirable helper that the boat had been lowered to communicate with the praus seen and avoided by him in the evening he had no doubt the thought had flashed on him at once it had an ugly look yet the best thing to do after all was to hang on and get back to the yacht and warn them    warn them against whom the man had been perfectly open with him warn them against what it struck him that he hadnt the slightest conception of what would happen of what was even likely to happen that strange rescuer himself was bringing the news of danger danger from the natives of course and yet he was in communication with those natives that was evident that boat going off in the night    carter swore heartily to himself his perplexity became positive bodily pain as he sat wet uncomfortable and still one hand on the tiller thrown up and down in headlong swings of his boat and before his eyes towering high the black hull of the brig also rose and fell setting her stern down in the sea now and again with a tremendous and foaming splash not a sound from her reached carters ears she seemed an abandoned craft but for the outline of a mans head and body still visible in a watchful attitude above the taffrail  carter told his bowman to haul up closer and hailed  brig ahoy anything wrong  he waited listening the shadowy man still watched after some time a curt no came back in answer  are you going to keep hoveto long shouted carter  dont know not long drop your boat clear of the ship drop clear do damage if you dont  slack away john said carter in a resigned tone to the elderly seaman in the bow slack away and let us ride easy to the full scope they dont seem very talkative on board there  even while he was speaking the line ran out and the regular undulations of the passing seas drove the boat away from the brig carter turned a little in his seat to look at the land it loomed up dead to leeward like a lofty and irregular cone only a mile or a mile and a half distant the noise of the surf beating upon its base was heard against the wind in measured detonations the fatigue of many days spent in the boat asserted itself above the restlessness of carters thoughts and gradually he lost the notion of the passing time without altogether losing the consciousness of his situation  in the intervals of that benumbed stuporrather than sleephe was aware that the interrupted noise of the surf had grown into a continuous great rumble swelling periodically into a loud roar that the high islet appeared now bigger and that a white fringe of foam was visible at its feet still there was no stir or movement of any kind on board the brig he noticed that the wind was moderating and the sea going down with it and then dozed off again for a minute when next he opened his eyes with a start it was just in time to see with surprise a new star soar noiselessly straight up from behind the land take up its position in a brilliant constellationand go out suddenly two more followed ascending together and after reaching about the same elevation expired side by side  thems rockets siraint they said one of the men in a muffled voice  aye rockets grunted carter and now whats the next move he muttered to himself dismally  he got his answer in the fierce swishing whirr of a slender ray of fire that shooting violently upward from the sombre hull of the brig dissolved at once into a dull red shower of falling sparks only one white and brilliant remained alone poised high overhead and after glowing vividly for a second exploded with a feeble report almost at the same time he saw the brigs head fall off the wind made out the yards swinging round to fill the main topsail and heard distinctly the thud of the first wave thrown off by the advancing bows the next minute the towline got the strain and his boat started hurriedly after the brig with a sudden jerk  leaning forward wide awake and attentive carter steered his men sat one behind another with shoulders up and arched backs dozing uncomfortable but patient upon the thwarts the care requisite to steer the boat properly in the track of the seething and disturbed water left by the brig in her rapid course prevented him from reflecting much upon the incertitude of the future and upon his own unusual situation  now he was only exceedingly anxious to see the yacht again and it was with a feeling of very real satisfaction that he saw all plain sail being made on the brig through the remaining hours of the night he sat grasping the tiller and keeping his eyes on the shadowy and high pyramid of canvas gliding steadily ahead of his boat with a slight balancing movement from side to side    iv  it was noon before the brig piloted by lingard through the deep channels between the outer coral reefs rounded within pistolshot a low hummock of sand which marked the end of a long stretch of stony ledges that being mostly awash showed a black head only here and there amongst the hissing brown froth of the yellow sea as the brig drew clear of the sandy patch there appeared dead to windward and beyond a maze of broken water sandspits and clusters of rocks the black hull of the yacht heeling over high and motionless upon the great expanse of glittering shallows her long naked spars were inclined slightly as if she had been sailing with a good breeze there was to the lookerson aboard the brig something sad and disappointing in the yachts aspect as she lay perfectly still in an attitude that in a seamans mind is associated with the idea of rapid motion  here she is said shaw who clad in a spotless white suit came just then from forward where he had been busy with the anchors she is well on sirisnt she looks like a mudflat to me from here  yes it is a mudflat said lingard slowly raising the long glass to his eye haul the mainsail up mr shaw he went on while he took a steady look at the yacht we will have to work in short tacks here  he put the glass down and moved away from the rail for the next hour he handled his little vessel in the intricate and narrow channel with careless certitude as if every stone every grain of sand upon the treacherous bottom had been plainly disclosed to his sight he handled her in the fitful and unsteady breeze with a matteroffact audacity that made shaw forward at his station gasp in sheer alarm when heading toward the inshore shoals the brig was never put round till the quick loud cries of the leadsmen announced that there were no more than three feet of water under her keel and when standing toward the steep inner edge of the long reef where the lead was of no use the helm would be put down only when the cutwater touched the faint line of the bordering foam lingards love for his brig was a mans love and was so great that it could never be appeased unless he called on her to put forth all her qualities and her power to repay his exacting affection by a faithfulness tried to the very utmost limit of endurance every flutter of the sails flew down from aloft along the taut leeches to enter his heart in a sense of acute delight and the gentle murmur of water alongside which continuous and soft showed that in all her windings his incomparable craft had never even for an instant ceased to carry her way was to him more precious and inspiring than the soft whisper of tender words would have been to another man it was in such moments that he lived intensely in a flush of strong feeling that made him long to press his little vessel to his breast she was his perfect world full of trustful joy  the people on board the yacht who watched eagerly the first sail they had seen since they had been ashore on that deserted part of the coast soon made her out with some disappointment to be a small merchant brig beating up tack for tack along the inner edge of the reefprobably with the intention to communicate and offer assistance the general opinion among the seafaring portion of her crew was that little effective assistance could be expected from a vessel of that description only the sailingmaster of the yacht remarked to the boatswain who had the advantage of being his first cousin this man is well acquainted here you can see that by the way he handles his brig i shant be sorry to have somebody to stand by us cant tell when we will get off this mud george  a long board sailed very close enabled the brig to fetch the southern limit of discoloured water over the bank on which the yacht had stranded on the very edge of the muddy patch she was put in stays for the last time as soon as she had paid off on the other tack sail was shortened smartly and the brig commenced the stretch that was to bring her to her anchorage under her topsails lower staysails and jib there was then less than a quarter of a mile of shallow water between her and the yacht but while that vessel had gone ashore with her head to the eastward the brig was moving slowly in a westnorthwest direction and consequently sailedso to speakpast the whole length of the yacht lingard saw every soul in the schooner on deck watching his advent in a silence which was as unbroken and perfect as that on board his own vessel  a little man with a red face framed in white whiskers waved a goldlaced cap above the rail in the waist of the yacht lingard raised his arm in return further aft under the white awnings he could see two men and a woman one of the men and the lady were in blue the other man who seemed very tall and stood with his arm entwined round an awning stanchion above his head was clad in white lingard saw them plainly they looked at the brig through binoculars turned their faces to one another moved their lips seemed surprised a large dog put his forepaws on the rail and lifting up his big black head sent out three loud and plaintive barks then dropped down out of sight a sudden stir and an appearance of excitement amongst all hands on board the yacht was caused by their perceiving that the boat towing astern of the stranger was their own second gig  arms were outstretched with pointing fingers someone shouted out a long sentence of which not a word could be made out and then the brig having reached the western limit of the bank began to move diagonally away increasing her distance from the yacht but bringing her stern gradually into view the people aft lingard noticed left their places and walked over to the taffrail so as to keep him longer in sight  when about a mile off the bank and nearly in line with the stern of the yacht the brigs topsails fluttered and the yards came down slowly on the caps the fore and aft canvas ran down and for some time she floated quietly with folded wings upon the transparent sheet of water under the radiant silence of the sky then her anchor went to the bottom with a rumbling noise resembling the roll of distant thunder in a moment her head tended to the last puffs of the northerly airs and the ensign at the peak stirred unfurled itself slowly collapsed flew out again and finally hung down straight and still as if weighted with lead  dead calm sir said shaw to lingard dead calm again we got into this funny place in the nick of time sir  they stood for a while side by side looking round upon the coast and the sea the brig had been brought up in the middle of a broad belt of clear water to the north rocky ledges showed in black and white lines upon the slight swell setting in from there a small island stood out from the broken water like the square tower of some submerged building it was about two miles distant from the brig to the eastward the coast was low a coast of green forests fringed with dark mangroves there was in its sombre dullness a clearly defined opening as if a small piece had been cut out with a sharp knife the water in it shone like a patch of polished silver lingard pointed it out to shaw  this is the entrance to the place where we are going he said  shaw stared roundeyed  i thought you came here on account of this here yacht he stammered surprised  ah the yacht said lingard musingly keeping his eyes on the break in the coast the yacht he stamped his foot suddenly i would give all i am worth and throw in a few days of life into the bargain if i could get her off and away before tonight  he calmed down and again stood gazing at the land a little within the entrance from behind the wall of forests an invisible fire belched out steadily the black and heavy convolutions of thick smoke which stood out high like a twisted and shivering pillar against the clear blue of the sky  we must stop that game mr shaw said lingard abruptly  yes sir what game asked shaw looking round in wonder  this smoke said lingard impatiently its a signal  certainly sirthough i dont see how we can do it it seems far inland a signal for what sir  it was not meant for us said lingard in an unexpectedly savage tone here shaw make them put a blank charge into that forecastle gun tell em to ram hard the wadding and grease the mouth we want to make a good noise if old jorgenson hears it that fire will be out before you have time to turn round twice    in a minute mr carter  the yachts boat had come alongside as soon as the brig had been brought up and carter had been waiting to take lingard on board the yacht they both walked now to the gangway shaw following his commander stood by to take his last orders  put all the boats in the water mr shaw lingard was saying with one foot on the rail ready to leave his ship and mount the fourpounder swivel in the longboats bow cast off the sea lashings of the guns but dont run em out yet keep the topsails loose and the jib ready for setting i may want the sails in a hurry now mr carter i am ready for you  shove off boys said carter as soon as they were seated in the boat shove off and give way for a last pull before you get a long rest  the men lay back on their oars grunting their faces were drawn grey and streaked with the dried salt sprays they had the worried expression of men who had a long call made upon their endurance carter heavyeyed and dull steered for the yachts gangway lingard asked as they were crossing the brigs bows  water enough alongside your craft i suppose  yes eight to twelve feet answered carter hoarsely say captain wheres your show of cutthroats why this sea is as empty as a church on a weekday  the booming report nearly over his head of the brigs eighteenpounder interrupted him a round puff of white vapour spreading itself lazily clung in fading shreds about the foreyard lingard turning half round in the stern sheets looked at the smoke on the shore carter remained silent staring sleepily at the yacht they were approaching lingard kept watching the smoke so intensely that he almost forgot where he was till carters voice pronouncing sharply at his ear the words way enough recalled him to himself  they were in the shadow of the yacht and coming alongside her ladder the master of the brig looked upward into the face of a gentleman with long whiskers and a shaved chin staring down at him over the side through a single eyeglass as he put his foot on the bottom step he could see the shore smoke still ascending unceasing and thick but even as he looked the very base of the black pillar rose above the ragged line of treetops the whole thing floated clear away from the earth and rolling itself into an irregularly shaped mass drifted out to seaward travelling slowly over the blue heavens like a threatening and lonely cloud    part ii the shore of refuge  i  the coast off which the little brig floating upright above her anchor seemed to guard the high hull of the yacht has no distinctive features it is land without form it stretches away without cape or bluff long and lowindefinitely and when the heavy gusts of the northeast monsoon drive the thick rain slanting over the sea it is seen faintly under the grey sky black and with a blurred outline like the straight edge of a dissolving shore in the long season of unclouded days it presents to view only a narrow band of earth that appears crushed flat upon the vast level of waters by the weight of the sky whose immense dome rests on it in a line as fine and true as that of the sea horizon itself  notwithstanding its nearness to the centres of european power this coast has been known for ages to the armed wanderers of these seas as the shore of refuge it has no specific name on the charts and geography manuals dont mention it at all but the wreckage of many defeats unerringly drifts into its creeks its approaches are extremely difficult for a stranger looked at from seaward the innumerable islets fringing what on account of its vast size may be called the mainland merge into a background that presents not a single landmark to point the way through the intricate channels it may be said that in a belt of sea twenty miles broad along that low shore there is much more coral mud sand and stones than actual sea water it was amongst the outlying shoals of this stretch that the yacht had gone ashore and the events consequent upon her stranding took place  the diffused light of the short daybreak showed the open water to the westward sleeping smooth and grey under a faded heaven the straight coast threw a heavy belt of gloom along the shoals which in the calm of expiring night were unmarked by the slightest ripple in the faint dawn the low clumps of bushes on the sandbanks appeared immense  two figures noiseless like two shadows moved slowly over the beach of a rocky islet and stopped side by side on the very edge of the water behind them between the mats from which they had arisen a small heap of black embers smouldered quietly they stood upright and perfectly still but for the slight movement of their heads from right to left and back again as they swept their gaze through the grey emptiness of the waters where about two miles distant the hull of the yacht loomed up to seaward black and shapeless against the wan sky  the two figures looked beyond without exchanging as much as a murmur the taller of the two grounded at arms length the stock of a gun with a long barrel the hair of the other fell down to its waist and near by the leaves of creepers drooping from the summit of the steep rock stirred no more than the festooned stone the faint light disclosing here and there a gleam of white sandbanks and the blurred hummocks of islets scattered within the gloom of the coast the profound silence the vast stillness all round accentuated the loneliness of the two human beings who urged by a sleepless hope had risen thus at break of day to look afar upon the veiled face of the sea  nothing said the man with a sigh and as if awakening from a long period of musing  he was clad in a jacket of coarse blue cotton of the kind a poor fisherman might own and he wore it wide open on a muscular chest the colour and smoothness of bronze from the twist of threadbare sarong wound tightly on the hips protruded outward to the left the ivory hilt ringed with six bands of gold of a weapon that would not have disgraced a ruler silver glittered about the flintlock and the hardwood stock of his gun the red and gold handkerchief folded round his head was of costly stuff such as is woven by highborn women in the households of chiefs only the gold threads were tarnished and the silk frayed in the folds his head was thrown back the dropped eyelids narrowed the gleam of his eyes his face was hairless the nose short with mobile nostrils and the smile of careless goodhumour seemed to have been permanently wrought as if with a delicate tool into the slight hollows about the corners of rather full lips his upright figure had a negligent elegance but in the careless face in the easy gestures of the whole man there was something attentive and restrained  after giving the offing a last searching glance he turned and facing the rising sun walked barefooted on the elastic sand the trailed butt of his gun made a deep furrow the embers had ceased to smoulder he looked down at them pensively for a while then called over his shoulder to the girl who had remained behind still scanning the sea  the fire is out immada  at the sound of his voice the girl moved toward the mats her black hair hung like a mantle her sarong the kiltlike garment which both sexes wear had the national check of grey and red but she had not completed her attire by the belt scarves the loose upper wrappings and the headcovering of a woman a black silk jacket like that of a man of rank was buttoned over her bust and fitted closely to her slender waist the edge of a standup collar stiff with gold embroidery rubbed her cheek she had no bracelets no anklets and although dressed practically in mans clothes had about her person no weapon of any sort her arms hung down in exceedingly tight sleeves slit a little way up from the wrist goldbraided and with a row of small gold buttons she walked brown and alert all of a piece with short steps the eyes lively in an impassive little face the arched mouth closed firmly and her whole person breathed in its rigid grace the fiery gravity of youth at the beginning of the task of lifeat the beginning of beliefs and hopes  this was the day of lingards arrival upon the coast but as is known the brig delayed by the calm did not appear in sight of the shallows till the morning was far advanced disappointed in their hope to see the expected sail shining in the first rays of the rising sun the man and the woman without attempting to relight the fire lounged on their sleeping mats at their feet a common canoe hauled out of the water was for more security moored by a grass rope to the shaft of a long spear planted firmly on the white beach and the incoming tide lapped monotonously against its stern  the girl twisting up her black hair fastened it with slender wooden pins the man reclining at full length had made room on his mat for the gunas one would do for a friendand supported on his elbow looked toward the yacht with eyes whose fixed dreaminess like a transparent veil would show the slow passage of every gloomy thought by deepening gradually into a sombre stare  we have seen three sunrises on this islet and no friend came from the sea he said without changing his attitude with his back toward the girl who sat on the other side of the cold embers  yes and the moon is waning she answered in a low voice the moon is waning yet he promised to be here when the nights are light and the water covers the sandbanks as far as the bushes  the traveller knows the time of his setting out but not the time of his return observed the man calmly  the girl sighed  the nights of waiting are long she murmured  and sometimes they are vain said the man with the same composure perhaps he will never return  why exclaimed the girl  the road is long and the heart may grow cold was the answer in a quiet voice if he does not return it is because he has forgotten  oh hassim it is because he is dead cried the girl indignantly  the man looking fixedly to seaward smiled at the ardour of her tone  they were brother and sister and though very much alike the family resemblance was lost in the more general traits common to the whole race  they were natives of wajo and it is a common saying amongst the malay race that to be a successful traveller and trader a man must have some wajo blood in his veins and with those people trading which means also travelling afar is a romantic and an honourable occupation the trader must possess an adventurous spirit and a keen understanding he should have the fearlessness of youth and the sagacity of age he should be diplomatic and courageous so as to secure the favour of the great and inspire fear in evildoers  these qualities naturally are not expected in a shopkeeper or a chinaman pedlar they are considered indispensable only for a man who of noble birth and perhaps related to the ruler of his own country wanders over the seas in a craft of his own and with many followers carries from island to island important news as well as merchandise who may be trusted with secret messages and valuable goods a man who in short is as ready to intrigue and fight as to buy and sell such is the ideal trader of wajo  trading thus understood was the occupation of ambitious men who played an occult but important part in all those national risings religious disturbances and also in the organized piratical movements on a large scale which during the first half of the last century affected the fate of more than one native dynasty and for a few years at least seriously endangered the dutch rule in the east when at the cost of much blood and gold a comparative peace had been imposed on the islands the same occupation though shorn of its glorious possibilities remained attractive for the most adventurous of a restless race the younger sons and relations of many a native ruler traversed the seas of the archipelago visited the innumerable and littleknown islands and the then practically unknown shores of new guinea every spot where european trade had not penetratedfrom aru to atjeh from sumbawa to palawan    ii  it was in the most unknown perhaps of such spots a small bay on the coast of new guinea that young pata hassim the nephew of one of the greatest chiefs of wajo met lingard for the first time  he was a trader after the wajo manner and in a stout seagoing prau armed with two guns and manned by young men who were related to his family by blood or dependence had come in there to buy some birds of paradise skins for the old sultan of ternate a risky expedition undertaken not in the way of business but as a matter of courtesy toward the aged sultan who had entertained him sumptuously in that dismal brick palace at ternate for a month or more  while lying off the village very much on his guard waiting for the skins and negotiating with the treacherous coastsavages who are the gobetweens in that trade hassim saw one morning lingards brig come to an anchor in the bay and shortly afterward observed a white man of great stature with a beard that shone like gold land from a boat and stroll on unarmed though followed by four malays of the brigs crew toward the native village  hassim was struck with wonder and amazement at the cool recklessness of such a proceeding and after in true malay fashion discussing with his people for an hour or so the urgency of the case he also landed but well escorted and armed with the intention of going to see what would happen  the affair really was very simple such aslingard would saysuch as might have happened to anybody he went ashore with the intention to look for some stream where he could conveniently replenish his water casks this being really the motive which had induced him to enter the bay  while with his men close by and surrounded by a mopheaded sooty crowd he was showing a few cotton handkerchiefs and trying to explain by signs the object of his landing a spear lunged from behind grazed his neck probably the papuan wanted only to ascertain whether such a creature could be killed or hurt and most likely firmly believed that it could not but one of lingards seamen at once retaliated by striking at the experimenting savage with his parangthree such choppers brought for the purpose of clearing the bush if necessary being all the weapons the party from the brig possessed  a deadly tumult ensued with such suddenness that lingard turning round swiftly saw his defender already speared in three places fall forward at his feet wasub who was there and afterward told the story once a week on an average used to horrify his hearers by showing how the man blinked his eyes quickly before he fell lingard was unarmed to the end of his life he remained incorrigibly reckless in that respect explaining that he was much too quick tempered to carry firearms on the chance of a row and if put to it he argued i can make shift to kill a man with my fist anyhow and thendont ye seeyou know what youre doing and are not so apt to start a trouble from sheer temper or funksee  in this case he did his best to kill a man with a blow from the shoulder and catching up another by the middle flung him at the naked wild crowd he hurled men about as the wind hurls broken boughs he made a broad way through our enemies related wasub in his jerky voice it is more probable that lingards quick movements and the amazing aspect of such a strange being caused the warriors to fall back before his rush  taking instant advantage of their surprise and fear lingard followed by his men dashed along the kind of ruinous jetty leading to the village which was erected as usual over the water they darted into one of the miserable huts built of rotten mats and bits of decayed canoes and in this shelter showing daylight through all its sides they had time to draw breath and realize that their position was not much improved  the women and children screaming had cleared out into the bush while at the shore end of the jetty the warriors capered and yelled preparing for a general attack lingard noticed with mortification that his boatkeeper apparently had lost his head for instead of swimming off to the ship to give the alarm as he was perfectly able to do the man actually struck out for a small rock a hundred yards away and was frantically trying to climb up its perpendicular side the tide being out to jump into the horrible mud under the houses would have been almost certain death nothing remained thereforesince the miserable dwelling would not have withstood a vigorous kick let alone a siegebut to rush back on shore and regain possession of the boat to this lingard made up his mind quickly and arming himself with a crooked stick he found under his hand sallied forth at the head of his three men as he bounded along far in advance he had just time to perceive clearly the desperate nature of the undertaking when he heard two shots fired to his right the solid mass of black bodies and frizzly heads in front of him wavered and broke up they did not run away however  lingard pursued his course but now with that thrill of exultation which even a faint prospect of success inspires in a sanguine man he heard a shout of many voices far off then there was another report of a shot and a musket ball fired at long range spurted a tiny jet of sand between him and his wild enemies his next bound would have carried him into their midst had they awaited his onset but his uplifted arm found nothing to strike black backs were leaping high or gliding horizontally through the grass toward the edge of the bush  he flung his stick at the nearest pair of black shoulders and stopped short the tall grasses swayed themselves into a rest a chorus of yells and piercing shrieks died out in a dismal howl and all at once the wooded shores and the blue bay seemed to fall under the spell of a luminous stillness the change was as startling as the awakening from a dream the sudden silence struck lingard as amazing  he broke it by lifting his voice in a stentorian shout which arrested the pursuit of his men they retired reluctantly glaring back angrily at the wall of a jungle where not a single leaf stirred the strangers whose opportune appearance had decided the issue of that adventure did not attempt to join in the pursuit but halted in a compact body on the ground lately occupied by the savages  lingard and the young leader of the wajo traders met in the splendid light of noonday and amidst the attentive silence of their followers on the very spot where the malay seaman had lost his life lingard striding up from one side thrust out his open palm hassim responded at once to the frank gesture and they exchanged their first handclasp over the prostrate body as if fate had already exacted the price of a death for the most ominous of her giftsthe gift of friendship that sometimes contains the whole good or evil of a life  ill never forget this day cried lingard in a hearty tone and the other smiled quietly  then after a short pausewill you burn the village for vengeance asked the malay with a quick glance down at the dead lascar who on his face and with stretched arms seemed to cling desperately to that earth of which he had known so little  lingard hesitated  no he said at last it would do good to no one  true said hassim gently but was this man your debtora slave  slave cried lingard this is an english brig slave no a free man like myself  hai he is indeed free now muttered the malay with another glance downward but who will pay the bereaved for his life  if there is anywhere a woman or child belonging to him imy serang would knowi shall seek them out cried lingard remorsefully  you speak like a chief said hassim only our great men do not go to battle with naked hands o you white men o the valour of you white men  it was folly pure folly protested lingard and this poor fellow has paid for it  he could not avoid his destiny murmured the malay it is in my mind my trading is finished now in this place he added cheerfully  lingard expressed his regret  it is no matter it is no matter assured the other courteously and after lingard had given a pressing invitation for hassim and his two companions of high rank to visit the brig the two parties separated  the evening was calm when the malay craft left its berth near the shore and was rowed slowly across the bay to lingards anchorage the end of a stout line was thrown on board and that night the white mans brig and the brown mans prau swung together to the same anchor  the sun setting to seaward shot its last rays between the headlands when the body of the killed lascar wrapped up decently in a white sheet according to mohammedan usage was lowered gently below the still waters of the bay upon which his curious glances only a few hours before had rested for the first time at the moment the dead man released from slipropes disappeared without a ripple before the eyes of his shipmates the bright flash and the heavy report of the brigs bow gun were succeeded by the muttering echoes of the encircling shores and by the loud cries of sea birds that wheeling in clouds seemed to scream after the departing seaman a wild and eternal goodbye the master of the brig making his way aft with hanging head was followed by low murmurs of pleased surprise from his crew as well as from the strangers who crowded the main deck in such acts performed simply from conviction what may be called the romantic side of the mans nature came out that responsive sensitiveness to the shadowy appeals made by life and death which is the groundwork of a chivalrous character  lingard entertained his three visitors far into the night a sheep from the brigs sea stock was given to the men of the prau while in the cabin hassim and his two friends sitting in a row on the stern settee looked very splendid with costly metals and flawed jewels the talk conducted with hearty friendship on lingards part and on the part of the malays with the wellbred air of discreet courtesy which is natural to the better class of that people touched upon many subjects and in the end drifted to politics  it is in my mind that you are a powerful man in your own country said hassim with a circular glance at the cuddy  my country is upon a faraway sea where the light breezes are as strong as the winds of the rainy weather here said lingard and there were low exclamations of wonder i left it very young and i dont know about my power there where great men alone are as numerous as the poor people in all your islands tuan hassim but here he continued here which is also my countrybeing an english craft and worthy of it tooi am powerful enough in fact i am rajah here this bit of my country is all my own  the visitors were impressed exchanged meaning glances nodded at each other  good good said hassim at last with a smile you carry your country and your power with you over the sea a rajah upon the sea good  lingard laughed thunderously while the others looked amused  your country is very powerfulwe know began again hassim after a pause but is it stronger than the country of the dutch who steal our land  stronger cried lingard he opened a broad palm stronger we could take them in our hand like this and he closed his fingers triumphantly  and do you make them pay tribute for their land enquired hassim with eagerness  no answered lingard in a sobered tone this tuan hassim you see is not the custom of white men we could of coursebut it is not the custom  is it not said the other with a sceptical smile they are stronger than we are and they want tribute from us and sometimes they get iteven from wajo where every man is free and wears a kris  there was a period of dead silence while lingard looked thoughtful and the malays gazed stonily at nothing  but we burn our powder amongst ourselves went on hassim gently and blunt our weapons upon one another  he sighed paused and then changing to an easy tone began to urge lingard to visit wajo for trade and to see friends he said laying his hand on his breast and inclining his body slightly  aye to trade with friends cried lingard with a laugh for such a shiphe waved his armfor such a vessel as this is like a household where there are many behind the curtain it is as costly as a wife and children  the guests rose and took their leave  you fired three shots for me panglima hassim said lingard seriously and i have had three barrels of powder put on board your prau one for each shot but we are not quits  the malays eyes glittered with pleasure  this is indeed a friends gift come to see me in my country  i promise said lingard to see yousome day  the calm surface of the bay reflected the glorious night sky and the brig with the prau riding astern seemed to be suspended amongst the stars in a peace that was almost unearthly in the perfection of its unstirring silence the last handshakes were exchanged on deck and the malays went aboard their own craft next morning when a breeze sprang up soon after sunrise the brig and the prau left the bay together when clear of the land lingard made all sail and sheered alongside to say goodbye before parting companythe brig of course sailing three feet to the praus one hassim stood on the high deck aft  prosperous road hailed lingard  remember the promise shouted the other and come soon he went on raising his voice as the brig forged past come soonlest what perhaps is written should come to pass  the brig shot ahead  what yelled lingard in a puzzled tone whats written  he listened and floating over the water came faintly the words  no one knows    iii  my word i couldnt help liking the chap would shout lingard when telling the story and looking around at the eyes that glittered at him through the smoke of cheroots this brixham trawlerboy afterward a youth in colliers deepwater man golddigger owner and commander of the finest brig afloat knew that by his listenersseamen traders adventurers like himselfthis was accepted not as the expression of a feeling but as the highest commendation he could give his malay friend  by heavens i shall go to wajo he cried and a semicircle of heads nodded grave approbation while a slightly ironical voice said deliberatelyyou are a made man tom if you get on the right side of that rajah of yours  go inand look out for yourself cried another with a laugh  a little professional jealousy was unavoidable wajo on account of its chronic state of disturbance being closed to the white traders but there was no real illwill in the banter of these men who rising with handshakes dropped off one by one lingard went straight aboard his vessel and till morning walked the poop of the brig with measured steps the riding lights of ships twinkled all round him the lights ashore twinkled in rows the stars twinkled above his head in a black sky and reflected in the black water of the roadstead twinkled far below his feet and all these innumerable and shining points were utterly lost in the immense darkness once he heard faintly the rumbling chain of some vessel coming to an anchor far away somewhere outside the official limits of the harbour a stranger to the portthought lingardone of us would have stood right in perhaps a ship from home and he felt strangely touched at the thought of that ship weary with months of wandering and daring not to approach the place of rest at sunrise while the big ship from the west her sides streaked with rust and grey with the salt of the sea was moving slowly in to take up a berth near the shore lingard left the roadstead on his way to the eastward  a heavy gulf thunderstorm was raging when after a long passage and at the end of a sultry calm day wasted in drifting helplessly in sight of his destination lingard taking advantage of fitful gusts of wind approached the shores of wajo with characteristic audacity he held on his way closing in with a coast to which he was a stranger and on a night that would have appalled any other man while at every dazzling flash hassims native land seemed to leap nearer at the brigand disappear instantly as though it had crouched low for the next spring out of an impenetrable darkness during the long day of the calm he had obtained from the deck and from aloft such good views of the coast and had noted the lay of the land and the position of the dangers so carefully that though at the precise moment when he gave the order to let go the anchor he had been for some time able to see no further than if his head had been wrapped in a woollen blanket yet the next flickering bluish flash showed him the brig anchored almost exactly where he had judged her to be off a narrow white beach near the mouth of a river  he could see on the shore a high cluster of bamboo huts perched upon piles a small grove of tall palms all bowed together before the blast like stalks of grass something that might have been a palisade of pointed stakes near the water and far off a sombre background resembling an immense wallthe forestclad hills next moment all this vanished utterly from his sight as if annihilated and before he had time to turn away came back to view with a sudden crash appearing unscathed and motionless under hooked darts of flame like some legendary country of immortals withstanding the wrath and fire of heaven  made uneasy by the nature of his holding ground and fearing that in one of the terrific offshore gusts the brig would start her anchor lingard remained on deck to watch over the safety of his vessel with one hand upon the leadline which would give him instant warning of the brig beginning to drag he stood by the rail most of the time deafened and blinded but also fascinated by the repeated swift visions of an unknown shore a sight always so inspiring as much perhaps by its vague suggestion of danger as by the hopes of success it never fails to awaken in the heart of a true adventurer and its immutable aspect of profound and still repose seen thus under streams of fire and in the midst of a violent uproar made it appear inconceivably mysterious and amazing  between the squalls there were short moments of calm while now and then even the thunder would cease as if to draw breath during one of those intervals lingard tired and sleepy was beginning to doze where he stood when suddenly it occurred to him that somewhere below the sea had spoken in a human voice it had said praise be to god and the voice sounded small clear and confident like the voice of a child speaking in a cathedral lingard gave a start and thoughtive dreamed thisand directly the sea said very close to him give a rope  the thunder growled wickedly and lingard after shouting to the men on deck peered down at the water until at last he made out floating close alongside the upturned face of a man with staring eyes that gleamed at him and then blinked quickly to a flash of lightning by that time all hands in the brig were wildly active and many ropesends had been thrown over then together with a gust of wind and as if blown on board a man tumbled over the rail and fell all in a heap upon the deck before any one had the time to pick him up he leaped to his feet causing the people around him to step back hurriedly a sinister blue glare showed the bewildered faces and the petrified attitudes of men completely deafened by the accompanying peal of thunder after a time as if to beings plunged in the abyss of eternal silence there came to their ears an unfamiliar thin faraway voice saying  i seek the white man  here cried lingard then when he had the stranger dripping and naked but for a soaked waistcloth under the lamp of the cabin he said i dont know you  my name is jaffir and i come from pata hassim who is my chief and your friend do you know this  he held up a thick gold ring set with a fairly good emerald  i have seen it before on the rajahs finger said lingard looking very grave  it is the witness of the truth i speakthe message from hassim isdepart and forget  i dont forget said lingard slowly i am not that kind of man what folly is this  it is unnecessary to give at full length the story told by jaffir it appears that on his return home after the meeting with lingard hassim found his relative dying and a strong party formed to oppose his rightful successor the old rajah tulla died late at night andas jaffir put itbefore the sun rose there were already blows exchanged in the courtyard of the rulers dalam this was the preliminary fight of a civil war fostered by foreign intrigues a war of jungle and river of assaulted stockades and forest ambushes in this contest both partiesaccording to jaffirdisplayed great courage and one of them an unswerving devotion to what almost from the first was a lost cause before a month elapsed hassim though still chief of an armed band was already a fugitive he kept up the struggle however with some vague notion that lingards arrival would turn the tide  for weeks we lived on wild rice for days we fought with nothing but water in our bellies declaimed jaffir in the tone of a true fireeater  and then he went on to relate how driven steadily down to the sea hassim with a small band of followers had been for days holding the stockade by the waterside  but every night some men disappeared confessed jaffir they were weary and hungry and they went to eat with their enemies we are only ten nowten men and a woman with the heart of a man who are tonight starving and tomorrow shall die swiftly we saw your ship afar all day but you have come too late and for fear of treachery and lest harm should befall youhis friendthe rajah gave me the ring and i crept on my stomach over the sand and i swam in the nightand i jaffir the best swimmer in wajo and the slave of hassim tell youhis message to you is depart and forgetand this is his gifttake  he caught hold suddenly of lingards hand thrust roughly into it the ring and then for the first time looked round the cabin with wondering but fearless eyes they lingered over the semicircle of bayonets and rested fondly on musketracks he grunted in admiration  yawa this is strength he murmured as if to himself but it has come too late  perhaps not cried lingard  too late said jaffir we are ten only and at sunrise we go out to die he went to the cabin door and hesitated there with a puzzled air being unused to locks and door handles  what are you going to do asked lingard  i shall swim back replied jaffir the message is spoken and the night can not last forever  you can stop with me said lingard looking at the man searchingly  hassim waits was the curt answer  did he tell you to return asked lingard  no what need said the other in a surprised tone  lingard seized his hand impulsively  if i had ten men like you he cried  we are ten but they are twenty to one said jaffir simply  lingard opened the door  do you want anything that a man can give he asked  the malay had a moment of hesitation and lingard noticed the sunken eyes the prominent ribs and the wornout look of the man  speak out he urged with a smile the bearer of a gift must have a reward  a drink of water and a handful of rice for strength to reach the shore said jaffir sturdily for over therehe tossed his headwe had nothing to eat today  you shall have itgive it to you with my own hands muttered lingard  he did so and thus lowered himself in jaffirs estimation for a time while the messenger squatting on the floor ate without haste but with considerable earnestness lingard thought out a plan of action in his ignorance as to the true state of affairs in the country to save hassim from the immediate danger of his position was all that he could reasonably attempt to that end lingard proposed to swing out his longboat and send her close inshore to take off hassim and his men he knew enough of malays to feel sure that on such a night the besiegers now certain of success and being jaffir said in possession of everything that could float would not be very vigilant especially on the sea front of the stockade the very fact of jaffir having managed to swim off undetected proved that much the brigs boat couldwhen the frequency of lightning abatedapproach unseen close to the beach and the defeated party either stealing out one by one or making a rush in a body would embark and be received in the brig  this plan was explained to jaffir who heard it without the slightest mark of interest being apparently too busy eating when the last grain of rice was gone he stood up took a long pull at the water bottle muttered i hear good i will tell hassim and tightening the rag round his loins prepared to go give me time to swim ashore he said and when the boat starts put another light beside the one that burns now like a star above your vessel we shall see and understand and dont send the boat till there is less lightning a boat is bigger than a man in the water tell the rowers to pull for the palmgrove and cease when an oar thrust down with a strong arm touches the bottom very soon they will hear our hail but if no one comes they must go away before daylight a chief may prefer death to life and we who are left are all of true heart do you understand o big man  the chap has plenty of sense muttered lingard to himself and when they stood side by side on the deck he said but there may be enemies on the beach o jaffir and they also may shout to deceive my men so let your hail be lightning will you remember  for a time jaffir seemed to be choking  liting is that right i sayis that right o strong man next moment he appeared upright and shadowy on the rail  yes thats right go now said lingard and jaffir leaped off becoming invisible long before he struck the water then there was a splash after a while a spluttering voice cried faintly liting ah ha and suddenly the next thundersquall burst upon the coast in the crashing flares of light lingard had again and again the quick vision of a white beach the inclined palmtrees of the grove the stockade by the sea the forest far away a vast landscape mysterious and stillhassims native country sleeping unmoved under the wrath and fire of heaven    iv  a traveller visiting wajo today may if he deserves the confidence of the common people hear the traditional account of the last civil war together with the legend of a chief and his sister whose mother had been a great princess suspected of sorcery and on her deathbed had communicated to these two the secrets of the art of magic the chiefs sister especially with the aspect of a child and the fearlessness of a great fighter became skilled in casting spells they were defeated by the son of their uncle becausewill explain the narrator simplythe courage of us wajo people is so great that magic can do nothing against it i fought in that war we had them with their backs to the sea and then he will go on to relate in an awed tone how on a certain night when there was such a thunderstorm as has been never heard of before or since a ship resembling the ships of white men appeared off the coast as though she had sailed down from the clouds she moved he will affirm with her sails bellying against the wind in size she was like an island the lightning played between her masts which were as high as the summits of mountains a star burned low through the clouds above her we knew it for a star at once because no flame of mans kindling could have endured the wind and rain of that night it was such a night that we on the watch hardly dared look upon the sea the heavy rain was beating down our eyelids and when day came the ship was nowhere to be seen and in the stockade where the day before there were a hundred or more at our mercy there was no one the chief hassim was gone and the lady who was a princess in the countryand nobody knows what became of them from that day to this sometimes traders from our parts talk of having heard of them here and heard of them there but these are the lies of men who go afar for gain we who live in the country believe that the ship sailed back into the clouds whence the ladys magic made her come did we not see the ship with our own eyes and as to rajah hassim and his sister mas immada some men say one thing and some another but god alone knows the truth  such is the traditional account of lingards visit to the shores of boni and the truth is he came and went the same night for when the dawn broke on a cloudy sky the brig under reefed canvas and smothered in sprays was storming along to the southward on her way out of the gulf lingard watching over the rapid course of his vessel looked ahead with anxious eyes and more than once asked himself with wonder why after all was he thus pressing her under all the sail she could carry his hair was blown about by the wind his mind was full of care and the indistinct shapes of many new thoughts and under his feet the obedient brig dashed headlong from wave to wave  her owner and commander did not know where he was going that adventurer had only a confused notion of being on the threshold of a big adventure there was something to be done and he felt he would have to do it it was expected of him the seas expected it the land expected it men also the story of war and of suffering jaffirs display of fidelity the sight of hassim and his sister the night the tempest the coast under streams of fireall this made one inspiring manifestation of a life calling to him distinctly for interference but what appealed to him most was the silent the complete unquestioning and apparently uncurious trust of these people they came away from death straight into his arms as it were and remained in them passive as though there had been no such thing as doubt or hope or desire this amazing unconcern seemed to put him under a heavy load of obligation  he argued to himself that had not these defeated men expected everything from him they could not have been so indifferent to his action their dumb quietude stirred him more than the most ardent pleading not a word not a whisper not a questioning look even they did not ask it flattered him he was also rather glad of it because if the unconscious part of him was perfectly certain of its action he himself did not know what to do with those bruised and battered beings a playful fate had delivered suddenly into his hands  he had received the fugitives personally had helped some over the rail in the darkness slashed about by lightning he had guessed that not one of them was unwounded and in the midst of tottering shapes he wondered how on earth they had managed to reach the longboat that had brought them off he caught unceremoniously in his arms the smallest of these shapes and carried it into the cabin then without looking at his light burden ran up again on deck to get the brig under way while shouting out orders he was dimly aware of someone hovering near his elbow it was hassim  i am not ready for war he explained rapidly over his shoulder and tomorrow there may be no wind afterward for a time he forgot everybody and everything while he conned the brig through the few outlying dangers but in half an hour and running off with the wind on the quarter he was quite clear of the coast and breathed freely it was only then that he approached two others on that poop where he was accustomed in moments of difficulty to commune alone with his craft hassim had called his sister out of the cabin now and then lingard could see them with fierce distinctness side by side and with twined arms looking toward the mysterious country that seemed at every flash to leap away farther from the brigunscathed and fading  the thought uppermost in lingards mind was what on earth am i going to do with them and no one seemed to care what he would do jaffir with eight others quartered on the main hatch looked to each others wounds and conversed interminably in low tones cheerful and quiet like wellbehaved children each of them had saved his kris but lingard had to make a distribution of cotton cloth out of his tradegoods whenever he passed by them they all looked after him gravely hassim and immada lived in the cuddy the chiefs sister took the air only in the evening and those two could be heard every night invisible and murmuring in the shadows of the quarterdeck every malay on board kept respectfully away from them  lingard on the poop listened to the soft voices rising and falling in a melancholy cadence sometimes the woman cried out as if in anger or in pain he would stop short the sound of a deep sigh would float up to him on the stillness of the night attentive stars surrounded the wandering brig and on all sides their light fell through a vast silence upon a noiseless sea lingard would begin again to pace the deck muttering to himself  belarabs the man for this job his is the only place where i can look for help but i dont think i know enough to find it i wish i had old jorgenson herejust for ten minutes  this jorgenson knew things that had happened a long time ago and lived amongst men efficient in meeting the accidents of the day but who did not care what would happen tomorrow and who had no time to remember yesterday strictly speaking he did not live amongst them he only appeared there from time to time he lived in the native quarter with a native woman in a native house standing in the middle of a plot of fenced ground where grew plantains and furnished only with mats cooking pots a queer fishing net on two sticks and a small mahogany case with a lock and a silver plate engraved with the words captain h c jorgenson barque wild rose  it was like an inscription on a tomb the wild rose was dead and so was captain h c jorgenson and the sextant case was all that was left of them old jorgenson gaunt and mute would turn up at meal times on board any trading vessel in the roads and the stewardschinamen or mulattoswould sulkily put on an extra plate without waiting for orders when the seamen traders foregathered noisily round a glittering cluster of bottles and glasses on a lighted verandah old jorgenson would emerge up the stairs as if from a dark sea and stepping up with a kind of tottering jauntiness would help himself in the first tumbler to hand  i drink to you all nono chair  he would stand silent over the talking group his taciturnity was as eloquent as the repeated warning of the slave of the feast his flesh had gone the way of all flesh his spirit had sunk in the turmoil of his past but his immense and bony frame survived as if made of iron his hands trembled but his eyes were steady he was supposed to know details about the end of mysterious men and of mysterious enterprises he was an evident failure himself but he was believed to know secrets that would make the fortune of any man yet there was also a general impression that his knowledge was not of that nature which would make it profitable for a moderately prudent person  this powerful skeleton dressed in faded blue serge and without any kind of linen existed anyhow sometimes if offered the job he piloted a home ship through the straits of rhio after however assuring the captain  you dont want a pilot a man could go through with his eyes shut but if you want me ill come ten dollars  then after seeing his charge clear of the last island of the group he would go back thirty miles in a canoe with two old malays who seemed to be in some way his followers to travel thirty miles at sea under the equatorial sun and in a cranky dugout where once down you must not move is an achievement that requires the endurance of a fakir and the virtue of a salamander ten dollars was cheap and generally he was in demand when times were hard he would borrow five dollars from any of the adventurers with the remark  i cant pay you back very soon but the girl must eat and if you want to know anything i can tell you  it was remarkable that nobody ever smiled at that anything the usual thing was to say  thank you old man when i am pushed for a bit of information ill come to you  jorgenson nodded then and would say remember that unless you young chaps are like we men who ranged about here years ago what i could tell you would be worse than poison  it was from jorgenson who had his favourites with whom he was less silent that lingard had heard of daratessalam the shore of refuge jorgenson had as he expressed it known the inside of that country just after the high old times when the whiteclad padris preached and fought all over sumatra till the dutch shook in their shoes only he did not say shook and shoes but the above paraphrase conveys well enough his contemptuous meaning lingard tried now to remember and piece together the practical bits of old jorgensons amazing tales but all that had remained with him was an approximate idea of the locality and a very strong but confused notion of the dangerous nature of its approaches he hesitated and the brig answering in her movements to the state of the mans mind lingered on the road seemed to hesitate also swinging this way and that on the days of calm  it was just because of that hesitation that a big new york ship loaded with oil in cases for japan and passing through the billiton passage sighted one morning a very smart brig being hoveto right in the fairway and a little to the east of carimata the lank skipper in a frockcoat and the big mate with heavy moustaches judged her almost too pretty for a britisher and wondered at the man on board laying his topsail to the mast for no reason that they could see the big ships sails fanned her along flapping in the light air and when the brig was last seen far astern she had still her mainyard aback as if waiting for someone but when next day a london teaclipper passed on the same track she saw no pretty brig hesitating all white and still at the parting of the ways all that night lingard had talked with hassim while the stars streamed from east to west like an immense river of sparks above their heads immada listened sometimes exclaiming low sometimes holding her breath she clapped her hands once a faint dawn appeared  you shall be treated like my father in the country hassim was saying a heavy dew dripped off the rigging and the darkened sails were black on the pale azure of the sky you shall be the father who advises for good  i shall be a steady friend and as a friend i want to be treatedno more said lingard take back your ring  why do you scorn my gift asked hassim with a sad and ironic smile  take it said lingard it is still mine how can i forget that when facing death you thought of my safety there are many dangers before us we shall be often separatedto work better for the same end if ever you and immada need help at once and i am within reach send me a message with this ring and if i am alive i will not fail you he looked around at the pale daybreak i shall talk to belarab straightlike we whites do i have never seen him but i am a strong man belarab must help us to reconquer your country and when our end is attained i wont let him eat you up  hassim took the ring and inclined his head  its time for us to be moving said lingard he felt a slight tug at his sleeve he looked back and caught immada in the act of pressing her forehead to the grey flannel dont child he said softly  the sun rose above the faint blue line of the shore of refuge  the hesitation was over the man and the vessel working in accord had found their way to the faint blue shore before the sun had descended halfway to its rest the brig was anchored within a gunshot of the slimy mangroves in a place where for a hundred years or more no white mans vessel had been entrusted to the hold of the bottom the adventurers of two centuries ago had no doubt known of that anchorage for they were very ignorant and incomparably audacious if it is true as some say that the spirits of the dead haunt the places where the living have sinned and toiled then they might have seen a white longboat pulled by eight oars and steered by a man sunburnt and bearded a cabbageleaf hat on head and pistols in his belt skirting the black mud full of twisted roots in search of a likely opening  creek after creek was passed and the boat crept on slowly like a monstrous waterspider with a big body and eight slender legs    did you follow with your ghostly eyes the quest of this obscure adventurer of yesterday you shades of forgotten adventurers who in leather jerkins and sweating under steel helmets attacked with long rapiers the palisades of the strange heathen or musket on shoulder and match in cock guarded timber blockhouses built upon the banks of rivers that command good trade you who wearied with the toil of fighting slept wrapped in frieze mantles on the sand of quiet beaches dreaming of fabulous diamonds and of a faroff home  heres an opening said lingard to hassim who sat at his side just as the sun was setting away to his left heres an opening big enough for a ship its the entrance we are looking for i believe we shall pull all night up this creek if necessary and its the very devil if we dont come upon belarabs lair before daylight  he shoved the tiller hard over and the boat swerving sharply vanished from the coast  and perhaps the ghosts of old adventurers nodded wisely their ghostly heads and exchanged the ghost of a wistful smile    v  whats the matter with king tom of late would ask someone when all the cards in

disregarded looked down dreamily at the falling cards spyi tell you he muttered to himself if you want to know anything ask me  when lingard returned from wajoafter an uncommonly long absenceeveryone remarked a great change he was less talkative and not so noisy he was still hospitable but his hospitality was less expansive and the man who was never so happy as when discussing impossibly wild projects with half a dozen congenial spirits often showed a disinclination to meet his best friends in a word he returned much less of a good fellow than he went away his visits to the settlements were not less frequent but much shorter and when there he was always in a hurry to be gone  during two years the brig had in her way as hard a life of it as the man swift and trim she flitted amongst the islands of little known groups she could be descried afar from lonely headlands a white speck travelling fast over the blue sea the apathetic keepers of rare lighthouses dotting the great highway to the east came to know the cut of her topsails they saw her passing east passing west they had faint glimpses of her flying with masts aslant in the mist of a rainsquall or could observe her at leisure upright and with shivering sails forging ahead through a long day of unsteady airs men saw her battling with a heavy monsoon in the bay of bengal lying becalmed in the java sea or gliding out suddenly from behind a point of land graceful and silent in the clear moonlight her activity was the subject of excited but lowtoned conversations which would be interrupted when her master appeared  here he is came in last night whispered the gossiping group  lingard did not see the covert glances of respect tempered by irony he nodded and passed on  hey tom no time for a drink would shout someone  he would shake his head without looking backfar away already  florid and burly he could be seen for a day or two getting out of dusty gharries striding in sunshine from the occidental bank to the harbour office crossing the esplanade disappearing down a street of chinese shops while at his elbow and as tall as himself old jorgenson paced along lean and faded obstinate and disregarded like a haunting spirit from the past eager to step back into the life of men  lingard ignored this wreck of an adventurer sticking to him closer than his shadow and the other did not try to attract attention he waited patiently at the doors of offices would vanish at tiffin time would invariably turn up again in the evening and then he kept his place till lingard went aboard for the night the police peons on duty looked disdainfully at the phantom of captain h c jorgenson barque wild rose wandering on the silent quay or standing still for hours at the edge of the sombre roadstead speckled by the anchor lights of shipsan adventurous soul longing to recross the waters of oblivion  the sampanmen sculling lazily homeward past the black hull of the brig at anchor could hear far into the night the drawl of the new england voice escaping through the lifted panes of the cabin skylight snatches of nasal sentences floated in the stillness around the still craft  yes siree mexican war

that for your taste no no cash downmy people in baltshooting seagulls you say waal its a risky businesssee hereten per cent discountits out of my own pocket  as time wore on and nothing happened at least nothing that one could hear of the excitement died out lingards new attitude was accepted as only his way there was nothing in it maintained some others dissented a good deal of curiosity however remained and the faint rumour of something big being in preparation followed him into every harbour he went to from rangoon to hongkong  he felt nowhere so much at home as when his brig was anchored on the inner side of the great stretch of shoals the centre of his life had shifted about four hundred milesfrom the straits of malacca to the shore of refugeand when there he felt himself within the circle of another existence governed by his impulse nearer his desire hassim and immada would come down to the coast and wait for him on the islet he always left them with regret  at the end of the first stage in each trip jorgenson waited for him at the top of the boatstairs and without a word fell into step at his elbow they seldom exchanged three words in a day but one evening about six months before lingards last trip as they were crossing the short bridge over the canal where native craft lie moored in clusters jorgenson lengthened his stride and came abreast it was a moonlight night and nothing stirred on earth but the shadows of high clouds lingard took off his hat and drew in a long sigh in the tepid breeze jorgenson spoke suddenly in a cautious tone the new rajah tulla smokes opium and is sometimes dangerous to speak to there is a lot of discontent in wajo amongst the big people  good good whispered lingard excitedly off his guard for once thenhow the devil do you know anything about it he asked  jorgenson pointed at the mass of praus coasting boats and sampans that jammed up together in the canal lay covered with mats and flooded by the cold moonlight with here and there a dim lantern burning amongst the confusion of high sterns spars masts and lowered sails  there he said as they moved on and their hatted and clothed shadows fell heavily on the queershaped vessels that carry the fortunes of brown men upon a shallow sea there i can sit with them i can talk to them i can come and go as i like they know me nowits timethirtyfive years some of them give a plate of rice and a bit of fish to the white man thats all i getafter thirtyfive yearsgiven up to them  he was silent for a time  i was like you once he added and then laying his hand on lingards sleeve murmuredare you very deep in this thing  to the very last cent said lingard quietly and looking straight before him  the glitter of the roadstead went out and the masts of anchored ships vanished in the invading shadow of a cloud  drop it whispered jorgenson  i am in debt said lingard slowly and stood still  drop it  never dropped anything in my life  drop it  by god i wont cried lingard stamping his foot  there was a pause  i was like youonce repeated jorgenson five and thirty yearsnever dropped anything and what you can do is only childs play to some jobs i have had on my handsunderstand thatgreat man as you are captain lingard of the lightning    you should have seen the wild rose he added with a sudden break in his voice  lingard leaned over the guardrail of the pier jorgenson came closer  i set fire to her with my own hands he said in a vibrating tone and very low as if making a monstrous confession  poor devil muttered lingard profoundly moved by the tragic enormity of the act i suppose there was no way out  i wasnt going to let her rot to pieces in some dutch port said jorgenson gloomily did you ever hear of dawson  somethingi dont remember now muttered lingard who felt a chill down his back at the idea of his own vessel decaying slowly in some dutch port he dieddidnt he he asked absently while he wondered whether he would have the pluck to set fire to the brigon an emergency  cut his throat on the beach below fort rotterdam said jorgenson his gaunt figure wavered in the unsteady moonshine as though made of mist yes he broke some trade regulation or other and talked big about lawcourts and legal trials to the lieutenant of the komet certainly says the hound jurisdiction of macassar i will take your schooner there then coming into the roads he tows her full tilt on a ledge of rocks on the north sidesmash when she was half full of water he takes his hat off to dawson theres the shore says hego and get your legal trial youenglishman he lifted a long arm and shook his fist at the moon which dodged suddenly behind a cloud all was lost poor dawson walked the streets for months barefooted and in rags then one day he begged a knife from some charitable soul went down to take a last look at the wreck and  i dont interfere with the dutch interrupted lingard impatiently i want hassim to get back his own  and suppose the dutch want the things just so returned jorgenson anyway there is a devil in such workdrop it  look here said lingard i took these people off when they were in their last ditch that means something i ought not to have meddled and it would have been all over in a few hours i must have meant something when i interfered whether i knew it or not i meant it thenand did not know it very well i mean it nowand do know it when you save people from death you take a share in their life thats how i look at it  jorgenson shook his head  foolishness he cried then asked softly in a voice that trembled with curiositywhere did you leave them  with belarab breathed out lingard you knew him in the old days  i knew him i knew his father burst out the other in an excited whisper whom did i not know i knew sentot when he was king of the south shore of java and the dutch offered a price for his headenough to make any mans fortune he slept twice on board the wild rose when things had begun to go wrong with him i knew him i knew all his chiefs the priests the fighting men the old regent who lost heart and went over to the dutch i knew he stammered as if the words could not come out gave it up and sighedbelarabs father escaped with me he began again quietly and joined the padris in sumatra he rose to be a great leader belarab was a youth then those were the times i ranged the coastand laughed at the cruisers i saw every battle fought in the battak countryand i saw the dutch run i was at the taking of singal and escaped i was the white man who advised the chiefs of manangkabo there was a lot about me in the dutch papers at the time they said i was a frenchman turned mohammedan he swore a great oath and reeling against the guardrail panted muttering curses on newspapers  well belarab has the job in hand said lingard composedly he is the chief man on the shore of refuge there are others of course he has sent messages north and south we must have men  all the devils unchained said jorgenson you have done it and nowlook outlook out     nothing can go wrong as far as i can see argued lingard they all know whats to be done ive got them in hand you dont think belarab unsafe do you  havent seen him for fifteen yearsbut the whole things unsafe growled jorgenson  i tell you ive fixed it so that nothing can go wrong it would be better if i had a white man over there to look after things generally there is a good lot of stores and armsand belarab would bear watchingno doubt are you in any want he added putting his hand in his pocket  no theres plenty to eat in the house answered jorgenson curtly drop it he burst out it would be better for you to jump overboard at once look at me i came out a boy of eighteen i can speak english i can speak dutch i can speak every cursed lingo of these islandsi remember things that would make your hair stand on endbut i have forgotten the language of my own country ive traded ive fought i never broke my word to white or native and look at me if it hadnt been for the girl i would have died in a ditch ten years ago everything left meyouth money strength hopethe very sleep but she stuck by the wreck  that says a lot for her and something for you said lingard cheerily  jorgenson shook his head  thats the worst of all he said with slow emphasis thats the end i came to them from the other side of the earth and they took me andsee what they made of me  what place do you belong to asked lingard  tromso groaned out jorgenson i will never see snow again he sobbed out his face in his hands  lingard looked at him in silence  would you come with me he said as i told you i am in want of a  i would see you damned first broke out the other savagely i am an old white loafer but you dont get me to meddle in their infernal affairs they have a devil of their own  the thing simply cant fail ive calculated every move ive guarded against everything i am no fool  yesyou are goodnight  well goodbye said lingard calmly  he stepped into his boat and jorgenson walked up the jetty lingard clearing the yoke lines heard him call out from a distance  drop it  i sail before sunrise he shouted in answer and went on board  when he came up from his cabin after an uneasy night it was dark yet a lank figure strolled across the deck  here i am said jorgenson huskily die there or hereall one but if i die there remember the girl must eat  lingard was one of the few who had seen jorgensons girl she had a wrinkled brown face a lot of tangled grey hair a few black stumps of teeth and had been married to him lately by an enterprising young missionary from bukit timah what her appearance might have been once when jorgenson gave for her three hundred dollars and several brass guns it was impossible to say all that was left of her youth was a pair of eyes undimmed and mournful which when she was alone seemed to look stonily into the past of two lives when jorgenson was near they followed his movements with anxious pertinacity and now within the sarong thrown over the grey head they were dropping unseen tears while jorgensons girl rocked herself to and fro squatting alone in a corner of the dark hut  dont you worry about that said lingard grasping jorgensons hand she shall want for nothing all i expect you to do is to look a little after belarabs morals when i am away one more trip i must make and then we shall be ready to go ahead ive foreseen every single thing trust me  in this way did the restless shade of captain h c jorgenson recross the water of oblivion to step back into the life of men    vi  for two years lingard who had thrown himself body and soul into the great enterprise had lived in the long intoxication of slowly preparing success no thought of failure had crossed his mind and no price appeared too heavy to pay for such a magnificent achievement it was nothing less than bringing hassim triumphantly back to that country seen once at night under the low clouds and in the incessant tumult of thunder when at the conclusion of some long talk with hassim who for the twentieth time perhaps had related the story of his wrongs and his struggle he lifted his big arm and shaking his fist above his head shouted we will stir them up we will wake up the country he was without knowing it in the least making a complete confession of the idealism hidden under the simplicity of his strength he would wake up the country that was the fundamental and unconscious emotion on which were engrafted his need of action the primitive sense of what was due to justice to gratitude to friendship the sentimental pity for the hard lot of immadapoor childthe proud conviction that of all the men in the world in his world he alone had the means and the pluck to lift up the big end of such an adventure  money was wanted and men were wanted and he had obtained enough of both in two years from that day when pistols in his belt and a cabbageleaf hat on head he had unexpectedly and at early dawn confronted in perfect silence that mysterious belarab who himself was for a moment too astounded for speech at the sight of a white face  the sun had not yet cleared the forests of the interior but a sky already full of light arched over a dark oval lagoon over wide fields as yet full of shadows that seemed slowly changing into the whiteness of the morning mist there were huts fences palisades big houses that erected on lofty piles were seen above the tops of clustered fruit trees as if suspended in the air  such was the aspect of belarabs settlement when lingard set his eyes on it for the first time there were all these things a great number of faces at the back of the spare and muffledup figure confronting him and in the swiftly increasing light a complete stillness that made the murmur of the word marhaba welcome pronounced at last by the chief perfectly audible to every one of his followers the bodyguards who stood about him in black skullcaps and with longshafted lances preserved an impassive aspect across open spaces men could be seen running to the waterside a group of women standing on a low knoll gazed intently and nothing of them but the heads showed above the unstirring stalks of a maize field suddenly within a cluster of empty huts near by the voice of an invisible hag was heard scolding with shrill fury an invisible young girl  strangers you want to see the strangers o devoid of all decency must i so lame and old husk the rice alone may evil befall thee and the strangers may they never find favour may they be pursued with swords i am old i am old there is no good in strangers o girl may they burn  welcome repeated belarab gravely and looking straight into lingards eyes  lingard spent six days that time in belarabs settlement of these three were passed in observing each other without a question being asked or a hint given as to the object in view lingard lounged on the fine mats with which the chief had furnished a small bamboo house outside a fortified enclosure where a white flag with a green border fluttered on a high and slender pole but still below the walls of long highroofed buildings raised forty feet or more on hardwood posts  far away the inland forests were tinted a shimmering blue like the forests of a dream on the seaward side the belt of great trunks and matted undergrowth came to the western shore of the oval lagoon and in the pure freshness of the air the groups of brown houses reflected in the water or seen above the waving green of the fields the clumps of palm trees the fencedin plantations the groves of fruit trees made up a picture of sumptuous prosperity  above the buildings the men the women the still sheet of water and the great plain of crops glistening with dew stretched the exalted the miraculous peace of a cloudless sky and no road seemed to lead into this country of splendour and stillness one could not believe the unquiet sea was so near with its gifts and its unending menace even during the months of storms the great clamour rising from the whitened expanse of the shallows dwelt high in the air in a vast murmur now feeble now stronger that seemed to swing back and forth on the wind above the earth without any one being able to tell whence it came it was like the solemn chant of a waterfall swelling and dying away above the woods the fields above the roofs of houses and the heads of men above the secret peace of that hidden and flourishing settlement of vanquished fanatics fugitives and outcasts  every afternoon belarab followed by an escort that stopped outside the door entered alone the house of his guest he gave the salutation inquired after his health conversed about insignificant things with an inscrutable mien but all the time the steadfast gaze of his thoughtful eyes seemed to seek the truth within that white face in the cool of the evening before the sun had set they talked together passing and repassing between the rugged pillars of the grove near the gate of the stockade the escort away in the oblique sunlight followed with their eyes the strolling figures appearing and vanishing behind the trees many words were pronounced but nothing was said that would disclose the thoughts of the two men they clasped hands demonstratively before separating and the heavy slam of the gate was followed by the triple thud of the wooden bars dropped into iron clamps  on the third night lingard was awakened from a light sleep by the sound of whispering outside a black shadow obscured the stars in the doorway and a man entering suddenly stood above his couch while another could be seen squattinga dark lump on the threshold of the hut  fear not i am belarab said a cautious voice  i was not afraid whispered lingard it is the man coming in the dark and without warning who is in danger  and did you not come to me without warning i said welcomeit was as easy for me to say kill him  you were within reach of my arm we would have died together retorted lingard quietly  the other clicked his tongue twice and his indistinct shape seemed to sink halfway through the floor  it was not written thus before we were born he said sitting crosslegged near the mats and in a deadened voice therefore you are my guest let the talk between us be straight like the shaft of a spear and shorter than the remainder of this night what do you want  first your long life answered lingard leaning forward toward the gleam of a pair of eyes and thenyour help    vii  the faint murmur of the words spoken on that night lingered for a long time in lingards ears more persistent than the memory of an uproar he looked with a fixed gaze at the stars burning peacefully in the square of the doorway while after listening in silence to all he had to say belarab as if seduced by the strength and audacity of the white man opened his heart without reserve he talked of his youth surrounded by the fury of fanaticism and war of battles on the hills of advances through the forests of mens unswerving piety of their unextinguishable hate not a single wandering cloud obscured the gentle splendour of the rectangular patch of starlight framed in the opaque blackness of the hut belarab murmured on of a succession of reverses of the ring of disasters narrowing round mens fading hopes and undiminished courage he whispered of defeat and flight of the days of despair of the nights without sleep of unending pursuit of the bewildered horror and sombre fury of their women and children killed in the stockade before the besieged sallied forth to die  i have seen all this before i was in years a man he cried low  his voice vibrated in the pause that succeeded they heard a light sigh of the sleeping follower who clasping his legs above his ankles rested his forehead on his knees  and there was amongst us began belarab again one white man who remained to the end who was faithful with his strength with his courage with his wisdom a great man he had great riches but a greater heart  the memory of jorgenson emaciated and greyhaired and trying to borrow five dollars to get something to eat for the girl passed before lingard suddenly upon the pacific glitter of the stars  he resembled you pursued belarab abruptly we escaped with him and in his ship came here it was a solitude the forest came near to the sheet of water the rank grass waved upon the heads of tall men telal my father died of weariness we were only a few and we all nearly died of trouble and sadnesshere on this spot and no enemies could tell where we had gone it was the shore of refugeand starvation  he droned on in the night with rising and falling inflections he told how his desperate companions wanted to go out and die fighting on the sea against the ships from the west the ships with high sides and white sails and how unflinching and alone he kept them battling with the thorny bush with the rank grass with the soaring and enormous trees lingard leaning on his elbow and staring through the door recalled the image of the wide fields outside sleeping now in an immensity of serenity and starlight this quiet and almost invisible talker had done it all in him was the origin the creation the fate and in the wonder of that thought the shadowy murmuring figure acquired a gigantic greatness of significance as if it had been the embodiment of some natural force of a force forever masterful and undying  and even now my life is unsafe as if i were their enemy said belarab mournfully eyes do not kill nor angry words and curses have no power else the dutch would not grow fat living on our land and i would not be alive tonight do you understand have you seen the men who fought in the old days they have not forgotten the times of war i have given them homes and quiet hearts and full bellies i alone and they curse my name in the dark in each others earsbecause they can never forget  this man whose talk had been of war and violence discovered unexpectedly a passionate craving for security and peace no one would understand him some of those who would not understand had died his white teeth gleamed cruelly in the dark but there were others he could not kill the fools he wanted the land and the people in it to be forgotten as if they had been swallowed by the sea but they had neither wisdom nor patience could they not wait they chanted prayers five times every day but they had not the faith  death comes to alland to the believers the end of trouble but you white men who are too strong for us you also die you die and there is a paradise as great as all earth and all heaven together but not for younot for you  lingard amazed listened without a sound the sleeper snored faintly belarab continued very calm after this almost involuntary outburst of a consoling belief he explained that he wanted somebody at his back somebody strong and whom he could trust some outside force that would awe the unruly that would inspire their ignorance with fear and make his rule secure he groped in the dark and seizing lingards arm above the elbow pressed it with forcethen let go and lingard understood why his temerity had been so successful  then and there in return for lingards open support a few guns and a little money belarab promised his help for the conquest of wajo there was no doubt he could find men who would fight he could send messages to friends at a distance and there were also many unquiet spirits in his own district ready for any adventure he spoke of these men with fierce contempt and an angry tenderness in mingled accents of envy and disdain he was wearied by their folly by their recklessness by their impatienceand he seemed to resent these as if they had been gifts of which he himself had been deprived by the fatality of his wisdom they would fight when the time came lingard had only to speak and a sign from him would send them to a vain deaththose men who could not wait for an opportunity on this earth or for the eternal revenge of heaven  he ceased and towered upright in the gloom  awake he exclaimed low bending over the sleeping man  their black shapes passing in turn eclipsed for two successive moments the glitter of the stars and lingard who had not stirred remained alone he lay back full length with an arm thrown across his eyes  when three days afterward he left belarabs settlement it was on a calm morning of unclouded peace all the boats of the brig came up into the lagoon armed and manned to make more impressive the solemn fact of a concluded alliance a staring crowd watched his imposing departure in profound silence and with an increased sense of wonder at the mystery of his apparition the progress of the boats was smooth and slow while they crossed the wide lagoon lingard looked back once a great stillness had laid its hand over the earth the sky and the men upon the immobility of landscape and people hassim and immada standing out clearly by the side of the chief raised their arms in a last salutation and the distant gesture appeared sad futile lost in space like a sign of distress made by castaways in the vain hope of an impossible help  he departed he returned he went away again and each time those two figures lonely on some sandbank of the shallows made at him the same futile sign of greeting or goodbye their arms at each movement seemed to draw closer around his heart the bonds of a protecting affection he worked prosaically earning money to pay the cost of the romantic necessity that had invaded his life and the money ran like water out of his hands the owner of the new england voice remitted not a little of it to his people in baltimore but import houses in the ports of the far east had their share it paid for a fast prau which commanded by jaffir sailed into unfrequented bays and up unexplored rivers carrying secret messages important news generous bribes a good part of it went to the purchase of the emma  the emma was a battered and decrepit old schooner that in the decline of her existence had been much illused by a paunchy white trader of cunning and gluttonous aspect this man boasted outrageously afterward of the good price he had got for that rotten old hooker of mineyou know the emma left port mysteriously in company with the brig and henceforth vanished from the seas forever lingard had her towed up the creek and ran her aground upon that shore of the lagoon farthest from belarabs settlement there had been at that time a great rise of waters which retiring soon after left the old craft cradled in the mud with her bows grounded high between the trunks of two big trees and leaning over a little as though after a hard life she had settled wearily to an everlasting rest there a few months later jorgenson found her when called back into the life of men he reappeared together with lingard in the land of refuge  she is better than a fort on shore said lingard as side by side they leant over the taffrail looking across the lagoon on the houses and palm groves of the settlement all the guns and powder i have got together so far are stored in her good idea wasnt it there will be perhaps no other such flood for years and now they cant come alongside unless right under the counter and only one boat at a time i think you are perfectly safe here you could keep off a whole fleet of boats she isnt easy to set fire to the forest in front is better than a wall well  jorgenson assented in grunts he looked at the desolate emptiness of the decks at the stripped spars at the dead body of the dismantled little vessel that would know the life of the seas no more the gloom of the forest fell on her mournful like a winding sheet the bushes of the bank tapped their twigs on the bluff of her bows and a pendent spike of tiny brown blossoms swung to and fro over the ruins of her windlass  hassims companions garrisoned the old hulk and jorgenson left in charge prowled about from stem to stern taciturn and anxiously faithful to his trust he had been received with astonishment respectand awe belarab visited him often sometimes those whom he had known in their prime years ago during a struggle for faith and life would come to talk with the white man their voices were like the echoes of stirring events in the pale glamour of a youth gone by they nodded their old heads do you rememberthey said he remembered only too well he was like a man raised from the dead for whom the fascinating trust in the power of life is tainted by the black scepticism of the grave  only at times the invincible belief in the reality of existence would come back insidious and inspiring he squared his shoulders held himself straight and walked with a firmer step he felt a glow within him and the quickened beat of his heart then he calculated in silent excitement lingards chances of success and he lived for a time with the life of that other man who knew nothing of the black scepticism of the grave the chances were good very good  i should like to see it through jorgenson muttered to himself ardently and his lustreless eyes would flash for a moment    part iii the capture  i  some people said lingard go about the world with their eyes shut you are right the sea is free to all of us some work on it and some play the fool on itand i dont care only you may take it from me that i will let no mans play interfere with my work you want me to understand you are a very great man  mr travers smiled coldly  oh yes continued lingard i understand that well enough but remember you are very far from home while i here i am where i belong and i belong where i am i am just tom lingard no more no less wherever i happen to be andyou may ask a sweep of his hand along the western horizon entrusted with perfect confidence the remainder of his speech to the dumb testimony of the sea  he had been on board the yacht for more than an hour and nothing for him had come of it but the birth of an unreasoning hate to the unconscious demand of these peoples presence of their ignorance of their faces of their voices of their eyes he had nothing to give but a resentment that had in it a germ of reckless violence he could tell them nothing because he had not the means their coming at this moment when he had wandered beyond that circle which race memories early associations all the essential conditions of ones origin trace round every mans life deprived him in a manner of the power of speech he was confounded it was like meeting exacting spectres in a desert  he stared at the open sea his arms crossed with a reflective fierceness his very appearance made him utterly different from everyone on board that vessel the grey shirt the blue sash one rolledup sleeve baring a sculptural forearm the negligent masterfulness of his tone and pose were very distasteful to mr travers who having made up his mind to wait for some kind of official assistance regarded the intrusion of that inexplicable man with suspicion from the moment lingard came on board the yacht every eye in that vessel had been fixed upon him only carter within earshot and leaning with his elbow upon the rail stared down at the deck as if overcome with drowsiness or lost in thought  of the three other persons aft mr travers kept his hands in the side pockets of his jacket and did not conceal his growing disgust  on the other side of the deck a lady in a long chair had a passive attitude that to mr dalcacer standing near her seemed characteristic of the manner in which she accepted the necessities of existence years before as an attache of his embassy in london he had found her an interesting hostess she was even more interesting now since a chance meeting and mr travers offer of a passage to batavia had given him an opportunity of studying the various shades of scorn which he suspected to be the secret of her acquiescence in the shallowness of events and the monotony of a worldly existence  there were things that from the first he had not been able to understand for instance why she should have married mr travers it must have been from ambition he could not help feeling that such a successful mistake would explain completely her scorn and also her acquiescence the meeting in manila had been utterly unexpected to him and he accounted for it to his uncle the governorgeneral of the colony by pointing out that englishmen when worsted in the struggle of love or politics travel extensively as if by encompassing a large portion of earths surface they hoped to gather fresh strength for a renewed contest as to himself he judgedbut did not saythat his contest with fate was ended though he also travelled leaving behind him in the capitals of europe a story in which there was nothing scandalous but the publicity of an excessive feeling and nothing more tragic than the early death of a woman whose brilliant perfections were no better known to the great world than the discreet and passionate devotion she had innocently inspired  the invitation to join the yacht was the culminating point of many exchanged civilities and was mainly prompted by mr travers desire to have somebody to talk to dalcacer had accepted with the reckless indifference of a man to whom one method of flight from a relentless enemy is as good as another certainly the prospect of listening to long monologues on commerce administration and politics did not promise much alleviation to his sorrow and he could not expect much else from mr travers whose life and thought ignorant of human passion were devoted to extracting the greatest possible amount of personal advantage from human institutions dalcacer found however that he could attain a measure of forgetfulnessthe most precious thing for him nowin the society of edith travers  she had awakened his curiosity which he thought nothing and nobody on earth could do any more  these two talked of things indifferent and interesting certainly not connected with human institutions and only very slightly with human passions but dalcacer could not help being made aware of her latent capacity for sympathy developed in those who are disenchanted with life or death how far she was disenchanted he did not know and did not attempt to find out this restraint was imposed upon him by the chivalrous respect he had for the secrets of women and by a conviction that deep feeling is often impenetrably obscure even to those it masters for their inspiration or their ruin he believed that even she herself would never know but his grave curiosity was satisfied by the observation of her mental state and he was not sorry that the stranding of the yacht prolonged his opportunity  time passed on that mudbank as well as anywhere else and it was not from a multiplicity of events but from the lapse of time alone that he expected relief yet in the sameness of days upon the shallows time flowing ceaselessly flowed imperceptibly and since every man clings to his own be it joy be it grief he was pleased after the unrest of his wanderings to be able to fancy the whole universe and even time itself apparently come to a standstill as if unwilling to take him away further from his sorrow which was fading indeed but undiminished as things fade not in the distance but in the mist   ii  dalcacer was a man of nearly forty lean and sallow with hollow eyes and a drooping brown moustache his gaze was penetrating and direct his smile frequent and fleeting he observed lingard with great interest he was attracted by that elusive somethinga line a fold perhaps the form of the eye the droop of an eyelid the curve of a cheek that trifling trait which on no two faces on earth is alike that in each face is the very foundation of expression as if all the rest being heredity mystery or accident it alone had been shaped consciously by the soul within  now and then he bent slightly over the slow beat of a red fan in the curve of the deck chair to say a few words to mrs travers who answered him without looking up without a modulation of tone or a play of feature as if she had spoken from behind the veil of an immense indifference stretched between her and all men between her heart and the meaning of events between her eyes and the shallow sea which like her gaze appeared profound forever stilled and seemed far off in the distance of a faint horizon beyond the reach of eye beyond the power of hand or voice to lose itself in the sky  mr travers stepped aside and speaking to carter overwhelmed him with reproaches  you misunderstood your instructions murmured mr travers rapidly why did you bring this man here i am surprised  not half so much as i was last night growled the young seaman without any reverence in his tone very provoking to mr travers  i perceive now you were totally unfit for the mission i entrusted you with went on the owner of the yacht  its he who got hold of me said carter havent you heard him yourself sir  nonsense whispered mr travers angrily have you any idea what his intentions may be  i half believe answered carter that his intention was to shoot me in his cabin last night if i  thats not the point interrupted mr travers have you any opinion as to his motives in coming here  carter raised his weary bloodshot eyes in a face scarlet and peeling as though it had been licked by a flame i know no more than you do sir last night when he had me in that cabin of his he said he would just as soon shoot me as let me go to look for any other help it looks as if he were desperately bent upon getting a lot of salvage money out of a stranded yacht  mr travers turned away and for a moment appeared immersed in deep thought this accident of stranding upon a deserted coast was annoying as a loss of time he tried to minimize it by putting in order the notes collected during the years travel in the east he had sent off for assistance his sailingmaster very crestfallen made bold to say that the yacht would most likely float at the next spring tides dalcacer a person of undoubted nobility though of inferior principles was better than no company in so far at least that he could play picquet  mr travers had made up his mind to wait then suddenly this rough man looking as if he had stepped out from an engraving in a book about buccaneers broke in upon his resignation with mysterious allusions to danger which sounded absurd yet were disturbing with dark and warning sentences that sounded like disguised menaces  mr travers had a heavy and rather long chin which he shaved his eyes were blue a chill naive blue he faced lingard untouched by travel without a mark of weariness or exposure with the air of having been born invulnerable he had a full pale face and his complexion was perfectly colourless yet amazingly fresh as if he had been reared in the shade  he thought  i must put an end to this preposterous hectoring i wont be intimidated into paying for services i dont need  mr travers felt a strong disgust for the impudence of the attempt and all at once incredibly strangely as though the thing like a contest with a rival or a friend had been of profound importance to his career he felt inexplicably elated at the thought of defeating the secret purposes of that man  lingard unconscious of everything and everybody contemplated the sea he had grown on it he had lived with it it had enticed him away from home on it his thoughts had expanded and his hand had found work to do it had suggested endeavour it had made him owner and commander of the finest brig afloat it had lulled him into a belief in himself in his strength in his luckand suddenly by its complicity in a fatal accident it had brought him face to face with a difficulty that looked like the beginning of disaster  he had said all he dared to sayand he perceived that he was not believed this had not happened to him for years it had never happened it bewildered him as if he had suddenly discovered that he was no longer himself he had come to them and had said i mean well by you i am tom lingard and they did not believe before such scepticism he was helpless because he had never imagined it possible he had said you are in the way of my work you are in the way of what i can not give up for any one but i will see you through all safe if you will only trust meme tom lingard and they would not believe him it was intolerable he imagined himself sweeping their disbelief out of his way and why not he did not know them he did not care for them he did not even need to lift his hand against them all he had to do was to shut his eyes now for a day or two and afterward he could forget that he had ever seen them it would be easy let their disbelief vanish their folly disappear their bodies perish    it was thator ruin    iii  lingards gaze detaching itself from the silent sea travelled slowly over the silent figures clustering forward over the faces of the seamen attentive and surprised over the faces never seen before yet suggesting old dayshis youthother seasthe distant shores of early memories mr travers gave a start also and the hand which had been busy with his left whisker went into the pocket of his jacket as though he had plucked out something worth keeping he made a quick step toward lingard  i dont see my way to utilize your services he said with cold finality  lingard grasping his beard looked down at him thoughtfully for a short time  perhaps its just as well he said very slowly because i did not offer my services ive offered to take you on board my brig for a few days as your only chance of safety and you asked me what were my motives my motives if you dont see them they are not for you to know  and these men who two hours before had never seen each other stood for a moment close together antagonistic as if they had been lifelong enemies one short dapper and glaring upward the other towering heavily and looking down in contempt and anger  mr dalcacer without taking his eyes off them bent low over the deck chair  have you ever seen a man dashing himself at a stone wall he asked confidentially  no said mrs travers gazing straight before her above the slow flutter of the fan no i did not know it was ever done men burrow under or slip round quietly while they look the other way  ah you define diplomacy murmured dalcacer a little of it here would do no harm but our picturesque visitor has none of it ive a great liking for him  already breathed out mrs travers with a smile that touched her lips with its bright wing and was flown almost before it could be seen  there is liking at first sight affirmed dalcacer as well as love at first sightthe coup de foudreyou know  she looked up for a moment and he went on gravely i think it is the truest the most profound of sentiments you do not love because of what is in the other you love because of something that is in yousomething alivein yourself he struck his breast lightly with the tip of one finger a capacity in you and not everyone may have itnot everyone deserves to be touched by fire from heaven  and die she said  he made a slight movement  who can tell that is as it may be but it is always a privilege even if one must live a little after being burnt  through the silence between them mr travers voice came plainly saying with irritation  ive told you already that i do not want you ive sent a messenger to the governor of the straits dont be importunate  then lingard standing with his back to them growled out something which must have exasperated mr travers because his voice was pitched higher  you are playing a dangerous game i warn you sir john as it happens is a personal friend of mine he will send a cruiser and lingard interrupted recklessly loud  as long as she does not get here for the next ten days i dont care cruisers are scarce just now in the straits and to turn my back on you is no hanging matter anyhow i would risk that and more do you hear and more  he stamped his foot heavily mr travers stepped back  you will gain nothing by trying to frighten me he said i dont know who you are  every eye in the yacht was wide open the men crowded upon each other stared stupidly like a flock of sheep mr travers pulled out a handkerchief and passed it over his forehead the face of the sailingmaster who leaned against the main mastas near as he dared to approach the gentrywas shining and crimson between white whiskers like a glowing coal between two patches of snow  dalcacer whispered  it is a quarrel and the picturesque man is angry he is hurt  mrs travers fan rested on her knees and she sat still as if waiting to hear more  do you think i ought to make an effort for peace asked dalcacer  she did not answer and after waiting a little he insisted  what is your opinion shall i try to mediateas a neutral as a benevolent neutral i like that man with the beard  the interchange of angry phrases went on aloud amidst general consternation  i would turn my back on you only i am thinking of these poor devils here growled lingard furiously did you ask them how they feel about it  i ask no one spluttered mr travers everybody here depends on my judgment  i am sorry for them then pronounced lingard with sudden deliberation and leaning forward with his arms crossed on his breast  at this mr travers positively jumped and forgot himself so far as to shout  you are an impudent fellow i have nothing more to say to you  dalcacer after muttering to himself this is getting serious made a movement and could not believe his ears when he heard mrs travers say rapidly with a kind of fervour  dont go pray dont stop them oh this is truththis is angersomething real at last  dalcacer leaned back at once against the rail  then mr travers with one arm extended repeated very loudly  nothing more to say leave my ship at once  and directly the black dog stretched at his wifes feet muzzle on paws and blinking yellow eyes growled discontentedly at the noise mrs travers laughed a faint bright laugh that seemed to escape to glide to dart between her white teeth dalcacer concealing his amazement was looking down at her gravely and after a slight gasp she said with little bursts of merriment between every few words  no but this issuchsuch a fresh experience for me to hearto see somethinggenuine and human ah ah one would think they had waited all their lives for this opportunityah ah ah all their livesfor this ah ah ah  these strange words struck dalcacer as perfectly just as throwing an unexpected light but after a smile he said seriously  this reality may go too far a man who looks so picturesque is capable of anything allow me and he left her side moving toward lingard looselimbed and gaunt yet having in his whole bearing in his walk in every leisurely movement an air of distinction and ceremony  lingard spun round with aggressive mien to the light touch on his shoulder but as soon as he took his eyes off mr travers his anger fell seemed to sink without a sound at his feet like a rejected garment  pardon me said dalcacer composedly the slight wave of his hand was hardly more than an indication the beginning of a conciliating gesture pardon me but this is a matter requiring perfect confidence on both sides don martin here who is a person of importance     ive spoken my mind plainly i have said as much as i dare on my word i have declared lingard with an air of good temper  ah said dalcacer reflectively then your reserve is a matter of pledged faithofof honour  lingard also appeared thoughtful for a moment  you may put it that way and i owe nothing to a man who couldnt see my hand when i put it out to him as i came aboard  you have so much the advantage of us here replied dalcacer that you may well be generous and forget that oversight and then just a little more confidence     my dear dalcacer you are absurd broke in mr travers in a calm voice but with white lips i did not come out all this way to shake hands promiscuously and receive confidences from the first adventurer that comes along  dalcacer stepped back with an almost imperceptible inclination of the head at lingard who stood for a moment with twitching face  i am an adventurer he burst out and if i hadnt been an adventurer i would have had to starve or work at home for such people as you if i werent an adventurer you would be most likely lying dead on this deck with your cut throat gaping at the sky  mr travers waved this speech away but others also had heard carter listened watchfully and something some alarming notion seemed to dawn all at once upon the thick little sailingmaster who rushed on his short legs and tugging at carters sleeve stammered desperately  whats he saying whos he whats up are the natives unfriendly my book saysnatives friendly all along this coast my book says  carter who had glanced over the side jerked his arm free  you go down into the pantry where you belong skipper and read that bit about the natives over again he said to his superior officer with savage contempt ill be hanged if some of them aint coming aboard now to eat youbook and all get out of the way and let the gentlemen have the first chance of a row  then addressing lingard he drawled in his old way  that crazy mate of yours has sent your boat back with a couple of visitors in her too  before he apprehended plainly the meaning of these words lingard caught sight of two heads rising above the rail the head of hassim and the head of immada then their bodies ascended into view as though these two beings had gradually emerged from the shallows they stood for a moment on the platform looking down on the deck as if about to step into the unknown then descended and walking aft entered the halflight under the awning shading the luxurious surroundings the complicated emotions of the to them inconceivable existences  lingard without waiting a moment cried  what news o rajah  hassims eyes made the round of the schooners decks he had left his gun in the boat and advanced empty handed with a tranquil assurance as if bearing a welcome offering in the faint smile of his lips immada half hidden behind his shoulder followed lightly her elbows pressed close to her side the thick fringe of her eyelashes was dropped like a veil she looked youthful and brooding she had an aspect of shy resolution  they stopped within arms length of the whites and for some time nobody said a word then hassim gave lingard a significant glance and uttered rapidly with a slight toss of the head that indicated in a manner the whole of the yacht  i see no guns  nno said lingard looking suddenly confused it had occurred to him that for the first time in two years or more he had forgotten utterly forgotten these peoples existence  immada stood slight and rigid with downcast eyes hassim at his ease scrutinized the faces as if searching for elusive points of similitude or for subtle shades of difference  what is this new intrusion asked mr travers angrily  these are the fisherfolk sir broke in the sailingmaster weve observed these three days past flitting about in a canoe but they never had the sense to answer our hail and yet a bit of fish for your breakfast he smiled obsequiously and all at once without provocation began to bellow  hey johnnie hab got fish fish one peecee fish eh savee fish fish he gave it up suddenly to say in a deferential tonecant make them savages understand anything sir and withdrew as if after a clever feat  hassim looked at lingard  why did the little white man make that outcry he asked anxiously  their desire is to eat fish said lingard in an enraged tone  then before the air of extreme surprise which incontinently appeared on the others face he could not restrain a short and hopeless laugh  eat fish repeated hassim staring o you white people o you white people eat fish good but why make that noise and why did you send them here without guns after a significant glance down upon the slope of the deck caused by the vessel being on the ground he added with a slight nod at lingardand without knowledge  you should not have come here o hassim said lingard testily here no one understands they take a rajah for a fisherman  yawa a great mistake for truly the chief of ten fugitives without a country is much less than the headman of a fishing village observed hassim composedly immada sighed but you tuan at least know the truth he went on with quiet irony then after a pausewe came here because you had forgotten to look toward us who had waited sleeping little at night and in the day watching with hot eyes the empty water at the foot of the sky for you  immada murmured without lifting her head  you never looked for us never never once  there was too much trouble in my eyes explained lingard with that patient gentleness of tone and face which every time he spoke to the young girl seemed to disengage itself from his whole person enveloping his fierceness softening his aspect such as the dreamy mist that in the early radiance of the morning weaves a veil of tender charm about a rugged rock in midocean i must look now to the right and to the left as in a time of sudden danger he added after a moment and she whispered an appalled why so low that its pain floated away in the silence of attentive men without response unheard ignored like the pain of an impalpable thought    iv  dalcacer standing back surveyed them all with a profound and alert attention lingard seemed unable to tear himself away from the yacht and remained checked as it were in the act of going like a man who has stopped to think out the last thing to say and that stillness of a body forgotten by the labouring mind reminded carter of that moment in the cabin when alone he had seen this man thus wrestling with his thought motionless and locked in the grip of his conscience  mr travers muttered audibly through his teeth  how long is this performance going to last i have desired you to go  think of these poor devils whispered lingard with a quick glance at the crew huddled up near by  you are the kind of man i would be least disposed to trustin any case said mr travers incisively very low and with an inexplicable but very apparent satisfaction you are only wasting your time here  youyou he stammered and stared he chewed with growls some insulting word and at last swallowed it with an effort my time pays for your life he said  he became aware of a sudden stir and saw that mrs travers had risen from her chair  she walked impulsively toward the group on the quarterdeck making straight for immada hassim had stepped aside and his detached gaze of a malay gentleman passed by her as if she had been invisible  she was tall supple moving freely her complexion was so dazzling in the shade that it seemed to throw out a halo round her head upon a smooth and wide brow an abundance of pale fair hair fine as silk undulating like the sea heavy like a helmet descended low without a trace of gloss without a gleam in its coils as though it had never been touched by a ray of light and a throat white smooth palpitating with life a round neck modelled with strength and delicacy supported gloriously that radiant face and that pale mass of hair unkissed by sunshine  she said with animation  why its a girl  mrs travers extorted from dalcacer a fresh tribute of curiosity a strong puff of wind fluttered the awnings and one of the screens blowing out wide let in upon the quarterdeck the rippling glitter of the shallows showing to dalcacer the luminous vastness of the sea with the line of the distant horizon dark like the edge of the encompassing night drawn at the height of mrs travers shoulder    where was it he had seen her lasta long time before on the other side of the world there was also the glitter of splendour around her then and an impression of luminous vastness the encompassing night too was there the night that waits for its time to move forward upon the glitter the splendour the men the women  he could not remember for the moment but he became convinced that of all the women he knew she alone seemed to be made for action every one of her movements had firmness ease the meaning of a vital fact the moral beauty of a fearless expression her supple figure was not dishonoured by any faltering of outlines under the plain dress of dark blue stuff moulding her form with bold simplicity  she had only very few steps to make but before she had stopped confronting immada dalcacer remembered her suddenly as he had seen her last out west far away impossibly different as if in another universe as if presented by the fantasy of a fevered memory he saw her in a luminous perspective of palatial drawing rooms in the restless eddy and flow of a human sea at the foot of walls high as cliffs under lofty ceilings that like a tropical sky flung light and heat upon the shallow glitter of uniforms of stars of diamonds of eyes sparkling in the weary or impassive faces of the throng at an official reception outside he had found the unavoidable darkness with its aspect of patient waiting a cloudy sky holding back the dawn of a london morning it was difficult to believe  lingard who had been looking dangerously fierce slapped his thigh and showed signs of agitation  by heavens i had forgotten all about you he pronounced in dismay  mrs travers fixed her eyes on immada fairhaired and white she asserted herself before the girl of olive face and raven locks with the maturity of perfection with the superiority of the flower over the leaf of the phrase that contains a thought over the cry that can only express an emotion immense spaces and countless centuries stretched between them and she looked at her as when one looks into ones own heart with absorbed curiosity with still wonder with an immense compassion lingard murmured warningly  dont touch her  mrs travers looked at him  do you think i could hurt her she asked softly and was so startled to hear him mutter a gloomy perhaps that she hesitated before she smiled  almost a child and so pretty what a delicate face she said while another deep sigh of the sea breeze lifted and let fall the screens so that the sound the wind and the glitter seemed to rush in together and bear her words away into space i had no idea of anything so charmingly gentle she went on in a voice that without effort glowed caressed and had a magic power of delight to the soul so young and she lives heredoes she on the seaor where lives then faintly as if she had been in the act of speaking removed instantly to a great distance she was heard again how does she live  lingard had hardly seen edith travers till then he had seen no one really but mr travers he looked and listened with something of the stupor of a new sensation  then he made a distinct effort to collect his thoughts and said with a remnant of anger  what have you got to do with her she knows war do you know anything about it and hunger too and thirst and unhappiness things you have only heard about she has been as near death as i am to youand what is all that to any of you here  that child she said in slow wonder  immada turned upon mrs travers her eyes black as coal sparkling and soft like a tropical night and the glances of the two women their dissimilar and inquiring glances met seemed to touch clasp hold each other with the grip of an intimate contact they separated  what are they come for why did you show them the way to this place asked immada faintly  lingard shook his head in denial  poor girl said mrs travers are they all so pretty  whoall mumbled lingard there isnt an other one like her if you were to ransack the islands all round the compass  edith ejaculated mr travers in a remonstrating acrimonious voice and everyone gave him a look of vague surprise  then mrs travers asked  who is she  lingard very red and grave declared curtly  a princess  immediately he looked round with suspicion no one smiled dalcacer courteous and nonchalant lounged up close to mrs travers elbow  if she is a princess then this man is a knight he murmured with conviction a knight as i live a descendant of the immortal hidalgo errant upon the sea it would be good for us to have him for a friend seriously i think that you ought  the two stepped aside and spoke low and hurriedly  yes you ought  how can i she interrupted catching the meaning like a ball  by saying something  is it really necessary she asked doubtfully  it would do no harm said dalcacer with sudden carelessness a friend is always better than an enemy  always she repeated meaningly but what could i say  some words he answered i should think any words in your voice  mr dalcacer  or you could perhaps look at him once or twice as though he were not exactly a robber he continued  mr dalcacer are you afraid  extremely he said stooping to pick up the fan at her feet that is the reason i am so anxious to conciliate and you must not forget that one of your queens once stepped on the cloak of perhaps such a man  her eyes sparkled and she dropped them suddenly  i am not a queen she said coldly  unfortunately not he admitted but then the other was a woman with no charm but her crown  at that moment lingard to whom hassim had been talking earnestly protested aloud  i never saw these people before  immada caught hold of her brothers arm mr travers said harshly  oblige me by taking these natives away  never before murmured immada as if lost in ecstasy dalcacer glanced at mrs travers and made a step forward  could not the difficulty whatever it is be arranged captain he said with careful politeness observe that we are not only men here  let them die cried immada triumphantly  though lingard alone understood the meaning of these words all on board felt oppressed by the uneasy silence which followed her cry  ah he is going now mrs travers whispered dalcacer  i hope said mrs travers impulsively and stopped as if alarmed at the sound  lingard stood still  i hope she began again that this poor girl will know happier days she hesitated  lingard waited attentive and serious  under your care she finished and i believe you meant to be friendly to us  thank you said lingard with dignity  you and dalcacer observed mr travers austerely are unnecessarily detaining thisahperson andahfriendsah  i had forgotten youand nowwhat one mustit is hardhard went on lingard disconnectedly while he looked into mrs travers violet eyes and felt his mind overpowered and troubled as if by the contemplation of vast distances iyou dont knowiyoucannot    ha its all that mans doing he burst out  for a time as if beside himself he glared at mrs travers then flung up one arm and strode off toward the gangway where hassim and immada waited for him interested and patient with a single word come he preceded them down into the boat not a sound was heard on the yachts deck while these three disappeared one after another below the rail as if they had descended into the sea    v  the afternoon dragged itself out in silence mrs travers sat pensive and idle with her fan on her knees dalcacer who thought the incident should have been treated in a conciliatory spirit attempted to communicate his view to his host but that gentleman purposely misunderstanding his motive overwhelmed him with so many apologies and expressions of regret at the irksome and perhaps inconvenient delay which you suffer from through your goodnatured acceptance of our invitation that the other was obliged to refrain from pursuing the subject further  even my regard for you my dear dalcacer could not induce me to submit to such a barefaced attempt at extortion affirmed mr travers with uncompromising virtue the man wanted to force his services upon me and then put in a heavy claim for salvage that is the whole secretyou may depend on it i detected him at once of course the eyeglass glittered perspicuously he underrated my intelligence and what a violent scoundrel the existence of such a man in the time we live in is a scandal  dalcacer retired and full of vague forebodings tried in vain for hours to interest himself in a book mr travers walked up and down restlessly trying to persuade himself that his indignation was based on purely moral grounds the glaring day like a mass of whitehot iron withdrawn from the fire was losing gradually its heat and its glare in a richer deepening of tone at the usual time two seamen walking noiselessly aft in their yachting shoes rolled up in silence the quarterdeck screens and the coast the shallows the dark islets and the snowy sandbanks uncovered thus day after day were seen once more in their aspect of dumb watchfulness the brig swung end on in the foreground her squared yards crossing heavily the soaring symmetry of the rigging resembled a creature instinct with life with the power of springing into action lurking in the light grace of its repose  a pair of stewards in white jackets with brass buttons appeared on deck and began to flit about without a sound laying the table for dinner on the flat top of the cabin skylight the sun drifting away toward other lands toward other seas toward other men the sun all red in a cloudless sky raked the yacht with a parting salvo of crimson rays that shattered themselves into sparks of fire upon the crystal and silver of the dinnerservice put a short flame into the blades of knives and spread a rosy tint over the white of plates a trail of purple like a smear of blood on a blue shield lay over the sea  on sitting down mr travers alluded in a vexed tone to the necessity of living on preserves all the stock of fresh provisions for the passage to batavia having been already consumed it was distinctly unpleasant  i dont travel for my pleasure however he added and the belief that the sacrifice of my time and comfort will be productive of some good to the world at large would make up for any amount of privations  mrs travers and dalcacer seemed unable to shake off a strong aversion to talk and the conversation like an expiring breeze kept on dying out repeatedly after each languid gust the large silence of the horizon the profound repose of all things visible enveloping the bodies and penetrating the souls with their quieting influence stilled thought as well as voice for a long time no one spoke behind the taciturnity of the masters the servants hovered without noise  suddenly mr travers as if concluding a train of thought muttered aloud  i own with regret i did in a measure lose my temper but then you will admit that the existence of such a man is a disgrace to civilization  this remark was not taken up and he returned for a time to the nursing of his indignation at the bottom of which like a monster in a fog crept a bizarre feeling of rancour he waved away an offered dish  this coast he began again has been placed under the sole protection of holland by the treaty of 1820 the treaty of 1820 creates special rights and obligations     both his hearers felt vividly the urgent necessity to hear no more dalcacer uncomfortable on a campstool sat stiff and stared at the glass stopper of a carafe mrs travers turned a little sideways and leaning on her elbow rested her head on the palm of her hand like one thinking about matters of profound import mr travers talked he talked inflexibly in a harsh blank voice as if reading a proclamation the other two as if in a state of incomplete trance had their ears assailed by fragments of official verbiage  an international understandingthe duty to civilizefailed to carry outcompactcanning dalcacer became attentive for a moment not that this attempt almost amusing in its impudence influences my opinion i wont admit the possibility of any violence being offered to people of our position it is the social aspect of such an incident i am desirous of criticising  here dalcacer lost himself again in the recollection of mrs travers and immada looking at each otherthe beginning and the end the flower and the leaf the phrase and the cry mr travers voice went on dogmatic and obstinate for a long time the end came with a certain vehemence  and if the inferior race must perish it is a gain a step toward the perfecting of society which is the aim of progress  he ceased the sparks of sunset in crystal and silver had gone out and around the yacht the expanse of coast and shallows seemed to await unmoved the coming of utter darkness the dinner was over a long time ago and the patient stewards had been waiting stoical in the downpour of words like sentries under a shower  mrs travers rose nervously and going aft began to gaze at the coast behind her the sun sunk already seemed to force through the mass of waters the glow of an unextinguishable fire and below her feet on each side of the yacht the lustrous sea as if reflecting the colour of her eyes was tinged a sombre violet hue  dalcacer came up to her with quiet footsteps and for some time they leaned side by side over the rail in silence then he saidhow quiet it is and she seemed to perceive that the quietness of that evening was more profound and more significant than ever before almost without knowing it she murmuredits like a dream another long silence ensued the tranquillity of the universe had such an august ampleness that the sounds remained on the lips as if checked by the fear of profanation the sky was limpid like a diamond and under the last gleams of sunset the night was spreading its veil over the earth there was something precious and soothing in the beautifully serene end of that expiring day of the day vibrating glittering and ardent and dying now in infinite peace without a stir without a tremor without a sighin the certitude of resurrection  then all at once the shadow deepened swiftly the stars came out in a crowd scattering a rain of pale sparks upon the blackness of the water while the coast stretched low down a dark belt without a gleam above it the tophamper of the brig loomed indistinct and high  mrs travers spoke first  how unnaturally quiet it is like a desert of land and water without a living soul  one man at least dwells in it said dalcacer lightly and if he is to be believed there are other men full of evil intentions  do you think it is true mrs travers asked  before answering dalcacer tried to see the expression of her face but the obscurity was too profound already  how can one see a dark truth on such a dark night he said evasively but it is easy to believe in evil here or anywhere else  she seemed to be lost in thought for a while  and that man himself she asked  after some time dalcacer began to speak slowly rough uncommon decidedly uncommon of his kind not at all what don martin thinks him to be for the restmysterious to me he is your countryman after all  she seemed quite surprised by that view  yes she said slowly but you know i can notwhat shall i sayimagine him at all he has nothing in common with the mankind i know there is nothing to begin upon how does such a man live what are his thoughts his actions his affections his  his conventions suggested dalcacer that would include everything  mr travers appeared suddenly behind them with a glowing cigar in his teeth he took it between his fingers to declare with persistent acrimony that no amount of scoundrelly intimidation would prevent him from having his usual walk there was about three hundred yards to the southward of the yacht a sandbank nearly a mile long gleaming a silvery white in the darkness plumetted in the centre with a thicket of dry bushes that rustled very loud in the slightest stir of the heavy night air the day after the stranding they had landed on it to stretch their legs a bit as the sailingmaster defined it and every evening since as if exercising a privilege or performing a duty the three paced there for an hour backward and forward lost in dusky immensity threading at the edge of water the belt of damp sand smooth level elastic to the touch like living flesh and sweating a little under the pressure of their feet  this time dalcacer alone followed mr travers mrs travers heard them get into the yachts smallest boat and the nightwatchman tugging at a pair of sculls pulled them off to the nearest point then the man returned he came up the ladder and she heard him say to someone on deck  orders to go back in an hour  his footsteps died out forward and a somnolent unbreathing repose took possession of the stranded yacht    vi  after a time this absolute silence which she almost could feel pressing upon her on all sides induced in mrs travers a state of hallucination she saw herself standing alone at the end of time on the brink of days all was unmoving as if the dawn would never come the stars would never fade the sun would never rise any more all was mute still deadas if the shadow of the outer darkness the shadow of the uninterrupted of the everlasting night that fills the universe the shadow of the night so profound and so vast that the blazing suns lost in it are only like sparks like pinpoints of fire the restless shadow that like a suspicion of an evil truth darkens everything upon the earth on its passage had enveloped her had stood arrested as if to remain with her forever  and there was such a finality in that illusion such an accord with the trend of her thought that when she murmured into the darkness a faint so be it she seemed to have spoken one of those sentences that resume and close a life  as a young girl often reproved for her romantic ideas she had dreams where the sincerity of a great passion appeared like the ideal fulfilment and the only truth of life entering the world she discovered that ideal to be unattainable because the world is too prudent to be sincere then she hoped that she could find the truth of life an ambition which she understood as a lifelong devotion to some unselfish ideal mr travers name was on mens lips he seemed capable of enthusiasm and of devotion he impressed her imagination by his impenetrability she married him found him enthusiastically devoted to the nursing of his own career and had nothing to hope for now  that her husband should be bewildered by the curious misunderstanding which had taken place and also permanently grieved by her disloyalty to his respectable ideals was only natural he was however perfectly satisfied with her beauty her brilliance and her useful connections she was admired she was envied she was surrounded by splendour and adulation the days went on rapid brilliant uniform without a glimpse of sincerity or true passion without a single true emotionnot even that of a great sorrow and swiftly and stealthily they had led her on and on to this evening to this coast to this sea to this moment of time and to this spot on the earths surface where she felt unerringly that the moving shadow of the unbroken night had stood still to remain with her forever  so be it she murmured resigned and defiant at the mute and smooth obscurity that hung before her eyes in a black curtain without a fold and as if in answer to that whisper a lantern was run up to the foreyardarm of the brig she saw it ascend swinging for a short space and suddenly remain motionless in the air piercing the dense night between the two vessels by its glance of flame that strong and steady seemed from afar to fall upon her alone  her thoughts like a fascinated moth went fluttering toward that lightthat manthat girl who had known war danger seen death near had obtained evidently the devotion of that man the occurrences of the afternoon had been strange in themselves but what struck her artistic sense was the vigour of their presentation they outlined themselves before her memory with the clear simplicity of some immortal legend they were mysterious but she felt certain they were absolutely true they embodied artless and masterful feelings such no doubt as had swayed mankind in the simplicity of its youth she envied for a moment the lot of that humble and obscure sister nothing stood between that girl and the truth of her sensations she could be sincerely courageous and tender and passionate andwellferocious why not ferocious she could know the truth of terrorand of affection absolutely without artificial trammels without the pain of restraint  thinking of what such life could be mrs travers felt invaded by that inexplicable exaltation which the consciousness of their physical capacities so often gives to intellectual beings she glowed with a sudden persuasion that she also could be equal to such an existence and her heart was dilated with a momentary longing to know the naked truth of things the naked truth of life and passion buried under the growth of centuries  she glowed and suddenly she quivered with the shock of coming to herself as if she had fallen down from a star there was a sound of rippling water and a shapeless mass glided out of the dark void she confronted a voice below her feet said  i made out your shapeon the sky a cry of surprise expired on her lips and she could only peer downward lingard alone in the brigs dinghy with another stroke sent the light boat nearly under the yachts counter laid his sculls in and rose from the thwart his head and shoulders loomed up alongside and he had the appearance of standing upon the sea involuntarily mrs travers made a movement of retreat  stop he said anxiously dont speak loud no one must know where do your people think themselves i wonder in a dock at home and you  my husband is not on board she interrupted hurriedly  i know  she bent a little more over the rail  then you are having us watched why  somebody must watch your people keep such a good lookoutdont they yes ever since dark one of my boats has been dodging astern here in the deep water i swore to myself i would never see one of you never speak to one of you here that i would be dumb blind deaf andhere i am  mrs travers alarm and mistrust were replaced by an immense curiosity burning yet quiet too as if before the inevitable work of destiny she looked downward at lingard his head was bared and with one hand upon the ships side he seemed to be thinking deeply  because you had something more to tell us mrs travers suggested gently  yes he said in a low tone and without moving in the least  will you come on board and wait she asked  who i he lifted his head so quickly as to startle her i have nothing to say to him and ill never put my foot on board this craft ive been told to go thats enough  he is accustomed to be addressed deferentially she said after a pause and you  who is he asked lingard simply  these three words seemed to her to scatter her past in the airlike smoke they robbed all the multitude of mankind of every vestige of importance she was amazed to find that on this night in this place there could be no adequate answer to the searching naiveness of that question  i didnt ask for much lingard began again did i only that you all should come on board my brig for five days thats all    do i look like a liar there are things i could not tell him i couldnt explaini couldntnot to himto no manto no man in the world  his voice dropped  not to myself he ended as if in a dream  we have remained unmolested so long here began mrs travers a little unsteadily that it makes it very difficult to believe in danger now we saw no one all these days except those two people who came for you if you may not explain  of course you cant be expected to see through a wall broke in lingard this coasts like a wall but i know whats on the other side    a yacht here of all things that float when i set eyes on her i could fancy she hadnt been more than an hour from home nothing but the look of her spars made me think of old times and then the faces of the chaps on board i seemed to know them all it was like home coming to me when i wasnt thinking of it and i hated the sight of you all  if we are exposed to any peril she said after a pause during which she tried to penetrate the secret of passion hidden behind that mans words it need not affect you our other boat is gone to the straits and effective help is sure to come very soon  affect me is that precious watchman of yours coming aft i dont want anybody to know i came here again begging even of you is he coming aft    listen ive stopped your other boat  his head and shoulders disappeared as though he had dived into a denser layer of obscurity floating on the water the watchman who had the intention to stretch himself in one of the deck chairs catching sight of the owners wife walked straight to the lamp that hung under the ridge pole of the awning and after fumbling with it for a time went away forward with an indolent gait  you dared mrs travers whispered down in an intense tone and directly lingards head emerged again below her with an upturned face  it was dareor give up the help from the straits would have been too late anyhow if i hadnt the power to keep you safe and if i had the power i could see you through italone i expected to find a reasonable man to talk to i ought to have known better you come from too far to understand these things well i dared ive sent after your other boat a fellow who with me at his back would try to stop the governor of the straits himself he will do it perhaps its done already you have nothing to hope for but i am here you said you believed i meant well  yes she murmured  thats why i thought i would tell you everything i had to begin with this business about the boat and what do you think of me now ive cut you off from the rest of the earth you people would disappear like a stone in the water you left one foreign port for another whos there to trouble about what became of you who would know who could guess it would be months before they began to stir  i understand she said steadily we are helpless  and alone he added  after a pause she said in a deliberate restrained voice  what does this mean plunder captivity  it would have meant death if i hadnt been here he answered  but you have the power to  why do you think you are alive yet he cried jorgenson has been arguing with them on shore he went on more calmly with a swing of his arm toward where the night seemed darkest do you think he would have kept them back if they hadnt expected me every day his words would have been nothing without my fist  she heard a dull blow struck on the side of the yacht and concealed in the same darkness that wrapped the unconcern of the earth and sea the fury and the pain of hearts she smiled above his head fascinated by the simplicity of images and expressions  lingard made a brusque movement the lively little boat being unsteady under his feet and she spoke slowly absently as if her thought had been lost in the vagueness of her sensations  and thisthisjorgenson you said who is he  a man he answered a man like myself  like yourself  just like myself he said with strange reluctance as if admitting a painful truth more sense perhaps but less luck though since your yacht has turned up here i begin to think that my luck is nothing much to boast of either  is our presence here so fatal  it may be death to some it may be worse than death to me and it rests with you in a way think of that i can never find such another chance again but thats nothing a man who has saved my life once and that i passed my word to would think i had thrown him over but thats nothing listen as true as i stand here in my boat talking to you i believe the girl would die of grief  you love her she said softly  like my own daughter he cried low  mrs travers said oh faintly and for a moment there was a silence then he began again  look here when i was a boy in a trawler and looked at you yacht people in the channel ports you were as strange to me as the malays here are strange to you i left home sixteen years ago and fought my way all round the earth i had the time to forget where i began what are you to me against these two if i was to die here on the spot would you care no one would care at home no one in the whole worldbut these two  what can i do she asked and waited leaning over  he seemed to reflect then lifting his head spoke gently  do you understand the danger you are in are you afraid  i understand the expression you used of course understand the danger she went on nodecidedly no andhonestlyi am not afraid  arent you he said in a disappointed voice perhaps you dont believe me i believed you though when you said you were sure i meant well i trusted you enough to come here asking for your helptelling you what no one knows  you mistake me she said with impulsive earnestness this is so extraordinarily unusualsuddenoutside my experience  aye he murmured what would you know of danger and trouble you but perhaps by thinking it over  you want me to think myself into a fright mrs travers laughed lightly and in the gloom of his thought this flash of joyous sound was incongruous and almost terrible next moment the night appeared brilliant as day warm as sunshine but when she ceased the returning darkness gave him pain as if it had struck heavily against his breast i dont think i could do that she finished in a serious tone  couldnt you he hesitated perplexed things are bad enough to make it no shame i tell you he said rapidly and i am not a timid man i may not be able to do much if you people dont help me  you want me to pretend i am alarmed she asked quickly  aye to pretendas well you may its a lot to ask of youwho perhaps never had to makebelieve a thing in your lifeisnt it  it is she said after a time  the unexpected bitterness of her tone struck lingard with dismay  dont be offended he entreated ive got to plan a way out of this mess its no play either could you pretend  perhaps if i tried very hard but to what end  you must all shift aboard the brig he began speaking quickly and then we may get over this trouble without coming to blows now if you were to say that you wish it that you feel unsafe in the yachtdont you see  i see she pronounced thoughtfully  the brig is small but the cuddy is fit for a lady went on lingard with animation  has it not already sheltered a princess she commented coolly  and i shall not intrude  this is an inducement  nobody will dare to intrude you neednt even see me  this is almost decisive only  i know my place  only i might not have the influence she finished  that i can not believe he said roughly the long and the short of it is you dont trust me because you think that only people of your own condition speak the truth always  evidently she murmured  you say to yourselfheres a fellow deep in with pirates thieves niggers  to be sure  a man i never saw the like before went on lingard headlong aruffian  he checked himself full of confusion after a time he heard her saying calmly  you are like other men in this that you get angry when you can not have your way at once  i angry he exclaimed in deadened voice you do not understand i am thinking of you alsoit is hard on me  i mistrust not you but my own power you have produced an unfortunate impression on mr travers  unfortunate impression he treated me as if i had been a longshore loafer never mind that he is your husband fear in those you care for is hard to bear for any man and so he  what machiavellism  eh what did you say  i only wondered where you had observed that on the sea  observed what he said absently then pursuing his ideaone word from you ought to be enough  you think so  i am sure of it why even i myself  of course she interrupted but dont you think that after parting with you on suchsuchinimical terms there would be a difficulty in resuming relations  a man like me would do anything for moneydont you see  after a pause she asked  and would you care for that argument to be used  as long as you know better  his voice vibratedshe drew back disturbed as if unexpectedly he had touched her  what can there be at stake she began wonderingly  a kingdom said lingard  mrs travers leaned far over the rail staring and their faces one above the other came very close together  not for yourself she whispered  he felt the touch of her breath on his forehead and remained still for a moment perfectly still as if he did not intend to move or speak any more  those things he began suddenly come in your way when you dont think and they get all round you before you know what you mean to do when i went into that bay in new guinea i never guessed where that course would take me to i could tell you a story you would understand you you  he stammered hesitated and suddenly spoke liberating the visions of two years into the night where mrs travers could follow them as if outlined in words of fire    vii  his tale was as startling as the discovery of a new world she was being taken along the boundary of an exciting existence and she looked into it through the guileless enthusiasm of the narrator the heroic quality of the feelings concealed what was disproportionate and absurd in that gratitude in that friendship in that inexplicable devotion the headlong fierceness of purpose invested his obscure design of conquest with the proportions of a great enterprise it was clear that no vision of a subjugated world could have been more inspiring to the most famous adventurer of history  from time to time he interrupted himself to ask confidently as if he had been speaking to an old friend what would you have done and hurried on without pausing for approval  it struck her that there was a great passion in all this the beauty of an implanted faculty of affection that had found itself its immediate need of an object and the way of expansion a tenderness expressed violently a tenderness that could only be satisfied by backing human beings against their own destiny perhaps her hatred of convention trammelling the frankness of her own impulses had rendered her more alert to perceive what is intrinsically great and profound within the forms of human folly so simple and so infinitely varied according to the region of the earth and to the moment of time  what of it that the narrator was only a roving seaman the kingdom of the jungle the men of the forest the lives obscure that simple soul was possessed by the greatness of the idea there was nothing sordid in its flaming impulses when she once understood that the story appealed to the audacity of her thoughts and she became so charmed with what she heard that she forgot where she was she forgot that she was personally close to that tale which she saw detached far away from her truth or fiction presented in picturesque speech real only by the response of her emotion  lingard paused in the cessation of the impassioned murmur she began to reflect and at first it was only an oppressive notion of there being some significance that really mattered in this mans story that mattered to her for the first time the shadow of danger and death crossed her mind was that the significance suddenly in a flash of acute discernment she saw herself involved helplessly in that story as one is involved in a natural cataclysm  he was speaking again he had not been silent more than a minute it seemed to mrs travers that years had elapsed so different now was the effect of his words her mind was agitated as if his coming to speak and confide in her had been a tremendous occurrence it was a fact of her own existence it was part of the story also this was the disturbing thought she heard him pronounce several names belarab daman tengga ningrat these belonged now to her life and she was appalled to find she was unable to connect these names with any human appearance they stood out alone as if written on the night they took on a symbolic shape they imposed themselves upon her senses she whispered as if pondering belarab daman ningrat and these barbarous sounds seemed to possess an exceptional energy a fatal aspect the savour of madness  not one of them but has a heavy score to settle with the whites whats that to me i had somehow to get men who would fight i risked my life to get that lot i made them promises which i shall keepor can you see now why i dared to stop your boat i am in so deep that i care for no sir john in the world when i look at the work ahead i care for nothing i gave you one chanceone good chance that i had to do no i suppose i didnt look enough of a gentleman yes yes thats it yet i know what a gentleman is i lived with them for years i chummed with themyeson goldfields and in other places where a man has got to show the stuff thats in him some of them write from home to me heresuch as you see me because inever mind and i know what a gentleman would do come wouldnt he treat a stranger fairly wouldnt he remember that no man is a liar till you prove him so wouldnt he keep his word wherever given well i am going to do that not a hair of your head shall be touched as long as i live  she had regained much of her composure but at these words she felt that staggering sense of utter insecurity which is given one by the first tremor of an earthquake it was followed by an expectant stillness of sensations she remained silent he thought she did not believe him  come what on earth do you think brought me heretototalk like this to you there was hassimrajah tulla i should saywho was asking me this afternoon what will you do now with these your people i believe he thinks yet i fetched you here for some reason you cant tell what crooked notion they will get into their thick heads its enough to make one swear he swore my people are you how much sayhow much youre no more mine than i am yours would any of you fine folks at home face black ruin to save a fishing smacks crew from getting drowned  notwithstanding that sense of insecurity which lingered faintly in her mind she had no image of death before her she felt intensely alive she felt alive in a flush of strength with an impression of novelty as though life had been the gift of this very moment the danger hidden in the night gave no sign to awaken her terror but the workings of a human soul simple and violent were laid bare before her and had the disturbing charm of an unheardof experience she was listening to a man who concealed nothing she said interrogatively  and yet you have come  yes he answered to youand for you only  the flood tide running strong over the banks made a placid trickling sound about the yachts rudder  i would not be saved alone  then you must bring them over yourself he said in a sombre tone theres the brig you have memy menmy guns you know what to do  i will try she said  very well i am sorry for the poor devils forward there if you fail but of course you wont watch that light on the brig i had it hoisted on purpose the trouble may be nearer than we think two of my boats are gone scouting and if the news they bring me is bad the light will be lowered think what that means and ive told you what i have told nobody think of my feelings also i told you because ibecause i had to  he gave a shove against the yachts side and glided away from under her eyes a rippling sound died out  she walked away from the rail the lamp and the skylights shone faintly along the dark stretch of the decks this evening was like the lastlike all the evenings before  is all this i have heard possible she asked herself nobut it is true  she sat down in a deck chair to think and found she could only remember she jumped up she was sure somebody was hailing the yacht faintly was that man hailing she listened and hearing nothing was annoyed with herself for being haunted by a voice  he said he could trust me now what is this danger what is danger she meditated  footsteps were coming from forward the figure of the watchman flitted vaguely over the gangway he was whistling softly and vanished hollow sounds in the boat were succeeded by a splash of oars the night swallowed these slight noises mrs travers sat down again and found herself much calmer  she had the faculty of being able to think her own thoughtsand the courage she could take no action of any kind till her husbands return lingards warnings were not what had impressed her most this man had presented his innermost self unclothed by any subterfuge there were in plain sight his desires his perplexities affections doubts his violence his folly and the existence they made up was lawless but not vile she had too much elevation of mind to look upon him from any other but a strictly human standpoint if he trusted her how strange why should he was he wrong she accepted the trust with scrupulous fairness and when it dawned upon her that of all the men in the world this unquestionably was the one she knew best she had a moment of wonder followed by an impression of profound sadness it seemed an unfortunate matter that concerned her alone  her thought was suspended while she listened attentively for the return of the yachts boat she was dismayed at the task before her not a sound broke the stillness and she felt as if she were lost in empty space then suddenly someone amidships yawned immensely and said oh dear oh dear a voice asked aint they back yet a negative grunt answered  mrs travers found that lingard was touching because he could be understood how simple was life she reflected she was frank with herself she considered him apart from social organization she discovered he had no place in it how delightful here was a human being and the naked truth of things was not so very far from her notwithstanding the growth of centuries then it occurred to her that this man by his action stripped her at once of her position of her wealth of her rank of her past i am helpless what remains she asked herself nothing anybody there might have suggested your presence she was too artificial yet to think of her beauty and yet the power of personality is part of the naked truth of things  she looked over her shoulder and saw the light at the brigs foreyardarm burning with a strong calm flame in the dust of starlight suspended above the coast she heard the heavy bump as of a boat run headlong against the ladder they were back she rose in sudden and extreme agitation what should she say how much how to begin why say anything it would be absurd like talking seriously about a dream she would not dare in a moment she was driven into a state of mind bordering on distraction she heard somebody run up the gangway steps with the idea of gaining time she walked rapidly aft to the taffrail the light of the brig faced her without a flicker enormous amongst the suns scattered in the immensity of the night  she fixed her eyes on it she thought i shant tell him anything impossible no i shall tell everything she expected every moment to hear her husbands voice and the suspense was intolerable because she felt that then she must decide somebody on deck was babbling excitedly she devoutly hoped dalcacer would speak first and thus put off the fatal moment a voice said roughly whats that and in the midst of her distress she recognized carters voice having noticed that young man who was of a different stamp from the rest of the crew she came to the conclusion that the matter could be related jocularly orwhy not pretend fear at that moment the brigs yardarm light she was looking at trembled distinctly and she was dumfounded as if she had seen a commotion in the firmament with her lips open for a cry she saw it fall straight down several feet flicker and go out all perplexity passed from her mind this first fact of the danger gave her a thrill of quite a new emotion something had to be done at once for some remote reason she felt ashamed of her hesitations  she moved swiftly forward and under the lamp came face to face with carter who was coming aft both stopped staring the light fell on their faces and both were struck by each others expression the four eyes shone wide  you have seen she asked beginning to tremble  how do you know he said at the same time evidently surprised  suddenly she saw that everybody was on deck  the light is down she stammered  the gentlemen are lost said carter then he perceived she did not seem to understand kidnapped off the sandbank he continued looking at her fixedly to see how she would take it she seemed calm kidnapped like a pair of lambs not a squeak he burst out with indignation but the sandbank is long and they might have been at the other end you were on deck maam he asked  yes she murmured in the chair here  we were all down below i had to rest a little when i came up the watchman was asleep he swears he wasnt but i know better nobody heard any noise unless you did but perhaps you were asleep he asked deferentially  yesnoi must have been she said faintly    viii  lingards soul was exalted by his talk with mrs travers by the strain of incertitude and by extreme fatigue on returning on board he asked after hassim and was told that the rajah and his sister had gone off in their canoe promising to return before midnight the boats sent to scout between the islets north and south of the anchorage had not come back yet he went into his cabin and throwing himself on the couch closed his eyes thinking i must sleep or i shall go mad  at times he felt an unshaken confidence in mrs traversthen he remembered her face next moment the face would fade he would make an effort to hold on to the image failand then become convinced without the shadow of a doubt that he was utterly lost unless he let all these people be wiped off the face of the earth  they all heard that man order me out of his ship he thought and thereupon for a second or so he contemplated without flinching the lurid image of a massacre and yet i had to tell her that not a hair of her head shall be touched not a hair  and irrationally at the recollection of these words there seemed to be no trouble of any kind left in the world now and then however there were black instants when from sheer weariness he thought of nothing at all and during one of these he fell asleep losing the consciousness of external things as suddenly as if he had been felled by a blow on the head  when he sat up almost before he was properly awake his first alarmed conviction was that he had slept the night through there was a light in the cuddy and through the open door of his cabin he saw distinctly mrs travers pass out of view across the lighted space  they did come on board after all he thoughthow is it i havent been called  he darted into the cuddy nobody looking up at the clock in the skylight he was vexed to see it had stopped till his ear caught the faint beat of the mechanism it was going then he could not have been asleep more than ten minutes he had not been on board more than twenty  so it was only a deception he had seen no one and yet he remembered the turn of the head the line of the neck the colour of the hair the movement of the passing figure he returned spiritlessly to his stateroom muttering no more sleep for me tonight and came out directly holding a few sheets of paper covered with a high angular handwriting  this was jorgensons letter written three days before and entrusted to hassim lingard had read it already twice but he turned up the lamp a little higher and sat down to read it again on the red shield above his head the gilt sheaf of thunderbolts darting between the initials of his name seemed to be aimed straight at the nape of his neck as he sat with bared elbows spread on the table poring over the crumpled sheets the letter began  hassim and immada are going out tonight to look for you you are behind your time and every passing day makes things worse  ten days ago three of belarabs men who had been collecting turtles eggs on the islets came flying back with a story of a ship stranded on the outer mudflats belarab at once forbade any boat from leaving the lagoon so far good there was a great excitement in the village i judge it must be a schoonerprobably some fool of a trader however you will know all about her when you read this you may say i might have pulled out to sea to have a look for myself but besides belarabs orders to the contrary which i would attend to for the sake of example all you are worth in this world tom is here in the emma under my feet and i would not leave my charge even for half a day hassim attended the council held every evening in the shed outside belarabs stockade that holy man ningrat was for looting that vessel hassim reproved him saying that the vessel probably was sent by you because no white men were known to come inside the shoals belarab backed up hassim ningrat was very angry and reproached belarab for keeping him ningrat short of opium to smoke he began by calling him o son and ended by shouting o you worse than an unbeliever there was a hullabaloo the followers of tengga were ready to interfere and you know how it is between tengga and belarab tengga always wanted to oust belarab and his chances were getting pretty good before you turned up and armed belarabs bodyguard with muskets however hassim stopped that row and no one was hurt that time next day which was friday ningrat after reading the prayers in the mosque talked to the people outside he bleated and capered like an old goat prophesying misfortune ruin and extermination if these whites were allowed to get away he is mad but then they think him a saint and he had been fighting the dutch for years in his young days six of belarabs guard marched down the village street carrying muskets at full cock and the crowd cleared out ningrat was spirited away by tenggas men into their masters stockade if it was not for the fear of you turning up any moment there would have been a partyfight that evening i think it is a pity tengga is not chief of the land instead of belarab a brave and foresighted man however treacherous at heart can always be trusted to a certain extent one can never get anything clear from belarab peace peace you know his fad and this fad makes him act silly the peace racket will get him into a row it may cost him his life in the end however tengga does not feel himself strong enough yet to act with his own followers only and belarab has on my advice disarmed all villagers his men went into the houses and took away by force all the firearms and as many spears as they could lay hands on the women screamed abuse of course but there was no resistance a few men were seen clearing out into the forest with their arms note this for it means there is another power beside belarabs in the village the growing power of tengga  one morningfour days agoi went to see tengga i found him by the shore trimming a plank with a small hatchet while a slave held an umbrella over his head he is amusing himself in building a boat just now he threw his hatchet down to meet me and led me by the hand to a shady spot he told me frankly he had sent out two good swimmers to observe the stranded vessel these men stole down the creek in a canoe and when on the sea coast swam from sandbank to sandbank until they approached unobservedi thinkto about fifty yards from that schooner what can that craft be i cant make it out the men reported there were three chiefs on board one with a glittering eye one a lean man in white and another without any hair on the face and dressed in a different style could it be a woman i dont know what to think i wish you were here after a lot of chatter tengga said six years ago i was ruler of a country and the dutch drove me out the country was small but nothing is too small for them to take they pretended to give it back to my nephewmay he burn i ran away or they would have killed me i am nothing herebut i remember these white people out there can not run away and they are very few there is perhaps a little to loot i would give it to my men who followed me in my calamity because i am their chief and my father was the chief of their fathers i pointed out the imprudence of this he said the dead do not show the way to this i remarked that the ignorant do not give information tengga kept quiet for a while then said we must not touch them because their skin is like yours and to kill them would be wrong but at the bidding of you whites we may go and fight with people of our own skin and our own faithand that is good i have promised to tuan lingard twenty men and a prau to make war in wajo the men are good and look at the prau it is swift and strong i must say tom the prau is the best craft of the kind i have ever seen i said you paid him well for the help and i also would pay says he if you let me have a few guns and a little powder for my men you and i shall share the loot of that ship outside and tuan lingard will not know it is only a little game you have plenty of guns and powder under your care he meant in the emma on that i spoke out pretty straight and we got rather warm until at last he gave me to understand that as he had about forty followers of his own and i had only nine of hassims chaps to defend the emma with he could very well go for me and get the lot and then says he i would be so strong that everybody would be on my side i discovered in the course of further talk that there is a notion amongst many people that you have come to grief in some way and wont show up here any more after this i saw the position was serious and i was in a hurry to get back to the emma but pretending i did not care i smiled and thanked tengga for giving me warning of his intentions about me and the emma at this he nearly choked himself with his betel quid and fixing me with his little eyes muttered even a lizard will give a fly the time to say its prayers i turned my back on him and was very thankful to get beyond the throw of a spear i havent been out of the emma since    ix  the letter went on to enlarge on the intrigues of tengga the wavering conduct of belarab and the state of the public mind it noted every gust of opinion and every event with an earnestness of belief in their importance befitting the chronicle of a crisis in the history of an empire the shade of jorgenson had indeed stepped back into the life of men the old adventurer looked on with a perfect understanding of the value of trifles using his eyes for that other man whose conscience would have the task to unravel the tangle lingard lived through those days in the settlement and was thankful to jorgenson only as he lived not from day to day but from sentence to sentence of the writing there was an effect of bewildering rapidity in the succession of events that made him grunt with surprise sometimes or growlwhat to himself angrily and turn back several lines or a whole page more than once toward the end he had a heavy frown of perplexity and fidgeted as he read  and i began to think i could keep things quiet till you came or those wretched white people got their schooner off when sherif daman arrived from the north on the very day he was expected with two illanun praus he looks like an arab it was very evident to me he can wind the two illanun pangerans round his little finger the two praus are large and armed they came up the creek flags and streamers flying beating drums and gongs and entered the lagoon with their decks full of armed men brandishing twohanded swords and sounding the war cry it is a fine force for you only belarab who is a perverse devil would not receive sherif daman at once so daman went to see tengga who detained him a very long time leaving tengga he came on board the emma and i could see directly there was something up  he began by asking me for the ammunition and weapons they are to get from you saying he was anxious to sail at once toward wajo since it was agreed he was to precede you by a few days i replied that that was true enough but that i could not think of giving him the powder and muskets till you came he began to talk about you and hinted that perhaps you will never come and no matter says he here is rajah hassim and the lady immada and we would fight for them if no white man was left in the world only we must have something to fight with he pretended then to forget me altogether and talked with hassim while i sat listening he began to boast how well he got along the bruni coast no illanun prau had passed down that coast for years  immada wanted me to give the arms he was asking for the girl is beside herself with fear of something happening that would put a stopper on the wajo expedition she has set her mind on getting her country back hassim is very reserved but he is very anxious too daman got nothing from me and that very evening the praus were ordered by belarab to leave the lagoon he does not trust the illanunsand small blame to him sherif daman went like a lamb he has no powder for his guns as the praus passed by the emma he shouted to me he was going to wait for you outside the creek tengga has given him a man who would show him the place all this looks very queer to me  look out outside then the praus are dodging amongst the islets daman visits tengga tengga called on me as a good friend to try and persuade me to give daman the arms and gunpowder he is so anxious to get somehow or other they tried to get around belarab who came to see me last night and hinted i had better do so he is anxious for these illanuns to leave the neighbourhood he thinks that if they loot the schooner they will be off at once thats all he wants now immada has been to see belarabs women and stopped two nights in the stockade belarabs youngest wifehe got married six weeks agois on the side of tenggas party because she thinks belarab would get a share of the loot and she got into her silly head there are jewels and silks in that schooner what between tengga worrying him outside and the women worrying him at home belarab had such a lively time of it that he concluded he would go to pray at his fathers tomb so for the last two days he has been away camping in that unhealthy place when he comes back he will be down with fever as sure as fate and then he will be no good for anything tengga lights up smoky fires often some signal to daman i go ashore with hassims men and put them out this is risking a fight every timefor tenggas men look very black at us i dont know what the next move may be hassims as true as steel immada is very unhappy they will tell you many details i have no time to write  the last page fluttered on the table out of lingards fingers he sat very still for a moment looking straight before him then went on deck  our boats back yet he asked shaw whom he saw prowling on the quarterdeck  no sir i wish they were i am waiting for them to go and turn in answered the mate in an aggrieved manner  lower that lantern forward there cried lingard suddenly in malay  this trade isnt fit for a decent man muttered shaw to himself and he moved away to lean on the rail looking moodily to seaward after a while there seems to be commotion on board that yacht he said i see a lot of lights moving about her decks anything wrong do you think sir  no i know what it is said lingard in a tone of elation she has done it he thought  he returned to the cabin put away jorgensons letter and pulled out the drawer of the table it was full of cartridges he took a musket down loaded it then took another and another he hammered at the waddings with fierce joyousness the ramrods rang and jumped it seemed to him he was doing his share of some work in which that woman was playing her part faithfully she has done it he repeated mentally she will sit in the cuddy she will sleep in my berth well im not ashamed of the brig by heavensno i shall keep away never come near them as ive promised now theres nothing more to say ive told her everything at once theres nothing more  he felt a heaviness in his burning breast in all his limbs as if the blood in his veins had become molten lead  i shall get the yacht off three four daysno a week  he found he couldnt do it under a week it occurred to him he would see her every day till the yacht was afloat no he wouldnt intrude but he was master and owner of the brig after all he didnt mean to skulk like a whipped cur about his own decks  itll be ten days before the schooner is ready ill take every scrap of ballast out of her ill strip herill take her lower masts out of her by heavens ill make sure then another week to fit outandgoodbye wish i had never seen them goodbyeforever homes the place for them not for me on another coast she would not have listened ah but she is a womanevery inch of her i shall shake hands yes i shall take her handjust before she goes why the devil not i am master here after allin this brigas good as any oneby heavens better than any onebetter than any one on earth  he heard shaw walk smartly forward above his head hailing  whats thata boat  a voice answered indistinctly  one of my boats is back thought lingard news about daman perhaps i dont care if he kicks i wish he would i would soon show her i can fight as well as i can handle the brig two praus only two praus i wouldnt mind if there were twenty i would sweep em off the seai would blow em out of the wateri would make the brig walk over them now id say to her you who are not afraid look how its done  he felt light he had the sensation of being whirled high in the midst of an uproar and as powerless as a feather in a hurricane he shuddered profoundly his arms hung down and he stood before the table staring like a man overcome by some fatal intelligence  shaw going into the waist to receive what he thought was one of the brigs boats came against carter making his way aft hurriedly  hullo is it you again he said swiftly barring the way  i come from the yacht began carter with some impatience  where else could you come from said shaw and what might you want now  i want to see your skipper  well you cant declared shaw viciously hes turned in for the night  he expects me said carter stamping his foot ive got to tell him what happened  dont you fret yourself young man said shaw in a superior manner he knows all about it  they stood suddenly silent in the dark carter seemed at a loss what to do shaw though surprised by it enjoyed the effect he had produced  damn me if i did not think so murmured carter to himself then drawling coolly askedand perhaps you know too  what do you think think i am a dummy here i aint mate of this brig for nothing  no you are not said carter with a certain bitterness of tone people do all kinds of queer things for a living and i am not particular myself but i would think twice before taking your billet  what what do you insinuate my billet you aint fit for it you yachtswabbing brassbuttoned imposter  whats this any of our boats back asked lingard from the poop let the seacannie in charge come to me at once  theres only a message from the yacht began shaw deliberately  yacht get the deck lamps along here in the waist see the ladder lowered bear a hand serang mr shaw burn the flare up aft two of them give light to the yachts boats that will be coming alongside steward wheres that steward turn him out then  bare feet began to patter all round carter shadows glided swiftly  are these flares coming wheres the quartermaster on duty shouted lingard in english and malay this way come here put it on a rocket stickcant you hold over the sidethus stand by with the lines for the boats forward there mr shawwe want more light  aye aye sir called out shaw but he did not move as if dazed by the vehemence of his commander  thats what we want muttered carter under his breath imposter what do you call yourself he said half aloud to shaw  the ruddy glare of the flares disclosed lingard from head to foot standing at the break of the poop his head was bare his face crudely lighted had a fierce and changing expression in the sway of flames  what can be his game thought carter impressed by the powerful and wild aspect of that figure hes changed somehow since i saw him first he reflected it struck him the change was serious not exactly for the worse perhapsand yet    lingard smiled at him from the poop  carter went up the steps and without pausing informed him of what had happened  mrs travers told me to go to you at once shes very upset as you may guess he drawled looking lingard hard in the face lingard knitted his eyebrows the hands too are scared carter went on they fancy the savages or whatever they may be who stole the owner are going to board the yacht every minute i dont think so myself but  quite rightmost unlikely muttered lingard  aye i daresay you know all about it continued carter coolly the men are startled and no mistake but i cant blame them very much there isnt enough even of carving knives aboard to go round one old signal gun a poor show for better men than they  theres no mistake i suppose about this affair asked lingard  well unless the gentlemen are having a lark with us at hide and seek the man says he waited ten minutes at the point then pulled slowly along the bank looking out expecting to see them walking back he made the trunk of a tree apparently stranded on the sand and as he was sculling past he says a man jumped up from behind that log flung a stick at him and went off running he backed water at once and began to shout are you there sir no one answered he could hear the bushes rustle and some strange noises like whisperings it was very dark after calling out several times and waiting on his oars he got frightened and pulled back to the yacht that is clear enough the only doubt in my mind is if they are alive or not i didnt let on to mrs travers thats a kind of thing you keep to yourself of course  i dont think they are dead said lingard slowly and as if thinking of something else  oh if you say so its all right said carter with deliberation  what asked lingard absently fling a stick did they fling a spear  thats it assented carter but i didnt say anything i only wondered if the same kind of stick hadnt been flung at the owner thats all but i suppose you know your business best captain  lingard grasping his whole beard reflected profoundly erect and with bowed head in the glare of the flares  i suppose you think its my doing he asked sharply without looking up  carter surveyed him with a candidly curious gaze well captain mrs travers did let on a bit to me about our chiefofficers boat youve stopped it havent you how she got to know god only knows she was sorry she spoke too but it wasnt so much of news to me as she thought i can put two and two together sometimes those rockets last night eh i wished i had bitten my tongue out before i told you about our first gig but i was taken unawares wasnt i i put it to you wasnt i and so i told her when she asked me what passed between you and me on board this brig not twentyfour hours ago things look different now all of a sudden enough to scare a woman but she is the best man of them all on board the others are fairly off the chump because its a bit dark and something has happened they aint used to but she has something on her mind i cant make her out he paused wriggled his shoulders slightlyno more than i can make you out he added  thats your trouble is it said lingard slowly  aye captain is it all clear to you stopping boats kidnapping gentlemen thats fun in a way onlyi am a youngster to youbut is it all clear to you old robinson wasnt particular you know and he  clearer than daylight cried lingard hotly i cant give up  he checked himself carter waited the flare bearers stood rigid turning their faces away from the flame and in the play of gleams at its foot the mast near by like a lofty column ascended in the great darkness a lot of ropes ran up slanting into a dark void and were lost to sight but high aloft a brace block gleamed white the end of a yardarm could be seen suspended in the air and as if glowing with its own light the sky had clouded over the brig without a breath of wind  give up repeated carter with an uneasy shuffle of feet  nobody finished lingard i cant its as clear as daylight i cant no nothing  he stared straight out afar and after looking at him carter felt moved by a bit of youthful intuition to murmur thats bad in a tone that almost in spite of himself hinted at the dawning of a befogged compassion  he had a sense of confusion within him the sense of mystery without he had never experienced anything like it all the time when serving with old robinson in the lyemoon and yet he had seen and taken part in some queer doings that were not clear to him at the time they were secret but they suggested something comprehensible this affair did not it had somehow a subtlety that affected him he was uneasy as if there had been a breath of magic on events and men giving to this complication of a yachting voyage a significance impossible to perceive but felt in the words in the gestures in the events which made them all strangely obscurely startling  he was not one who could keep track of his sensations and besides he had not the leisure he had to answer lingards questions about the people of the yacht no he couldnt say mrs travers was what you may call frightened she seemed to have something in her mind oh yes the chaps were in a funk would they fight anybody would fight when driven to it funk or no funk that was his experience naturally one liked to have something better than a handspike to do it with stillin the pause carter seemed to weigh with composure the chances of men with handspikes  what do you want to fight us for he asked suddenly  lingard started  i dont he said i wouldnt be asking you  theres no saying what you would do captain replied carter it isnt twentyfour hours since you wanted to shoot me  i only said i would rather than let you go raising trouble for me explained lingard  one night isnt like another mumbled carter but how am i to know it seems to me you are making trouble for yourself as fast as you can  well supposing i am said lingard with sudden gloominess would your men fight if i armed them properly  whatfor you or for themselves asked carter  for the woman burst out lingard you forget theres a woman on board i dont care that for their carcases  carter pondered conscientiously  not tonight he said at last theres one or two good men amongst them but the rest are struck all of a heap not tonight give them time to get steady a bit if you want them to fight  he gave facts and opinions with a mixture of loyalty and mistrust his own state puzzled him exceedingly he couldnt make out anything he did not know what to believe and yet he had an impulsive desire an inspired desire to help the man at times it appeared a necessityat others policy between whiles a great folly which perhaps did not matter because he suspected himself of being helpless anyway then he had moments of anger in those moments he would feel in his pocket the butt of a loaded pistol he had provided himself with the weapon when directed by mrs travers to go on board the brig  if he wants to interfere with me ill let drive at him and take my chance of getting away he had explained hurriedly  he remembered how startled mrs travers looked of course a woman like thatnot used to hear such talk therefore it was no use listening to her except for good manners sake once bit twice shy he had no mind to be kidnapped not he nor bullied either  i cant let him nab me too you will want me now mrs travers he had said and i promise you not to fire off the old thing unless he jolly well forces me to  he was youthfully wise in his resolution not to give way to her entreaties though her extraordinary agitation did stagger him for a moment when the boat was already on its way to the brig he remembered her calling out after him  you must not you dont understand  her voice coming faintly in the darkness moved him it resembled so much a cry of distress  give way boys give way he urged his men  he was wise resolute and he was also youthful enough to almost wish it should come to it and with foresight he even instructed the boats crew to keep the gig just abaft the main rigging of the brig  when you see me drop into her all of a sudden shove off and pull for dear life  somehow just then he was not so anxious for a shot but he held on with a determined mental grasp to his fine resolution lest it should slip away from him and perish in a sea of doubts  hadnt i better get back to the yacht he asked gently  getting no answer he went on with deliberation  mrs travers ordered me to say that no matter how this came about she is ready to trust you she is waiting for some kind of answer i suppose  ready to trust me repeated lingard his eyes lit up fiercely  every sway of flares tossed slightly to and fro the massy shadows of the main deck where here and there the figure of a man could be seen standing very still with a dusky face and glittering eyeballs  carter stole his hand warily into his breast pocket  well captain he said he was not going to be bullied let the owners wife trust whom she liked  have you got anything in writing for me there asked lingard advancing a pace exultingly  carter alert stepped back to keep his distance shaw stared from the side his rubicund cheeks quivered his round eyes seemed starting out of his head and his mouth was open as though he had been ready to choke with pentup curiosity amazement and indignation  no not in writing said carter steadily and low  lingard had the air of being awakened by a shout a heavy and darkening frown seemed to fall out of the night upon his forehead and swiftly passed into the night again and when it departed it left him so calm his glance so lucid his mien so composed that it was difficult to believe the mans heart had undergone within the last second the trial of humiliation and of danger he smiled sadly  well young man he asked with a kind of goodhumoured resignation what is it you have there a knife or a pistol  a pistol said carter are you surprised captain he spoke with heat because a sense of regret was stealing slowly within him as stealthily as irresistibly as the flowing tide who began these tricks he withdrew his hand empty and raised his voice you are up to something i cant make out youyou are not straight  the flares held on high streamed right up without swaying and in that instant of profound calm the shadows on the brigs deck became as still as the men  you think not said lingard thoughtfully  carter nodded he resented the turn of the incident and the growing impulse to surrender to that man  mrs travers trusts me though went on lingard with gentle triumph as if advancing an unanswerable argument  so she says grunted carter i warned her shes a baby theyre all as innocent as babies there and you know it and i know it ive heard of your kind you would dump the lot of us overboard if it served your turn thats what i think  and thats all  carter nodded slightly and looked away there was a silence lingards eyes travelled over the brig the lighted part of the vessel appeared in bright and wavering detail walled and canopied by the night he felt a light breath on his face the air was stirring but the shallows silent and lost in the darkness gave no sound of life  this stillness oppressed lingard the world of his endeavours and his hopes seemed dead seemed gone his desire existed homeless in the obscurity that had devoured his corner of the sea this stretch of the coast his certitude of success and here in the midst of what was the domain of his adventurous soul there was a lost youngster ready to shoot him on suspicion of some extravagant treachery came ready to shoot thats good too he was too weary to laughand perhaps too sad also the danger of the pistolshot which he believed realthe young are rashirritated him the night and the spot were full of contradictions it was impossible to say who in this shadowy warfare was to be an enemy and who were the allies so close were the contacts issuing from this complication of a yachting voyage that he seemed to have them all within his breast  shoot me he is quite up to that trickdamn him yet i would trust him sooner than any man in that yacht  such were his thoughts while he looked at carter who was biting his lips in the vexation of the long silence when they spoke again to each other they talked soberly with a sense of relief as if they had come into cool air from an overheated room and when carter dismissed went into his boat he had practically agreed to the line of action traced by lingard for the crew of the yacht he had agreed as if in implicit confidence it was one of the absurdities of the situation which had to be accepted and could never be understood  do i talk straight now had asked lingard  it seems straight enough assented carter with an air of reserve i will work with you so far anyhow  mrs travers trusts me remarked lingard again  by the lord harry cried carter giving way suddenly to some latent conviction i was warning her against you say captain you are a devil of a man how did you manage it  i trusted her said lingard  did you cried the amazed carter when how where  you know too much already retorted lingard quietly waste no time i will be after you  carter whistled low  theres a pair of you i cant make out he called back hurrying over the side  shaw took this opportunity to approach beginning with hesitation a word with you sir the mate went on to say he was a respectable man he delivered himself in a ringing unsteady voice he was married he had children he abhorred illegality the light played about his obese figure he had flung his mushroom hat on the deck he was not afraid to speak the truth the grey moustache stood out aggressively his glances were uneasy he pressed his hands to his stomach convulsively opened his thick short arms wide wished it to be understood he had been chiefofficer of home ships with a spotless character and he hoped quite up to his work he was a peaceable man none more disposed to stretch a point when it came to a difference with niggers of some kindthey had to be taught manners and reason and he was not averse at a pinch tobut here were white peoplegentlemen ladies not to speak of the crew he had never spoken to a superior like this before and this was prudence his conviction a point of view a point of principle a conscious superiority and a burst of resentment hoarded through years against all the successive and unsatisfactory captains of his existence there never had been such an opportunity to show he could not be put upon he had one of them on a string and he was going to lead him a dance there was courage too in it since he believed himself fallen unawares into the clutches of a particularly desperate man and beyond the reach of law  a certain small amount of calculation entered the audacity of his remonstrance perhapsit flashed upon himthe yachts gentry will hear i stood up for them this could conceivably be of advantage to a man who wanted a lift in the world owner of a yachtbadly scareda gentlemanmoney nothing to him thereupon shaw declared with heat that he couldnt be an accessory either after or before the fact those that never went homewho had nothing to go to perhapshe interjected hurriedly could do as they liked he couldnt he had a wife a family a little housepaid forwith difficulty he followed the sea respectably out and home all regular not vagabonding here and there chumming with the first nigger that came along and laying traps for his betters  one of the two flare bearers sighed at his elbow and shifted his weight to the other foot  these two had been keeping so perfectly still that the movement was as startling as if a statue had changed its pose after looking at the offender with cold malevolence shaw went on to speak of lawcourts of trials and of the liberty of the subject then he pointed out the certitude and the inconvenience of being found out affecting for the moment the dispassionateness of wisdom  there will be fifteen years in gaol at the end of this job for everybody said shaw and i have a boy that dont know his father yet fine things for him to learn when he grows up the innocent are dead certain here to catch it along with you the missus will break her heart unless she starves first home sold up  he saw a mysterious iniquity in a dangerous relation to himself and began to lose his head what he really wanted was to have his existence left intact for his own cherishing and pride it was a moral aspiration but in his alarm the native grossness of his nature came clattering out like a devil out of a trap he would blow the gaff split give away the whole show he would back up honest people kiss the book say what he thought let all the world know    and when he paused to draw breath all around him was silent and still before the impetus of that respectable passion his words were scattered like chaff driven by a gale and rushed headlong into the night of the shallows and in the great obscurity imperturbable it heard him say he washed his hands of everything  and the brig asked lingard suddenly  shaw was checked for a second the seaman in him instinctively admitted the claim of the ship  the brig the brig shes right enough he mumbled he had nothing to say against the brignot he she wasnt like the big ships he was used to but of her kind the best craft he ever    and with a brusque return upon himself he protested that he had been decoyed on board under false pretences it was as bad as being shanghaied when in liquor it wasupon his soul and into a craft next thing to a pirate that was the name for it or his own name was not shaw he said this glaring owlishly lingard perfectly still and mute bore the blows without a sign  the silly fuss of that man seared his very soul there was no end to this plague of fools coming to him from the forgotten ends of the earth a fellow like that could not be told no one could be told blind they came and blind they would go out he admitted reluctantly but without doubt that as if pushed by a force from outside he would have to try and save two of them to this end he foresaw the probable need of leaving his brig for a time he would have to leave her with that man the mate he had engaged him himselfto make his insurance validto be able sometimes to speakto have near him who would have believed such a foolman could exist on the face of the sea who leave the brig with him the brig  ever since sunset the breeze kept off by the heat of the day had been trying to reestablish in the darkness its sway over the shoals its approaches had been heard in the night its patient murmurs its foiled sighs but now a surprisingly heavy puff came in a free rush as if far away there to the northward the last defence of the calm had been victoriously carried the flames borne down streamed bluishly horizontal and noisy at the end of tall sticks like fluttering pennants and behold the shadows on the deck went mad and jostled each other as if trying to escape from a doomed craft the darkness held up domelike by the brilliant glare seemed to tumble headlong upon the brig in an overwhelming downfall the men stood swaying as if ready to fall under the ruins of a black and noiseless disaster the blurred outlines of the brig the masts the rigging seemed to shudder in the terror of coming extinctionand then the darkness leaped upward again the shadows returned to their places the men were seen distinct swarthy with calm faces with glittering eyeballs the destruction in the breath had passed was gone  a discord of three voices raised together in a drawling wail trailed on the sudden immobility of the air  brig ahoy give us a rope  the first boatload from the yacht emerged floating slowly into the pool of purple light wavering round the brig on the black water two men squeezed in the bows pulled uncomfortably in the middle on a heap of seamens canvas bags another sat insecure propped with both arms stifflegged angularly helpless the light from the poop brought everything out in lurid detail and the boat floating slowly toward the brig had a suspicious and pitiful aspect the shabby load lumbering her looked somehow as if it had been stolen by those men who resembled castaways in the sternsheets carter standing up steered with his leg he had a smile of youthful sarcasm  here they are he cried to lingard youve got your own way captain i thought i had better come myself with the first precious lot  pull around the stern the brigs on the swing interrupted lingard  aye aye well try not to smash the brig we would be lost indeed iffend off there john fend off old reliable if you care a pin for your salty hide i like the old chap he said when he stood by lingards side looking down at the boat which was being rapidly cleared by whites and malays working shoulder to shoulder in silence i like him he dont belong to that yachting lot either they picked him up on the road somewhere look at the old dogcarved out of a ships timberas talkative as a fishgrim as a gutted wreck thats the man for me all the others there are married or going to be or ought to be or sorry they aint every man jack of them has a petticoat in towdash me never heard in all my travels such a jabber about wives and kids hurry up with your dunnagebelow there aye i had no difficulty in getting them to clear out from the yacht they never saw a pair of gents stolen beforeyou understand it upset all their little notions of what a stranding means hereabouts not that mine arent mixed a bit tooand yet ive seen a thing or two  his excitement was revealed in this boyish impulse to talk  look he said pointing at the growing pile of bags and bedding on the brigs quarterdeck look dont they mean to sleep softand dream of homemaybe home think of that captain these chaps cant get clear away from it it isnt like you and me  lingard made a movement  i ran away myself when so high my old mans a trinity pilot thats a job worth staying at home for mother writes sometimes but they cant miss me much theres fourteen of us altogethereight at home yet no fear of the old country ever getting undermannedlet die who must only let it be a fair game captain lets have a fair show  lingard assured him briefly he should have it that was the very reason he wanted the yachts crew in the brig he added then quiet and grave he inquired whether that pistol was still in carters pocket  never mind that said the young man hurriedly remember who began to be shot at wouldnt rile me so muchits being threatened dont you see that was heavy on my chest last night is very far off thoughand i will be hanged if i know what i meant exactly when i took the old thing from its nail there more i cant say till alls settled one way or another will that do  flushing brick red he suspended his judgment and stayed his hand with the generosity of youth          apparently it suited lingard to be reprieved in that form he bowed his head slowly it would do to leave his life to that youngsters ignorance seemed to redress the balance of his mind against a lot of secret intentions it was distasteful and bitter as an expiation should be he also held a life in his hand a life and many deaths besides but these were like one single feather in the scales of his conscience that he should feel so was unavoidable because his strength would at no price permit itself to be wasted it would not beand there was an end of it all he could do was to throw in another risk into the sea of risks thus was he enabled to recognize that a drop of water in the ocean makes a great difference his very desire unconquered but exiled had left the place where he could constantly hear its voice he saw it he saw himself the past the future he saw it all shifting and indistinct like those shapes the strained eye of a wanderer outlines in darker strokes upon the face of the night    x  when lingard went to his boat to follow carter who had gone back to the yacht wasub mast and sail on shoulder preceded him down the ladder the old man leaped in smartly and busied himself in getting the dinghy ready for his commander  in that little boat lingard was accustomed to traverse the shallows alone she had a short mast and a lugsail carried two easily floated in a few inches of water in her he was independent of a crew and if the wind failed could make his way with a pair of sculls taking short cuts over shoal places there were so many islets and sandbanks that in case of sudden bad weather there was always a lee to be found and when he wished to land he could pull her up a beach striding ahead painter in hand like a giant child dragging a toy boat when the brig was anchored within the shallows it was in her that he visited the lagoon once when caught by a sudden freshening of the seabreeze he had waded up a shelving bank carrying her on his head and for two days they had rested together on the sand while around them the shallow waters raged lividly and across three miles of foam the brig would time after time dissolve in the mist and reappear distinct nodding her tall spars that seemed to touch a weeping sky of lamentable greyness  whenever he came into the lagoon tugging with bare arms jorgenson who would be watching the entrance of the creek ever since a muffled detonation of a gun to seaward had warned him of the brigs arrival on the shore of refuge would mutter to himselfheres tom coming in his nutshell and indeed she was in shape somewhat like half a nutshell and also in the colour of her dark varnished planks the mans shoulders and head rose high above her gunwales loaded with lingards heavy frame she would climb sturdily the steep ridges slide squatting into the hollows of the sea or now and then take a sedate leap over a short wave her behaviour had a stout trustworthiness about it and she reminded one of a surefooted mountainpony carrying over difficult ground a rider much bigger than himself  wasub wiped the thwarts ranged the mast and sail along the side shipped the rowlocks lingard looked down at his old servants spare shoulders upon which the light from above fell unsteady but vivid wasub worked for the comfort of his commander and his singleminded absorption in that task flashed upon lingard the consolation of an act of friendliness the elderly malay at last lifted his head with a deferential murmur his wrinkled old face with half a dozen wiry hairs pendulous at each corner of the dark lips expressed a kind of weary satisfaction and the slightly oblique worn eyes stole a discreet upward glance containing a hint of some remote meaning lingard found himself compelled by the justice of that obscure claim to murmur as he stepped into the boat  these are times of danger  he sat down and took up the sculls wasub held on to the gunwale as to a last hope of a further confidence he had served in the brig five years lingard remembered that very well this aged figure had been intimately associated with the brigs life and with his own appearing silently ready for every incident and emergency in an unquestioning expectation of orders symbolic of blind trust in his strength of an unlimited obedience to his will was it unlimited  we shall require courage and fidelity added lingard in a tentative tone  there are those who know me snapped the old man readily as if the words had been waiting for a long time observe tuan i have filled with fresh water the little breaker in the bows  i know you too said lingard  and the windand the sea ejaculated the serang jerkily these also are faithful to the strong by allah i who am a pilgrim and have listened to words of wisdom in many places i tell you tuan there is strength in the knowledge of what is hidden in things without life as well as in the living men will tuan be gone long  i come back in a short timetogether with the rest of the whites from over there this is the beginning of many stratagems wasub daman the son of a dog has suddenly made prisoners two of my own people my face is made black  tse tse what ferocity is that one should not offer shame to a friend or to a friends brother lest revenge come sweeping like a flood yet can an illanun chief be other than tyrannical my old eyes have seen much but they never saw a tiger change its stripes yawa the tiger can not this is the wisdom of us ignorant malay men the wisdom of white tuans is great they think that by the power of many speeches the tiger may he broke off and in a crisp busy tone said the rudder dwells safely under the aftermost seat should tuan be pleased to sail the boat this breeze will not die away before sunrise again his voice changed as if two different souls had been flitting in and out of his body no no kill the tiger and then the stripes may be counted without fearone by one thus  he pointed a frail brown finger and abruptly made a mirthless dry sound as if a rattle had been sprung in his throat  the wretches are many said lingard  nay tuan they follow their great men even as we in the brig follow you that is right  lingard reflected for a moment  my men will follow me then he said  they are poor calashes without sense commented wasub with pitying superiority some with no more comprehension than men of the bush freshly caught there is sali the foolish son of my sister and by your great favour appointed to mind the tiller of this ship his stupidity is extreme but his eyes are goodnearly as good as mine that by praying and much exercise can see far into the night  lingard laughed low and then looked earnestly at the serang above their heads a man shook a flare over the side and a thin shower of sparks floated downward and expired before touching the water  so you can see in the night o serang well then look and speak speak fightor no fight weapons or words which folly well what do you see  a darkness a darkness whispered wasub at last in a frightened tone there are nights he shook his head and muttered look the tide has turned ya tuan the tide has turned  lingard looked downward where the water could be seen gliding past the ships side moving smoothly streaked with lines of froth across the illumined circle thrown round the brig by the lights on her poop air bubbles sparkled lines of darkness ripples of glitter appeared glided went astern without a splash without a trickle without a plaint without a break the unchecked gentleness of the flow captured the eye by a subtle spell fastened insidiously upon the mind a disturbing sense of the irretrievable the ebbing of the sea athwart the lonely sheen of flames resembled the eternal ebbtide of time and when at last lingard looked up the knowledge of that noiseless passage of the waters produced on his mind a bewildering effect for a moment the speck of light lost in vast obscurity the brig the boat the hidden coast the shallows the very walls and roof of darknessthe seen and the unseen alike seemed to be gliding smoothly onward through the enormous gloom of space then with a great mental effort he brought everything to a sudden standstill and only the froth and bubbles went on streaming past ceaselessly unchecked by the power of his will  the tide has turnedyou say serang has it well perhaps it has perhaps it has he finished muttering to himself  truly it has can not tuan see it run under his own eyes said wasub with an alarmed earnestness look now it is in my mind that a prau coming from amongst the southern islands if steered cunningly in the free set of the current would approach the bows of this our brig drifting silently as a shape without a substance  and board suddenlyis that it said lingard  daman is crafty and the illanuns are very bloodthirsty night is nothing to them they are certainly valorous are they not born in the midst of fighting and are they not inspired by the evil of their hearts even before they can speak and their chiefs would be leading them while you tuan are going from us even now  you dont want me to go asked lingard  for a time wasub listened attentively to the profound silence  can we fight without a leader he began again it is the belief in victory that gives courage and what would poor calashes do sons of peasants and fishermen freshly caughtwithout knowledge they believe in your strengthand in your poweror elsewill those whites that came so suddenly avenge you they are here like fish within the stakes yawa who will bring the news and who will come to find the truth and perchance to carry off your body you go alone tuan  there must be no fighting it would be a calamity insisted lingard there is blood that must not be spilt  hear tuan exclaimed wasub with heat the waters are running out now he punctuated his speech by slight jerks at the dinghy the waters go and at the appointed time they shall return and if between their going and coming the blood of all the men in the world were poured into it the sea would not rise higher at the full by the breadth of my finger nail  but the world would not be the same you do not see that serang give the boat a good shove  directly said the old malay and his face became impassive tuan knows when it is best to go and death sometimes retreats before a firm tread like a startled snake tuan should take a follower with him not a silly youth but one who has livedwho has a steady heartwho would walk close behind watchfullyand quietly yes quietly and with quick eyeslike mineperhaps with a weaponi know how to strike  lingard looked at the wrinkled visage very near his own and into the peering old eyes they shone strangely a tense eagerness was expressed in the squatting figure leaning out toward him on the other side within reach of his arm the night stood like a wall discouragingopaqueimpenetrable no help would avail the darkness he had to combat was too impalpable to be cleft by a blowtoo dense to be pierced by the eye yet as if by some enchantment in the words that made this vain offer of fidelity it became less overpowering to his sight less crushing to his thought he had a moment of pride which soothed his heart for the space of two beats his unreasonable and misjudged heart shrinking before the menace of failure expanded freely with a sense of generous gratitude in the threatening dimness of his emotions this mans offer made a point of clearness the glimmer of a torch held aloft in the night it was priceless no doubt but ineffectual too small too far too solitary it did not dispel the mysterious obscurity that had descended upon his fortunes so that his eyes could no longer see the work of his hands the sadness of defeat pervaded the world  and what could you do o wasub he said  i could always call outtake care tuan  and then for these charmwords of mine hey turn danger aside what but perchance you would die all the same treachery is a strong magic tooas you said  yes indeed the order might come to your servant but iwasubthe son of a free man a follower of rajahs a fugitive a slave a pilgrimdiver for pearls serang of white mens ships i have had too many masters too many you are the last after a silence he said in an almost indifferent voice if you go tuan let us go together  for a time lingard made no sound  no use he said at last no use serang one life is enough to pay for a mans follyand you have a household  i have twotuan but it is a long time since i sat on the ladder of a house to talk at ease with neighbours yes two households one in lingard smiled faintly tuan let me follow you  no you have said it serangi am alone that is true and alone i shall go on this very night but first i must bring all the white people here push  ready tuan look out  wasubs body swung over the sea with extended arms lingard caught up the sculls and as the dinghy darted away from the brigs side he had a complete view of the lighted poopshaw leaning massively over the taffrail in sulky dejection the flare bearers erect and rigid the heads along the rail the eyes staring after him above the bulwarks the foreend of the brig was wrapped in a lurid and sombre mistiness the sullen mingling of darkness and of light her masts pointing straight up could be tracked by torn gleams and vanished above as if the trucks had been tall enough to pierce the heavy mass of vapours motionless overhead she was beautifully precious his loving eyes saw her floating at rest in a wavering halo between an invisible sky and an invisible sea like a miraculous craft suspended in the air he turned his head away as if the sight had been too much for him at the moment of separation and as soon as his little boat had passed beyond the limit of the light thrown upon the water he perceived very low in the black void of the west the stern lantern of the yacht shining feebly like a star about to set unattainable infinitely remotebelonging to another universe    part iv the gift of the shallows  i  lingard brought mrs travers away from the yacht going alone with her in the little boat during the bustle of the embarkment and till the last of the crew had left the schooner he had remained towering and silent by her side it was only when the murmuring and uneasy voices of the sailors going away in the boats had been completely lost in the distance that his voice was heard grave in the silence pronouncing the wordsfollow me she followed him their footsteps rang hollow and loud on the empty deck at the bottom of the steps he turned round and said very low  take care  he got into the boat and held on it seemed to him that she was intimidated by the darkness she felt her arm gripped firmlyive got you he said she stepped in headlong trusting herself blindly to his grip and sank on the stern seat catching her breath a little she heard a slight splash and the indistinct side of the deserted yacht melted suddenly into the body of the night  rowing he faced her a hooded and cloaked shape and above her head he had before his eyes the gleam of the stern lantern expiring slowly on the abandoned vessel when it went out without a warning flicker he could see nothing of the stranded yachts outline she had vanished utterly like a dream and the occurrences of the last twentyfour hours seemed also to be a part of a vanished dream the hooded and cloaked figure was part of it too it spoke not it moved not it would vanish presently lingard tried to remember mrs travers features even as she sat within two feet of him in the boat he seemed to have taken from that vanished schooner not a woman but a memorythe tormenting recollection of a human being he would see no more  at every stroke of the short sculls mrs travers felt the boat leap forward with her lingard to keep his direction had to look over his shoulder frequentlyyou will be safe in the brig he said she was silent a dream a dream he lay back vigorously the water slapped loudly against the blunt bows the ruddy glow thrown afar by the flares was reflected deep within the hood the dream had a pale visage the memory had living eyes  i had to come for you myself he said  i expected it of you these were the first words he had heard her say since they had met for the third time  and i sworebefore you toothat i would never put my foot on board your craft  it was good of you to she began  i forgot somehow he said simply  i expected it of you she repeated he gave three quick strokes before he asked very gently  what more do you expect  everything she said he was rounding then the stern of the brig and had to look away then he turned to her  and you trust me to he exclaimed  i would like to trust you she interrupted because  above them a startled voice cried in malay captain coming the strange sound silenced her lingard laid in his sculls and she saw herself gliding under the high side of the brig a dark staring face appeared very near her eyes black fingers caught the gunwale of the boat she stood up swaying take care said lingard again but this time in the light did not offer to help her she went up alone and he followed her over the rail  the quarterdeck was thronged by men of two races lingard and mrs travers crossed it rapidly between the groups that moved out of the way on their passage lingard threw open the cabin door for her but remained on deck to inquire about his boats they had returned while he was on board the yacht and the two men in charge of them came aft to make their reports the boat sent north had seen nothing the boat which had been directed to explore the banks and islets to the south had actually been in sight of damans praus the man in charge reported that several fires were burning on the shore the crews of the two praus being encamped on a sandbank cooking was going on they had been near enough to hear the voices there was a man keeping watch on the ridge they knew this because they heard him shouting to the people below by the fires lingard wanted to know how they had managed to remain unseen the night was our hiding place answered the man in his deep growling voice he knew nothing of any white men being in damans camp why should there be rajah hassim and the lady his sister appeared unexpectedly near his boat in their canoe rajah hassim had ordered him then in whispers to go back to the brig at once and tell tuan what he had observed rajah hassim said also that he would return to the brig with more news very soon he obeyed because the rajah was to him a person of authority having the perfect knowledge of tuans mind as we all knowenough cried lingard suddenly  the man looked up heavily for a moment and retreated forward without another word lingard followed him with irritated eyes a new power had come into the world had possessed itself of human speech had imparted to it a sinister irony of allusion to be told that someone had a perfect knowledge of his mind startled him and made him wince it made him aware that now he did not know his mind himselfthat it seemed impossible for him ever to regain that knowledge and the new power not only had cast its spell upon the words he had to hear but also upon the facts that assailed him upon the people he saw upon the thoughts he had to guide upon the feelings he had to bear they remained what they had ever beenthe visible surface of life open in the sun to the conquering tread of an unfettered will yesterday they could have been discerned clearly mastered and despised but now another power had come into the world and had cast over them all the wavering gloom of a dark and inscrutable purpose    ii  recovering himself with a slight start lingard gave the order to extinguish all the lights in the brig now the transfer of the crew from the yacht had been effected there was every advantage in the darkness he gave the order from instinct it being the right thing to do in the circumstances his thoughts were in the cabin of his brig where there was a woman waiting he put his hand over his eyes collecting himself as if before a great mental effort he could hear about him the excited murmurs of the white men whom in the morning he had so ardently desired to have safe in his keeping he had them there now but accident illluck a cursed folly had tricked him out of the success of his plan he would have to go in and talk to mrs travers the idea dismayed him of necessity he was not one of those men who have the mastery of expression to liberate his soul was for him a gigantic undertaking a matter of desperate effort of doubtful success i must have it out with her he murmured to himself as though at the prospect of a struggle he was uncertain of himself of her he was uncertain of everything and everybody but he was very certain he wanted to look at her  at the moment he turned to the door of the cabin both flares went out together and the black vault of the night upheld above the brig by the fierce flames fell behind him and buried the deck in sudden darkness the buzz of strange voices instantly hummed louder with a startled note hallocant see a mortal thingwell what nextinsisted a voicei want to know what next  lingard checked himself ready to open the door and waited absurdly for the answer as though in the hope of some suggestion whats up with you think yourself lucky said somebodyits all very wellfor tonight began the voicewhat are you fashing yourself for remonstrated the other reasonably well get home right enoughi am not so sure the second mate he says never mind what he says that ere man who has got this brig will see us through the owners wife will talk to himshe will money can do a lot the two voices came nearer and spoke more distinctly close behind lingard suppose them blooming savages set fire to the yacht whats to prevent themand suppose they do this ere brigs good enough to get away in aint she guns and all well get home yet all right what do you say john  i say nothing and care less said a third voice peaceful and faint  dyou mean to say john you would go to the bottom as soon as you would go home come nowto the bottom repeated the wan voice composedly aye thats where we all are going to in one way or another the way dont matter  ough you would give the blues to the funny man of a blooming circus what would my missus say if i wasnt to turn up never at allshe would get another man theres always plenty of fools about a quiet and mirthless chuckle was heard in the pause of shocked silence lingard with his hand on the door remained still further off a growl burst out i do hate to be chucked in the dark aboard a strange ship i wonder where they keep their fresh water cant get any sense out of them silly niggers we dont seem to be more account here than a lot of cattle likely as not well have to berth on this blooming quarterdeck for god knows how long then again very near lingard the first voice said deadened discreetlytheres something curious about this here brig turning up suddenlike aint there and that skipper of hernow what kind of a man is heanyhow  oh hes one of them skippers going about loose the brigs his own i am thinking he just goes about in her looking for what he may pick up honest or dishonest my brotherinlaw has served two commissions in these seas and was telling me awful yarns about whats going on in them godforsaken parts likely he lied though them manofwars men are a holy terror for yarns bless you what do i care who this skipper is let him do his best and dont trouble your head you wont see him again in your life once we get clear  and can he do anything for the owner asked the first voice againcan he we can do nothingthats one thing certain the owner may be lying clubbed to death this very minute for all we know by all accounts these savages here are a crool murdering lot mind you i am sorry for him as much as anybodyaye aye muttered the other approvinglyhe may not have been ready poor man began again the reasonable voice lingard heard a deep sighif theres anything as can be done for him the owners wife shes got to fix it up with this ere skipper under providence he may serve her turn  lingard flung open the cabin door entered and with a slam shut the darkness out  i am under providence to serve your turn he said after standing very still for a while with his eyes upon mrs travers the brigs swinglamp lighted the cabin with an extraordinary brilliance mrs travers had thrown back her hood the radiant brightness of the little place enfolded her so close clung to her with such force that it might have been part of her very essence there were no shadows on her face it was fiercely lighted hermetically closed of impenetrable fairness  lingard looked in unconscious ecstasy at this vision so amazing that it seemed to have strayed into his existence from beyond the limits of the conceivable it was impossible to guess her thoughts to know her feelings to understand her grief or her joy but she knew all that was at the bottom of his heart he had told her himself impelled by a sudden thought going to her in darkness in desperation in absurd hope in incredible trust he had told her what he had told no one on earth except perhaps at times himself but without wordsless clearly he had told her and she had listened in silence she had listened leaning over the rail till at last her breath was on his forehead he remembered this and had a moment of soaring pride and of unutterable dismay he spoke with an effort  youve heard what i said just now here i am  do you expect me to say something she asked is it necessary is it possible  no he answered it is said already i know what you expect from me everything  everything she repeated paused and added much lower it is the very least he seemed to lose himself in thought  it is extraordinary he reflected half aloud how i dislike that man she leaned forward a little  remember those two men are innocent she began  so am iinnocent so is everybody in the world have you ever met a man or a woman that was not theyve got to take their chances all the same  i expect you to be generous she said  to you  wellto me yesif you like to me alone  to you alone and you know everything his voice dropped you want your happiness  she made an impatient movement and he saw her clench the hand that was lying on the table  i want my husband back she said sharply  yes yes its what i was saying same thing he muttered with strange placidity she looked at him searchingly he had a large simplicity that filled ones vision she found herself slowly invaded by this masterful figure he was not mediocre whatever he might have been he was not mediocre the glamour of a lawless life stretched over him like the sky over the sea down on all sides to an unbroken horizon within he moved very lonely dangerous and romantic there was in him crime sacrifice tenderness devotion and the madness of a fixed idea she thought with wonder that of all the men in the world he was indeed the one she knew the best and yet she could not foresee the speech or the act of the next minute she said distinctly  youve given me your confidence now i want you to give me the life of these two men the life of two men whom you do not know whom tomorrow you will forget it can be done it must be done you cannot refuse them to me she waited  why cant i refuse he whispered gloomily without looking up  you ask she exclaimed he made no sign he seemed at a loss for words  you ask    ah she cried dont you see that i have no kingdoms to conquer    iii  a slight change of expression which passed away almost directly showed that lingard heard the passionate cry wrung from her by the distress of her mind he made no sign she perceived clearly the extreme difficulty of her position the situation was dangerous not so much the facts of it as the feeling of it at times it appeared no more actual than a tradition and she thought of herself as of some woman in a ballad who has to beg for the lives of innocent captives to save the lives of mr travers and mr dalcacer was more than a duty it was a necessity it was an imperative need it was an irresistible mission yet she had to reflect upon the horrors of a cruel and obscure death before she could feel for them the pity they deserved it was when she looked at lingard that her heart was wrung by an extremity of compassion the others were pitiful but he the victim of his own extravagant impulses appeared tragic fascinating and culpable lingard lifted his head whispers were heard at the door and hassim followed by immada entered the cabin  mrs travers looked at lingard because of all the faces in the cabin his was the only one that was intelligible to her hassim began to speak at once and when he ceased immadas deep sigh was heard in the sudden silence then lingard looked at mrs travers and said  the gentlemen are alive rajah hassim here has seen them less than two hours ago and so has the girl they are alive and unharmed so far and now     he paused mrs travers leaning on her elbow shaded her eyes under the glint of suspended thunderbolts  you must hate us she murmured  hate you he repeated with as she fancied a tinge of disdain in his tone no i hate myself  why yourself she asked very low  for not knowing my mind he answered for not knowing my mind for not knowing what it is thats got hold of me sincesince this morning i was angry then    nothing but very angry     and now she murmured  i am    unhappy he said after a moment of silence which gave to mrs travers the time to wonder how it was that this man had succeeded in penetrating into the very depths of her compassion he hit the table such a blow that all the heavy muskets seemed to jump a little  mrs travers heard hassim pronounce a few words earnestly and a moan of distress from immada  i believed in you before you    before you gave me your confidence she began you could see that could you not  he looked at her fixedly you are not the first that believed in me he said  hassim lounging with his back against the closed door kept his eye on him watchfully and immadas dark and sorrowful eyes rested on the face of the white woman mrs travers felt as though she were engaged in a contest with them in a struggle for the possession of that mans strength and of that mans devotion when she looked up at lingard she saw on his facewhich should have been impassive or exalted the face of a stern leader or the face of a pitiless dreameran expression of utter forgetfulness he seemed to be tasting the delight of some profound and amazing sensation and suddenly in the midst of her appeal to his generosity in the middle of a phrase mrs travers faltered becoming aware that she was the object of his contemplation  do not do not look at that woman cried immada o masterlook away    hassim threw one arm round the girls neck her voice sank o masterlook at us hassim drawing her to himself covered her lips with his hand she struggled a little like a snared bird and submitted hiding her face on his shoulder very quiet sobbing without noise  what do they say to you asked mrs travers with a faint and pained smile what can they say it is intolerable to think that their words which have no meaning for me may go straight to your heart     look away whispered lingard without making the slightest movement  mrs travers sighed  yes it is very hard to think that i who want to touch you cannot make myself understood as well as they and yet i speak the language of your childhood the language of the man for whom there is no hope but in your generosity  he shook his head she gazed at him anxiously for a moment in your memories then she said and was surprised by the expression of profound sadness that overspread his attentive face  do you know what i remember he said do you want to know she listened with slightly parted lips i will tell you poverty hard workand death he went on very quietly and now ive told you and you dont know thats how it is between us you talk to mei talk to youand we dont know  her eyelids dropped  what can i find to say she went on what can i do i mustnt give in think amongst your memories there must be some facesome voicesome name if nothing more i can not believe that there is nothing but bitterness  theres no bitterness he murmured  o brother my heart is faint with fear whispered immada lingard turned swiftly to that whisper  then they are to be saved exclaimed mrs travers ah i knew     bear thy fear in patience said hassim rapidly to his sister  they are to be saved you have said it lingard pronounced aloud suddenly he felt like a swimmer who in the midst of superhuman efforts to reach the shore perceives that the undertow is taking him to sea he would go with the mysterious current he would go swiftlyand see the end the fulfilment both blissful and terrible  with this state of exaltation in which he saw himself in some incomprehensible way always victorious whatever might befall there was mingled a tenacity of purpose he could not sacrifice his intention the intention of years the intention of his life he could no more part with it and exist than he could cut out his heart and live the adventurer held fast to his adventure which made him in his own sight exactly what he was  he considered the problem with cool audacity backed by a belief in his own power it was not these two men he had to save he had to save himself and looked upon in this way the situation appeared familiar  hassim had told him the two white men had been taken by their captors to damans camp the young rajah leaving his sister in the canoe had landed on the sand and had crept to the very edge of light thrown by the fires by which the illanuns were cooking daman was sitting apart by a larger blaze two praus rode in shallow water near the sandbank on the ridge a sentry walked watching the lights of the brig the camp was full of quiet whispers hassim returned to his canoe then he and his sister paddling cautiously round the anchored praus in which womens voices could be heard approached the other end of the camp the light of the big blaze there fell on the water and the canoe skirted it without a splash keeping in the night hassim landing for the second time crept again close to the fires each prau had according to the customs of the illanun rovers when on a raiding expedition a smaller warboat and these being light and manageable were hauled up on the sand not far from the big blaze they sat high on the shelving shore throwing heavy shadows hassim crept up toward the largest of them and then standing on tiptoe could look at the camp across the gunwales the confused talking of the men was like the buzz of insects in a forest a child wailed on board one of the praus and a woman hailed the shore shrilly hassim unsheathed his kris and held it in his hand  very soonhe saidhe saw the two white men walking amongst the fires they waved their arms and talked together stopping from time to time they approached daman and the short man with the hair on his face addressed him earnestly and at great length daman sat crosslegged upon a little carpet with an open koran on his knees and chanted the versets swaying to and fro with his eyes shut  the illanun chiefs reclining wrapped in cloaks on the ground raised themselves on their elbows to look at the whites when the short white man finished speaking he gazed down at them for a while then stamped his foot he looked angry because no one understood him then suddenly he looked very sad he covered his face with his hands the tall man put his hand on the short mans shoulder and whispered into his ear the dry wood of the fires crackled the illanuns slept cooked talked but with their weapons at hand an armed man or two came up to stare at the prisoners and then returned to their fire the two whites sank down in the sand in front of daman their clothes were soiled there was sand in their hair the tall man had lost his hat the glass in the eye of the short man glittered very much his back was muddy and one sleeve of his coat torn up to the elbow  all this hassim saw and then retreated undetected to that part of the shore where immada waited for him keeping the canoe afloat the illanuns trusting to the sea kept very bad watch on their prisoners and had he been able to speak with them hassim thought an escape could have been effected but they could not have understood his signs and still less his words he consulted with his sister immada murmured sadly at their feet the ripple broke with a mournful sound no louder than their voices  hassims loyalty was unshaken but now it led him on not in the bright light of hopes but in the deepened shadow of doubt he wanted to obtain information for his friend who was so powerful and who perhaps would know how to be constant when followed by immada he approached the camp againthis time openlytheir appearance did not excite much surprise it was well known to the chiefs of the illanuns that the rajah for whom they were to fightif god so willedwas upon the shoals looking out for the coming of the white man who had much wealth and a store of weapons and who was his servant daman who alone understood the exact relation welcomed them with impenetrable gravity hassim took his seat on the carpet at his right hand a consultation was being held halfaloud in short and apparently careless sentences with long intervals of silence between immada nestling close to her brother leaned one arm on his shoulder and listened with serious attention and with outward calm as became a princess of wajo accustomed to consort with warriors and statesmen in moments of danger and in the hours of deliberation her heart was beating rapidly and facing her the silent white men stared at these two known faces as if across a gulf four illanun chiefs sat in a row their ample cloaks fell from their shoulders and lay behind them on the sand in which their four long lances were planted upright each supporting a small oblong shield of wood carved on the edges and stained a dull purple daman stretched out his arm and pointed at the prisoners the faces of the white men were very quiet daman looked at them mutely and ardently as if consumed by an unspeakable longing  the koran in a silk cover hung on his breast by a crimson cord it rested over his heart and just below the plain buffalohorn handle of a kris stuck into the twist of his sarong protruded ready to his hand the clouds thickening over the camp made the darkness press heavily on the glow of scattered fires there is blood between me and the whites he pronounced violently the illanun chiefs remained impassive there was blood between them and all mankind hassim remarked dispassionately that there was one white man with whom it would be wise to remain friendly and besides was not daman his friend already daman smiled with halfclosed eyes he was that white mans friend not his slave the illanuns playing with their swordhandles grunted assent why asked daman did these strange whites travel so far from their country the great white man whom they all knew did not want them no one wanted them evil would follow in their footsteps they were such men as are sent by rulers to examine the aspects of faroff countries and talk of peace and make treaties such is the beginning of great sorrows the illanuns were far from their country where no white man dared to come and therefore they were free to seek their enemies upon the open waters they had found these two who had come to see he asked what they had come to see was there nothing to look at in their own country  he talked in an ironic and subdued tone the scattered heaps of embers glowed a deeper red the big blaze of the chiefs fire sank low and grew dim before he ceased straightlimbed figures rose sank moved whispered on the beach here and there a spearblade caught a red gleam above the black shape of a head  the illanuns seek booty on the sea cried daman their fathers and the fathers of their fathers have done the same being fearless like those who embrace death closely  a low laugh was heard we strike and go said an exulting voice we live and die with our weapons in our hands the illanuns leaped to their feet they stamped on the sand flourishing naked blades over the heads of their prisoners a tumult arose  when it subsided daman stood up in a cloak that wrapped him to his feet and spoke again giving advice  the white men sat on the sand and turned their eyes from face to face as if trying to understand it was agreed to send the prisoners into the lagoon where their fate would be decided by the ruler of the land the illanuns only wanted to plunder the ship they did not care what became of the men but daman cares remarked hassim to lingard when relating what took place he cares o tuan  hassim had learned also that the settlement was in a state of unrest as if on the eve of war belarab with his followers was encamped by his fathers tomb in the hollow beyond the cultivated fields his stockade was shut up and no one appeared on the verandahs of the houses within you could tell there were people inside only by the smoke of the cooking fires tenggas followers meantime swaggered about the settlement behaving tyrannically to those who were peaceable a great madness had descended upon the people a madness strong as the madness of love the madness of battle the desire to spill blood a strange fear also had made them wild the big smoke seen that morning above the forests of the coast was some agreed signal from tengga to daman but what it meant hassim had been unable to find out he feared for jorgensons safety he said that while one of the warboats was being made ready to take the captives into the lagoon he and his sister left the camp quietly and got away in their canoe the flares of the brig reflected in a faint loom upon the clouds enabled them to make straight for the vessel across the banks before they had gone half way these flames went out and the darkness seemed denser than any he had known before but it was no greater than the darkness of his mindhe added he had looked upon the white men sitting unmoved and silent under the edge of swords he had looked at daman he had heard bitter words spoken he was looking now at his white friendand the issue of events he could not see one can see mens faces but their fate which is written on their foreheads one cannot see he had no more to say and what he had spoken was true in every word    iv  lingard repeated it all to mrs travers her courage her intelligence the quickness of her apprehension the colour of her eyes and the intrepidity of her glance evoked in him an admiring enthusiasm she stood by his side every moment that fatal illusion clung closer to his soullike a garment of lightlike an armour of fire  he was unwilling to face the facts all his lifetill that dayhad been a wrestle with events in the daylight of this world but now he could not bring his mind to the consideration of his position it was mrs travers who after waiting awhile forced on him the pain of thought by wanting to know what bearing hassims news had upon the situation  lingard had not the slightest doubt daman wanted him to know what had been done with the prisoners that is why daman had welcomed hassim and let him hear the decision and had allowed him to leave the camp on the sandbank there could be only one object in this to let him lingard know that the prisoners had been put out of his reach as long as he remained in his brig now this brig was his strength to make him leave his brig was like removing his hand from his sword  do you understand what i mean mrs travers he asked they are afraid of me because i know how to fight this brig they fear the brig because when i am on board her the brig and i are one an armed mandont you see without the brig i am disarmed without me she cant strike so daman thinks he does not know everything but he is not far off the truth he says to himself that if i man the boats to go after these whites into the lagoon then his illanuns will get the yacht for sureand perhaps the brig as well if i stop here with my brig he holds the two white men and can talk as big as he pleases belarab believes in me no doubt but daman trusts no man on earth he simply does not know how to trust any one because he is always plotting himself he came to help me and as soon as he found i was not there he began to plot with tengga now he has made a movea clever move a cleverer move than he thinks why ill tell you why because i tom lingard havent a single white man aboard this brig i can trust not one i only just discovered my mates got the notion i am some kind of pirate and all your yacht people think the same it is as though you had brought a curse on me in your yacht nobody believes me good god what have i come to even those twolook at themi say look at them by all the stars they doubt me me     he pointed at hassim and immada the girl seemed frightened hassim looked on calm and intelligent with inexhaustible patience lingards voice fell suddenly  and by heavens they may be right who knows you do you know they have waited for years look they are waiting with heavy hearts do you think that i dont care ought i to have kept it all intold no oneno onenot even you are they waiting for what will never come now  mrs travers rose and moved quickly round the table can we give anything to thisthis daman or these other men we could give them more than they could think of asking imy husband     dont talk to me of your husband he said roughly you dont know what you are doing she confronted the sombre anger of his eyesbut i must she asserted with heatmust he mused noticing that she was only half a head less tall than himself must oh yes of course you must must yes but i dont want to hear give what can you give you may have all the treasures of the world for all i know no you cant give anything     i was thinking of your difficulty when i spoke she interrupted his eyes wandered downward following the line of her shoulderof meof me he repeated  all this was said almost in whispers the sound of slow footsteps was heard on deck above their heads lingard turned his face to the open skylight  on deck there any wind  all was still for a moment somebody above answered in a leisurely tone  a steady little draught from the northward  then after a pause added in a mutter  pitch dark  aye dark enough murmured lingard he must do something now at once the world was waiting the world full of hopes and fear what should he do instead of answering that question he traced the ungleaming coils of her twisted hair and became fascinated by a stray lock at her neck what should he do no one to leave his brig to the voice that had answered his question was carters voice he is hanging about keeping his eye on me he said to mrs travers she shook her head and tried to smile the man above coughed discreetly no said lingard you must understand that you have nothing to give  the man on deck who seemed to have lingered by the skylight was heard saying quietly i am at hand if you want me mrs travers hassim and immada looked up you see exclaimed lingard what did i tell you hes keeping his eye on me on board my own ship am i dreaming am i in a fever tell him to come down he said after a pause mrs travers did so and lingard thought her voice very commanding and very sweet theres nothing in the world i love so much as this brig he went on nothing in the world if i lost her i would have no standing room on the earth for my feet you dont understand this you cant  carter came in and shut the cabin door carefully he looked with serenity at everyone in turn  all quiet asked lingard  quiet enough if you like to call it so he answered but if you only put your head outside the door youll hear them all on the quarterdeck snoring against each other as if there were no wives at home and no pirates at sea  look here said lingard i found out that i cant trust my mate  cant you drawled carter i am not exactly surprised i must say he does not snore but i believe it is because he is too crazy to sleep he waylaid me on the poop just now and said something about evil communications corrupting good manners seems to me ive heard that before queer thing to say he tried to make it out somehow that if he wasnt corrupt it wasnt your fault as if this was any concern of mine hes as mad as hes fator else he puts it on carter laughed a little and leaned his shoulders against a bulkhead  lingard gazed at the woman who expected so much from him and in the light she seemed to shed he saw himself leading a column of armed boats to the attack of the settlement he could burn the whole place to the ground and drive every soul of them into the bush he could and there was a surprise a shock a vague horror at the thought of the destructive power of his will he could give her ever so many lives he had seen her yesterday and it seemed to him he had been all his life waiting for her to make a sign she was very still he pondered a plan of attack he saw smoke and flameand next moment he saw himself alone amongst shapeless ruins with the whispers with the sigh and moan of the shallows in his ears he shuddered and shaking his hand  no i cannot give you all those lives he cried  then before mrs travers could guess the meaning of this outburst he declared that as the two captives must be saved he would go alone into the lagoon he could not think of using force you understand why he said to mrs travers and she whispered a faint yes he would run the risk alone his hope was in belarab being able to see where his true interest lay if i can only get at him i would soon make him see he mused aloud havent i kept his power up for these two years past and he knows it too he feels it whether he would be allowed to reach belarab was another matter lingard lost himself in deep thought he would not dare he burst out mrs travers listened with parted lips carter did not move a muscle of his youthful and selfpossessed face only when lingard turning suddenly came up close to him and asked with a red flash of eyes and in a lowered voice could you fight this brig something like a smile made a stir amongst the hairs of his little fair moustache  could i he said i could try anyhow he paused and added hardly above his breath for the ladyof course  lingard seemed staggered as though he had been hit in the chest i was thinking of the brig he said gently  mrs travers would be on board retorted carter  what on board ah yes on board where else stammered lingard  carter looked at him in amazement fight you ask he said slowly you just try me  i shall ejaculated lingard he left the cabin calling out serang a thin cracked voice was heard immediately answering tuan and the door slammed to  you trust him mrs travers asked carter rapidly  you do notwhy she answered  i cant make him out if he was another kind of man i would say he was drunk said carter why is he here at allhe and this brig of his excuse my boldnessbut have you promised him anything  ii promised exclaimed mrs travers in a bitter tone which silenced carter for a moment  so much the better he said at last let him show what he can do first and     here take this said lingard who reentered the cabin fumbling about his neck carter mechanically extended his hand  whats this for he asked looking at a small brass key attached to a thin chain  powder magazine trap door under the table the man who has this key commands the brig while i am away the serang understands you have her very life in your hand there  carter looked at the small key lying in his halfopen palm  i was just telling mrs travers i didnt trust younot altogether     i know all about it interrupted lingard contemptuously you carry a blamed pistol in your pocket to blow my brains outdont you whats that to me i am thinking of the brig i think i know your sort you will do  well perhaps i might mumbled carter modestly  dont be rash said lingard anxiously if youve got to fight use your head as well as your hands if theres a breeze fight under way if they should try to board in a calm trust to the small arms to hold them off keep your head and he looked intensely into carters eyes his lips worked without a sound as though he had been suddenly struck dumb dont think about me whats that to you who i am think of the ship he burst out dont let her godont let her go the passion in his voice impressed his hearers who for a time preserved a profound silence  all right said carter at last i will stick to your brig as though she were my own but i would like to see clear through all this look hereyou are going off somewhere alone you said  yes alone  very well mind then that you dont come back with a crowd of those brown friends of yoursor by the heavens above us i wont let you come within hail of your own ship am i to keep this key  captain lingard said mrs travers suddenly would it not be better to tell him everything  tell him everything repeated lingard everything yesterday it might have been done only yesterday yesterday did i say only six hours agoonly six hours ago i had something to tell you heard it and now its gone tell him theres nothing to tell any more he remained for a time with bowed head while before him mrs travers who had begun a gesture of protest dropped her arms suddenly in a moment he looked up again  keep the key he said calmly and when the time comes step forward and take charge i am satisfied  i would like to see clear through all this though muttered carter again and for how long are you leaving us captain lingard made no answer carter waited awhile come sir he urged i ought to have some notion what is it two three days lingard started  days he repeated ah days what is it you want to know two    threewhat did the old fellow sayperhaps for life this was spoken so low that no one but carter heard the last wordsdo you mean it he murmured lingard noddedwait as long as you canthen go he said in the same hardly audible voice go wherewhere you like nearest port any portvery good thats something plain at any rate commented the young man with imperturbable good humour  i go o hassim began lingard and the malay made a slow inclination of the head which he did not raise again till lingard had ceased speaking he betrayed neither surprise nor any other emotion while lingard in a few concise and sharp sentences made him acquainted with his purpose to bring about singlehanded the release of the prisoners when lingard had ended with the words and you must find a way to help me in the time of trouble o rajah hassim he looked up and said  good you never asked me for anything before  he smiled at his white friend there was something subtle in the smile and afterward an added firmness in the repose of the lips immada moved a step forward she looked at lingard with terror in her black and dilated eyes she exclaimed in a voice whose vibration startled the hearts of all the hearers with an indefinable sense of alarm he will perish hassim he will perish alone  no said hassim thy fear is as vain tonight as it was at sunrise he shall not perish alone  her eyelids dropped slowly from her veiled eyes the tears fell vanishing in the silence lingards forehead became furrowed by folds that seemed to contain an infinity of sombre thoughts remember o hassim that when i promised you to take you back to your country you promised me to be a friend to all white men a friend to all whites who are of my people forever  my memory is good o tuan said hassim i am not yet back in my country but is not everyone the ruler of his own heart promises made by a man of noble birth live as long as the speaker endures  goodbye said lingard to mrs travers you will be safe here he looked all around the cabin i leave you he began again and stopped short mrs travers hand resting lightly on the edge of the table began to tremble its for you    yes for you alone    and it seems it cant be     it seemed to him that he was saying goodbye to all the world that he was taking a last leave of his own self mrs travers did not say a word but immada threw herself between them and cried  you are a cruel woman you are driving him away from where his strength is you put madness into his heart o blindwithout pitywithout shame     immada said hassims calm voice nobody moved  what did she say to me faltered mrs travers and again repeated in a voice that sounded hard what did she say  forgive her said lingard her fears are for me   its about your going mrs travers interrupted swiftly  yes it isand you must forgive her he had turned away his eyes with something that resembled embarrassment but suddenly he was assailed by an irresistible longing to look again at that woman at the moment of parting he clung to her with his glance as a man holds with his hands a priceless and disputed possession the faint blush that overspread gradually mrs travers features gave her face an air of extraordinary and startling animation  the danger you run she asked eagerly he repelled the suggestion by a slighting gesture of the handnothing worth looking at twice dont give it a thought he said ive been in tighter places he clapped his hands and waited till he heard the cabin door open behind his back steward my pistols the mulatto in slippers aproned to the chin glided through the cabin with unseeing eyes as though for him no one there had existed   is it my heart that aches so mrs travers asked herself contemplating lingards motionless figure how long will this sensation of dull pain last will it last forever   how many changes of clothes shall i put up sir asked the steward while lingard took the pistols from him and eased the hammers after putting on fresh capsi will take nothing this time steward he received in turn from the mulattos hands a red silk handkerchief a pocket book a cigarcase he knotted the handkerchief loosely round his throat it was evident he was going through the routine of every departure for the shore he even opened the cigarcase to see whether it had been filledhat sir murmured the halfcaste lingard flung it on his headtake your orders from this lady stewardtill i come back the cabin is hersdo you hear he sighed ready to go and seemed unable to lift a footi am coming with you declared mrs travers suddenly in a tone of unalterable decision he did not look at her he did not even look up he said nothing till after carter had cried you cant mrs traverswhen without budging he whispered to himselfof course mrs travers had pulled already the hood of her cloak over her head and her face within the dark cloth had turned an intense and unearthly white in which the violet of her eyes appeared unfathomably mysterious carter started forwardyou dont know this man he almost shouted  i do know him she said and before the reproachfully unbelieving attitude of the other she added speaking slowly and with emphasis there is not i verily believe a single thought or act of his life that i dont knowits trueits true muttered lingard to himself carter threw up his arms with a groan stand back said a voice that sounded to him like a growl of thunder and he felt a grip on his hand which seemed to crush every bone he jerked it awaymrs travers stay he cried they had vanished through the open door and the sound of their footsteps had already died away carter turned about bewildered as if looking for helpwho is he steward who in the name of all the mad devils is he he asked wildly he was confounded by the cold and philosophical tone of the answertaint my place to trouble about that sirnor yours i guessisnt it shouted carter why he has carried the lady off the steward was looking critically at the lamp and after a while screwed the light downthats better he mumbledgood god what is a fellow to do continued carter looking at hassim and immada who were whispering together and gave him only an absent glance he rushed on deck and was struck blind instantly by the night that seemed to have been lying in wait for him he stumbled over something soft kicked something hard flung himself on the rail come back he cried come back captain mrs traversor let me come too  he listened the breeze blew cool against his cheek a black bandage seemed to lie over his eyes gone he groaned utterly crushed and suddenly he heard mrs travers voice remote in the depths of the nightdefend the brig it said and these words pronouncing themselves in the immensity of a lightless universe thrilled every fibre of his body by the commanding sadness of their tone defend defend the brig    i am damned if i do shouted carter in despair unless you come back    mrs travers     as thoughi wereon boardmyself went on the rising cadence of the voice more distant now a marvel of faint and imperious clearness  carter shouted no more he tried to make out the boat for a time and when giving it up he leaped down from the rail the heavy obscurity of the brigs main deck was agitated like a sombre pool by his jump swayed eddied seemed to break up blotches of darkness recoiled drifted away bare feet shuffled hastily confused murmurs died out lascars he muttered the crew is all agog afterward he listened for a moment to the faintly tumultuous snores of the white men sleeping in rows with their heads under the break of the poop somewhere about his feet the yachts black dog invisible and chained to a deckringbolt whined rattled the thin links pattered with his claws in his distress at the unfamiliar surroundings begging for the charity of human notice carter stooped impulsively and was met by a startling lick in the facehallo boy he thumped the thick curly sides stroked the smooth headgood boy rover down lie down dog you dont know what to make of itdo you boy the dog became still as death well neither do i muttered carter but such natures are helped by a cheerful contempt for the intricate and endless suggestions of thought he told himself that he would soon see what was to come of it and dismissed all speculation had he been a little older he would have felt that the situation was beyond his grasp but he was too young to see it whole and in a manner detached from himself all these inexplicable events filled him with deep concernbut then on the other hand he had the key of the magazine and he could not find it in his heart to dislike lingard he was positive about this at last and to know that much after the discomfort of an inward conflict went a long way toward a solution when he followed shaw into the cabin he could not repress a sense of enjoyment or hide a faint and malicious smile  gone awaydid you say and carried off the lady with him discoursed shaw very loud in the doorway did he well i am not surprised what can you expect from a man like that who leaves his ship in an open roadstead withouti wont say ordersbut without as much as a single word to his next in command and at night at that that just shows you the kind of man is this the way to treat a chief mate i apprehend he was riled at the little altercation we had just before you came on board i told him a truth or twobutnever mind theres the law and thats enough for me i am captain as long as he is out of the ship and if his address before very long is not in one of her majestys jails or other i authorize you to call me a dutchman you mark my words  he walked in masterfully sat down and surveyed the cabin in a leisurely and autocratic manner but suddenly his eyes became stony with amazement and indignation he pointed a fat and trembling forefinger  niggers he said huskily in the cuddy in the cuddy he appeared bereft of speech for a time  since he entered the cabin hassim had been watching him in thoughtful and expectant silence i cant have it he continued with genuine feeling in his voice damme ive too much respect for myself he rose with heavy deliberation his eyes bulged out in a severe and dignified stare out you go he bellowed suddenly making a step forwardgreat scott what are you up to mister asked in a tone of dispassionate surprise the steward whose head appeared in the doorway these are the captains friends show me a mans friends and    began shaw dogmatically but abruptly passed into the tone of admonition you take your mug out of the way bottlewasher they aint friends of mine i aint a vagabond i know whats due to myself quit he hissed fiercely hassim with an alert movement grasped the handle of his kris shaw puffed out his cheeks and frownedlook out he will stick you like a prize pig murmured carter without moving a muscle shaw looked round helplesslyand you would enjoy the funwouldnt you he said with slow bitterness carters distant noncommittal smile quite overwhelmed him by its horrid frigidity extreme despondency replaced the proper feeling of racial pride in the primitive soul of the mate my god what luck what have i done to fall amongst that lot he groaned sat down and took his big grey head in his hands carter drew aside to make room for immada who in obedience to a whisper from her brother sought to leave the cabin she passed out after an instant of hesitation during which she looked up at carter once her brother motionless in a defensive attitude protected her retreat she disappeared hassims grip on his weapon relaxed he looked in turn at every object in the cabin as if to fix its position in his mind forever and following his sister walked out with noiseless footfalls  they entered the same darkness which had received enveloped and hidden the troubled souls of lingard and edith but to these two the light from which they had felt themselves driven away was now like the light of forbidden hopes it had the awful and tranquil brightness that a light burning on the shore has for an exhausted swimmer about to give himself up to the fateful sea they looked back it had disappeared carter had shut the cabin door behind them to have it out with shaw he wanted to arrive at some kind of working compromise with the nominal commander but the mate was so demoralized by the novelty of the assaults made upon his respectability that the young defender of the brig could get nothing from him except lamentations mingled with mild blasphemies the brig slept and along her quiet deck the voices raised in her cabinshaws appeals and reproaches directed vociferously to heaven together with carters inflexible drawl mingled into one deadened modulated and continuous murmur the lockouts in the waist motionless and peering into obscurity one ear turned to the sea were aware of that strange resonance like the ghost of a quarrel that seemed to hover at their backs wasub after seeing hassim and immada into their canoe prowled to and fro the whole length of the vessel vigilantly there was not a star in the sky and no gleam on the water there was no horizon no outline no shape for the eye to rest upon nothing for the hand to grasp an obscurity that seemed without limit in space and time had submerged the universe like a destroying flood  a lull of the breeze kept for a time the small boat in the neighbourhood of the brig the hoisted sail invisible fluttered faintly mysteriously and the boat rising and falling bodily to the passage of each invisible undulation of the waters seemed to repose upon a living breast lingard his hand on the tiller sat up erect expectant and silent mrs travers had drawn her cloak close around her body their glances plunged infinitely deep into a lightless void and yet they were still so near the brig that the piteous whine of the dog mingled with the angry rattling of the chain reached their ears faintly evoking obscure images of distress and fury a sharp bark ending in a plaintive howl that seemed raised by the passage of phantoms invisible to men rent the black stillness as though the instinct of the brute inspired by the soul of night had voiced in a lamentable plaint the fear of the future the anguish of lurking death the terror of shadows not far from the brigs boat hassim and immada in their canoe letting their paddles trail in the water sat in a silent and invincible torpor as if the fitful puffs of wind had carried to their hearts the breath of a subtle poison that very soon would make them diehave you seen the white womans eyes cried the girl she struck her palms together loudly and remained with her arms extended with her hands clasped o hassim have you seen her eyes shining under her eyebrows like rays of light darting under the arched boughs in a forest they pierced me i shuddered at the sound of her voice i saw her walk behind himand it seems to me that she does not live on earththat all this is witchcraft  she lamented in the night hassim kept silent he had no illusions and in any other man but lingard he would have thought the proceeding no better than suicidal folly for him travers and dalcacer were two powerful rajahsprobably relatives of the ruler of the land of the english whom he knew to be a woman but why they should come and interfere with the recovery of his own kingdom was an obscure problem he was concerned for lingards safety that the risk was incurred mostly for his sakeso that the prospects of the great enterprise should not be ruined by a quarrel over the lives of these whitesdid not strike him so much as may be imagined there was that in him which made such an action on lingards part appear all but unavoidable was he not rajah hassim and was not the other a man of strong heart of strong arm of proud courage a man great enough to protect highborn princesa friend immadas words called out a smile which like the words was lost in the darkness forget your weariness he said gently lest o sister we should arrive too late the coming day would throw its light on some decisive event hassim thought of his own men who guarded the emma and he wished to be where they could hear his voice he regretted jaffir was not there hassim was saddened by the absence from his side of that man who once had carried what he thought would be his last message to his friend it had not been the last he had lived to cherish new hopes and to face new troubles and perchance to frame another message yet while death knocked with the hands of armed enemies at the gate the breeze steadied the succeeding swells swung the canoe smoothly up the unbroken ridges of water travelling apace along the land they progressed slowly but immadas heart was more weary than her arms and hassim dipping the blade of his paddle without a splash peered right and left trying to make out the shadowy forms of islets a long way ahead of the canoe and holding the same course the brigs dinghy ran with broad lug extended making for that narrow and winding passage between the coast and the southern shoals which led to the mouth of the creek connecting the lagoon with the sea  thus on that starless night the shallows were peopled by uneasy souls the thick veil of clouds stretched over them cut them off from the rest of the universe at times mrs travers had in the darkness the impression of dizzy speed and again it seemed to her that the boat was standing still that everything in the world was standing still and only her fancy roamed free from all trammels lingard perfectly motionless by her side steered shaping his course by the feel of the wind presently he perceived ahead a ghostly flicker of faint livid light which the earth seemed to throw up against the uniform blackness of the sky the dinghy was approaching the expanse of the shallows the confused clamour of broken water deepened its note  how long are we going to sail like this asked mrs travers gently she did not recognize the voice that pronounced the word always in answer to her question it had the impersonal ring of a voice without a master her heart beat fast  captain lingard she cried  yes what he said nervously as if startled out of a dream  i asked you how long we were going to sail like this she repeated distinctly  if the breeze holds we shall be in the lagoon soon after daybreak that will be the right time too i shall leave you on board the hulk with jorgenson  and you what will you do she asked she had to wait for a while  i will do what i can she heard him say at last there was another pause all i can he added  the breeze dropped the sail fluttered  i have perfect confidence in you she said but are you certain of success  no  the futility of her question came home to mrs travers in a few hours of life she had been torn away from all her certitudes flung into a world of improbabilities this thought instead of augmenting her distress seemed to soothe her what she experienced was not doubt and it was not fear it was something else it might have been only a great fatigue  she heard a dull detonation as if in the depth of the sea it was hardly more than a shock and a vibration a roller had broken amongst the shoals the livid clearness lingard had seen ahead flashed and flickered in expanded white sheets much nearer to the boat now and all thisthe wan burst of light the faint shock as of something remote and immense falling into ruins was taking place outside the limits of her life which remained encircled by an impenetrable darkness and by an impenetrable silence puffs of wind blew about her head and expired the sail collapsed shivered audibly stood full and still in turn and again the sensation of vertiginous speed and of absolute immobility succeeding each other with increasing swiftness merged at last into a bizarre state of headlong motion and profound peace the darkness enfolded her like the enervating caress of a sombre universe it was gentle and destructive its languor seduced her soul into surrender nothing existed and even all her memories vanished into space she was content that nothing should exist  lingard aware all the time of their contact in the narrow stern sheets of the boat was startled by the pressure of the womans head drooping on his shoulder he stiffened himself still more as though he had tried on the approach of a danger to conceal his life in the breathless rigidity of his body the boat soared and descended slowly a region of foam and reefs stretched across her course hissing like a gigantic cauldron a strong gust of wind drove her straight at it for a moment then passed on and abandoned her to the regular balancing of the swell the struggle of the rocks forever overwhelmed and emerging with the sea forever victorious and repulsed fascinated the man he watched it as he would have watched something going on within himself while mrs travers slept sustained by his arm pressed to his side abandoned to his support the shoals guarding the shore of refuge had given him his first glimpse of successthe solid support he needed for his action the shallows were the shelter of his dreams their voice had the power to soothe and exalt his thoughts with the promise of freedom for his hopes never had there been such a generous friendship    a mass of white foam whirling about a centre of intense blackness spun silently past the side of the boat    that woman he held like a captive on his arm had also been given to him by the shallows  suddenly his eyes caught on a distant sandbank the red gleam of damans camp fire instantly eclipsed like the wink of a signalling lantern along the level of the waters it brought to his mind the existence of the two menthose other captives if the war canoe transporting them into the lagoon had left the sands shortly after hassims retreat from damans camp travers and dalcacer were by this time far away up the creek every thought of action had become odious to lingard since all he could do in the world now was to hasten the moment of his separation from that woman to whom he had confessed the whole secret of his life  and she slept she could sleep he looked down at her as he would have looked at the slumbering ignorance of a child but the life within him had the fierce beat of supreme moments near by the eddies sighed along the reefs the water soughed amongst the stones clung round the rocks with tragic murmurs that resembled promises goodbyes or prayers from the unfathomable distances of the night came the booming of the swell assaulting the seaward face of the shallows he felt the womans nearness with such intensity that he heard nothing    then suddenly he thought of death  wake up he shouted in her ear swinging round in his seat mrs travers gasped a splash of water flicked her over the eyes and she felt the separate drops run down her cheeks she tasted them on her lips tepid and bitter like tears a swishing undulation tossed the boat on high followed by another and still another and then the boat with the breeze abeam glided through still water laying over at a steady angle  clear of the reef now remarked lingard in a tone of relief  were we in any danger asked mrs travers in a whisper  well the breeze dropped and we drifted in very close to the rocks he answered i had to rouse you it wouldnt have done for you to wake up suddenly struggling in the water  so she had slept it seemed to her incredible that she should have closed her eyes in this small boat with the knowledge of their desperate errand on so disturbed a sea the man by her side leaned forward extended his arm and the boat going off before the wind went on faster on an even keel a motionless black bank resting on the sea stretched infinitely right in their way in ominous stillness she called lingards attention to it look at this awful cloud  this cloud is the coast and in a moment we shall be entering the creek he said quietly mrs travers stared at it was it landland it seemed to her even less palpable than a cloud a mere sinister immobility above the unrest of the sea nursing in its depth the unrest of men who to her mind were no more real than fantastic shadows    v  what struck mrs travers most directly she set eyes on him was the otherworld aspect of jorgenson he had been buried out of sight so long that his tall gaunt body his unhurried mechanical movements his set face and his eyes with an empty gaze suggested an invincible indifference to all the possible surprises of the earth that appearance of a resuscitated man who seemed to be commanded by a conjuring spell strolled along the decks of what was even to mrs travers eyes the mere corpse of a ship and turned on her a pair of deepsunk expressionless eyes with an almost unearthly detachment mrs travers had never been looked at before with that strange and pregnant abstraction yet she didnt dislike jorgenson in the early morning light white from head to foot in a perfectly clean suit of clothes which seemed hardly to contain any limbs freshly shaven jorgensons sunken cheeks with their withered colouring always had a sort of gloss as though he had the habit of shaving every two hours or so he looked as immaculate as though he had been indeed a pure spirit superior to the soiling contacts of the material earth he was disturbing but he was not repulsive he gave no sign of greeting  lingard addressed him at once  you have had a regular staircase built up the side of the hulk jorgenson he said it was very convenient for us to come aboard now but in case of an attack dont you think     i did think there was nothing so dispassionate in the world as the voice of captain h c jorgenson ex barque wild rose since he had recrossed the waters of oblivion to step back into the life of men i did think but since i dont want to make trouble     oh you dont want to make trouble interrupted lingard  no dont believe in it do you king tom  i may have to make trouble  so you came up here in this small dinghy of yours like this to start making trouble did you  whats the matter with you dont you know me yet jorgenson  i thought i knew you how could i tell that a man like you would come along for a fight bringing a woman with him  this lady is mrs travers said lingard the wife of one of the luckless gentlemen daman got hold of last evening    this is jorgenson the friend of whom i have been telling you mrs travers  mrs travers smiled faintly her eyes roamed far and near and the strangeness of her surroundings the overpowering curiosity the conflict of interest and doubt gave her the aspect of one still new to life presenting an innocent and naive attitude before the surprises of experience she looked very guileless and youthful between those two men lingard gazed at her with that unconscious tenderness mingled with wonder which some men manifest toward girlhood there was nothing of a conqueror of kingdoms in his bearing jorgenson preserved his amazing abstraction which seemed neither to hear nor see anything but evidently he kept a mysterious grip on events in the world of living men because he asked very naturally  how did she get away  the lady wasnt on the sandbank explained lingard curtly  what sandbank muttered jorgenson perfunctorily    is the yacht looted tom  nothing of the kind said lingard  ah many dead inquired jorgenson  i tell you there was nothing of the kind said lingard impatiently  what no fight inquired jorgenson again without the slightest sign of animation  no  and you a fighting man  listen to me jorgenson things turned out so that before the time came for a fight it was already too late he turned to mrs travers still looking about with anxious eyes and a faint smile on her lips while i was talking to you that evening from the boat it was already too late no there was never any time for it i have told you all about myself mrs travers and you know that i speak the truth when i say too late if you had only been alone in that yacht going about the seas  yes she struck in but i was not alone  lingard dropped his chin on his breast already a foretaste of noonday heat staled the sparkling freshness of the morning the smile had vanished from edith travers lips and her eyes rested on lingards bowed head with an expression no longer curious but which might have appeared enigmatic to jorgenson if he had looked at her but jorgenson looked at nothing he asked from the remoteness of his dead past what have you left outside tom what is there now  theres the yacht on the shoals my brig at anchor and about a hundred of the worst kind of illanun vagabonds under three chiefs and with two warpraus moored to the edge of the bank maybe daman is with them too out there  no said jorgenson positively  he has come in cried lingard he brought his prisoners in himself then  landed by torchlight uttered precisely the shade of captain jorgenson late of the barque wild rose he swung his arm pointing across the lagoon and mrs travers turned about in that direction  all the scene was but a great light and a great solitude her gaze travelled over the lustrous dark sheet of empty water to a shore bordered by a white beach empty too and showing no sign of human life the human habitations were lost in the shade of the fruit trees masked by the cultivated patches of indian corn and the banana plantations near the shore the rigid lines of two stockaded forts could be distinguished flanking the beach and between them with a great open space before it the brown roof slope of an enormous long building that seemed suspended in the air had a great square flag fluttering above it something like a small white flame in the sky was the carved white coral finial on the gable of the mosque which had caught full the rays of the sun a multitude of gay streamers white and red flew over the halfconcealed roofs over the brilliant fields and amongst the sombre palm groves but it might have been a deserted settlement decorated and abandoned by its departed population lingard pointed to the stockade on the right  thats where your husband is he said to mrs travers  who is the other uttered jorgensons voice at their backs he also was turned that way with his strange sightless gaze fixed beyond them into the void  a spanish gentleman i believe you said mrs travers observed lingard  it is extremely difficult to believe that there is anybody there murmured mrs travers  did you see them both jorgenson asked lingard  made out nobody too far too dark  as a matter of fact jorgenson had seen nothing about an hour before daybreak but the distant glare of torches while the loud shouts of an excited multitude had reached him across the water only like a faint and tempestuous murmur presently the lights went away processionally through the groves of trees into the armed stockades the distant glare vanished in the fading darkness and the murmurs of the invisible crowd ceased suddenly as if carried off by the retreating shadow of the night daylight followed swiftly disclosing to the sleepless jorgenson the solitude of the shore and the ghostly outlines of the familiar forms of grouped trees and scattered human habitations he had watched the varied colours come out in the dawn the wide cultivated settlement of many shades of green framed far away by the fine black lines of the forestedge that was its limit and its protection  mrs travers stood against the rail as motionless as a statue her face had lost all its mobility and her cheeks were dead white as if all the blood in her body had flowed back into her heart and had remained there her very lips had lost their colour lingard caught hold of her arm roughly  dont mrs travers why are you terrifying yourself like this if you dont believe what i say listen to me asking jorgenson     yes ask me mumbled jorgenson in his white moustache  speak straight jorgenson what do you think are the gentlemen alive  certainly said jorgenson in a sort of disappointed tone as though he had expected a much more difficult question  is their life in immediate danger  of course not said jorgenson  lingard turned away from the oracle you have heard him mrs travers you may believe every word he says there isnt a thought or a purpose in that settlement he continued pointing at the dumb solitude of the lagoon that this man doesnt know as if they were his own  i know ask me muttered jorgenson mechanically  mrs travers said nothing but made a slight movement and her whole rigid figure swayed dangerously lingard put his arm firmly round her waist and she did not seem aware of it till after she had turned her head and found lingards face very near her own but his eyes full of concern looked so close into hers that she was obliged to shut them like a woman about to faint  the effect this produced upon lingard was such that she felt the tightening of his arm and as she opened her eyes again some of the colour returned to her face she met the deepened expression of his solicitude with a look so steady with a gaze that in spite of herself was so profoundly vivid that its clearness seemed to lingard to throw all his past life into shadei dont feel faint it isnt that at all she declared in a perfectly calm voice it seemed to lingard as cold as ice  very well he agreed with a resigned smile but you just catch hold of that rail please before i let you go she too forced a smile on her lips  what incredulity she remarked and for a time made not the slightest movement at last as if making a concession she rested the tips of her fingers on the rail lingard gradually removed his arm and pray dont look upon me as a conventional weak woman person the delicate lady of your own conception she said facing lingard with her arm extended to the rail make that effort please against your own conception of what a woman like me should be i am perhaps as strong as you are captain lingard i mean it literally in my bodydont you think i have seen that long ago she heard his deep voice protestingand as to my courage mrs travers continued her expression charmingly undecided between frowns and smiles didnt i tell you only a few hours ago only last evening that i was not capable of thinking myself into a fright you remember when you were begging me to try something of the kind dont imagine that i would have been ashamed to try but i couldnt have done it no not even for the sake of somebody elses kingdom do you understand me  god knows said the attentive lingard after a time with an unexpected sigh you people seem to be made of another stuff  what has put that absurd notion into your head  i didnt mean better or worse and i wouldnt say it isnt good stuff either what i meant to say is that its different one feels it and here we are  yes here we are repeated mrs travers and as to this moment of emotion what provoked it is not a concern for anybody or anything outside myself i felt no terror i cannot even fix my fears upon any distinct image you think i am shamelessly heartless in telling you this  lingard made no sign it didnt occur to him to make a sign he simply hung on mrs travers words as it were only for the sake of the soundi am simply frank with you she continued what do i know of savagery violence murder i have never seen a dead body in my life the light the silence the mysterious emptiness of this place have suddenly affected my imagination i suppose what is the meaning of this wonderful peace in which we standyou and i alone  lingard shook his head he saw the narrow gleam of the womans teeth between the parted lips of her smile as if all the ardour of her conviction had been dissolved at the end of her speech into wistful recognition of their partnership before things outside their knowledge and he was warmed by something a little helpless in that smile within three feet of them the shade of jorgenson very gaunt and neat stared into space  yes you are strong said lingard but a whole long night sitting in a small boat i wonder you are not too stiff to stand  i am not stiff in the least she interrupted still smiling i am really a very strong woman she added earnestly whatever happens you may reckon on that fact  lingard gave her an admiring glance but the shade of jorgenson perhaps catching in its remoteness the sound of the word woman was suddenly moved to begin scolding with all the liberty of a ghost in a flow of passionless indignation  woman thats what i say thats just about the last touchthat you tom lingard redeyed tom king tom and all those fine names that you should leave your weapons twenty miles behind you your men your guns your brig that is your strength and come along here with your mouth full of fight barehanded and with a woman in towwellwell  dont forget jorgenson that the lady hears you remonstrated lingard in a vexed tone    he doesnt mean to be rude he remarked to mrs travers quite loud as if indeed jorgenson were but an immaterial and feelingless illusion he has forgotten  the woman is not in the least offended i ask for nothing better than to be taken on that footing  forgot nothing mumbled jorgenson with a sort of ghostly assertiveness and as it were for his own satisfaction whats the world coming to  it was i who insisted on coming with captain lingard said mrs travers treating jorgenson to a fascinating sweetness of tone  thats what i say what is the world coming to hasnt king tom a mind of his own what has come over him hes mad leaving his brig with a hundred and twenty born and bred pirates of the worst kind in two praus on the other side of a sandbank did you insist on that too has he put himself in the hands of a strange woman  jorgenson seemed to be asking those questions of himself mrs travers observed the empty stare the selfcommuning voice his unearthly lack of animation somehow it made it very easy to speak the whole truth to him  no she said it is i who am altogether in his hands  nobody would have guessed that jorgenson had heard a single word of that emphatic declaration if he had not addressed himself to lingard with the question neither more nor less abstracted than all his other speeches  why then did you bring her along  you dont understand it was only right and proper one of the gentlemen is the ladys husband  oh yes muttered jorgenson whos the other  you have been told a friend  poor mr dalcacer said mrs travers what bad luck for him to have accepted our invitation but he is really a mere acquaintance  i hardly noticed him observed lingard gloomily he was talking to you over the back of your chair when i came aboard the yacht as if he had been a very good friend  we always understood each other very well said mrs travers picking up from the rail the long glass that was lying there i always liked him the frankness of his mind and his great loyalty  what did he do asked lingard  he loved said mrs travers lightly but thats an old story she raised the glass to her eyes one arm extended fully to sustain the long tube and lingard forgot dalcacer in admiring the firmness of her pose and the absolute steadiness of the heavy glass she was as firm as a rock after all those emotions and all that fatigue  mrs travers directed the glass instinctively toward the entrance of the lagoon the smooth water there shone like a piece of silver in the dark frame of the forest a black speck swept across the field of her vision it was some time before she could find it again and then she saw apparently so near as to be within reach of the voice a small canoe with two people in it she saw the wet paddles rising and dipping with a flash in the sunlight she made out plainly the face of immada who seemed to be looking straight into the big end of the telescope the chief and his sister after resting under the bank for a couple of hours in the middle of the night had entered the lagoon and were making straight for the hulk they were already near enough to be perfectly distinguishable to the naked eye if there had been anybody on board to glance that way but nobody was even thinking of them they might not have existed except perhaps in the memory of old jorgenson but that was mostly busy with all the mysterious secrets of his late tomb  mrs travers lowered the glass suddenly lingard came out from a sort of trance and said  mr dalcacer loved why shouldnt he  mrs travers looked frankly into lingards gloomy eyes it isnt that alone of course she said first of all he knew how to love and then    you dont know how artificial and barren certain kinds of life can be but mr dalcacers life was not that his devotion was worth having  you seem to know a lot about him said lingard enviously why do you smile she continued to smile at him for a little while the long brass tube over her shoulder shone like gold against the pale fairness of her bare headat a thought she answered preserving the low tone of the conversation into which they had fallen as if their words could have disturbed the selfabsorption of captain h c jorgenson at the thought that for all my long acquaintance with mr dalcacer i dont know half as much about him as i know about you  ah thats impossible contradicted lingard spaniard or no spaniard he is one of your kind  tarred with the same brush murmured mrs travers with only a halfamused irony but lingard continued  he was trying to make it up between me and your husband wasnt he i was too angry to pay much attention but i liked him well enough what pleased me most was the way in which he gave it up that was done like a gentleman do you understand what i mean mrs travers  i quite understand  yes you would he commented simply but just then i was too angry to talk to anybody and so i cleared out on board my own ship and stayed there not knowing what to do and wishing you all at the bottom of the sea dont mistake me mrs travers its you the people aft that i wished at the bottom of the sea i had nothing against the poor devils on board they would have trusted me quick enough so i fumed there tilltill     till nine oclock or a little after suggested mrs travers impenetrably  no till i remembered you said lingard with the utmost innocence  do you mean to say that you forgot my existence so completely till then you had spoken to me on board the yacht you know  did i i thought i did what did i say  you told me not to touch a dusky princess answered mrs travers with a short laugh then with a visible change of mood as if she had suddenly out of a light heart been recalled to the sense of the true situation but indeed i meant no harm to this figure of your dream and look over there she is pursuing you lingard glanced toward the north shore and suppressed an exclamation of remorse for the second time he discovered that he had forgotten the existence of hassim and immada the canoe was now near enough for its occupants to distinguish plainly the heads of three people above the low bulwark of the emma immada let her paddle trail suddenly in the water with the exclamation i see the white woman there her brother looked over his shoulder and the canoe floated arrested as if by the sudden power of a spellthey are no dream to me muttered lingard sturdily mrs travers turned abruptly away to look at the further shore it was still and empty to the naked eye and seemed to quiver in the sunshine like an immense painted curtain lowered upon the unknown  heres rajah hassim coming jorgenson i had an idea he would perhaps stay outside mrs travers heard lingards voice at her back and the answering grunt of jorgenson she raised deliberately the long glass to her eye pointing it at the shore  she distinguished plainly now the colours in the flutter of the streamers above the brown roofs of the large settlement the stir of palm groves the black shadows inland and the dazzling white beach of coral sand all ablaze in its formidable mystery she swept the whole range of the view and was going to lower the glass when from behind the massive angle of the stockade there stepped out into the brilliant immobility of the landscape a man in a long white gown and with an enormous black turban surmounting a dark face slow and grave he paced the beach ominously in the sunshine an enigmatical figure in an oriental tale with something weird and menacing in its sudden emergence and lonely progress  with an involuntary gasp mrs travers lowered the glass all at once behind her back she heard a low musical voice beginning to pour out incomprehensible words in a tone of passionate pleading hassim and immada had come on board and had approached lingard yes it was intolerable to feel that this flow of soft speech which had no meaning for her could make its way straight into that mans heart    part v the point of honour and the point of passion  i  may i come in  yes said a voice within the door is open it had a wooden latch mr travers lifted it while the voice of his wife continued as he entered did you imagine i had locked myself in did you ever know me lock myself in  mr travers closed the door behind him no it has never come to that he said in a tone that was not conciliatory in that place which was a room in a wooden hut and had a square opening without glass but with a halfclosed shutter he could not distinguish his wife very well at once she was sitting in an armchair and what he could see best was her fair hair all loose over the back of the chair there was a moment of silence the measured footsteps of two men pacing athwart the quarterdeck of the dead ship emma commanded by the derelict shade of jorgenson could be heard outside  jorgenson on taking up his dead command had a house of thin boards built on the after deck for his own accommodation and that of lingard during his flying visits to the shore of refuge a narrow passage divided it in two and lingards side was furnished with a camp bedstead a rough desk and a rattan armchair on one of his visits lingard had brought with him a black seamans chest and left it there apart from these objects and a small lookingglass worth about half a crown and nailed to the wall there was nothing else in there whatever what was on jorgensons side of the deckhouse no one had seen but from external evidence one could infer the existence of a set of razors  the erection of that primitive deckhouse was a matter of propriety rather than of necessity it was proper that the white men should have a place to themselves on board but lingard was perfectly accurate when he told mrs travers that he had never slept there once his practice was to sleep on deck as to jorgenson if he did sleep at all he slept very little it might have been said that he haunted rather than commanded the emma his white form flitted here and there in the night or stood for hours silent contemplating the sombre glimmer of the lagoon mr travers eyes accustomed gradually to the dusk of the place could now distinguish more of his wifes person than the great mass of honeycoloured hair he saw her face the dark eyebrows and her eyes that seemed profoundly black in the half light he said  you couldnt have done so here there is neither lock nor bolt  isnt there i didnt notice i would know how to protect myself without locks and bolts  i am glad to hear it said mr travers in a sullen tone and fell silent again surveying the woman in the chair indulging your taste for fancy dress he went on with faint irony  mrs travers clasped her hands behind her head the wide sleeves slipping back bared her arms to her shoulders she was wearing a malay thin cotton jacket cut low in the neck without a collar and fastened with wrought silver clasps from the throat downward she had replaced her yachting skirt by a blue check sarong embroidered with threads of gold mr travers eyes travelling slowly down attached themselves to the gleaming instep of an agitated foot from which hung a light leather sandal  i had no clothes with me but what i stood in said mrs travers i found my yachting costume too heavy it was intolerable i was soaked in dew when i arrived so when these things were produced for my inspection     by enchantment muttered mr travers in a tone too heavy for sarcasm  no out of that chest there are very fine stuffs there  no doubt said mr travers the man wouldnt be above plundering the natives    he sat down heavily on the chest a most appropriate costume for this farce he continued but do you mean to wear it in open daylight about the decks  indeed i do said mrs travers dalcacer has seen me already and he didnt seem shocked  you should said mr travers try to get yourself presented with some bangles for your ankles so that you may jingle as you walk  bangles are not necessities said mrs travers in a weary tone and with the fixed upward look of a person unwilling to relinquish her dream mr travers dropped the subject to ask  and how long is this farce going to last  mrs travers unclasped her hands lowered her glance and changed her whole pose in a moment  what do you mean by farce what farce  the one which is being played at my expense  you believe that  not only believe i feel deeply that it is so at my expense its a most sinister thing mr travers pursued still with downcast eyes and in an unforgiving tone i must tell you that when i saw you in that courtyard in a crowd of natives and leaning on that mans arm it gave me quite a shock  did i too look sinister said mrs travers turning her head slightly toward her husband and yet i assure you that i was glad profoundly glad to see you safe from danger for a time at least to gain time is everything     i ask myself mr travers meditated aloud was i ever in danger am i safe now i dont know i cant tell no all this seems an abominable farce  there was that in his tone which made his wife continue to look at him with awakened interest it was obvious that he suffered from a distress which was not the effect of fear and mrs travers face expressed real concern till he added in a freezing manner the question however is as to your discretion  she leaned back again in the chair and let her hands rest quietly in her lap would you have preferred me to remain outside in the yacht in the near neighbourhood of these wild men who captured you or do you think that they too were got up to carry on a farce  most decidedly mr travers raised his head though of course not his voice you ought to have remained in the yacht amongst white men your servants the sailingmaster the crew whose duty it was to    who would have been ready to die for you  i wonder why they should haveand why i should have asked them for that sacrifice however i have no doubt they would have died or would you have preferred me to take up my quarters on board that mans brig we were all fairly safe there the real reason why i insisted on coming in here was to be nearer to youto see for myself what could be or was being done    but really if you want me to explain my motives then i may just as well say nothing i couldnt remain outside for days without news in a state of horrible doubt we couldnt even tell whether you and dalcacer were still alive till we arrived here you might have been actually murdered on the sandbank after rajah hassim and that girl had gone away or killed while going up the river and i wanted to know at once as soon as possible it was a matter of impulse i went off in what i stood in without delaying a moment  yes said mr travers and without even thinking of having a few things put up for me in a bag no doubt you were in a state of excitement unless you took such a tragic view that it seemed to you hardly worth while to bother about my clothes  it was absolutely the impulse of the moment i could have done nothing else wont you give me credit for it  mr travers raised his eyes again to his wifes face he saw it calm her attitude reposeful till then his tone had been resentful dull without sarcasm but now he became slightly pompous  no as a matter of fact as a matter of experience i cant credit you with the possession of feelings appropriate to your origin social position and the ideas of the class to which you belong it was the heaviest disappointment of my life i had made up my mind not to mention it as long as i lived this however seems an occasion which you have provoked yourself it isnt at all a solemn occasion i dont look upon it as solemn at all its very disagreeable and humiliating but it has presented itself you have never taken a serious interest in the activities of my life which of course are its distinction and its value and why you should be carried away suddenly by a feeling toward the mere man i dont understand  therefore you dont approve mrs travers commented in an even tone but i assure you you may safely my feeling was of the most conventional nature exactly as if the whole world were looking on after all we are husband and wife its eminently fitting that i should be concerned about your fate even the man you distrust and dislike so much the warmest feeling let me tell you that i ever saw you display even that man found my conduct perfectly proper his own word proper so eminently proper that it altogether silenced his objections  mr travers shifted uneasily on his seat  its my belief edith that if you had been a man you would have led a most irregular life you would have been a frank adventurer i mean morally it has been a great grief to me you have a scorn in you for the serious side of life for the ideas and the ambitions of the social sphere to which you belong  he stopped because his wife had clasped again her hands behind her head and was no longer looking at him  its perfectly obvious he began again we have been living amongst most distinguished men and women and your attitude to them has been always soso negative you would never recognize the importance of achievements of acquired positions i dont remember you ever admiring frankly any political or social success i ask myself what after all you could possibly have expected from life  i could never have expected to hear such a speech from you as to what i did expect    i must have been very stupid  no you are anything but that declared mr travers conscientiously it isnt stupidity he hesitated for a moment its a kind of wilfulness i think i preferred not to think about this grievous difference in our points of view which you will admit i could not have possibly foreseen before we     a sort of solemn embarrassment had come over mr travers mrs travers leaning her chin on the palm of her hand stared at the bare matchboard side of the hut  do you charge me with profound girlish duplicity she asked very softly  the inside of the deckhouse was full of stagnant heat perfumed by a slight scent which seemed to emanate from the loose mass of mrs travers hair mr travers evaded the direct question which struck him as lacking fineness even to the point of impropriety  i must suppose that i was not in the calm possession of my insight and judgment in those days he said ii was not in a critical state of mind at the time he admitted further but even after going so far he did not look up at his wife and therefore missed something like the ghost of a smile on mrs travers lips that smile was tinged with scepticism which was too deepseated for anything but the faintest expression therefore she said nothing and mr travers went on as if thinking aloud  your conduct was of course above reproach but you made for yourself a detestable reputation of mental superiority expressed ironically you inspired mistrust in the best people you were never popular  i was bored murmured mrs travers in a reminiscent tone and with her chin resting in the hollow of her hand  mr travers got up from the seamans chest as unexpectedly as if he had been stung by a wasp but of course with a much slower and more solemn motion  the matter with you edith is that at heart you are perfectly primitive mrs travers stood up too with a supple leisurely movement and raising her hands to her hair turned half away with a pensive remark  imperfectly civilized  imperfectly disciplined corrected mr travers after a moment of dreary meditation  she let her arms fall and turned her head  no dont say that she protested with strange earnestness i am the most severely disciplined person in the world i am tempted to say that my discipline has stopped at nothing short of killing myself i suppose you can hardly understand what i mean  mr travers made a slight grimace at the floor  i shall not try he said it sounds like something that a barbarian hating the delicate complexities and the restraints of a nobler life might have said from you it strikes me as wilful bad taste    i have often wondered at your tastes you have always liked extreme opinions exotic costumes lawless characters romantic personalitieslike dalcacer     poor mr dalcacer murmured mrs travers  a man without any ideas of duty or usefulness said mr travers acidly what are you pitying him for  why for finding himself in this position out of mere goodnature he had nothing to expect from joining our voyage no advantage for his political ambitions or anything of the kind i suppose you asked him on board to break our teteatete which must have grown wearisome to you  i am never bored declared mr travers dalcacer seemed glad to come and being a spaniard the horrible waste of time cannot matter to him in the least  waste of time repeated mrs travers indignantly  he may yet have to pay for his good nature with his life  mr travers could not conceal a movement of anger  ah i forgot those assumptions he said between his clenched teeth he is a mere spaniard he takes this farcical conspiracy with perfect nonchalance decayed races have their own philosophy  he takes it with a dignity of his own  i dont know what you call his dignity i should call it lack of selfrespect  why because he is quiet and courteous and reserves his judgment and allow me to tell you martin that you are not taking our troubles very well  you cant expect from me all those foreign affectations i am not in the habit of compromising with my feelings  mrs travers turned completely round and faced her husband you sulk she said    mr travers jerked his head back a little as if to let the word go pasti am outraged he declared mrs travers recognized there something like real sufferingi assure you she said seriously for she was accessible to pity i assure you that this strange lingard has no idea of your importance he doesnt know anything of your social and political position and still less of your great ambitions mr travers listened with some attentioncouldnt you have enlightened him he askedit would have been no use his mind is fixed upon his own position and upon his own sense of power he is a man of the lower classes   he is a brute said mr travers obstinately and for a moment those two looked straight into each others eyesoh said mrs travers slowly you are determined not to compromise with your feelings an undertone of scorn crept into her voice but shall i tell you what i think i think and she advanced her head slightly toward the pale unshaven face that confronted her dark eyes i think that for all your blind scorn you judge the man well enough to feel that you can indulge your indignation with perfect safety do you hear with perfect safety directly she had spoken she regretted these words really it was unreasonable to take mr travers tricks of character more passionately on this spot of the eastern archipelago full of obscure plots and warring motives than in the more artificial atmosphere of the town after all what she wanted was simply to save his life not to make him understand anything mr travers opened his mouth and without uttering a word shut it again his wife turned toward the lookingglass nailed to the wall she heard his voice behind her  edith wheres the truth in all this  she detected the anguish of a slow mind with an instinctive dread of obscure places wherein new discoveries can be made she looked over her shoulder to say  its on the surface i assure you altogether on the surface  she turned again to the lookingglass where her own face met her with dark eyes and a fair mist of hair above the smooth forehead but her words had produced no soothing effect  but what does it mean cried mr travers why doesnt the fellow apologize why are we kept here are we being kept here why dont we get away why doesnt he take me back on board my yacht what does he want from me how did he procure our release from these people on shore who he says intended to cut our throats why did they give us up to him instead  mrs travers began to twist her hair on her head  matters of high policy and of local politics conflict of personal interests mistrust between the parties intrigues of individualsyou ought to know how that sort of thing works his diplomacy made use of all that the first thing to do was not to liberate you but to get you into his keeping he is a very great man here and let me tell you that your safety depends on his dexterity in the use of his prestige rather than on his power which he cannot use if you would let him talk to you i am sure he would tell you as much as it is possible for him to disclose  i dont want to be told about any of his rascalities but havent you been taken into his confidence  completely admitted mrs travers peering into the small lookingglass  what is the influence you brought to bear upon this man it looks to me as if our fate were in your hands  your fate is not in my hands it is not even in his hands there is a moral situation here which must be solved  ethics of blackmail commented mr travers with unexpected sarcasm it flashed through his wifes mind that perhaps she didnt know him so well as she had supposed it was as if the polished and solemn crust of hard proprieties had cracked slightly here and there under the strain disclosing the mere wrongheadedness of a common mortal but it was only manner that had cracked a little the marvellous stupidity of his conceit remained the same she thought that this discussion was perfectly useless and as she finished putting up her hair she said i think we had better go on deck now  you propose to go out on deck like this muttered mr travers with downcast eyes  like this certainly its no longer a novelty who is going to be shocked  mr travers made no reply what she had said of his attitude was very true he sulked at the enormous offensiveness of men things and events of words and even of glances which he seemed to feel physically resting on his skin like a pain like a degrading contact he managed not to wince but he sulked his wife continued and let me tell you that those clothes are fit for a princessi mean they are of the quality material and style custom prescribes for the highest in the land a fardistant land where i am informed women rule as much as the men in fact they were meant to be presented to an actual princess in due course they were selected with the greatest care for that child immada captain lingard     mr travers made an inarticulate noise partaking of a groan and a grunt  well i must call him by some name and this i thought would be the least offensive for you to hear after all the man exists but he is known also on a certain portion of the earths surface as king tom dalcacer is greatly taken by that name it seems to him wonderfully well adapted to the man in its familiarity and deference and if you prefer     i would prefer to hear nothing said mr travers distinctly not a single word not even from you till i am a free agent again but words dont touch me nothing can touch me neither your sinister warnings nor the moods of levity which you think proper to display before a man whose life according to you hangs on a thread  i never forget it for a moment said mrs travers and i not only know that it does but i also know the strength of the thread it is a wonderful thread you may say if you like it has been spun by the same fate which made you what you are  mr travers felt awfully offended he had never heard anybody let alone his own self addressed in such terms the tone seemed to question his very quality he reflected with shocked amazement that he had lived with that woman for eight years and he said to her gloomily  you talk like a pagan  it was a very strong condemnation which apparently mrs travers had failed to hear for she pursued with animation  but really you cant expect me to meditate on it all the time or shut myself up here and mourn the circumstances from morning to night it would be morbid let us go on deck  and you look simply heathenish in this costume mr travers went on as though he had not been interrupted and with an accent of deliberate disgust  her heart was heavy but everything he said seemed to force the tone of levity on to her lips as long as i dont look like a guy she remarked negligently and then caught the direction of his lurid stare which as a matter of fact was fastened on her bare feet she checked herself oh yes if you prefer it i will put on my stockings but you know i must be very careful of them its the only pair i have here i have washed them this morning in that bathroom which is built over the stern they are now drying over the rail just outside perhaps you will be good enough to pass them to me when you go on deck  mr travers spun round and went on deck without a word as soon as she was alone mrs travers pressed her hands to her temples a gesture of distress which relieved her by its sincerity the measured footsteps of two men came to her plainly from the deck rhythmic and double with a suggestion of tranquil and friendly intercourse she distinguished particularly the footfalls of the man whose lifes orbit was most remote from her own and yet the orbits had cut a few days ago she could not have even conceived of his existence and now he was the man whose footsteps it seemed to her her ears could single unerringly in the tramp of a crowd it was indeed a fabulous thing in the half light of her overheated shelter she let an irresolute frightened smile pass off her lips before she too went on deck    ii  an ingeniously constructed framework of light posts and thin laths occupied the greater part of the deck amidships of the emma the four walls of that airy structure were made of muslin it was comparatively lofty a doorlike arrangement of light battens filled with calico was further protected by a system of curtains calculated to baffle the pursuit of mosquitoes that haunted the shores of the lagoon in great singing clouds from sunset till sunrise a lot of fine mats covered the deck space within the transparent shelter devised by lingard and jorgenson to make mrs travers existence possible during the time when the fate of the two men and indeed probably of everybody else on board the emma had to hang in the balance very soon lingards unbidden and fatal guests had learned the trick of stepping in and out of the place quickly mr dalcacer performed the feat without apparent haste almost nonchalantly yet as well as anybody it was generally conceded that he had never let a mosquito in together with himself mr travers dodged in and out without grace and was obviously much irritated at the necessity mrs travers did it in a manner all her own with marked cleverness and an unconscious air there was an improvised table in there and some wicker armchairs which jorgenson had produced from somewhere in the depths of the ship it was hard to say what the inside of the emma did not contain it was crammed with all sorts of goods like a general store that old hulk was the arsenal and the warchest of lingards political action she was stocked with muskets and gunpowder with bales of longcloth of cotton prints of silks with bags of rice and currency brass guns she contained everything necessary for dealing death and distributing bribes to act on the cupidity and upon the fears of men to march and to organize to feed the friends and to combat the enemies of the cause she held wealth and power in her flanks that grounded ship that would swim no more without masts and with the best part of her deck cumbered by the two structures of thin boards and of transparent muslin  within the latter lived the europeans visible in the daytime to the few malays on board as if through a white haze in the evening the lighting of the hurricane lamps inside turned them into dark phantoms surrounded by a shining mist against which the insect world rushing in its millions out of the forest on the bank was baffled mysteriously in its assault rigidly enclosed by transparent walls like captives of an enchanted cobweb they moved about sat gesticulated conversed publicly during the day and at night when all the lanterns but one were extinguished their slumbering shapes covered all over by white cotton sheets on the camp bedsteads which were brought in every evening conveyed the gruesome suggestion of dead bodies reposing on stretchers the food such as it was was served within that glorified mosquito net which everybody called the cage without any humorous intention at meal times the party from the yacht had the company of lingard who attached to this ordeal a sense of duty performed at the altar of civility and conciliation he could have no conception how much his presence added to the exasperation of mr travers because mr travers manner was too intensely consistent to present any shades it was determined by an ineradicable conviction that he was a victim held to ransom on some incomprehensible terms by an extraordinary and outrageous bandit this conviction strung to the highest pitch never left him for a moment being the object of indignant meditation to his mind and even clinging as it were to his very body it lurked in his eyes in his gestures in his ungracious mutters and in his sinister silences the shock to his moral being had ended by affecting mr travers physical machine he was aware of hepatic pains suffered from accesses of somnolence and suppressed gusts of fury which frightened him secretly his complexion had acquired a yellow tinge while his heavy eyes had become bloodshot because of the smoke of the open wood fires during his three days detention inside belarabs stockade his eyes had been always very sensitive to outward conditions dalcacers fine black eyes were more enduring and his appearance did not differ very much from his ordinary appearance on board the yacht he had accepted with smiling thanks the offer of a thin blue flannel tunic from jorgenson those two men were much of the same build though of course dalcacer quietly alive and spiritually watchful did not resemble jorgenson who without being exactly macabre behaved more like an indifferent but restless corpse those two could not be said to have ever conversed together conversation with jorgenson was an impossible thing even lingard never attempted the feat he propounded questions to jorgenson much as a magician would interrogate an evoked shade or gave him curt directions as one would make use of some marvellous automaton and that was apparently the way in which jorgenson preferred to be treated lingards real company on board the emma was dalcacer dalcacer had met lingard on the easy terms of a man accustomed all his life to good society in which the very affectations must be carried on without effort whether affectation or nature or inspired discretion dalcacer never let the slightest curiosity pierce the smoothness of his level grave courtesy lightened frequently by slight smiles which often had not much connection with the words he uttered except that somehow they made them sound kindly and as it were tactful in their character however those words were strictly neutral  the only time when lingard had detected something of a deeper comprehension in dalcacer was the day after the long negotiations inside belarabs stockade for the temporary surrender of the prisoners that move had been suggested to him exactly as mrs travers had told her husband by the rivalries of the parties and the state of public opinion in the settlement deprived of the presence of the man who theoretically at least was the greatest power and the visible ruler of the shore of refuge belarab still lingered at his fathers tomb whether that man of the embittered and pacific heart had withdrawn there to meditate upon the unruliness of mankind and the thankless nature of his task or whether he had gone there simply to bathe in a particularly clear pool which was a feature of the place give himself up to the enjoyment of a certain fruit which grew in profusion there and indulge for a time in a scrupulous performance of religious exercises his absence from the settlement was a fact of the utmost gravity it is true that the prestige of a longunquestioned rulership and the longsettled mental habits of the people had caused the captives to be taken straight to belarabs stockade as a matter of course belarab at a distance could still outweigh the power on the spot of tengga whose secret purposes were no better known who was jovial talkative outspoken and pugnacious but who was not a professed servant of god famed for many charities and a scrupulous performance of pious practices and who also had no father who had achieved a local saintship but belarab with his glamour of asceticism and melancholy together with a reputation for severity for a man so pious would be naturally ruthless was not on the spot the only favourable point in his absence was the fact that he had taken with him his latest wife the same lady whom jorgenson had mentioned in his letter to lingard as anxious to bring about battle murder and the looting of the yacht not because of inborn wickedness of heart but from a simple desire for silks jewels and other objects of personal adornment quite natural in a girl so young and elevated to such a high position belarab had selected her to be the companion of his retirement and lingard was glad of it he was not afraid of her influence over belarab he knew his man no words no blandishments no sulks scoldings or whisperings of a favourite could affect either the resolves or the irresolutions of that arab whose action ever seemed to hang in mystic suspense between the contradictory speculations and judgments disputing the possession of his will it was not what belarab would either suddenly do or leisurely determine upon that lingard was afraid of the danger was that in his taciturn hesitation which had something hopelessly godlike in its remote calmness the man would do nothing and leave his white friend face to face with unruly impulses against which lingard had no means of action but force which he dared not use since it would mean the destruction of his plans and the downfall of his hopes and worse still would wear an aspect of treachery to hassim and immada those fugitives whom he had snatched away from the jaws of death on a night of storm and had promised to lead back in triumph to their own country he had seen but once sleeping unmoved under the wrath and fire of heaven  on the afternoon of the very day he had arrived with her on board the emmato the infinite disgust of jorgensonlingard held with mrs travers after she had had a couple of hours rest a long fiery and perplexed conversation from the nature of the problem it could not be exhaustive but toward the end of it they were both feeling thoroughly exhausted mrs travers had no longer to be instructed as to facts and possibilities she was aware of them only too well and it was not her part to advise or argue she was not called upon to decide or to plead the situation was far beyond that but she was worn out with watching the passionate conflict within the man who was both so desperately reckless and so rigidly restrained in the very ardour of his heart and the greatness of his soul it was a spectacle that made her forget the actual questions at issue this was no stage play and yet she had caught herself looking at him with bated breath as at a great actor on a darkened stage in some simple and tremendous drama he extorted from her a response to the forces that seemed to tear at his singleminded brain at his guileless breast he shook her with his own struggles he possessed her with his emotions and imposed his personality as if its tragedy were the only thing worth considering in this matter and yet what had she to do with all those obscure and barbarous things obviously nothing unluckily she had been taken into the confidence of that mans passionate perplexity a confidence provoked apparently by nothing but the power of her personality she was flattered and even more she was touched by it she was aware of something that resembled gratitude and provoked a sort of emotional return as between equals who had secretly recognized each others value yet at the same time she regretted not having been left in the dark as much in the dark as mr travers himself or dalcacer though as to the latter it was impossible to say how much precise unaccountable intuitive knowledge was buried under his unruffled manner  dalcacer was the sort of man whom it would be much easier to suspect of anything in the world than ignoranceor stupidity naturally he couldnt know anything definite or even guess at the bare outline of the facts but somehow he must have scented the situation in those few days of contact with lingard he was an acute and sympathetic observer in all his secret aloofness from the life of men which was so very different from jorgensons secret divorce from the passions of this earth mrs travers would have liked to share with dalcacer the burden for it was a burden of lingards story after all she had not provoked those confidences neither had that unexpected adventurer from the sea laid on her an obligation of secrecy no not even by implication he had never said to her that she was the only person whom he wished to know that story  no what he had said was that she was the only person to whom he could tell the tale himself as if no one else on earth had the power to draw it from him that was the sense and nothing more yes it would have been a relief to tell dalcacer it would have been a relief to her feeling of being shut off from the world alone with lingard as if within the four walls of a romantic palace and in an exotic atmosphere yes that relief and also another that of sharing the responsibility with somebody fit to understand yet she shrank from it with unaccountable reserve as if by talking of lingard with dalcacer she was bound to give him an insight into herself it was a vague uneasiness and yet so persistent that she felt it too when she had to approach and talk to lingard under dalcacers eyes not that mr dalcacer would ever dream of staring or even casting glances but was he averting his eyes on purpose that would be even more offensive  i am stupid whispered mrs travers to herself with a complete and reassuring conviction yet she waited motionless till the footsteps of the two men stopped outside the deckhouse then separated and died away before she went out on deck she came out on deck some time after her husband as if in intended contrast to the conflicts of men a great aspect of serenity lay upon all visible things mr travers had gone inside the cage in which he really looked like a captive and thoroughly out of place dalcacer had gone in there too but he preservedor was it an illusionan air of independence it was not that he put it on like mr travers he sat in a wicker armchair in very much the same attitude as the other gentleman and also silent but there was somewhere a subtle difference which did away with the notion of captivity moreover dalcacer had that peculiar gift of never looking out of place in any surroundings mrs travers in order to save her european boots for active service had been persuaded to use a pair of leather sandals also extracted from that seamans chest in the deckhouse an additional fastening had been put on them but she could not avoid making a delicate clatter as she walked on the deck no part of her costume made her feel so exotic it also forced her to alter her usual gait and move with quick short steps very much like immada  i am robbing the girl of her clothes she had thought to herself besides other things she knew by this time that a girl of such high rank would never dream of wearing anything that had been worn by somebody else  at the slight noise of mrs travers sandals dalcacer looked over the back of his chair but he turned his head away at once and mrs travers leaning her elbow on the rail and resting her head on the palm of her hand looked across the calm surface of the lagoon idly  she was turning her back on the cage the forepart of the deck and the edge of the nearest forest that great erection of enormous solid trunks dark rugged columns festooned with writhing creepers and steeped in gloom was so close to the bank that by looking over the side of the ship she could see inverted in the glassy belt of water its massive and black reflection on the reflected sky that gave the impression of a clear blue abyss seen through a transparent film and when she raised her eyes the same abysmal immobility seemed to reign over the whole sunbathed enlargement of that lagoon which was one of the secret places of the earth she felt strongly her isolation she was so much the only being of her kind moving within this mystery that even to herself she looked like an apparition without rights and without defence and that must end by surrendering to those forces which seemed to her but the expression of the unconscious genius of the place hers was the most complete loneliness charged with a catastrophic tension it lay about her as though she had been set apart within a magic circle it cut offbut it did not protect the footsteps that she knew how to distinguish above all others on that deck were heard suddenly behind her she did not turn her head  since that afternoon when the gentlemen as lingard called them had been brought on board mrs travers and lingard had not exchanged one significant word  when lingard had decided to proceed by way of negotiation she had asked him on what he based his hope of success and he had answered her on my luck what he really depended on was his prestige but even if he had been aware of such a word he would not have used it since it would have sounded like a boast and besides he did really believe in his luck nobody either white or brown had ever doubted his word and that of course gave him great assurance in entering upon the negotiation but the ultimate issue of it would be always a matter of luck he said so distinctly to mrs travers at the moment of taking leave of her with jorgenson already waiting for him in the boat that was to take them across the lagoon to belarabs stockade  startled by his decision for it had come suddenly clinched by the words i believe i can do it mrs travers had dropped her hand into his strong open palm on which an expert in palmistry could have distinguished other lines than the line of luck lingards hand closed on hers with a gentle pressure she looked at him speechless he waited for a moment then in an unconsciously tender voice he said well wish me luck then  she remained silent and he still holding her hand looked surprised at her hesitation it seemed to her that she could not let him go and she didnt know what to say till it occurred to her to make use of the power she knew she had over him she would try it again i am coming with you she declared with decision you dont suppose i could remain here in suspense for hours perhaps  he dropped her hand suddenly as if it had burnt himoh yes of course he mumbled with an air of confusion one of the men over there was her husband and nothing less could be expected from such a woman he had really nothing to say but she thought he hesitateddo you think my presence would spoil everything i assure you i am a lucky person too in a way    as lucky as you at least she had added in a murmur and with a smile which provoked his responsive mutteroh yes we are a lucky pair of peoplei count myself lucky in having found a man like you to fight myour battles she said warmly suppose you had not existed     you must let me come with you for the second time before her expressed wish to stand by his side he bowed his head after all if things came to the worst she would be as safe between him and jorgenson as left alone on board the emma with a few malay spearmen for all defence for a moment lingard thought of picking up the pistols he had taken out of his belt preparatory to joining jorgenson in the boat thinking it would be better to go to a big talk completely unarmed they were lying on the rail but he didnt pick them up four shots didnt matter they could not matter if the world of his creation were to go to pieces he said nothing of that to mrs travers but busied himself in giving her the means to alter her personal appearance it was then that the seachest in the deckhouse was opened for the first time before the interested mrs travers who had followed him inside lingard handed to her a malay womans light cotton coat with jewelled clasps to put over her european dress it covered half of her yachting skirt mrs travers obeyed him without comment he pulled out a long and wide scarf of white silk embroidered heavily on the edges and ends and begged her to put it over her head and arrange the ends so as to muffle her face leaving little more than her eyes exposed to viewwe are going amongst a lot of mohammedans he explainedi see you want me to look respectable she jestedi assure you mrs travers he protested earnestly that most of the people there and certainly all the great men have never seen a white woman in their lives but perhaps you would like better one of those other scarves there are three in thereno i like this one well enough they are all very gorgeous i see that the princess is to be sent back to her land with all possible splendour what a thoughtful man you are captain lingard that child will be touched by your generosity    will i do like this  yes said lingard averting his eyes mrs travers followed him into the boat where the malays stared in silence while jorgenson stiff and angular gave no sign of life not even so much as a movement of the eyes lingard settled her in the stern sheets and sat down by her side the ardent sunshine devoured all colours the boat swam forward on the glare heading for the strip of coral beach dazzling like a crescent of metal raised to a white heat they landed gravely jorgenson opened above mrs travers head a big white cotton parasol and she advanced between the two men dazed as if in a dream and having no other contact with the earth but through the soles of her feet everything was still empty incandescent and fantastic then when the gate of the stockade was thrown open she perceived an expectant and still multitude of bronze figures draped in coloured stuffs they crowded the patches of shade under the three lofty forest trees left within the enclosure between the sunsmitten empty spaces of hardbaked ground the broad blades of the spears decorated with crimson tufts of horsehair had a cool gleam under the outspread boughs to the left a group of buildings on piles with long verandahs and immense roofs towered high in the air above the heads of the crowd and seemed to float in the glare looking much less substantial than their heavy shadows lingard pointing to one of the smallest said in an undertone i lived there for a fortnight when i first came to see belarab and mrs travers felt more than ever as if walking in a dream when she perceived beyond the rails of its verandah and visible from head to foot two figures in an armour of chain mail with pointed steel helmets crested with white and black feathers and guarding the closed door a high bench draped in turkey cloth stood in an open space of the great audience shed lingard led her up to it jorgenson on her other side closed the parasol calmly and when she sat down between them the whole throng before her eyes sank to the ground with one accord disclosing in the distance of the courtyard a lonely figure leaning against the smooth trunk of a tree a white cloth was fastened round his head by a yellow cord its pointed ends fell on his shoulders framing a thin dark face with large eyes a silk cloak striped black and white fell to his feet and in the distance he looked aloof and mysterious in his erect and careless attitude suggesting assurance and power  lingard bending slightly whispered into mrs travers ear that that man apart and dominating the scene was daman the supreme leader of the illanuns the one who had ordered the capture of those gentlemen in order perhaps to force his hand the two barbarous halfnaked figures covered with ornaments and charms squatting at his feet with their heads enfolded in crimson and gold handkerchiefs and with straight swords lying across their knees were the pangerans who carried out the order and had brought the captives into the lagoon but the two men in chain armour on watch outside the door of the small house were belarabs two particular bodyguards who got themselves up in that way only on very great occasions they were the outward and visible sign that the prisoners were in belarabs keeping and this was good so far the pity was that the great chief himself was not there then lingard assumed a formal pose and mrs travers stared into the great courtyard and with rows and rows of faces ranged on the ground at her feet felt a little giddy for a moment  every movement had died in the crowd even the eyes were still under the variegated mass of coloured headkerchiefs while beyond the open gate a noble palm tree looked intensely black against the glitter of the lagoon and the pale incandescence of the sky mrs travers gazing that way wondered at the absence of hassim and immada but the girl might have been somewhere within one of the houses with the ladies of belarabs stockade then suddenly mrs travers became aware that another bench had been brought out and was already occupied by five men dressed in gorgeous silks and embroidered velvets roundfaced and grave their hands reposed on their knees but one amongst them clad in a white robe and with a large nearly black turban on his head leaned forward a little with his chin in his hand his cheeks were sunken and his eyes remained fixed on the ground as if to avoid looking at the infidel woman  she became aware suddenly of a soft murmur and glancing at lingard she saw him in an attitude of impassive attention the momentous negotiations had begun and it went on like this in low undertones with long pauses and in the immobility of all the attendants squatting on the ground with the distant figure of daman far off in the shade towering over all the assembly but in him too mrs travers could not detect the slightest movement while the slightly modulated murmurs went on enveloping her in a feeling of peace  the fact that she couldnt understand anything of what was said soothed her apprehensions sometimes a silence fell and lingard bending toward her would whisper it isnt so easy and the stillness would be so perfect that she would hear the flutter of a pigeons wing somewhere high up in the great overshadowing trees and suddenly one of the men before her without moving a limb would begin another speech rendered more mysterious still by the total absence of action or play of feature only the watchfulness of the eyes which showed that the speaker was not communing with himself made it clear that this was not a spoken meditation but a flow of argument directed to lingard who now and then uttered a few words either with a grave or a smiling expression they were always followed by murmurs which seemed mostly to her to convey assent and then a reflective silence would reign again and the immobility of the crowd would appear more perfect than before  when lingard whispered to her that it was now his turn to make a speech mrs travers expected him to get up and assert himself by some commanding gesture but he did not he remained seated only his voice had a vibrating quality though he obviously tried to restrain it and it travelled masterfully far into the silence he spoke for a long time while the sun climbing the unstained sky shifted the diminished shadows of the trees pouring on the heads of men its heat through the thick and motionless foliage whenever murmurs arose he would stop and glancing fearlessly at the assembly wait till they subsided once or twice they rose to a loud hum and mrs travers could hear on the other side of her jorgenson muttering something in his moustache beyond the rows of heads daman under the tree had folded his arms on his breast the edge of the white cloth concealed his forehead and at his feet the two illanun chiefs half naked and bedecked with charms and ornaments of bright feathers of shells with necklaces of teeth claws and shining beads remained crosslegged with their swords across their knees like two bronze idols even the plumes of their headdresses stirred not  sudah it is finished a movement passed along all the heads the seated bodies swayed to and fro lingard had ceased speaking he remained seated for a moment looking his audience all over and when he stood up together with mrs travers and jorgenson the whole assembly rose from the ground together and lost its ordered formation some of belarabs retainers young broadfaced fellows wearing a sort of uniform of checkpatterned sarongs black silk jackets and crimson skullcaps set at a rakish angle swaggered through the broken groups and ranged themselves in two rows before the motionless daman and his illanun chiefs in martial array the members of the council who had left their bench approached the white people with gentle smiles and deferential movements of the hands their bearing was faintly propitiatory only the man in the big turban remained fanatically aloof keeping his eyes fixed on the ground  i have done it murmured lingard to mrs traverswas it very difficult she askedno he said conscious in his heart that he had strained to the fullest extent the prestige of his good name and that habit of deference to his slightest wish established by the glamour of his wealth and the fear of his personality in this great talk which after all had done nothing except put off the decisive hour he offered mrs travers his arm ready to lead her away but at the last moment did not move  with an authoritative gesture daman had parted the ranks of belarabs young followers with the red skullcaps and was seen advancing toward the whites striking into an astonished silence all the scattered groups in the courtyard but the broken ranks had closed behind him the illanun chiefs for all their truculent aspect were much too prudent to attempt to move they had not needed for that the faint warning murmur from daman he advanced alone the plain hilt of a sword protruded from the open edges of his cloak the parted edges disclosed also the butts of two flintlock pistols the koran in a velvet case hung on his breast by a red cord of silk he was pious magnificent and warlike with calm movements and a straight glance from under the hem of the simple piece of linen covering his head he carried himself rigidly and his bearing had a sort of solemn modesty lingard said hurriedly to mrs travers that the man had met white people before and that should he attempt to shake hands with her she ought to offer her own covered with the end of her scarfwhy she asked proprietyyes it will be better said lingard and the next moment mrs travers felt her enveloped hand pressed gently by slender dark fingers and felt extremely oriental herself when with her face muffled to the eyes she encountered the lustrous black stare of the searobbers leader it was only for an instant because daman turned away at once to shake hands with lingard in the straight ample folds of his robes he looked very slender facing the robust white man  great is your power he said in a pleasant voice the white men are going to be delivered to you  yes they pass into my keeping said lingard returning the others bright smile but otherwise looking grim enough with the frown which had settled on his forehead at damans approach he glanced over his shoulder at a group of spearmen escorting the two captives who had come down the steps from the hut at the sight of daman barring as it were lingards way they had stopped at some distance and had closed round the two white men daman also glanced dispassionately that way  they were my guests he murmured please god i shall come soon to ask you for them    as a friend he added after a slight pause  and please god you will not go away empty handed said lingard smoothing his brow after all you and i were not meant to meet only to quarrel would you have preferred to see them pass into tenggas keeping  tengga is fat and full of wiles said daman disdainfully a mere shopkeeper smitten by a desire to be a chief he is nothing but you and i are men that have real power yet there is a truth that you and i can confess to each other mens hearts grow quickly discontented listen the leaders of men are carried forward in the hands of their followers and common mens minds are unsteady their desires changeable and their thoughts not to be trusted you are a great chief they say do not forget that i am a chief too and a leader of armed men  i have heard of you too said lingard in a composed voice  daman had cast his eyes down suddenly he opened them very wide with an effect that startled mrs traversyes but do you see mrs travers her hand resting lightly on lingards arm had the sensation of acting in a gorgeously got up play on the brilliantly lighted stage of an exotic opera whose accompaniment was not music but the varied strains of the allpervading silenceyes i see lingard replied with a surprisingly confidential intonation but power too is in the hands of a great leader  mrs travers watched the faint movements of damans nostrils as though the man were suffering from some powerful emotion while under her fingers lingards forearm in its white sleeve was as steady as a limb of marble without looking at him she seemed to feel that with one movement he could crush that nervous figure in which lived the breath of the great desert haunted by his nomad camelriding ancestorspower is in the hand of god he said all animation dying out of his face and paused to wait for lingards very true then continued with a fine smile but he apportions it according to his will for his own purposes even to those that are not of the faith  such being the will of god you should harbour no bitterness against them in your heart  the low exclamation against those and a slight dismissing gesture of a meagre dark hand out of the folds of the cloak were almost understandable to mrs travers in the perfection of their melancholy contempt and gave lingard a further insight into the character of the ally secured to him by the diplomacy of belarab he was only half reassured by this assumption of superior detachment he trusted to the mans selfinterest more for daman no doubt looked to the reconquered kingdom for the reward of dignity and ease his father and grandfather the men of whom jorgenson had written as having been hanged for an example twelve years before had been friends of sultans advisers of rulers wealthy financiers of the great raiding expeditions of the past it was hatred that had turned daman into a selfmade outcast till belarabs diplomacy had drawn him out from some obscure and uneasy retreat  in a few words lingard assured daman of the complete safety of his followers as long as they themselves made no attempt to get possession of the stranded yacht lingard understood very well that the capture of travers and dalcacer was the result of a sudden fear a move directed by daman to secure his own safety the sight of the stranded yacht shook his confidence completely it was as if the secrets of the place had been betrayed after all it was perhaps a great folly to trust any white man no matter how much he seemed estranged from his own people daman felt he might have been the victim of a plot lingards brig appeared to him a formidable engine of war he did not know what to think and the motive for getting hold of the two white men was really the wish to secure hostages distrusting the fierce impulses of his followers he had hastened to put them into belarabs keeping but everything in the settlement seemed to him suspicious belarabs absence jorgensons refusal to make over at once the promised supply of arms and ammunition and now that white man had by the power of his speech got them away from belarabs people so much influence filled daman with wonder and awe a recluse for many years in the most obscure corner of the archipelago he felt himself surrounded by intrigues but the alliance was a great thing too he did not want to quarrel he was quite willing for the time being to accept lingards assurance that no harm should befall his people encamped on the sandbanks attentive and slight he seemed to let lingards deliberate words sink into him the force of that unarmed big man seemed overwhelming he bowed his head slowly  allah is our refuge he murmured accepting the inevitable  he delighted mrs travers not as a living being but like a clever sketch in colours a vivid rendering of an artists vision of some soul delicate and fierce his bright halfsmile was extraordinary sharp like clear steel painfully penetrating glancing right and left mrs travers saw the whole courtyard smitten by the desolating fury of sunshine and peopled with shadows their forms and colours fading in the violence of the light the very brown tones of roof and wall dazzled the eye then daman stepped aside he was no longer smiling and mrs travers advanced with her hand on lingards arm through a heat so potent that it seemed to have a taste a feel a smell of its own she moved on as if floating in it with lingards support  where are they she asked  they are following us all right he answered lingard was so certain that the prisoners would be delivered to him on the beach that he never glanced back till after reaching the boat he and mrs travers turned about  the group of spearmen parted right and left and mr travers and dalcacer walked forward alone looking unreal and odd like their own dayghosts mr travers gave no sign of being aware of his wifes presence it was certainly a shock to him but dalcacer advanced smiling as if the beach were a drawing room  with a very few paddlers the heavy old europeanbuilt boat moved slowly over the water that seemed as pale and blazing as the sky above jorgenson had perched himself in the bow the other four white people sat in the stern sheets the exprisoners side by side in the middle lingard spoke suddenly  i want you both to understand that the trouble is not over yet nothing is finished you are out on my bare word  while lingard was speaking mr travers turned his face away but dalcacer listened courteously not another word was spoken for the rest of the way the two gentlemen went up the ships side first lingard remained to help mrs travers at the foot of the ladder she pressed his hand strongly and looking down at his upturned face  this was a wonderful success she said  for a time the character of his fascinated gaze did not change it was as if she had said nothing then he whispered admiringly you understand everything  she moved her eyes away and had to disengage her hand to which he clung for a moment giddy like a man falling out of the world    iii  mrs travers acutely aware of lingard behind her remained gazing over the lagoon after a time he stepped forward and placed himself beside her close to the rail she went on staring at the sheet of water turned to deep purple under the sunset sky  why have you been avoiding me since we came back from the stockade she asked in a deadened voice  there is nothing to tell you till rajah hassim and his sister immada return with some news lingard answered in the same tone has my friend succeeded will belarab listen to any arguments will he consent to come out of his shell is he on his way back i wish i knew    not a whisper comes from there he may have started two days ago and he may be now near the outskirts of the settlement or he may have gone into camp half way down from some whim or other or he may be already arrived for all i know we should not have seen him the road from the hills does not lead along the beach  he snatched nervously at the long glass and directed it at the dark stockade the sun had sunk behind the forests leaving the contour of the treetops outlined by a thread of gold under a band of delicate green lying across the lower sky higher up a faint crimson glow faded into the darkened blue overhead the shades of the evening deepened over the lagoon clung to the sides of the emma and to the forms of the further shore lingard laid the glass down  mr dalcacer too seems to have been avoiding me said mrs travers you are on very good terms with him captain lingard  he is a very pleasant man murmured lingard absently but he says funny things sometimes he inquired the other day if there were any playing cards on board and when i asked him if he liked cardplaying just for something to say he told me with that queer smile of his that he had read a story of some people condemned to death who passed the time before execution playing card games with their guards  and what did you say  i told him that there were probably cards on board somewherejorgenson would know then i asked him whether he looked on me as a gaoler he was quite startled and sorry for what he said  it wasnt very kind of you captain lingard  it slipped out awkwardly and we made it up with a laugh  mrs travers leaned her elbows on the rail and put her head into her hands every attitude of that woman surprised lingard by its enchanting effect upon himself he sighed and the silence lasted for a long while  i wish i had understood every word that was said that morning  that morning repeated lingard what morning do you mean  i mean the morning when i walked out of belarabs stockade on your arm captain lingard at the head of the procession it seemed to me that i was walking on a splendid stage in a scene from an opera in a gorgeous show fit to make an audience hold its breath you cant possibly guess how unreal all this seemed and how artificial i felt myself an opera you know     i know i was a gold digger at one time some of us used to come down to melbourne with our pockets full of money i daresay it was poor enough to what you must have seen but once i went to a show like that it was a story acted to music all the people went singing through it right to the very end  how it must have jarred on your sense of reality said mrs travers still not looking at him you dont remember the name of the opera  no i never troubled my head about it weour lot never did  i wont ask you what the story was like it must have appeared to you like the very defiance of all truth would real people go singing through their life anywhere except in a fairy tale  these people didnt always sing for joy said lingard simply i dont know much about fairy tales  they are mostly about princesses murmured mrs travers  lingard didnt quite hear he bent his ear for a moment but she wasnt looking at him and he didnt ask her to repeat her remark fairy tales are for children i believe he said but that story with music i am telling you of mrs travers was not a tale for children i assure you that of the few shows i have seen that one was the most real to me more real than anything in life  mrs travers remembering the fatal inanity of most opera librettos was touched by these words as if there had been something pathetic in this readiness of response as if she had heard a starved man talking of the delight of a crust of dry bread i suppose you forgot yourself in that story whatever it was she remarked in a detached tone  yes it carried me away but i suppose you know the feeling  no i never knew anything of the kind not even when i was a chit of a girl lingard seemed to accept this statement as an assertion of superiority he inclined his head slightly moreover she might have said what she liked what pleased him most was her not looking at him for it enabled him to contemplate with perfect freedom the curve of her cheek her small ear half hidden by the clear mesh of fine hair the fascination of her uncovered neck and her whole person was an impossible an amazing and solid marvel which somehow was not so much convincing to the eye as to something within him that was apparently independent of his senses not even for a moment did he think of her as remote untouchablepossibly but remoteno whether consciously or unconsciously he took her spiritually for granted it was materially that she was a wonder of the sort that is at the same time familiar and sacred  no mrs travers began again abruptly i never forgot myself in a story it was not in me i have not even been able to forget myself on that morning on shore which was part of my own story  you carried yourself first rate said lingard smiling at the nape of her neck her ear the film of escaped hair the modelling of the corner of her eye he could see the flutter of the dark eyelashes and the delicate flush on her cheek had rather the effect of scent than of colour  you approved of my behaviour  just right i tell you my word werent they all struck of a heap when they made out what you were  i ought to feel flattered i will confess to you that i felt only half disguised and was half angry and wholly uncomfortable what helped me i suppose was that i wanted to please     i dont mean to say that they were exactly pleased broke in lingard conscientiously they were startled more  i wanted to please you dropped mrs travers negligently a faint hoarse and impatient call of a bird was heard from the woods as if calling to the oncoming night lingards face grew hot in the deepening dusk the delicate lemon yellow and ethereal green tints had vanished from the sky and the red glow darkened menacingly the sun had set behind the black pall of the forest no longer edged with a line of gold yes i was absurdly selfconscious continued mrs travers in a conversational tone and it was the effect of these clothes that you made me put on over some of my europeani almost said disguise because you know in the present more perfect costume i feel curiously at home and yet i cant say that these things really fit me the sleeves of this silk underjacket are rather tight my shoulders feel bound too and as to the sarong it is scandalously short according to rule it should have been long enough to fall over my feet but i like freedom of movement i have had very little of what i liked in life  i can hardly believe that said lingard if it wasnt for your saying so     i wouldnt say so to everybody she said turning her head for a moment to lingard and turning it away again to the dusk which seemed to come floating over the black lagoon far away in its depth a couple of feeble lights twinkled it was impossible to say whether on the shore or on the edge of the more distant forest overhead the stars were beginning to come out but faint yet as if too remote to be reflected in the lagoon only to the west a setting planet shone through the red fog of the sunset glow it was supposed not to be good for me to have much freedom of action so at least i was told but i have a suspicion that it was only unpleasing to other people  i should have thought began lingard then hesitated and stopped it seemed to him inconceivable that everybody should not have loved to make that woman happy and he was impressed by the bitterness of her tone mrs travers did not seem curious to know what he wanted to say and after a time she added i dont mean only when i was a child i dont remember that very well i daresay i was very objectionable as a child  lingard tried to imagine her as a child the idea was novel to him her perfection seemed to have come into the world complete mature and without any hesitation or weakness he had nothing in his experience that could help him to imagine a child of that class the children he knew played about the village street and ran on the beach he had been one of them he had seen other children of course since but he had not been in touch with them except visually and they had not been english children her childhood like his own had been passed in england and that very fact made it almost impossible for him to imagine it he could not even tell whether it was in town or in the country or whether as a child she had even seen the sea and how could a child of that kind be objectionable but he remembered that a child disapproved of could be very unhappy and he said  i am sorry  mrs travers laughed a little within the muslin cage forms had turned to blurred shadows amongst them the form of dalcacer arose and moved the systematic or else the morbid dumbness of mr travers bored and exasperated him though as a matter of fact that gentlemans speeches had never had the power either to entertain or to soothe his mind  its very nice of you you have a great capacity for sympathy but after all i am not certain on which side your sympathies lie with me or those muchtried people said mrs travers  with the child said lingard disregarding the bantering tone a child can have a very bad time of it all to itself  what can you know of it she asked  i have my own feelings he answered in some surprise  mrs travers with her back to him was covered with confusion neither could she depict to herself his childhood as if he too had come into the world in the fullness of his strength and his purpose she discovered a certain naiveness in herself and laughed a little he made no sound  dont be angry she said i wouldnt dream of laughing at your feelings indeed your feelings are the most serious thing that ever came in my way i couldnt help laughing at myselfat a funny discovery i made  in the days of your childhood she heard lingards deep voice asking after a pause  oh no ages afterward no child could have made that discovery do you know the greatest difference there is between us it is this that i have been living since my childhood in front of a show and that i never have been taken in for a moment by its tinsel and its noise or by anything that went on on the stage do you understand what i mean captain lingard  there was a moment of silence what does it matter we are no children now there was an infinite gentleness in lingards deep tones but if you have been unhappy then dont tell me that it has not been made up to you since surely you have only to make a sign a woman like you  you think i could frighten the whole world on to its knees  no not frighten the suggestion of a laugh in the deadened voice passed off in a catch of the breath then he was heard beginning soberly your husband    he hesitated a little and she took the opportunity to say coldly  his name is mr travers  lingard didnt know how to take it he imagined himself to have been guilty of some sort of presumption but how on earth was he to call the man after all he was her husband that idea was disagreeable to him because the man was also inimical in a particularly unreasonable and galling manner at the same time he was aware that he didnt care a bit for his enmity and had an idea that he would not have cared for his friendship either and suddenly he felt very much annoyed  yes thats the man i mean he said in a contemptuous tone i dont particularly like the name and i am sure i dont want to talk about him more than i can help if he hadnt been your husband i wouldnt have put up with his manners for an hour do you know what would have happened to him if he hadnt been your husband  no said mrs travers do you captain lingard  not exactly he admitted something he wouldnt have liked you may be sure  while of course he likes this very much she observed lingard gave an abrupt laugh  i dont think its in my power to do anything that he would like he said in a serious tone forgive me my frankness mrs travers but he makes it very difficult sometimes for me to keep civil whatever i have had to put up with in life i have never had to put up with contempt  i quite believe that said mrs travers dont your friends call you king tom  nobody that i care for i have no friends oh yes they call me that     you have no friends  not i he said with decision a man like me has no chums  its quite possible murmured mrs travers to herself  no not even jorgenson old crazy jorgenson he calls me king tom too you see what thats worth  yes i see or rather i have heard that poor man has no tone and so much depends on that now suppose i were to call you king tom now and then between ourselves mrs travers voice proposed distantly tentative in the night that invested her person with a colourless vagueness of form  she waited in the stillness her elbows on the rail and her face in her hands as if she had already forgotten what she had said she heard at her elbow the deep murmur of  lets hear you say it  she never moved the least bit the sombre lagoon sparkled faintly with the reflection of the stars  oh yes i will let you hear it she said into the starlit space in a voice of unaccented gentleness which changed subtly as she went on i hope you will never regret that you came out of your friendless mystery to speak to me king tom how many days ago it was and here is another day gone tell me how many more of them there must be of these blinding days and nights without a sound  be patient he murmured dont ask me for the impossible  how do you or i know what is possible she whispered with a strange scorn you wouldnt dare guess but i tell you that every day that passes is more impossible to me than the day before  the passion of that whisper went like a stab into his breast what am i to tell you he murmured as if with despair remember that every sunset makes it a day less do you think i want you here  a bitter little laugh floated out into the starlight mrs travers heard lingard move suddenly away from her side she didnt change her pose by a hairs breadth presently she heard dalcacer coming out of the cage his cultivated voice asked half playfully  have you had a satisfactory conversation may i be told something of it  mr dalcacer you are curious  well in our position i confess    you are our only refuge remember  you want to know what we were talking about said mrs travers altering slowly her position so as to confront dalcacer whose face was almost undistinguishable oh well then we talked about opera the realities and illusions of the stage of dresses of peoples names and things of that sort  nothing of importance he said courteously mrs travers moved forward and he stepped to one side inside the cage two malay hands were hanging round lanterns the light of which fell on mr travers bowed head as he sat in his chair  when they were all assembled for the evening meal jorgenson strolled up from nowhere in particular as his habit was and speaking through the muslin announced that captain lingard begged to be excused from joining the company that evening then he strolled away from that moment till they got up from the table and the camp bedsteads were brought in not twenty words passed between the members of the party within the net the strangeness of their situation made all attempts to exchange ideas very arduous and apart from that each had thoughts which it was distinctly useless to communicate to the others mr travers had abandoned himself to his sense of injury he did not so much brood as rage inwardly in a dull dispirited way the impossibility of asserting himself in any manner galled his very soul dalcacer was extremely puzzled detached in a sense from the life of men perhaps as much even as jorgenson himself he took yet a reasonable interest in the course of events and had not lost all his sense of selfpreservation without being able to appreciate the exact values of the situation he was not one of those men who are ever completely in the dark in any given set of circumstances without being humorous he was a goodhumoured man his habitual gentle smile was a true expression more of a european than of a spaniard he had that truly aristocratic nature which is inclined to credit every honest man with something of its own nobility and in its judgment is altogether independent of class feeling he believed lingard to be an honest man and he never troubled his head to classify him except in the sense that he found him an interesting character he had a sort of esteem for the outward personality and the bearing of that seaman he found in him also the distinction of being nothing of a type he was a specimen to be judged only by its own worth with his natural gift of insight dalcacer told himself that many overseas adventurers of history were probably less worthy because obviously they must have been less simple he didnt however impart those thoughts formally to mrs travers in fact he avoided discussing lingard with mrs travers who he thought was quite intelligent enough to appreciate the exact shade of his attitude if that shade was fine mrs travers was fine too and there was no need to discuss the colours of this adventure moreover she herself seemed to avoid all direct discussion of the lingard element in their fate dalcacer was fine enough to be aware that those two seemed to understand each other in a way that was not obvious even to themselves whenever he saw them together he was always much tempted to observe them and he yielded to the temptation the fact of ones life depending on the phases of an obscure action authorizes a certain latitude of behaviour he had seen them together repeatedly communing openly or apart and there was in their way of joining each other in their poses and their ways of separating something special and characteristic and pertaining to themselves only as if they had been made for each other  what he couldnt understand was why mrs travers should have put off his natural curiosity as to her latest conference with the man of fate by an incredible statement as to the nature of the conversation talk about dresses opera peoples names he couldnt take this seriously she might have invented he thought something more plausible or simply have told him that this was not for him to know she ought to have known that he would not have been offended couldnt she have seen already that he accepted the complexion of mystery in her relation to that man completely unquestionably as though it had been something preordained from the very beginning of things but he was not annoyed with mrs travers after all it might have been true she would talk exactly as she liked and even incredibly if it so pleased her and make the man hang on her lips and likewise she was capable of making the man talk about anything by a power of inspiration for reasons simple or perverse opera dresses yesabout shakespeare and the musical glasses for a mere whim or for the deepest purpose women worthy of the name were like that they were very wonderful they rose to the occasion and sometimes above the occasion when things were bound to occur that would be comic or tragic as it happened but generally charged with trouble even to innocent beholders dalcacer thought these thoughts without bitterness and even without irony with his halfsecret social reputation as a man of one great passion in a world of mere intrigues he liked all women he liked them in their sentiment and in their hardness in the tragic character of their foolish or clever impulses at which he looked with a sort of tender seriousness  he didnt take a favourable view of the position but he considered mrs travers statement about operas and dresses as a warning to keep off the subject for this reason he remained silent through the meal  when the bustle of clearing away the table was over he strolled toward mrs travers and remarked very quietly  i think that in keeping away from us this evening the man of fate was well inspired we dined like a lot of carthusian monks  you allude to our silence  it was most scrupulous if we had taken an eternal vow we couldnt have kept it better  did you feel bored  pas du tout dalcacer assured her with whimsical gravity i felt nothing i sat in a state of blessed vacuity i believe i was the happiest of us three unless you too mrs travers     its absolutely no use your fishing for my thoughts mr dalcacer if i were to let you see them you would be appalled  thoughts really are but a shape of feelings let me congratulate you on the impassive mask you can put on those horrors you say you nurse in your breast it was impossible to tell anything by your face  you will always say flattering things  madame my flatteries come from the very bottom of my heart i have given up long ago all desire to please and i was not trying to get at your thoughts whatever else you may expect from me you may count on my absolute respect for your privacy but i suppose with a mask such as you can make for yourself you really dont care the man of fate i noticed is not nearly as good at it as you are  what a pretentious name do you call him by it to his face mr dalcacer  no i havent the cheek confessed dalcacer equably and besides its too momentous for daily use and he is so simple that he might mistake it for a joke and nothing could be further from my thoughts mrs travers i will confess to you that i dont feel jocular in the least but what can he know about people of our sort and when i reflect how little people of our sort can know of such a man i am quite content to address him as captain lingard its common and soothing and most respectable and satisfactory for captain is the most empty of all titles what is a captain anybody can be a captain and for lingard its a name like any other whereas what he deserves is something special significant and expressive that would match his person his simple and romantic person  he perceived that mrs travers was looking at him intently they hastened to turn their eyes away from each other  he would like your appreciation mrs travers let drop negligently  i am afraid he would despise it  despise it why that sort of thing is the very breath of his nostrils  you seem to understand him mrs travers women have a singular capacity for understanding i mean subjects that interest them because when their imagination is stimulated they are not afraid of letting it go a man is more mistrustful of himself but women are born much more reckless they push on and on under the protection of secrecy and silence and the greater the obscurity of what they wish to explore the greater their courage  do you mean seriously to tell me that you consider me a creature of darkness  i spoke in general remonstrated dalcacer anything else would have been an impertinence yes obscurity is womens best friend their daring loves it but a sudden flash of light disconcerts them generally speaking if they dont get exactly at the truth they always manage to come pretty near to it  mrs travers had listened with silent attention and she allowed the silence to continue for some time after dalcacer had ceased when she spoke it was to say in an unconcerned tone that as to this subject she had had special opportunities her selfpossessed interlocutor managed to repress a movement of real curiosity under an assumption of conventional interest indeed he exclaimed politely a special opportunity how did you manage to create it  this was too much for mrs travers i create it she exclaimed indignantly but under her breath how on earth do you think i could have done it  mr dalcacer as if communing with himself was heard to murmur unrepentantly that indeed women seldom knew how they had done it to which mrs travers in a weary tone returned the remark that no two men were dense in the same way to this mr dalcacer assented without difficulty yes our brand presents more varieties this from a certain point of view is obviously to our advantage we interest    not that i imagine myself interesting to you mrs travers but what about the man of fate  oh yes breathed out mrs travers  i see immensely said dalcacer in a tone of mysterious understanding was his stupidity so colossal  it was indistinguishable from great visions that were in no sense mean and made up for him a world of his own  i guessed that much muttered dalcacer to himself but that you know mrs travers that isnt good news at all to me world of dreams eh thats very bad very dangerous its almost fatal mrs travers  why all this dismay why do you object to a world of dreams  because i dislike the prospect of being made a sacrifice of by those moors i am not an optimist like our friend there he continued in a low tone nodding toward the dismal figure of mr travers huddled up in the chair i dont regard all this as a farce and i have discovered in myself a strong objection to having my throat cut by those gorgeous barbarians after a lot of fatuous talk dont ask me why mrs travers put it down to an absurd weakness  mrs travers made a slight movement in her chair raising her hands to her head and in the dim light of the lanterns dalcacer saw the mass of her clear gleaming hair fall down and spread itself over her shoulders she seized half of it in her hands which looked very white and with her head inclined a little on one side she began to make a plait  you are terrifying he said after watching the movement of her fingers for a while  yes     she accentuated interrogatively  you have the awfulness of the predestined you too are the prey of dreams  not of the moors then she uttered calmly beginning the other plait dalcacer followed the operation to the end close against her her diaphanous shadow on the muslin reproduced her slightest movements dalcacer turned his eyes away  no no barbarian shall touch you because if it comes to that i believe he would be capable of killing you himself  a minute elapsed before he stole a glance in her direction she was leaning back again her hands had fallen on her lap and her head with a plait of hair on each side of her face her head incredibly changed in character and suggesting something medieval ascetic drooped dreamily on her breast  dalcacer waited holding his breath she didnt move in the dim gleam of jewelled clasps the faint sheen of gold embroideries and the shimmer of silks she was like a figure in a faded painting only her neck appeared dazzlingly white in the smoky redness of the light dalcacers wonder approached a feeling of awe he was on the point of moving away quietly when mrs travers without stirring in the least let him hear the words  i have told him that every day seemed more difficult to live dont you see how impossible this is  dalcacer glanced rapidly across the cage where mr travers seemed to be asleep all in a heap and presenting a ruffled appearance like a sick bird nothing was distinct of him but the bald patch on the top of his head  yes he murmured it is most unfortunate    i understand your anxiety mrs travers but     i am frightened she said  he reflected a moment what answer did you get he asked softly  the answer was patience  dalcacer laughed a littleyou may well laugh murmured mrs travers in a tone of anguishthats why i did he whispered patience didnt he see the horror of iti dont know he walked away said mrs travers she looked immovably at her hands clasped in her lap and then with a burst of distress mr dalcacer what is going to happenah you are asking yourself the question at last that will happen which cannot be avoided and perhaps you know best what it isno i am still asking myself what he will doah that is not for me to know declared dalcacer i cant tell you what he will do but i know what will happen to himto him you say to him she criedhe will break his heart said dalcacer distinctly bending a little over the chair with a slight gasp at his own audacityand waited  croyezvous came at last from mrs travers in an accent so coldly languid that dalcacer felt a shudder run down his spine  was it possible that she was that kind of woman he asked himself did she see nothing in the world outside herself was she above the commonest kind of compassion he couldnt suspect mrs travers of stupidity but she might have been heartless and like some women of her class quite unable to recognize any emotion in the world except her own dalcacer was shocked and at the same time he was relieved because he confessed to himself that he had ventured very far however in her humanity she was not vulgar enough to be offended she was not the slave of small meannesses this thought pleased dalcacer who had schooled himself not to expect too much from people but he didnt know what to do next after what he had ventured to say and after the manner in which she had met his audacity the only thing to do was to change the conversation mrs travers remained perfectly still i will pretend that i think she is asleep he thought to himself meditating a retreat on tiptoe  he didnt know that mrs travers was simply trying to recover the full command of her faculties his words had given her a terrible shock after managing to utter this defensive croyezvous which came out of her lips cold and faint as if in a last effort of dying strength she felt herself turn rigid and speechless she was thinking stiff all over with emotion dalcacer has seen it how much more has he been able to see she didnt ask herself that question in fear or shame but with a reckless resignation out of that shock came a sensation of peace a glowing warmth passed through all her limbs if dalcacer had peered by that smoky light into her face he might have seen on her lips a fatalistic smile come and go but dalcacer would not have dreamed of doing such a thing and besides his attention just then was drawn in another direction he had heard subdued exclamations had noticed a stir on the decks of the emma and even some sort of noise outside the ship  these are strange sounds he said  yes i hear mrs travers murmured uneasily  vague shapes glided outside the cage barefooted almost noiseless whispering malay words secretly  it seems as though a boat had come alongside observed dalcacer lending an attentive ear i wonder what it means in our position     it may mean anything interrupted mrs travers  jaffir is here said a voice in the darkness of the after end of the ship then there were some more words in which dalcacers attentive ear caught the word surat  a message of some sort has come he said they will be calling captain lingard i wonder what thoughts or what dreams this call will interrupt he spoke lightly looking now at mrs travers who had altered her position in the chair and by their tones and attitudes these two might have been on board the yacht sailing the sea in perfect safety you of course are the one who will be told dont you feel a sort of excitement mrs travers  i have been lately exhorted to patience she said in the same easy tone i can wait and i imagine i shall have to wait till the morning  it cant be very late yet he said time with us has been standing still for ever so long and yet this may be the hour of fate  is this the feeling you have at this particular moment  i have had that feeling for a considerable number of moments already at first it was exciting now i am only moderately anxious i have employed my time in going over all my past life  can one really do that  yes i cant say i have been bored to extinction i am still alive as you see but i have done with that and i feel extremely idle there is only one thing i would like to do i want to find a few words that could convey to you my gratitude for all your friendliness in the past at the time when you let me see so much of you in london i felt always that you took me on my own terms and that so kindly that often i felt inclined to think better of myself but i am afraid i am wearying you mrs travers  i assure you you have never done thatin the past and as to the present moment i beg you not to go away stay by me please we are not going to pretend that we are sleepy at this early hour  dalcacer brought a stool close to the long chair and sat down on it oh yes the possible hour of fate he said i have a request to make mrs travers i dont ask you to betray anything what would be the good the issue when it comes will be plain enough but i should like to get a warning just something that would give me time to pull myself together to compose myself as it were i want you to promise me that if the balance tips against us you will give me a sign you could for instance seize the opportunity when i am looking at you to put your left hand to your forehead like this it is a gesture that i have never seen you make and so     jorgenson lingards voice was heard forward where the light of a lantern appeared suddenly then after a pause lingard was heard again here  then the silent minutes began to go by mrs travers reclining in her chair and dalcacer sitting on the stool waited motionless without a word presently through the subdued murmurs and agitation pervading the dark deck of the emma mrs travers heard a firm footstep and lantern in hand lingard appeared outside the muslin cage  will you come out and speak to me he said loudly not you the lady he added in an authoritative tone as dalcacer rose hastily from the stool i want mrs travers  of course muttered dalcacer to himself and as he opened the door of the cage to let mrs travers slip through he whispered to her this is the hour of fate  she brushed past him swiftly without the slightest sign that she had heard the words on the after deck between the cage and the deckhouse lingard waited lantern in hand nobody else was visible about but dalcacer felt in the air the presence of silent and excited beings hovering outside the circle of light lingard raised the lantern as mrs travers approached and dalcacer heard him say  i have had news which you ought to know let us go into the deckhouse  dalcacer saw their heads lighted up by the raised lantern surrounded by the depths of shadow with an effect of a marvellous and symbolic vision he heard mrs travers say i would rather not hear your news in a tone that made that sensitive observer purse up his lips in wonder he thought that she was overwrought that the situation had grown too much for her nerves but this was not the tone of a frightened person it flashed through his mind that she had become selfconscious and there he stopped in his speculation that friend of women remained discreet even in his thoughts he stepped backward further into the cage and without surprise saw mrs travers follow lingard into the deckhouse    iv  lingard stood the lantern on the table its light was very poor he dropped on to the seachest heavily he too was overwrought his flannel shirt was open at the neck he had a broad belt round his waist and was without his jacket before him mrs travers straight and tall in the gay silks cottons and muslins of her outlandish dress with the ends of the scarf thrown over her head hanging down in front of her looked dimly splendid and with a black glance out of her white face he said  do you too want to throw me over i tell you you cant do that now  i wasnt thinking of throwing you over but i dont even know what you mean there seem to be no end of things i cant do hadnt you better tell me of something that i could do have you any idea yourself what you want from me  you can let me look at you you can listen to me you can speak to me  frankly i have never shirked doing all those things whenever you wanted me to you have led me     i led you cried lingard  oh it was my fault she said without anger i must have dreamed then that it was you who came to me in the dark with the tale of your impossible life could i have sent you away  i wish you had why didnt you  do you want me to tell you that you were irresistible how could i have sent you away but you what made you come back to me with your very heart on your lips  when lingard spoke after a time it was in jerky sentences  i didnt stop to think i had been hurt i didnt think of you people as ladies and gentlemen i thought of you as people whose lives i held in my hand how was it possible to forget you in my trouble it is your face that i brought back with me on board my brig i dont know why i didnt look at you more than at anybody else it took me all my time to keep my temper down lest it should burn you all up i didnt want to be rude to you people but i found it wasnt very easy because threats were the only argument i had was i very offensive mrs travers  she had listened tense and very attentive almost stern and it was without the slightest change of expression that she said  i think that you bore yourself appropriately to the state of life to which it has pleased god to call you  what state muttered lingard to himself i am what i am they call me rajah laut king tom and such like i think it amused you to hear it but i can tell you it is no joke to have such names fastened on one even in fun and those very names have in them something which makes all this affair here no small matter to anybody  she stood before him with a set severe facedid you call me out in this alarming manner only to quarrel with meno but why do you choose this time to tell me that my coming for help to you was nothing but impudence in your sight well i beg your pardon for intruding on your dignityyou misunderstood me said mrs travers without relaxing for a moment her contemplative severity such a flattering thing had never happened to me before and it will never happen to me again but believe me king tom you did me too much honour jorgenson is perfectly right in being angry with you for having taken a woman in towhe didnt mean to be rude protested lingard earnestly mrs travers didnt even smile at this intrusion of a point of manners into the atmosphere of anguish and suspense that seemed always to arise between her and this man who sitting on the seachest had raised his eyes to her with an air of extreme candour and seemed unable to take them off again she continued to look at him sternly by a tremendous effort of will  how changed you are he murmured  he was lost in the depths of the simplest wonder she appeared to him vengeful and as if turned forever into stone before his bewildered remorse forever suddenly mrs travers looked round and sat down in the chair her strength failed her but she remained austere with her hands resting on the arms of her seat lingard sighed deeply and dropped his eyes she did not dare relax her muscles for fear of breaking down altogether and betraying a reckless impulse which lurked at the bottom of her dismay to seize the head of dalcacers man of fate press it to her breast once fling it far away and vanish herself vanish out of life like a wraith the man of fate sat silent and bowed yet with a suggestion of strength in his dejection if i dont speak mrs travers said to herself with great inward calmness i shall burst into tears she said aloud what could have happened what have you dragged me in here for why dont you tell me your news  i thought you didnt want to hear i believe you really dont want to what is all this to you i believe that you dont care anything about what i feel about what i do and how i end i verily believe that you dont care how you end yourself i believe you never cared for your own or anybodys feelings i dont think it is because you are hard i think it is because you dont know and dont want to know and are angry with life  he flourished an arm recklessly and mrs travers noticed for the first time that he held a sheet of paper in his hand  is that your news there she asked significantly its difficult to imagine that in this wilderness writing can have any significance and who on earth here could send you news on paper will you let me see it could i understand it is it in english come king tom dont look at me in this awful way  she got up suddenly not in indignation but as if at the end of her endurance the jewelled clasps the gold embroideries gleamed elusively amongst the folds of her draperies which emitted a mysterious rustle  i cant stand this she cried i cant stand being looked at like this no woman could stand it no woman has ever been looked at like this what can you see hatred i could understand what is it you think me capable of  you are very extraordinary murmured lingard who had regained his selfpossession before that outburst  very well and you are extraordinary too thats understoodhere we are both under that curse and having to face together whatever may turn up but who on earth could have sent you this writing  who repeated lingard why that young fellow that blundered on my brig in the dark bringing a boatload of trouble alongside on that quiet night in carimata straits the darkest night i have ever known an accursed night  mrs travers bit her lip waited a little then asked quietly  what difficulty has he got into now  difficulty cried lingard he is immensely pleased with himself the young fool you know when you sent him to talk to me that evening you left the yacht he came with a loaded pistol in his pocket and now he has gone and done it  done it repeated mrs travers blankly done what  she snatched from lingards unresisting palm the sheet of paper while she was smoothing it lingard moved round and stood close at her elbow she ran quickly over the first lines then her eyes steadied at the end she drew a quick breath and looked up at lingard their faces had never been so close together before and mrs travers had a surprising second of a perfectly new sensation she looked awaydo you understand what this news means he murmured mrs travers let her hand fall by her side yes she said in a low tone the compact is broken  carter had begun his letter without any preliminaries  you cleared out in the middle of the night and took the lady away with you you left me no proper orders but as a sailorman i looked upon myself as left in charge of two ships while within half a mile on that sandbank there were more than a hundred piratical cutthroats watching me as closely as so many tigers about to leap days went by without a word of you or the lady to leave the ships outside and go inland to look for you was not to be thought of with all those pirates within springing distance put yourself in my place cant you imagine my anxiety my sleepless nights each night worse than the night before and still no word from you i couldnt sit still and worry my head off about things i couldnt understand i am a sailorman my first duty was to the ships i had to put an end to this impossible situation and i hope you will agree that i have done it in a seamanlike way one misty morning i moved the brig nearer the sandbank and directly the mist cleared i opened fire on the praus of those savages which were anchored in the channel we aimed wide at first to give those vagabonds that were on board a chance to clear out and join their friends camped on the sands i didnt want to kill people then we got the long gun to bear and in about an hour we had the bottom knocked out of the two praus the savages on the bank howled and screamed at every shot they are mighty angry but i dont care for their anger now for by sinking their praus i have made them as harmless as a flock of lambs they neednt starve on their sandbank because they have two or three dugouts hauled up on the sand and they may ferry themselves and their women to the mainland whenever they like  i fancy i have acted as a seaman and as a seaman i intend to go on acting now i have made the ships safe i shall set about without loss of time trying to get the yacht off the mud when thats done i shall arm the boats and proceed inshore to look for you and the yachts gentry and shant rest till i know whether any or all of you are above the earth yet  i hope these words will reach you just as we had done the business of those praus the man you sent off that night in carimata to stop our chief officer came sailing in from the west with our first gig in tow and the boats crew all well your serang tells me he is a most trustworthy messenger and that his name is jaffir he seems only too anxious to try to get to you as soon as possible i repeat ships and men have been made safe and i dont mean to give you up dead or alive  you are quick in taking the point said lingard in a dull voice while mrs travers with the sheet of paper gripped in her hand looked into his face with anxious eyes he has been smart and no mistake  he didnt know murmured mrs travers  no he didnt know but could i take everybody into my confidence protested lingard in the same low tone and yet who else could i trust it seemed to me that he must have understood without being told but he is too young he may well be proud according to his lights he has done that job outside very smartlydamn his smartness and here we are with all our lives depending on my wordwhich is broken now mrs travers it is broken  mrs travers nodded at him slightly  they would sooner have expected to see the sun and the moon fall out of the sky lingard continued with repressed fire next moment it seemed to have gone out of him and mrs travers heard him mutter a disconnected phrase    the world down about my ears  what will you do she whispered  what will i do repeated lingard gently oh yesdo mrs travers do you see that i am nothing now just nothing  he had lost himself in the contemplation of her face turned to him with an expression of awed curiosity the shock of the world coming down about his ears in consequence of carters smartness was so terrific that it had dulled his sensibilities in the manner of a great pain or of a great catastrophe what was there to look at but that womans face in a world which had lost its consistency its shape and its promises in a moment  mrs travers looked away she understood that she had put to lingard an impossible question what was presenting itself to her as a problem was to that man a crisis of feeling obviously carters action had broken the compact entered into with daman and she was intelligent enough to understand that it was the sort of thing that could not be explained away it wasnt horror that she felt but a sort of consternation something like the discomfiture of people who have just missed their train it was only more intense the real dismay had yet to make its way into her comprehension to lingard it was a blow struck straight at his heart  he was not angry with carter the fellow had acted like a seaman carters concern was for the ships in this fatality carter was a mere incident the real cause of the disaster was somewhere else was other and more remote and at the same time lingard could not defend himself from a feeling that it was in himself too somewhere in the unexplored depths of his nature something fatal and unavoidable he muttered to himself  no i am not a lucky man  this was but a feeble expression of the discovery of the truth that suddenly had come home to him as if driven into his breast by a revealing power which had decided that this was to be the end of his fling but he was not the man to give himself up to the examination of his own sensations his natural impulse was to grapple with the circumstances and that was what he was trying to do but he missed now that sense of mastery which is half the battle conflict of some sort was the very essence of his life but this was something he had never known before this was a conflict within himself he had to face unsuspected powers foes that he could not go out to meet at the gate they were within as though he had been betrayed by somebody by some secret enemy he was ready to look round for that subtle traitor a sort of blankness fell on his mind and he suddenly thought why its myself  immediately afterward he had a clear merciless recollection of hassim and immada he saw them far off beyond the forests oh yes they existedwithin his breast  that was a night he muttered looking straight at mrs travers he had been looking at her all the time his glance had held her under a spell but for a whole interminable minute he had not been aware of her at all at the murmur of his words she made a slight movement and he saw her againwhat night she whispered timidly like an intruder she was astonished to see him smilenot like this one he said you made me notice how quiet and still it was yes listen how still it is  both moved their heads slightly and seemed to lend an ear there was not a murmur sigh rustle splash or footfall no whispers no tremors not a sound of any kind they might have been alone on board the emma abandoned even by the ghost of captain jorgenson departed to rejoin the barque wild rose on the shore of the cimmerian seaits like the stillness of the end said mrs travers in a low equable voiceyes but that too is false said lingard in the same tonei dont understand mrs travers began hurriedly after a short silence but dont use that word dont use it king tom it frightens me by its mere sound  lingard made no sign his thoughts were back with hassim and immada the young chief and his sister had gone up country on a voluntary mission to persuade belarab to return to his stockade and to take up again the direction of affairs they carried urgent messages from lingard who for belarab was the very embodiment of truth and force that unquestioned force which had permitted belarab to indulge in all his melancholy hesitations but those two young people had also some personal prestige they were lingards hearts friends they were like his children but beside that their high birth their warlike story their wanderings adventures and prospects had given them a glamour of their own    v  the very day that travers and dalcacer had come on board the emma hassim and immada had departed on their mission for lingard of course could not think of leaving the white people alone with jorgenson jorgenson was all right but his ineradicable habit of muttering in his moustache about throwing a lighted match amongst the powder barrels had inspired lingard with a certain amount of mistrust and moreover he did not want to go away from mrs travers  it was the only correct inspiration on carters part to send jaffir with his report to lingard that stouthearted fighter swimmer and devoted follower of the princely misfortunes of hassim and immada had looked upon his mission to catch the chief officer of the yacht which he had received from lingard in carimata as a trifling job it took him a little longer than he expected but he had got back to the brig just in time to be sent on to lingard with carters letter after a couple of hours rest he had the story of all the happenings from wasub before he left and though his face preserved its grave impassivity in his heart he did not like it at all  fearless and wily jaffir was the man for difficult missions and a born messengeras he expressed it himselfto bear weighty words between great men with his unfailing memory he was able to reproduce them exactly whether soft or hard in council or in private for he knew no fear with him there was no need for writing which might fall into the hands of the enemy if he died on the way the message would die with him he had also the gift of getting at the sense of any situation and an observant eye he was distinctly one of those men from whom trustworthy information can be obtained by the leaders of great enterprises lingard did put several questions to him but in this instance of course jaffir could have only very little to say of carter whom he called the young one he said that he looked as white men look when they are pleased with themselves then added without waiting for a definite questionthe ships out there are now safe enough o rajah laut there was no elation in his tone  lingard looked at him blankly when the greatest of white men remarked that there was yet a price to be paid for that safety jaffir assented by a yes by allah without losing for a moment his grim composure when told that he would be required to go and find his master and the lady immada who were somewhere in the back country in belarabs travelling camp he declared himself ready to proceed at once he had eaten his fill and had slept three hours on board the brig and he was not tired when he was young he used to get tired sometimes but for many years now he had known no such weakness he did not require the boat with paddlers in which he had come up into the lagoon he would go alone in a small canoe this was no time he remarked for publicity and ostentation his pentup anxiety burst through his lips it is in my mind tuan that death has not been so near them since that night when you came sailing in a black cloud and took us all out of the stockade  lingard said nothing but there was in jaffir a faith in that white man which was not easily shaken  how are you going to save them this time o rajah laut he asked simply  belarab is my friend murmured lingard  in his anxiety jaffir was very outspoken a man of peace he exclaimed in a low tone who could be safe with a man like that he asked contemptuously  there is no war said lingard  there is suspicion dread and revenge and the anger of armed men retorted jaffir you have taken the white prisoners out of their hands by the force of your words alone is that so tuan  yes said lingard  and you have them on board here asked jaffir with a glance over his shoulder at the white and misty structure within which by the light of a small oil flame dalcacer and mrs travers were just then conversing  yes i have them here  then rajah laut whispered jaffir you can make all safe by giving them back  can i do that were the words breathed out through lingards lips to the faithful follower of hassim and immada  can you do anything else was the whispered retort of jaffir the messenger accustomed to speak frankly to the great of the earth you are a white man and you can have only one word and now i go  a small rough dugout belonging to the emma had been brought round to the ladder a shadowy calash hovering respectfully in the darkness of the deck had already cleared his throat twice in a warning manner  yes jaffir go said lingard and be my friend  i am the friend of a great prince said the other sturdily but you rajah laut were even greater and great you will remain while you are with us people of this sea and of this land but what becomes of the strength of your arms before your own white people where does it go to i say well then we must trust in the strength of your heart  i hope that will never fail said lingard and jaffir emitted a grunt of satisfaction but god alone sees into mens hearts  yes our refuge is with allah assented jaffir who had acquired the habit of pious turns of speech in the frequentation of professedly religious men of whom there were many in belarabs stockade as a matter of fact he reposed all his trust in lingard who had with him the prestige of a providential man sent at the hour of need by heaven itself he waited a while then what is the message i am to take he asked  tell the whole tale to the rajah hassim said lingard and tell him to make his way here with the lady his sister secretly and with speed the time of great trouble has come let us at least be together  right right jaffir approved heartily to die alone under the weight of ones enemies is a dreadful fate  he stepped back out of the sheen of the lamp by which they had been talking and making his way down into the small canoe he took up a paddle and without a splash vanished on the dark lagoon  it was then that mrs travers and dalcacer heard lingard call aloud for jorgenson instantly the familiar shadow stood at lingards elbow and listened in detached silence only at the end of the tale it marvelled audibly heres a mess for you if you like but really nothing in the world could astonish or startle old jorgenson he turned away muttering in his moustache lingard remained with his chin in his hand and jaffirs last words took gradual possession of his mind then brusquely he picked up the lamp and went to seek mrs travers he went to seek her because he actually needed her bodily presence the sound of her voice the dark clear glance of her eyes she could do nothing for him on his way he became aware that jorgenson had turned out the few malays on board the emma and was disposing them about the decks to watch the lagoon in all directions on calling mrs travers out of the cage lingard was in the midst of his mental struggle conscious of a certain satisfaction in taking her away from dalcacer he couldnt spare any of her attention to any other man not the least crumb of her time not the least particle of her thought he needed it all to see it withdrawn from him for the merest instant was irritatingseemed a disaster  dalcacer left alone wondered at the imperious tone of lingards call to this observer of shades the fact seemed considerable sheer nerves he concluded to himself the man is overstrung he must have had some sort of shock but what could it behe wondered to himself in the tense stagnation of those days of waiting the slightest tremor had an enormous importance dalcacer did not seek his camp bedstead he didnt even sit down with the palms of his hands against the edge of the table he leaned back against it in that negligent attitude he preserved an alert mind which for a moment wondered whether mrs travers had not spoiled lingard a little yet in the suddenness of the forced association where too dalcacer was sure there was some moral problem in the background he recognized the extreme difficulty of weighing accurately the imperious demands against the necessary reservations the exact proportions of boldness and caution and dalcacer admired upon the whole mrs travers cleverness  there could be no doubt that she had the situation in her hands that of course did not mean safety she had it in her hands as one may hold some highly explosive and uncertain compound dalcacer thought of her with profound sympathy and with a quite unselfish interest sometimes in a street we cross the path of personalities compelling sympathy and wonder but for all that we dont follow them home dalcacer refrained from following mrs travers any further he had become suddenly aware that mr travers was sitting up on his camp bedstead he must have done it very suddenly only a moment before he had appeared plunged in the deepest slumber and the stillness for a long time now had been perfectly unbroken dalcacer was startled enough for an exclamation and mr travers turned his head slowly in his direction dalcacer approached the bedstead with a certain reluctance  awake he said  a sudden chill said mr travers but i dont feel cold now strange i had the impression of an icy blast  ah said dalcacer  impossible of course went on mr travers this stagnating air never moves it clings odiously to one what time is it  really i dont know  the glass of my watch was smashed on that night when we were so treacherously assailed by the savages on the sandbank grumbled mr travers  i must say i was never so surprised in my life confessed dalcacer we had stopped and i was lighting a cigar you may remember  no said mr travers i had just then pulled out my watch of course it flew out of my hand but it hung by the chain somebody trampled on it the hands are broken off short it keeps on ticking but i cant tell the time its absurd most provoking  do you mean to say asked dalcacer that you have been winding it up every evening  mr travers looked up from his bedstead and he also seemed surprised why i suppose i have he kept silent for a while it isnt so much blind habit as you may think my habits are the outcome of strict method i had to order my life methodically you know very well my dear dalcacer that without strict method i would not have been able to get through my work and would have had no time at all for social duties which of course are of very great importance i may say that materially method has been the foundation of my success in public life there were never any empty moments in my day and now this    he looked all round the cage    wheres my wife he asked  i was talking to her only a moment ago answered dalcacer i dont know the time my watch is on board the yacht but it isnt late you know  mr travers flung off with unwonted briskness the light cotton sheet which covered him he buttoned hastily the tunic which he had unfastened before lying down and just as dalcacer was expecting him to swing his feet to the deck impetuously he lay down again on the pillow and remained perfectly still  dalcacer waited awhile and then began to pace the cage after a couple of turns he stopped and said gently  i am afraid travers you are not very well  i dont know what illness is answered the voice from the pillow to the great relief of dalcacer who really had not expected an answer good health is a great asset in public life illness may make you miss a unique opportunity i was never ill  all this came out deadened in tone as if the speakers face had been buried in the pillow dalcacer resumed his pacing  i think i asked you where my wife was said the muffled voice  with great presence of mind dalcacer kept on pacing the cage as if he had not heardyou know i think she is mad went on the muffled voice unless i am  again dalcacer managed not to interrupt his regular pacing do you know what i think he said abruptly i think travers that you dont want to talk about her i think that you dont want to talk about anything and to tell you the truth i dont want to either  dalcacer caught a faint sigh from the pillow and at the same time saw a small dim flame appear outside the cage and still he kept on his pacing mrs travers and lingard coming out of the deckhouse stopped just outside the door and lingard stood the decklamp on its roof they were too far from dalcacer to be heard but he could make them out mrs travers as straight as an arrow and the heavy bulk of the man who faced her with a lowered head he saw it in profile against the light and as if deferential in its slight droop they were looking straight at each other neither of them made the slightest gesture  there is that in me lingard murmured deeply which would set my heart harder than a stone i am king tom rajah laut and fit to look any man hereabouts in the face i have my name to take care of everything rests on that  mr dalcacer would express this by saying that everything rested on honour commented mrs travers with lips that did not tremble though from time to time she could feel the accelerated beating of her heart  call it what you like its something that a man needs to draw a free breath and lookas you see me standing before you here i care for it no longer  but i do care for it retorted mrs travers as you see me standing herei do care this is something that is your very own you have a right to it and i repeat i do care for it  care for something of my own murmured lingard very close to her face why should you care for my rights  because she said holding her ground though their foreheads were nearly touching because if i ever get back to my life i dont want to make it more absurd by real remorse  her tone was soft and lingard received the breath of those words like a caress on his face dalcacer in the cage made still another effort to keep up his pacing he didnt want to give mr travers the slightest excuse for sitting up again and looking round  that i should live to hear anybody say they cared anything for what was mine whispered lingard and that it should be youyou who have taken all hardness out of me  i dont want your heart to be made hard i want it to be made firm  you couldnt have said anything better than what you have said just now to make it steady flowed the murmur of lingards voice with something tender in its depth has anybody ever had a friend like this he exclaimed raising his head as if taking the starry night to witness  and i ask myself is it possible that there should be another man on earth that i could trust as i trust you i say to you yes go and save what you have a right to and dont forget to be merciful i will not remind you of our perfect innocence the earth must be small indeed that we should have blundered like this into your life its enough to make one believe in fatality but i cant find it in me to behave like a fatalist to sit down with folded hands had you been another kind of man i might have been too hopeless or too disdainful do you know what mr dalcacer calls you  inside the cage dalcacer casting curious glances in their direction saw lingard shake his head and thought with slight uneasiness he is refusing her something  mr dalcacers name for you is the man of fate said mrs travers a little breathlessly  a mouthful never mind he is a gentleman its what you     i call you all but by your christian name said mrs travers hastily believe me mr dalcacer understands you  he is all right interjected lingard  and he is innocent i remember what you have saidthat the innocent must take their chance well then do what is right  you think it would be right you believe it you feel it  at this time in this place from a man like youyes it is right  lingard thought that woman wonderfully true to him and wonderfully fearless with herself the necessity to take back the two captives to the stockade was so clear and unavoidable now that he believed nothing on earth could have stopped him from doing so but where was there another woman in the world who would have taken it like this and he reflected that in truth and courage there is found wisdom it seemed to him that till mrs travers came to stand by his side he had never known what truth and courage and wisdom were with his eyes on her face and having been told that in her eyes he appeared worthy of being both commanded and entreated he felt an instant of complete content a moment of as it were perfect emotional repose  during the silence mrs travers with a quick sideglance noticed dalcacer as one sees a man in a mist his mere dark shape arrested close to the muslin screen she had no doubt that he was looking in their direction and that he could see them much more plainly than she could see him mrs travers thought suddenly how anxious he must be and she remembered that he had begged her for some sign for some warning beforehand at the moment of crisis she had understood very well his hinted request for time to get prepared if he was to get more than a few minutes this was the moment to make him a signthe sign he had suggested himself mrs travers moved back the least bit so as to let the light fall in front of her and with a slow distinct movement she put her left hand to her forehead  well then she heard lingards forcible murmur well then mrs travers it must be done tonight  one may be true fearless and wise and yet catch ones breath before the simple finality of action mrs travers caught her breath tonight tonight she whispered dalcacers dark and misty silhouette became more blurred he had seen her sign and had retreated deeper within the cage  yes tonight affirmed lingard now at once within the hour this moment he murmured fiercely following mrs travers in her recoiling movement she felt her arm being seized swiftly dont you see that if it is to do any good that if they are not to be delivered to mere slaughter it must be done while all is dark ashore before an armed mob in boats comes clamouring alongside yes before the night is an hour older so that i may be hammering at belarabs gate while all the settlement is still asleep  mrs travers didnt dream of protesting for the moment she was unable to speak this man was very fierce and just as suddenly as it had been gripped making her think incongruously in the midst of her agitation that there would be certainly a bruise there in the morning she felt her arm released and a penitential tone come into lingards murmuring voice  and even now its nearly too late the road was plain but i saw you on it and my heart failed me i was there like an empty man and i dared not face you you must forgive me no i had no right to doubt you for a moment i feel as if i ought to go on my knees and beg your pardon for forgetting what you are for daring to forget  why king tom what is it  it seems as if i had sinned she heard him say he seized her by the shoulders turned her about moved her forward a step or two his hands were heavy his force irresistible though he himself imagined he was handling her gently look straight before you he growled into her ear do you see anything mrs travers passive between the rigid arms could see nothing but far off the massed featureless shadows of the shore  no i see nothing she said  you cant be looking the right way she heard him behind her and now she felt her head between lingards hands he moved it the least bit to the right there see it  no what am i to look for  a gleam of light said lingard taking away his hands suddenly a gleam that will grow into a blaze before our boat can get half way across the lagoon  even as lingard spoke mrs travers caught sight of a red spark far away she had looked often enough at the settlement as on the face of a painting on a curtain to have its configuration fixed in her mind to know that it was on the beach at its end furthest from belarabs stockade  the brushwood is catching murmured lingard in her ear if they had some dry grass the whole pile would be blazing by now  and this means     it means that the news has spread and it is before tenggas enclosure on his end of the beach thats where all the brains of the settlement are it means talk and excitement and plenty of crafty words tenggas fire i tell you mrs travers that before half an hour has passed daman will be there to make friends with the fat tengga who is ready to say to him i told you so  i see murmured mrs travers lingard drew her gently to the rail  and now look over there at the other end of the beach where the shadows are heaviest that is belarabs fort his houses his treasure his dependents thats where the strength of the settlement is i kept it up i made it last but what is it now its like a weapon in the hand of a dead man and yet its all we have to look to if indeed there is still time i swear to you i wouldnt dare land them in daylight for fear they should be slaughtered on the beach  there is no time to lose whispered mrs travers and lingard too spoke very low  no not if i too am to keep what is my right its you who have said it  yes i have said it she whispered without lifting her head lingard made a brusque movement at her elbow and bent his head close to her shoulder  and i who mistrusted you like arabs do to their great men i ought to kiss the hem of your robe in repentance for having doubted the greatness of your heart  oh my heart said mrs travers lightly still gazing at the fire which had suddenly shot up to a tall blaze i can assure you it has been of very little account in the world she paused for a moment to steady her voice then said firmly lets get this over  to tell you the truth the boat has been ready for some time  well then     mrs travers said lingard with an effort they are people of your own kind and suddenly he burst out i cannot take them ashore bound hand and foot  mr dalcacer knows you will find him ready ever since the beginning he has been prepared for whatever might happen  he is a man said lingard with conviction but its of the other that i am thinking  ah the other she repeated then what about my thoughts luckily we have mr dalcacer i shall speak to him first  she turned away from the rail and moved toward the cage  jorgenson the voice of lingard resounded all along the deck get a light on the gangway then he followed mrs travers slowly    vi  dalcacer after receiving his warning stepped back and leaned against the edge of the table he could not ignore in himself a certain emotion and indeed when he had asked mrs travers for a sign he expected to be movedbut he had not expected the sign to come so soon he expected this night to pass like other nights in broken slumbers bodily discomfort and the unrest of disconnected thinking at the same time he was surprised at his own emotion he had flattered himself on the possession of more philosophy he thought that this famous sense of selfpreservation was a queer thing a purely animal thing for as a thinking man he reflected i really ought not to care it was probably the unusual that affected him clearly if he had been lying seriously ill in a room in a hotel and had overheard some ominous whispers he would not have cared in the least ah but then he would have been illand in illness one grows so indifferent illness is a great help to unemotional behaviour which of course is the correct behaviour for a man of the world he almost regretted he was not very ill but then mr travers was obviously ill and it did not seem to help him much dalcacer glanced at the bedstead where mr travers preserved an immobility which struck dalcacer as obviously affected he mistrusted it generally he mistrusted mr travers one couldnt tell what he would do next not that he could do much one way or another but that somehow he threatened to rob the situation of whatever dignity it may have had as a stroke of fate as a call on courage mr dalcacer acutely observant and alert for the slightest hints preferred to look upon himself as the victim not of a swindle but of a rough man naively engaged in a contest with heavens injustice dalcacer did not examine his heart but some lines of a french poet came into his mind to the effect that in all times those who fought with an unjust heaven had possessed the secret admiration and love of men he didnt go so far as love but he could not deny to himself that his feeling toward lingard was secretly friendly andwell appreciative mr travers sat up suddenly what a horrible nuisance thought dalcacer fixing his eyes on the tips of his shoes with the hope that perhaps the other would lie down again mr travers spoke  still up dalcacer  i assure you it isnt late its dark at six we dined before seven that makes the night long and i am not a very good sleeper that is i cannot go to sleep till late in the night  i envy you said mr travers speaking with a sort of drowsy apathy i am always dropping off and the awakenings are horrible  dalcacer raising his eyes noticed that mrs travers and lingard had vanished from the light they had gone to the rail where dalcacer could not see them some pity mingled with his vexation at mr travers snatchy wakefulness there was something weird about the man he reflected jorgenson he began aloud  whats that snapped mr travers  its the name of that lanky old storekeeper who is always about the decks  i havent seen him i dont see anybody i dont know anybody i prefer not to notice  i was only going to say that he gave me a pack of cards would you like a game of piquet  i dont think i could keep my eyes open said mr travers in an unexpectedly confidential tone isnt it funny dalcacer and then i wake up its too awful  dalcacer made no remark and mr travers seemed not to have expected any  when i said my wife was mad he began suddenly causing dalcacer to start i didnt mean it literally of course his tone sounded slightly dogmatic and he didnt seem to be aware of any interval during which he had appeared to sleep dalcacer was convinced more than ever that he had been shamming and resigned himself wearily to listen folding his arms across his chest what i meant really continued mr travers was that she is the victim of a craze society is subject to crazes as you know very well they are not reprehensible in themselves but the worst of my wife is that her crazes are never like those of the people with whom she naturally associates they generally run counter to them this peculiarity has given me some anxiety you understand in the position we occupy people will begin to say that she is eccentric do you see her anywhere dalcacer  dalcacer was thankful to be able to say that he didnt see mrs travers he didnt even hear any murmurs though he had no doubt that everybody on board the emma was wide awake by now but mr travers inspired him with invincible mistrust and he thought it prudent to add  you forget that your wife has a room in the deckhouse  this was as far as he would go for he knew very well that she was not in the deckhouse mr travers completely convinced by the statement made no sound but neither did he lie down again dalcacer gave himself up to meditation the night seemed extremely oppressive at lingards shout for jorgenson that in the profound silence struck his ears ominously he raised his eyes and saw mrs travers outside the door of the cage he started forward but she was already within he saw she was moved she seemed out of breath and as if unable to speak at first  hadnt we better shut the door suggested dalcacer  captain lingards coming in she whispered to him he has made up his mind  thats an excellent thing commented dalcacer quietly i conclude from this that we shall hear something  you shall hear it all from me breathed out mrs travers  ah exclaimed dalcacer very low  by that time lingard had entered too and the decks of the emma were all astir with moving figures jorgensons voice was also heard giving directions for nearly a minute the four persons within the cage remained motionless a shadowy malay in the gangway said suddenly sudah tuan and lingard murmured ready mrs travers  she seized dalcacers arm and led him to the side of the cage furthest from the corner in which mr travers bed was placed while lingard busied himself in pricking up the wick of the cage lantern as if it had suddenly occurred to him that this whatever happened should not be a deed of darkness mr travers did nothing but turn his head to look over his shoulder  one moment said dalcacer in a low tone and smiling at mrs travers agitation before you tell me anything let me ask you have you made up your mind he saw with much surprise a widening of her eyes was it indignation a pause as of suspicion fell between those two people then dalcacer said apologetically perhaps i ought not to have asked that question and lingard caught mrs travers words oh i am not afraid to answer that question  then their voices sank lingard hung the lamp up again and stood idle in the revived light but almost immediately he heard dalcacer calling him discreetly  captain lingard  he moved toward them at once at the same instant mr travers head pivoted away from the group to its frontal position  dalcacer very serious spoke in a familiar undertone  mrs travers tells me that we must be delivered up to those moors on shore  yes there is nothing else for it said lingard  i confess i am a bit startled said dalcacer but except for a slightly hurried utterance nobody could have guessed at anything resembling emotion  i have a right to my good name said lingard also very calm while mrs travers near him with halfveiled eyes listened impassive like a presiding genius  i wouldnt question that for a moment conceded dalcacer a point of honour is not to be discussed but there is such a thing as humanity too to be delivered up helplessly     perhaps interrupted lingard but you neednt feel hopeless i am not at liberty to give up my life for your own mrs travers knows why that too is engaged  always on your honour  i dont know a promise is a promise  nobody can be held to the impossible remarked dalcacer  impossible what is impossible i dont know it i am not a man to talk of the impossible or dodge behind it i did not bring you here  dalcacer lowered his head for a moment i have finished he said gravely that much i had to say i hope you dont think i have appeared unduly anxious  its the best policy too mrs travers made herself heard suddenly nothing of her moved but her lips she did not even raise her eyes its the only possible policy you believe me mr dalcacer    he made an almost imperceptible movement of the head    well then i put all my hope in you mr dalcacer to get this over as easily as possible and save us all from some odious scene you think perhaps that it is i who ought to     no no i dont think so interrupted dalcacer it would be impossible  i am afraid it would she admitted nervously  dalcacer made a gesture as if to beg her to say no more and at once crossed over to mr travers side of the cage he did not want to give himself time to think about his task mr travers was sitting up on the camp bedstead with a light cotton sheet over his legs he stared at nothing and on approaching him dalcacer disregarded the slight sinking of his own heart at this aspect which seemed to be that of extreme terror this is awful he thought the man kept as still as a hare in its form  the impressed dalcacer had to make an effort to bring himself to tap him lightly on the shoulder  the moment has come travers to show some fortitude he said with easy intimacy mr travers looked up swiftly i have just been talking to your wife she had a communication from captain lingard for us both it remains for us now to preserve as much as possible our dignity i hope that if necessary we will both know how to die  in a moment of profound stillness dalcacer had time to wonder whether his face was as stony in expression as the one upturned to him but suddenly a smile appeared on it which was certainly the last thing dalcacer expected to see an indubitable smile a slightly contemptuous smile  my wife has been stuffing your head with some more of her nonsense mr travers spoke in a voice which astonished dalcacer as much as the smile a voice that was not irritable nor peevish but had a distinct note of indulgence my dear dalcacer that craze has got such a hold of her that she would tell you any sort of tale social impostors mediums fortunetellers charlatans of all sorts do obtain a strange influence over women you have seen that sort of thing yourself i had a talk with her before dinner the influence that bandit has got over her is incredible i really believe the fellow is half crazy himself they often are you know i gave up arguing with her now what is it you have got to tell me but i warn you that i am not going to take it seriously  he rejected briskly the cotton sheet put his feet to the ground and buttoned his jacket dalcacer as he talked became aware by the slight noise behind him that mrs travers and lingard were leaving the cage but he went on to the end and then waited anxiously for the answer  see she has followed him out on deck were mr travers first words i hope you understand that it is a mere craze you cant help seeing that look at her costume she simply has lost her head luckily the world neednt know but suppose that something similar had happened at home it would have been extremely awkward oh yes i will come i will go anywhere i cant stand this hulk those people this infernal cage i believe i should fall ill if i were to remain here  the inward detached voice of jorgenson made itself heard near the gangway saying the boat has been waiting for this hour past king tom  let us make a virtue of necessity and go with a good grace said dalcacer ready to take mr travers under the arm persuasively for he did not know what to make of that gentleman  but mr travers seemed another man i am afraid dalcacer that you too are not very strongminded i am going to take a blanket off this bedstead    he flung it hastily over his arm and followed dalcacer closely what i suffer mostly from strange to say is cold  mrs travers and lingard were waiting near the gangway to everybodys extreme surprise mr travers addressed his wife first  you were always laughing at peoples crazes was what he said and now you have a craze of your own but we wont discuss that  dalcacer passed on raising his cap to mrs travers and went down the ships side into the boat jorgenson had vanished in his own manner like an exorcised ghost and lingard stepping back left husband and wife face to face  did you think i was going to make a fuss asked mr travers in a very low voice i assure you i would rather go than stay here you didnt think that you have lost all sense of reality of probability i was just thinking this evening that i would rather be anywhere than here looking on at you at your folly     mrs travers loud martin made lingard wince caused dalcacer to lift his head down there in the boat and even jorgenson forward somewhere out of sight ceased mumbling in his moustache the only person who seemed not to have heard that exclamation was mr travers himself who continued smoothly     at the aberration of your mind you who seemed so superior to common credulities you are not yourself not at all and some day you will admit to me that    no the best thing will be to forget it as you will soon see yourself we shall never mention that subject in the future i am certain you will be only too glad to agree with me on that point  how far ahead are you looking asked mrs travers finding her voice and even the very tone in which she would have addressed him had they been about to part in the hall of their town house she might have been asking him at what time he expected to be home while a footman held the door open and the brougham waited in the street  not very far this cant last much longer mr travers made a movement as if to leave her exactly as though he were rather pressed to keep an appointment by the by he said checking himself i suppose the fellow understands thoroughly that we are wealthy he could hardly doubt that  its the last thought that would enter his head said mrs travers  oh yes just so mr travers allowed a little impatience to pierce under his casual manner but i dont mind telling you that i have had enough of this i am prepared to makeahto make concessions a large pecuniary sacrifice only the whole position is so absurd he might conceivably doubt my good faith wouldnt it be just as well if you with your particular influence would hint to him that with me he would have nothing to fear i am a man of my word  that is the first thing he would naturally think of any man said mrs travers  will your eyes never be opened mr travers began irritably then gave it up well so much the better then i give you a free hand  what made you change your attitude like this asked mrs travers suspiciously  my regard for you he answered without hesitation  i intended to join you in your captivity i was just trying to persuade him     i forbid you absolutely whispered mr travers forcibly i am glad to get away i dont want to see you again till your craze is over  she was confounded by his secret vehemence but instantly succeeding his fierce whisper came a short inane society laugh and a much louder not that i attach any importance     he sprang away as it were from his wife and as he went over the gangway waved his hand to her amiably  lighted dimly by the lantern on the roof of the deckhouse mrs travers remained very still with lowered head and an aspect of profound meditation it lasted but an instant before she moved off and brushing against lingard passed on with downcast eyes to her deck cabin lingard heard the door shut he waited awhile made a movement toward the gangway but checked himself and followed mrs travers into her cabin  it was pitch dark in there he could see absolutely nothing and was oppressed by the profound stillness unstirred even by the sound of breathing  i am going on shore he began breaking the black and deathlike silence enclosing him and the invisible woman i wanted to say goodbye  you are going on shore repeated mrs travers her voice was emotionless blank unringing  yes for a few hours or for life lingard said in measured tones i may have to die with them or to die maybe for others for you if i only knew how to manage it i would want to live i am telling you this because it is dark if there had been a light in here i wouldnt have come in  i wish you had not uttered the same unringing womans voice you are always coming to me with those lives and those deaths in your hand  yes its too much for you was lingards undertoned comment you could be no other than true and you are innocent dont wish me life but wish me luck for you are innocentand you will have to take your chance  all luck to you king tom he heard her say in the darkness in which he seemed now to perceive the gleam of her hair i will take my chance and try not to come near me again for i am weary of you  i can well believe it murmured lingard and stepped out of the cabin shutting the door after him gently for half a minute perhaps the stillness continued and then suddenly the chair fell over in the darkness next moment mrs travers head appeared in the light of the lamp left on the roof of the deckhouse her bare arms grasped the door posts  wait a moment she said loudly into the shadows of the deck she heard no footsteps saw nothing moving except the vanishing white shape of the late captain h c jorgenson who was indifferent to the life of men wait king tom she insisted raising her voice then i didnt mean it dont believe me she cried recklessly  for the second time that night a womans voice startled the hearts of men on board the emma all except the heart of old jorgenson the malays in the boat looked up from their thwarts dalcacer sitting in the stern sheets beside lingard felt a sinking of his heart  whats this he exclaimed i heard your name on deck you are wanted i think  shove off ordered lingard inflexibly without even looking at dalcacer mr travers was the only one who didnt seem to be aware of anything a long time after the boat left the emmas side he leaned toward dalcacer  i have a most extraordinary feeling he said in a cautious undertone i seem to be in the airi dont know are we on the water dalcacer are you quite sure but of course we are on the water  yes said dalcacer in the same tone crossing the styxperhaps he heard mr travers utter an unmoved very likely which he did not expect lingard his hand on the tiller sat like a man of stone  then your point of view has changed whispered dalcacer  i told my wife to make an offer went on the earnest whisper of the other man a sum of money but to tell you the truth i dont believe very much in its success  dalcacer made no answer and only wondered whether he didnt like better mr travers other unreasonable mood there was no denying the fact that mr travers was a troubling person now he suddenly gripped dalcacers forearm and added under his breath i doubt everything i doubt whether the offer will ever be made  all this was not very impressive there was something pitiful in it whisper grip shudder as of a child frightened in the dark but the emotion was deep once more that evening but this time aroused by the husbands distress dalcacers wonder approached the borders of awe    part vi the claim of life and the toll of death  i  have you got king toms watch in there said a voice that seemed not to attach the slightest importance to the question jorgenson outside the door of mrs travers part of the deckhouse waited for the answer he heard a low cry very much like a moan the startled sound of pain that may be sometimes heard in sick rooms but it moved him not at all he would never have dreamt of opening the door unless told to do so in which case he would have beheld with complete indifference mrs travers extended on the floor with her head resting on the edge of the camp bedstead on which lingard had never slept as though she had subsided there from a kneeling posture which is the attitude of prayer supplication or defeat the hours of the night had passed mrs travers by after flinging herself on her knees she didnt know why since she could think of nothing to pray for had nothing to invoke and was too far gone for such a futile thing as despair she had remained there till the sense of exhaustion had grown on her to the point in which she lost her belief in her power to rise in a halfsitting attitude her head resting against the edge of the couch and her arms flung above her head she sank into an indifference the mere resignation of a wornout body and a wornout mind which often is the only sort of rest that comes to people who are desperately ill and is welcome enough in a way the voice of jorgenson roused her out of that state she sat up aching in every limb and cold all over  jorgenson behind the door repeated with lifeless obstinacy  do you see king toms watch in there  mrs travers got up from the floor she tottered snatching at the air and found the back of the armchair under her hand  whos there  she was also ready to ask where am i but she remembered and at once became the prey of that active dread which had been lying dormant for a few hours in her uneasy and prostrate body what time is it she faltered out  dawn pronounced the imperturbable voice at the door it seemed to her that it was a word that could make any heart sink with apprehension dawn she stood appalled and the toneless voice outside the door insisted  you must have toms watch there  i havent seen it she cried as if tormented by a dream  look in that desk thing if you push open the shutter you will be able to see  mrs travers became aware of the profound darkness of the cabin jorgenson heard her staggering in there after a moment a womans voice which struck even him as strange said in faint tones  i have it its stopped  it doesnt matter i dont want to know the time there should be a key about see it anywhere  yes its fastened to the watch the dazed voice answered from within jorgenson waited before making his request will you pass it out to me theres precious little time left now  the door flew open which was certainly something jorgenson had not expected he had expected but a hand with the watch protruded through a narrow crack but he didnt start back or give any other sign of surprise at seeing mrs travers fully dressed against the faint clearness in the frame of the open shutter she presented to him the dark silhouette of her shoulders surmounted by a sleek head because her hair was still in the two plaits to jorgenson mrs travers in her uneuropean dress had always been displeasing almost monstrous her stature her gestures her general carriage struck his eye as absurdly incongruous with a malay costume too ample too free too boldoffensive to mrs travers jorgenson in the dusk of the passage had the aspect of a dim white ghost and he chilled her by his ghosts aloofness  he picked up the watch from her outspread palm without a word of thanks only mumbling in his moustache hm yes thats it i havent yet forgotten how to count seconds correctly but its better to have a watch  she had not the slightest notion what he meant and she did not care her mind remained confused and the sense of bodily discomfort oppressed her she whispered shamefacedly i believe ive slept  i havent mumbled jorgenson growing more and more distinct to her eyes the brightness of the short dawn increased rapidly as if the sun were impatient to look upon the settlement no fear of that he added boastfully  it occurred to mrs travers that perhaps she had not slept either her state had been more like an imperfect halfconscious quivering death she shuddered at the recollection  what an awful night she murmured drearily  there was nothing to hope for from jorgenson she expected him to vanish indifferent like a phantom of the dead carrying off the appropriately dead watch in his hand for some unearthly purpose jorgenson didnt move his was an insensible almost a senseless presence nothing could be extorted from it but a wave of anguish as confused as all her other sensations swept mrs travers off her feet  cant you tell me something she cried  for half a minute perhaps jorgenson made no sound then for years i have been telling anybody who cared to ask he mumbled in his moustache telling tom too and tom knew what he wanted to do hows one to know what you are after  she had never expected to hear so many words from that rigid shadow its monotonous mumble was fascinating its sudden loquacity was shocking and in the profound stillness that reigned outside it was as if there had been no one left in the world with her but the phantom of that old adventurer he was heard again what i could tell you would be worse than poison  mrs travers was not familiar with jorgensons consecrated phrases the mechanical voice the words themselves his air of abstraction appalled her and he hadnt done yet she caught some more of his unconcerned mumbling there is nothing i dont know and the absurdity of the statement was also appalling mrs travers gasped and with a wild little laugh  then you know why i called after king tom last night  he glanced away along his shoulder through the door of the deckhouse at the growing brightness of the day she did so too it was coming it had come another day and it seemed to mrs travers a worse calamity than any discovery she had made in her life than anything she could have imagined to come to her the very magnitude of horror steadied her seemed to calm her agitation as some kinds of fatal drugs do before they kill she laid a steady hand on jorgensons sleeve and spoke quietly distinctly urgently  you were on deck what i want to know is whether i was heard  yes said jorgenson absently i heard you then as if roused a little he added less mechanically the whole ship heard you  mrs travers asked herself whether perchance she had not simply screamed it had never occurred to her before that perhaps she had at the time it seemed to her she had no strength for more than a whisper had she been really so loud and the deadly chill the night that had gone by her had left in her body vanished from her limbs passed out of her in a flush her face was turned away from the light and that fact gave her courage to continue moreover the man before her was so detached from the shames and prides and schemes of life that he seemed not to count at all except that somehow or other he managed at times to catch the mere literal sense of the words addressed to himand answer them and answer them answer unfailingly impersonally without any feeling  you saw tomking tom was he there i mean just then at the moment there was a light at the gangway was he on deck  no in the boat  already could i have been heard in the boat down there you say the whole ship heard meand i dont care but could he hear me  was it tom you were after said jorgenson in the tone of a negligent remark  cant you answer me she cried angrily  tom was busy no childs play the boat shoved off said jorgenson as if he were merely thinking aloud  you wont tell me then mrs travers apostrophized him fearlessly she was not afraid of jorgenson just then she was afraid of nothing and nobody and jorgenson went on thinking aloud  i guess he will be kept busy from now on and so shall i  mrs travers seemed ready to take by the shoulders and shake that deadvoiced spectre till it begged for mercy but suddenly her strong white arms fell down by her side the arms of an exhausted woman  i shall never never find out she whispered to herself  she cast down her eyes in intolerable humiliation in intolerable desire as though she had veiled her face not a sound reached the loneliness of her thought but when she raised her eyes again jorgenson was no longer standing before her  for an instant she saw him all black in the brilliant and narrow doorway and the next moment he had vanished outside as if devoured by the hot blaze of light the sun had risen on the shore of refuge  when mrs travers came out on deck herself it was as it were with a boldly unveiled face with wideopen and dry sleepless eyes their gaze undismayed by the sunshine sought the innermost heart of things each day offered to the passion of her dread and of her impatience the lagoon the beach the colours and the shapes struck her more than ever as a luminous painting on an immense cloth hiding the movements of an inexplicable life she shaded her eyes with her hand there were figures on the beach moving dark dots on the white semicircle bounded by the stockades backed by roof ridges above the palm groves further back the mass of carved white coral on the roof of the mosque shone like a white daystar religion and politicsalways politics to the left before tenggas enclosure the loom of fire had changed into a pillar of smoke but there were some big trees over there and she couldnt tell whether the night council had prolonged its sitting some vague forms were still moving there and she could picture them to herself daman the supreme chief of searobbers with a vengeful heart and the eyes of a gazelle sentot the sour fanatic with the big turban that other saint with a scanty loin cloth and ashes in his hair and tengga whom she could imagine from hearsay fat goodtempered crafty but ready to spill blood on his ambitious way and already bold enough to flaunt a yellow state umbrella at the very gate of belarabs stockadeso they said  she saw she imagined she even admitted now the reality of those things no longer a mere pageant marshalled for her vision with barbarous splendour and savage emphasis she questioned it no longerbut she did not feel it in her soul any more than one feels the depth of the sea under its peaceful glitter or the turmoil of its grey fury her eyes ranged afar unbelieving and fearfuland then all at once she became aware of the empty cage with its interior in disorder the camp bedsteads not taken away a pillow lying on the deck the dying flame like a shred of dull yellow stuff inside the lamp left hanging over the table the whole struck her as squalid and as if already decayed a flimsy and idle phantasy but jorgenson seated on the deck with his back to it was not idle his occupation too seemed fantastic and so truly childish that her heart sank at the mans utter absorption in it jorgenson had before him stretched on the deck several bits of rather thin and dirtylooking rope of different lengths from a couple of inches to about a foot he had an idiot might have amused himself in that way set fire to the ends of them they smouldered with amazing energy emitting now and then a splutter and in the calm air within the bulwarks sent up very slender exactly parallel threads of smoke each with a vanishing curl at the end and the absorption with which jorgenson gave himself up to that pastime was enough to shake all confidence in his sanity  in one halfopened hand he was holding the watch he was also provided with a scrap of paper and the stump of a pencil mrs travers was confident that he did not either hear or see her  captain jorgenson you no doubt think     he tried to wave her away with the stump of the pencil he did not want to be interrupted in his strange occupation he was playing very gravely indeed with those bits of string i lighted them all together he murmured keeping one eye on the dial of the watch just then the shortest piece of string went out utterly consumed jorgenson made a hasty note and remained still while mrs travers looked at him with stony eyes thinking that nothing in the world was any use the other threads of smoke went on vanishing in spirals before the attentive jorgenson  what are you doing asked mrs travers drearily  timing match    precaution     he had never in mrs travers experience been less spectral than then he displayed a weakness of the flesh he was impatient at her intrusion he divided his attention between the threads of smoke and the face of the watch with such interest that the sudden reports of several guns breaking for the first time for days the stillness of the lagoon and the illusion of the painted scene failed to make him raise his head he only jerked it sideways a little mrs travers stared at the wisps of white vapour floating above belarabs stockade the series of sharp detonations ceased and their combined echoes came back over the lagoon like a longdrawn and rushing sigh  whats this cried mrs travers  belarabs come home said jorgenson  the last thread of smoke disappeared and jorgenson got up he had lost all interest in the watch and thrust it carelessly into his pocket together with the bit of paper and the stump of pencil he had resumed his aloofness from the life of men but approaching the bulwark he condescended to look toward belarabs stockade  yes he is home he said very low  whats going to happen cried mrs travers whats to be done jorgenson kept up his appearance of communing with himself  i know what to do he mumbled  you are lucky said mrs travers with intense bitterness  it seemed to her that she was abandoned by all the world the opposite shore of the lagoon had resumed its aspect of a painted scene that would never roll up to disclose the truth behind its blinding and soulless splendour it seemed to her that she had said her last words to all of them to dalcacer to her husband to lingard himselfand that they had all gone behind the curtain forever out of her sight of all the white men jorgenson alone was left that man who had done with life so completely that his mere presence robbed it of all heat and mystery leaving nothing but its terrible its revolting insignificance and mrs travers was ready for revolt she cried with suppressed passion  are you aware captain jorgenson that i am alive  he turned his eyes on her and for a moment she was daunted by their cold glassiness but before they could drive her away something like the gleam of a spark gave them an instants animation  i want to go and join them i want to go ashore she said firmly there  her bare and extended arm pointed across the lagoon and jorgensons resurrected eyes glided along the white limb and wandered off into space  no boat he muttered  there must be a canoe i know there is a canoe i want it  she stepped forward compelling commanding trying to concentrate in her glance all her will power the sense of her own right to dispose of herself and her claim to be served to the last moment of her life it was as if she had done nothing jorgenson didnt flinch  which of them are you after asked his blank unringing voice  she continued to look at him her face had stiffened into a severe mask she managed to say distinctly  i suppose you have been asking yourself that question for some time captain jorgenson  no i am asking you now  his face disclosed nothing to mrs travers bold and weary eyes what could you do over there jorgenson added as merciless as irrepressible and sincere as though he were the embodiment of that inner voice that speaks in all of us at times and like jorgenson is offensive and difficult to answer  remember that i am not a shadow but a living woman still captain jorgenson i can live and i can die send me over to share their fate  sure you would like asked the roused jorgenson in a voice that had an unexpected living quality a faint vibration which no man had known in it for years there may be death in it he mumbled relapsing into indifference  who cares she said recklessly all i want is to ask tom a question and hear his answer thats what i would like thats what i must have    ii  along the hot and gloomy forest path neglected overgrown and strangled in the fierce life of the jungle there came a faint rustle of leaves jaffir the servant of princes the messenger of great men walked stooping with a broad chopper in his hand he was naked from the waist upward his shoulders and arms were scratched and bleeding a multitude of biting insects made a cloud about his head he had lost his costly and ancient headkerchief and when in a slightly wider space he stopped in a listening attitude anybody would have taken him for a fugitive  he waved his arms about slapping his shoulders the sides of his head his heaving flanks then motionless listened again for a while a sound of firing not so much made faint by distance as muffled by the masses of foliage reached his ears dropping shots which he could have counted if he had cared to there is fighting in the forest already he thought then putting his head low in the tunnel of vegetation he dashed forward out of the horrible cloud of flies which he actually managed for an instant to leave behind him but it was not from the cruelty of insects that he was flying for no man could hope to drop that escort and jaffir in his life of a faithful messenger had been accustomed if such an extravagant phrase may be used to be eaten alive bent nearly double he glided and dodged between the trees through the undergrowth his brown body streaming with sweat his firm limbs gleaming like limbs of imperishable bronze through the mass of green leaves that are forever born and forever dying for all his desperate haste he was no longer a fugitive he was simply a man in a tremendous hurry his flight which had begun with a bound and a rush and a general display of great presence of mind was a simple issue from a critical situation issues from critical situations are generally simple if one is quick enough to think of them in time he became aware very soon that the attempt to pursue him had been given up but he had taken the forest path and had kept up his pace because he had left his rajah and the lady immada beset by enemies on the edge of the forest as good as captives to a party of tenggas men  belarabs hesitation had proved too much even for hassims hereditary patience in such matters it is but becoming that weighty negotiations should be spread over many days that the same requests and arguments should be repeated in the same words at many successive interviews and receive the same evasive answers matters of state demand the dignity of such a procedure as if time itself had to wait on the power and wisdom of rulers such are the proceedings of embassies and the dignified patience of envoys but at this time of crisis hassims impatience obtained the upper hand and though he never departed from the tradition of soft speech and restrained bearing while following with his sister in the train of the pious belarab he had his moments of anger of anxiety of despondency his friendships his future his countrys destinies were at stake while belarabs camp wandered deviously over the back country as if influenced by the vacillation of the rulers thought the very image of uncertain fate  often no more than the single word good was all the answer vouchsafed to hassims daily speeches the lesser men companions of the chief treated him with deference but hassim could feel the opposition from the womens side of the camp working against his cause in subservience to the mere caprice of the new wife a girl quite gentle and kind to her dependents but whose imagination had run away with her completely and had made her greedy for the loot of the yacht from mere simplicity and innocence what could hassim that stranger wandering and poor offer for her acceptance nothing the wealth of his faroff country was but an idle tale the talk of an exile looking for help  at night hassim had to listen to the anguished doubts of immada the only companion of his life child of the same mother brave as a man but in her fears a very woman she whispered them to him far into the night while the camp of the great belarab was hushed in sleep and the fires had sunk down to mere glowing embers hassim soothed her gravely but he too was a native of wajo where men are more daring and quicker of mind than other malays more energetic too and energy does not go without an inner fire hassim lost patience and one evening he declared to his sister immada tomorrow we leave this ruler without a mind and go back to our white friend  therefore next morning letting the camp move on the direct road to the settlement hassim and immada took a course of their own it was a lonely path between the jungle and the clearings they had two attendants with them hassims own men men of wajo and so the lady immada when she had a mind to could be carried after the manner of the great ladies of wajo who need not put foot to the ground unless they like the lady immada accustomed to the hardships that are the lot of exiles preferred to walk but from time to time she let herself be carried for a short distance out of regard for the feelings of her attendants the party made good time during the early hours and hassim expected confidently to reach before evening the shore of the lagoon at a spot very near the stranded emma at noon they rested in the shade near a dark pool within the edge of the forest and it was there that jaffir met them much to his and their surprise it was the occasion of a long talk jaffir squatting on his heels discoursed in measured tones he had entranced listeners the story of carters exploit amongst the shoals had not reached belarabs camp it was a great shock to hassim but the sort of half smile with which he had been listening to jaffir never altered its character it was the princess immada who cried out in distress and wrung her hands a deep silence fell  indeed before the fatal magnitude of the fact it seemed even to those malays that there was nothing to say and jaffir lowering his head respected his princes consternation then before that feeling could pass away from that small group of people seated round a few smouldering sticks the noisy approach of a large party of men made them all leap to their feet before they could make another movement they perceived themselves discovered the men were armed as if bound on some warlike expedition amongst them sentot in his loin cloth and with unbound wild locks capered and swung his arms about like the lunatic he was the others astonishment made them halt but their attitude was obviously hostile in the rear a portly figure flanked by two attendants carrying swords was approaching prudently rajah hassim resumed quietly his seat on the trunk of a fallen tree immada rested her hand lightly on her brothers shoulder and jaffir squatting down again looked at the ground with all his faculties and every muscle of his body tensely on the alert  tenggas fighters he murmured scornfully  in the group somebody shouted and was answered by shouts from afar there could be no thought of resistance hassim slipped the emerald ring from his finger stealthily and jaffir got hold of it by an almost imperceptible movement the rajah did not even look at the trusty messenger  fail not to give it to the white man he murmured thy servant hears o rajah its a charm of great power  the shadows were growing to the westward everybody was silent and the shifting group of armed men seemed to have drifted closer immada drawing the end of a scarf across her face confronted the advance with only one eye exposed on the flank of the armed men sentot was performing a slow dance but he too seemed to have gone dumb  now go breathed out rajah hassim his gaze levelled into space immovably  for a second or more jaffir did not stir then with a sudden leap from his squatting posture he flew through the air and struck the jungle in a great commotion of leaves vanishing instantly like a swimmer diving from on high a deep murmur of surprise arose in the armed party a spear was thrown a shot was fired three or four men dashed into the forest but they soon returned crestfallen with apologetic smiles while jaffir striking an old path that seemed to lead in the right direction ran on in solitude raising a rustle of leaves with a naked parang in his hand and a cloud of flies about his head the sun declining to the westward threw shafts of light across his dark path he ran at a springy halftrot his eyes watchful his broad chest heaving and carrying the emerald ring on the forefinger of a clenched hand as though he were afraid it should slip off fly off be torn from him by an invisible force or spirited away by some enchantment who could tell what might happen there were evil forces at work in the world powerful incantations horrible apparitions the messenger of princes and of great men charged with the supreme appeal of his master was afraid in the deepening shade of the forest evil presences might have been lurking in that gloom still the sun had not set yet he could see its face through the leaves as he skirted the shore of the lagoon but what if allahs call should come to him suddenly and he die as he ran  he drew a long breath on the shore of the lagoon within about a hundred yards from the stranded bows of the emma the tide was out and he walked to the end of a submerged log and sent out a hail for a boat jorgensons voice answered the sun had sunk behind the forest belt of the coast all was still as far as the eye could reach over the black water a slight breeze came along it and jaffir on the brink waiting for a canoe shivered a little  at the same moment carter exhausted by thirty hours of uninterrupted toil at the head of whites and malays in getting the yacht afloat dropped into mrs travers deck chair on board the hermit said to the devoted wasub let a good watch be kept tonight old man glanced contentedly at the setting sun and fell asleep    iii  there was in the bows of the emma an elevated grating over the heel of her bowsprit whence the eye could take in the whole range of her deck and see every movement of her crew it was a spot safe from eavesdroppers though of course exposed to view the sun had just set on the supreme content of carter when jorgenson and jaffir sat down side by side between the knightheads of the emma and public but unapproachable impressive and secret began to converse in low tones  every wajo fugitive who manned the hulk felt the approach of a decisive moment their minds were made up and their hearts beat steadily they were all desperate men determined to fight and to die and troubling not about the manner of living or dying this was not the case with mrs travers who having shut herself up in the deckhouse was profoundly troubled about those very things though she too felt desperate enough to welcome almost any solution  of all the people on board she alone did not know anything of that conference in her deep and aimless thinking she had only become aware of the absence of the slightest sound on board the emma not a rustle not a footfall the public view of jorgenson and jaffir in deep consultation had the effect of taking all wish to move from every man  twilight enveloped the two figures forward while they talked looking in the stillness of their pose like carved figures of european and asiatic contrasted in intimate contact the deepening dusk had nearly effaced them when at last they rose without warning as it were and thrilling the heart of the beholders by the sudden movement but they did not separate at once they lingered in their high place as if awaiting the fall of complete darkness a fit ending to their mysterious communion jaffir had given jorgenson the whole story of the ring the symbol of a friendship matured and confirmed on the night of defeat on the night of flight from a fardistant land sleeping unmoved under the wrath and fire of heaven  yes tuan continued jaffir it was first sent out to the white man on a night of mortal danger a present to remember a friend by i was the bearer of it then even as i am now then as now it was given to me and i was told to save myself and hand the ring over in confirmation of my message i did so and that white man seemed to still the very storm to save my rajah he was not one to depart and forget him whom he had once called his friend my message was but a message of goodbye but the charm of the ring was strong enough to draw all the power of that white man to the help of my master now i have no words to say rajah hassim asks for nothing but what of that by the mercy of allah all things are the same the compassion of the most high the power of the ring the heart of the white man nothing is changed only the friendship is a little older and love has grown because of the shared dangers and long companionship therefore tuan i have no fear but how am i to get the ring to the rajah laut just hand it to him the last breath would be time enough if they were to spear me at his feet but alas the bush is full of tenggas men the beach is open and i could never even hope to reach the gate  jorgenson with his hands deep in the pockets of his tunic listened looking down jaffir showed as much consternation as his nature was capable of  our refuge is with god he murmured but what is to be done has your wisdom no stratagem o tuan  jorgenson did not answer it appeared as though he had no stratagem but god is great and jaffir waited on the others immobility anxious but patient perplexed yet hopeful in his grim way while the night flowing on from the dark forest near by hid their two figures from the sight of observing men before the silence of jorgenson jaffir began to talk practically now that tengga had thrown off the mask jaffir did not think that he could land on the beach without being attacked captured nay killed since a man like he though he could save himself by taking flight at the order of his master could not be expected to surrender without a fight he mentioned that in the exercise of his important functions he knew how to glide like a shadow creep like a snake and almost burrow his way underground he was jaffir who had never been foiled no bog morass great river or jungle could stop him he would have welcomed them in many respects they were the friends of a crafty messenger but that was an open beach and there was no other way and as things stood now every bush around every tree trunk every deep shadow of house or fence would conceal tenggas men or such of damans infuriated partisans as had already made their way to the settlement how could he hope to traverse the distance between the waters edge and belarabs gate which now would remain shut night and day not only himself but anybody from the emma would be sure to be rushed upon and speared in twenty places  he reflected for a moment in silence  even you tuan could not accomplish the feat  true muttered jorgenson  when after a period of meditation he looked round jaffir was no longer by his side he had descended from the high place and was probably squatting on his heels in some dark nook on the fore deck jorgenson knew jaffir too well to suppose that he would go to sleep he would sit there thinking himself into a state of fury then get away from the emma in some way or other go ashore and perish fighting he would in fact run amok for it looked as if there could be no way out of the situation then of course lingard would know nothing of hassim and immadas captivity for the ring would never reach himthe ring that could tell its own tale no lingard would know nothing he would know nothing about anybody outside belarabs stockade till the end came whatever the end might be for all those people that lived the life of men whether to know or not to know would be good for lingard jorgenson could not tell he admitted to himself that here there was something that he jorgenson could not tell all the possibilities were wrapped up in doubt uncertain like all things pertaining to the life of men it was only when giving a short thought to himself that jorgenson had no doubt he of course would know what to do  on the thin face of that old adventurer hidden in the night not a feature moved not a muscle twitched as he descended in his turn and walked aft along the decks of the emma his faded eyes which had seen so much did not attempt to explore the night they never gave a glance to the silent watchers against whom he brushed had a light been flashed on him suddenly he would have appeared like a man walking in his sleep the somnambulist of an eternal dream mrs travers heard his footsteps pass along the side of the deckhouse she heard themand let her head fall again on her bare arms thrown over the little desk before which she sat  jorgenson standing by the taffrail noted the faint reddish glow in the massive blackness of the further shore jorgenson noted things quickly cursorily perfunctorily as phenomena unrelated to his own apparitional existence of a visiting ghost they were but passages in the game of men who were still playing at life he knew too well how much that game was worth to be concerned about its course he had given up the habit of thinking for so long that the sudden resumption of it irked him exceedingly especially as he had to think on toward a conclusion in that world of eternal oblivion of which he had tasted before lingard made him step back into the life of men all things were settled once for all he was irritated by his own perplexity which was like a reminder of that mortality made up of questions and passions from which he had fancied he had freed himself forever by a natural association his contemptuous annoyance embraced the existence of mrs travers too for how could he think of tom lingard of what was good or bad for king tom without thinking also of that woman who had managed to put the ghost of a spark even into his own extinguished eyes she was of no account but toms integrity was it was of tom that he had to think of what was good or bad for tom in that absurd and deadly game of his life finally he reached the conclusion that to be given the ring would be good for tom lingard just to be given the ring and no more the ring and no more  it will help him to make up his mind muttered jorgenson in his moustache as if compelled by an obscure conviction it was only then that he stirred slightly and turned away from the loom of the fires on the distant shore mrs travers heard his footsteps passing again along the side of the deckhouseand this time never raised her head that man was sleepless mad childish and inflexible he was impossible he haunted the decks of that hulk aimlessly     it was however in pursuance of a very distinct aim that jorgenson had gone forward again to seek jaffir  the first remark he had to offer to jaffirs consideration was that the only person in the world who had the remotest chance of reaching belarabs gate on that night was that tall white woman the rajah laut had brought on board the wife of one of the captive white chiefs surprise made jaffir exclaim but he wasnt prepared to deny that it was possible that for many reasons some quite simple and others very subtle those sons of the evil one belonging to tengga and daman would refrain from killing a white woman walking alone from the waters edge to belarabs gate yes it was just possible that she might walk unharmed  especially if she carried a blazing torch muttered jorgenson in his moustache he told jaffir that she was sitting now in the dark mourning silently in the manner of white women she had made a great outcry in the morning to be allowed to join the white men on shore he jorgenson had refused her the canoe ever since she had secluded herself in the deckhouse in great distress  jaffir listened to it all without particular sympathy and when jorgenson added it is in my mind o jaffir to let her have her will now he answered by a yes by allah let her go what does it matter of the greatest unconcern till jorgenson added  yes and she may carry the ring to the rajah laut  jorgenson saw jaffir the grim and impassive jaffir give a perceptible start it seemed at first an impossible task to persuade jaffir to part with the ring the notion was too monstrous to enter his mind to move his heart but at last he surrendered in an awed whisper god is great perhaps it is her destiny  being a wajo man he did not regard women as untrustworthy or unequal to a task requiring courage and judgment once he got over the personal feeling he handed the ring to jorgenson with only one reservation you know tuan that she must on no account put it on her finger  let her hang it round her neck suggested jorgenson readily  as jorgenson moved toward the deckhouse it occurred to him that perhaps now that woman tom lingard had taken in tow might take it into her head to refuse to leave the emma this did not disturb him very much all those people moved in the dark he himself at that particular moment was moving in the dark beyond the simple wish to guide lingards thought in the direction of hassim and immada to help him to make up his mind at last to a ruthless fidelity to his purpose jorgenson had no other aim the existence of those whites had no meaning on earth they were the sort of people that pass without leaving footprints that woman would have to act in ignorance and if she refused to go then in ignorance she would have to stay on board he would tell her nothing  as a matter of fact he discovered that mrs travers would simply have nothing to do with him she would not listen to what he had to say she desired him a mere weary voice confined in the darkness of the deck cabin to go away and trouble her no more but the ghost of jorgenson was not easily exorcised he too was a mere voice in the outer darkness inexorable insisting that she should come out on deck and listen at last he found the right words to say  it is something about tom that i want to tell you you wish him well dont you  after this she could not refuse to come out on deck and once there she listened patiently to that white ghost muttering and mumbling above her drooping head  it seems to me captain jorgenson she said after he had ceased that you are simply trifling with me after your behaviour to me this morning i can have nothing to say to you  i have a canoe for you now mumbled jorgenson  you have some new purpose in view now retorted mrs travers with spirit but you wont make it clear to me what is it that you have in your mind  toms interest  are you really his friend  he brought me here you know it he has talked a lot to you  he did but i ask myself whether you are capable of being anybodys friend  you ask yourself repeated jorgenson very quiet and morose if i am not his friend i should like to know who is  mrs travers asked quickly whats all this about a ring what ring  toms property he has had it for years  and he gave it to you doesnt he care for it  dont know its just a thing  but it has a meaning as between you and him is that so  yes it has he will know what it means  what does it mean  i am too much his friend not to hold my tongue  what to me  and who are you was jorgensons unexpected remark he has told you too much already  perhaps he has whispered mrs travers as if to herself and you want that ring to be taken to him she asked in a louder tone  yes at once for his good  are you certain it is for his good why cant you     she checked herself that man was hopeless he would never tell anything and there was no means of compelling him he was invulnerable unapproachable    he was dead  just give it to him mumbled jorgenson as though pursuing a mere fixed idea just slip it quietly into his hand he will understand  what is it advice warning signal for action  it may be anything uttered jorgenson morosely but as it were in a mollified tone its meant for his good  oh if i only could trust that man mused mrs travers half aloud  jorgensons slight noise in the throat might have been taken for an expression of sympathy but he remained silent  really this is most extraordinary cried mrs travers suddenly aroused why did you come to me why should it be my task why should you want me specially to take it to him  i will tell you why said jorgensons blank voice its because there is no one on board this hulk that can hope to get alive inside that stockade this morning you told me yourself that you were ready to diefor tomor with tom well risk it then you are the only one that has half a chance to get throughand tom maybe is waiting  the only one repeated mrs travers with an abrupt movement forward and an extended hand before which jorgenson stepped back a pace risk it certainly wheres that mysterious ring  i have got it in my pocket said jorgenson readily yet nearly half a minute elapsed before mrs travers felt the characteristic shape being pressed into her halfopen palm dont let anybody see it jorgenson admonished her in a murmur hide it somewhere about you why not hang it round your neck  mrs travers hand remained firmly closed on the ring yes that will do she murmured hastily ill be back in a moment get everything ready with those words she disappeared inside the deckhouse and presently threads of light appeared in the interstices of the boards mrs travers had lighted a candle in there she was busy hanging that ring round her neck she was going yestaking the risk for toms sake  nobody can resist that man jorgenson muttered to himself with increasing moroseness i couldnt   iv  jorgenson after seeing the canoe leave the ships side ceased to live intellectually there was no need for more thinking for any display of mental ingenuity he had done with it all all his notions were perfectly fixed and he could go over them in the same ghostly way in which he haunted the deck of the emma at the sight of the ring lingard would return to hassim and immada now captives too though jorgenson certainly did not think them in any serious danger what had happened really was that tengga was now holding hostages and those jorgenson looked upon as lingards own people they were his he had gone in with them deep very deep they had a hold and a claim on king tom just as many years ago people of that very race had had a hold and a claim on him jorgenson only tom was a much bigger man a very big man nevertheless jorgenson didnt see why he should escape his own fatejorgensons fateto be absorbed captured made their own either in failure or in success it was an unavoidable fatality and jorgenson felt certain that the ring would compel lingard to face it without flinching what he really wanted lingard to do was to cease to take the slightest interest in those whiteswho were the sort of people that left no footprints  perhaps at first sight sending that woman to lingard was not the best way toward that end jorgenson however had a distinct impression in which his morning talk with mrs travers had only confirmed him that those two had quarrelled for good as indeed was unavoidable what did tom lingard want with any woman the only woman in jorgensons life had come in by way of exchange for a lot of cotton stuffs and several brass guns this fact could not but affect jorgensons judgment since obviously in this case such a transaction was impossible therefore the case was not serious it didnt exist what did exist was lingards relation to the wajo exiles a great and warlike adventure such as no rover in those seas had ever attempted  that tengga was much more ready to negotiate than to fight the old adventurer had not the slightest doubt how lingard would deal with him was not a concern of jorgensons that would be easy enough nothing prevented lingard from going to see tengga and talking to him with authority all that ambitious person really wanted was to have a share in lingards wealth in lingards power in lingards friendship a year before tengga had once insinuated to jorgenson in what way am i less worthy of being a friend than belarab  it was a distinct overture a disclosure of the mans innermost mind jorgenson of course had met it with a profound silence his task was not diplomacy but the care of stores  after the effort of connected mental processes in order to bring about mrs travers departure he was anxious to dismiss the whole matter from his mind the last thought he gave to it was severely practical it occurred to him that it would be advisable to attract in some way or other lingards attention to the lagoon in the language of the sea a single rocket is properly a signal of distress but in the circumstances a group of three sent up simultaneously would convey a warning he gave his orders and watched the rockets go up finely with a trail of red sparks a bursting of white stars high up in the air and three loud reports in quick succession then he resumed his pacing of the whole length of the hulk confident that after this tom would guess that something was up and set a close watch over the lagoon no doubt these mysterious rockets would have a disturbing effect on tengga and his friends and cause a great excitement in the settlement but for that jorgenson did not care the settlement was already in such a turmoil that a little more excitement did not matter what jorgenson did not expect however was the sound of a musketshot fired from the jungle facing the bows of the emma it caused him to stop dead short he had heard distinctly the bullet strike the curve of the bow forward some hotheaded ass fired that he said to himself contemptuously it simply disclosed to him the fact that he was already besieged on the shore side and set at rest his doubts as to the length tengga was prepared to go any length of course there was still time for tom to put everything right with six words unless    jorgenson smiled grimly in the dark and resumed his tireless pacing  what amused him was to observe the fire which had been burning night and day before tenggas residence suddenly extinguished he pictured to himself the wild rush with bamboo buckets to the lagoon shore the confusion the hurry and jostling in a great hissing of water midst clouds of steam the image of the fat tenggas consternation appealed to jorgensons sense of humour for about five seconds then he took up the binoculars from the roof of the deckhouse  the bursting of the three white stars over the lagoon had given him a momentary glimpse of the black speck of the canoe taking over mrs travers he couldnt find it again with the glass it was too dark but the part of the shore for which it was steered would be somewhere near the angle of belarabs stockade nearest to the beach this jorgenson could make out in the faint rosy glare of fires burning inside jorgenson was certain that lingard was looking toward the emma through the most convenient loophole he could find  as obviously mrs travers could not have paddled herself across two men were taking her over and for the steersman she had jaffir though he had assented to jorgensons plan jaffir was anxious to accompany the ring as near as possible to its destination nothing but dire necessity had induced him to part with the talisman crouching in the stern and flourishing his paddle from side to side he glared at the back of the canvas deckchair which had been placed in the middle for mrs travers wrapped up in the darkness she reclined in it with her eyes closed faintly aware of the ring hung low on her breast as the canoe was rather large it was moving very slowly the two men dipped their paddles without a splash and surrendering herself passively in a temporary relaxation of all her limbs to this adventure mrs travers had no sense of motion at all she too like jorgenson was tired of thinking she abandoned herself to the silence of that night full of roused passions and deadly purposes she abandoned herself to an illusory feeling to the impression that she was really resting for the first time in many days she could taste the relief of being alone the men with her were less than nothing she could not speak to them she could not understand them the canoe might have been moving by enchantmentif it did move at all like a halfconscious sleeper she was on the verge of saying to herself what a strange dream i am having  the low tones of jaffirs voice stole into it quietly telling the men to cease paddling and the long canoe came to a rest slowly no more than ten yards from the beach the party had been provided with a torch which was to be lighted before the canoe touched the shore thus giving a character of openness to this desperate expedition and if it draws fire on us jaffir had commented to jorgenson well then we shall see whose fate it is to die on this night  yes had muttered jorgenson we shall see  jorgenson saw at last the small light of the torch against the blackness of the stockade he strained his hearing for a possible volley of musketry fire but no sound came to him over the broad surface of the lagoon over there the man with the torch the other paddler and jaffir himself impelling with a gentle motion of his paddle the canoe toward the shore had the glistening eyeballs and the tense faces of silent excitement the ruddy glare smote mrs travers closed eyelids but she didnt open her eyes till she felt the canoe touch the strand the two men leaped instantly out of it mrs travers rose abruptly nobody made a sound she stumbled out of the canoe on to the beach and almost before she had recovered her balance the torch was thrust into her hand the heat the nearness of the blaze confused and blinded her till instinctively she raised the torch high above her head for a moment she stood still holding aloft the fierce flame from which a few sparks were falling slowly  a naked bronze arm lighted from above pointed out the direction and mrs travers began to walk toward the featureless black mass of the stockade when after a few steps she looked back over her shoulder the lagoon the beach the canoe the men she had just left had become already invisible she was alone bearing up a blazing torch on an earth that was a dumb shadow shifting under her feet at last she reached firmer ground and the dark length of the palisade untouched as yet by the light of the torch seemed to her immense intimidating she felt ready to drop from sheer emotion but she moved on  a little more to the left shouted a strong voice  it vibrated through all her fibres rousing like the call of a trumpet went far beyond her filled all the space mrs travers stood still for a moment then casting far away from her the burning torch ran forward blindly with her hands extended toward the great sound of lingards voice leaving behind her the light flaring and spluttering on the ground she stumbled and was only saved from a fall by her hands coming in contact with the rough stakes the stockade rose high above her head and she clung to it with widely open arms pressing her whole body against the rugged surface of that enormous and unscalable palisade she heard through it low voices inside heavy thuds and felt at every blow a slight vibration of the ground under her feet she glanced fearfully over her shoulder and saw nothing in the darkness but the expiring glow of the torch she had thrown away and the sombre shimmer of the lagoon bordering the opaque darkness of the shore her strained eyeballs seemed to detect mysterious movements in the darkness and she gave way to irresistible terror to a shrinking agony of apprehension was she to be transfixed by a broad blade to the high immovable wall of wood against which she was flattening herself desperately as though she could hope to penetrate it by the mere force of her fear she had no idea where she was but as a matter of fact she was a little to the left of the principal gate and almost exactly under one of the loopholes of the stockade her excessive anguish passed into insensibility she ceased to hear to see and even to feel the contact of the surface to which she clung lingards voice somewhere from the sky above her head was directing her distinct very close full of concern  you must stoop low lower yet  the stagnant blood of her body began to pulsate languidly she stooped lowlower yetso low that she had to sink on her knees and then became aware of a faint smell of wood smoke mingled with the confused murmur of agitated voices this came to her through an opening no higher than her head in her kneeling posture and no wider than the breadth of two stakes lingard was saying in a tone of distress  i couldnt get any of them to unbar the gate  she was unable to make a soundare you there lingard asked anxiously so close to her now that she seemed to feel the very breath of his words on her face it revived her completely she understood what she had to do she put her head and shoulders through the opening was at once seized under the arms by an eager grip and felt herself pulled through with an irresistible force and with such haste that her scarf was dragged off her head its fringes having caught in the rough timber the same eager grip lifted her up stood her on her feet without her having to make any exertion toward that end she became aware that lingard was trying to say something but she heard only a confused stammering expressive of wonder and delight in which she caught the words you    you    deliriously repeated he didnt release his hold of her his helpful and irresistible grip had changed into a close clasp a crushing embrace the violent taking possession by an embodied force that had broken loose and was not to be controlled any longer as his great voice had done a moment before his great strength too seemed able to fill all space in its enveloping and undeniable authority every time she tried instinctively to stiffen herself against its might it reacted affirming its fierce will its uplifting power several times she lost the feeling of the ground and had a sensation of helplessness without fear of triumph without exultation the inevitable had come to pass she had foreseen itand all the time in that dark place and against the red glow of camp fires within the stockade the man in whose arms she struggled remained shadowy to her eyesto her halfclosed eyes she thought suddenly he will crush me to death without knowing it  he was like a blind force she closed her eyes altogether her head fell back a little not instinctively but with wilful resignation and as it were from a sense of justice she abandoned herself to his arms the effect was as though she had suddenly stabbed him to the heart he let her go so suddenly and completely that she would have fallen down in a heap if she had not managed to catch hold of his forearm he seemed prepared for it and for a moment all her weight hung on it without moving its rigidity by a hairs breadth behind her mrs travers heard the heavy thud of blows on wood the confused murmurs and movements of men  a voice said suddenly its done with such emphasis that though of course she didnt understand the words it helped her to regain possession of herself and when lingard asked her very little above a whisper why dont you say something she answered readily let me get my breath first  round them all sounds had ceased the men had secured again the opening through which those arms had snatched her into a moment of selfforgetfulness which had left her out of breath but uncrushed as if something imperative had been satisfied she had a moment of inward serenity a period of peace without thought while holding to that arm that trembled no more than an arm of iron she felt stealthily over the ground for one of the sandals which she had lost oh yes there was no doubt of it she had been carried off the earth without shame without regret but she would not have let him know of that dropped sandal for anything in the world that lost sandal was as symbolic as a dropped veil but he did not know of it he must never know where was that thing she felt sure that they had not moved an inch from that spot presently her foot found it and still gripping lingards forearm she stooped to secure it properly when she stood up still holding his arm they confronted each other he rigid in an effort of selfcommand but feeling as if the surges of the heaviest sea that he could remember in his life were running through his heart and the woman as if emptied of all feeling by her experience without thought yet but beginning to regain her sense of the situation and the memory of the immediate past  i have been watching at that loophole for an hour ever since they came running to me with that story of the rockets said lingard i was shut up with belarab then i was looking out when the torch blazed and you stepped ashore i thought i was dreaming but what could i do i felt i must rush to you but i dared not that clump of palms is full of men so are the houses you saw that time you came ashore with me full of men armed men a trigger is soon pulled and when once shooting begins    and you walking in the open with that light above your head i didnt dare you were safer alone i had the strength to hold myself in and watch you come up from the shore no no man that ever lived had seen such a sight what did you come for  didnt you expect somebody i dont mean me i mean a messenger  no said lingard wondering at his own selfcontrol why did he let you come  you mean captain jorgenson oh he refused at first he said that he had your orders  how on earth did you manage to get round him said lingard in his softest tones  i did not try she began and checked herself lingards question though he really didnt seem to care much about an answer had aroused afresh her suspicion of jorgensons change of front i didnt have to say very much at the last she continued gasping yet a little and feeling her personality crushed to nothing in the hug of those arms expand again to its full significance before the attentive immobility of that man captain jorgenson has always looked upon me as a nuisance perhaps he had made up his mind to get rid of me even against your orders is he quite sane  she released her firm hold of that iron forearm which fell slowly by lingards side she had regained fully the possession of her personality there remained only a fading slightly breathless impression of a short flight above that earth on which her feet were firmly planted now and is that all she asked herself not bitterly but with a sort of tender contempt  he is so sane sounded lingards voice gloomily that if i had listened to him you would not have found me here  what do you mean by here in this stockade  anywhere he said  and what would have happened then  god knows he answered what would have happened if the world had not been made in seven days i have known you for just about that time it began by me coming to you at nightlike a thief in the night where the devil did i hear that and that man you are married to thinks i am no better than a thief  it ought to be enough for you that i never made a mistake as to what you are that i come to you in less than twentyfour hours after you left me contemptuously to my distress dont pretend you didnt hear me call after you oh yes you heard the whole ship heard me for i had no shame  yes you came said lingard violently but have you really come i cant believe my eyes are you really here  this is a dark spot luckily said mrs travers but can you really have any doubt she added significantly  he made a sudden movement toward her betraying so much passion that mrs travers thought i shant come out alive this time and yet he was there motionless before her as though he had never stirred it was more as though the earth had made a sudden movement under his feet without being able to destroy his balance but the earth under mrs travers feet had made no movement and for a second she was overwhelmed by wonder not at this proof of her own selfpossession but at the mans immense power over himself if it had not been for her strange inward exhaustion she would perhaps have surrendered to that power but it seemed to her that she had nothing in her worth surrendering and it was in a perfectly even tone that she said give me your arm captain lingard we cant stay all night on this spot  as they moved on she thought there is real greatness in that man he was great even in his behaviour no apologies no explanations no abasement no violence and not even the slightest tremor of the frame holding that bold and perplexed soul she knew that for certain because her fingers were resting lightly on lingards arm while she walked slowly by his side as though he were taking her down to dinner and yet she couldnt suppose for a moment that like herself he was emptied of all emotion she never before was so aware of him as a dangerous force he is really ruthless she thought they had just left the shadow of the inner defences about the gate when a slightly hoarse apologetic voice was heard behind them repeating insistently what even mrs travers ear detected to be a sort of formula the words were there is this thingthere is this thingthere is this thing they turned round  oh my scarf said mrs travers  a short squat broadfaced young fellow having for all costume a pair of white drawers was offering the scarf thrown over both his arms as if they had been sticks and holding it respectfully as far as possible from his person lingard took it from him and mrs travers claimed it at once dont forget the proprieties she said this is also my face veil  she was arranging it about her head when lingard said there is no need i am taking you to those gentlemeni will use it all the same said mrs travers this thing works both ways as a matter of propriety or as a matter of precaution till i have an opportunity of looking into a mirror nothing will persuade me that there isnt some change in my face lingard swung half round and gazed down at her veiled now she confronted him boldly tell me captain lingard how many eyes were looking at us a little while ago  do you care he asked  not in the least she said a million stars were looking on too and what did it matter they were not of the world i know and its just the same with the eyes they are not of the world i live in  lingard thought nobody is never before had she seemed to him more unapproachable more different and more remote the glow of a number of small fires lighted the ground only and brought out the black bulk of men lying down in the thin drift of smoke only one of these fires rather apart and burning in front of the house which was the quarter of the prisoners might have been called a blaze and even that was not a great one it didnt penetrate the dark space between the piles and the depth of the verandah above where only a couple of heads and the glint of a spearhead could be seen dimly in the play of the light but down on the ground outside the black shape of a man seated on a bench had an intense relief another intensely black shadow threw a handful of brushwood on the fire and went away the man on the bench got up it was dalcacer he let lingard and mrs travers come quite close up to him extreme surprise seemed to have made him dumb  you didnt expect    began mrs travers with some embarrassment before that mute attitude  i doubted my eyes struck in dalcacer who seemed embarrassed too next moment he recovered his tone and confessed simply at the moment i wasnt thinking of you mrs travers he passed his hand over his forehead i hardly know what i was thinking of  in the light of the shootingup flame mrs travers could see dalcacers face there was no smile on it she could not remember ever seeing him so grave and as it were so distant she abandoned lingards arm and moved closer to the fire  i fancy you were very far away mr dalcacer she said  this is the sort of freedom of which nothing can deprive us he observed looking hard at the manner in which the scarf was drawn across mrs travers face its possible i was far away he went on but i can assure you that i dont know where i was less than an hour ago we had a great excitement here about some rockets but i didnt share in it there was no one i could ask a question of the captain here was i understood engaged in a most momentous conversation with the king or the governor of this place  he addressed lingard directly may i ask whether you have reached any conclusion as yet that moor is a very dilatory person i believe  any direct attack he would of course resist said lingard and so far you are protected but i must admit that he is rather angry with me hes tired of the whole business he loves peace above anything in the world but i havent finished with him yet  as far as i understood from what you told me before said mr dalcacer with a quick side glance at mrs travers uncovered and attentive eyes as far as i can see he may get all the peace he wants at once by driving us two i mean mr travers and myself out of the gate on to the spears of those other enraged barbarians and there are some of his counsellors who advise him to do that very thing no later than the break of day i understand  lingard stood for a moment perfectly motionless  thats about it he said in an unemotional tone and went away with a heavy step without giving another look at dalcacer and mrs travers who after a moment faced each other  you have heard said dalcacer of course that doesnt affect your fate in any way and as to him he is much too prestigious to be killed lightheartedly when all this is over you will walk triumphantly on his arm out of this stockade for there is nothing in all this to affect his greatness his absolute value in the eyes of those peopleand indeed in any other eyes dalcacer kept his glance averted from mrs travers and as soon as he had finished speaking busied himself in dragging the bench a little way further from the fire when they sat down on it he kept his distance from mrs travers she made no sign of unveiling herself and her eyes without a face seemed to him strangely unknown and disquieting  the situation in a nutshell she said you have arranged it all beautifully even to my triumphal exit well and what then no you neednt answer it has no interest i assure you i came here not with any notion of marching out in triumph as you call it i came here to speak in the most vulgar way to save your skinand mine  her voice came muffled to dalcacers ears with a changed character even to the very intonation above the white and embroidered scarf her eyes in the firelight transfixed him black and so steady that even the red sparks of the reflected glare did not move in them he concealed the strong impression she made he bowed his head a little  i believe you know perfectly well what you are doing  no i dont know she said more quickly than he had ever heard her speak before first of all i dont think he is so safe as you imagine oh yes he has prestige enough i dont question that but you are apportioning life and death with too much assurance     i know my portion murmured dalcacer gently a moment of silence fell in which mrs travers eyes ended by intimidating dalcacer who looked away the flame of the fire had sunk low in the dark agglomeration of buildings which might have been called belarabs palace there was a certain animation a flitting of people voices calling and answering the passing to and fro of lights that would illuminate suddenly a heavy pile the corner of a house the eaves of a lowpitched roof while in the open parts of the stockade the armed men slept by the expiring fires  mrs travers said suddenly that jorgenson is not friendly to us  possibly  with clasped hands and leaning over his knees dalcacer had assented in a very low tone mrs travers unobserved pressed her hands to her breast and felt the shape of the ring thick heavy set with a big stone it was there secret hung against her heart and enigmatic what did it mean what could it mean what was the feeling it could arouse or the action it could provoke and she thought with compunction that she ought to have given it to lingard at once without thinking without hesitating there this is what i came for to give you this yes but there had come an interval when she had been able to think of nothing and since then she had had the time to reflectunfortunately to remember jorgensons hostile contemptuous glance enveloping her from head to foot at the break of a day after a night of lonely anguish and now while she sat there veiled from his keen sight there was that other man that dalcacer prophesying o yes triumphant she knew already what that was mrs travers became afraid of the ring she felt ready to pluck it from her neck and cast it away  i mistrust him she saidyou do exclaimed dalcacer very lowi mean that jorgenson he seems a merciless sort of creaturehe is indifferent to everything said dalcacerit may be a maskhave you some evidence mrs travers  no said mrs travers without hesitation i have my instinct  dalcacer remained silent for a while as though he were pursuing another train of thought altogether then in a gentle almost playful tone if i were a woman he said turning to mrs travers i would always trust my intuitionif you were a woman mr dalcacer i would not be speaking to you in this way because then i would be suspect to you  the thought that before long perhaps he would be neither man nor woman but a lump of cold clay crossed dalcacers mind which was living alert and unsubdued by the danger he had welcomed the arrival of mrs travers simply because he had been very lonely in that stockade mr travers having fallen into a phase of sulks complicated with shivering fits of lingard dalcacer had seen almost nothing since they had landed for the man of fate was extremely busy negotiating in the recesses of belarabs main hut and the thought that his life was being a matter of arduous bargaining was not agreeable to mr dalcacer the chiefs dependents and the armed men garrisoning the stockade paid very little attention to him apparently and this gave him the feeling of his captivity being very perfect and hopeless during the afternoon while pacing to and fro in the bit of shade thrown by the glorified sort of hut inside which mr travers shivered and sulked misanthropically he had been aware of the more distant verandahs becoming filled now and then by the muffled forms of women of belarabs household taking a distant and curious view of the white man all this was irksome he found his menaced life extremely difficult to get through yes he welcomed the arrival of mrs travers who brought with her a tragic note into the empty gloom  suspicion is not in my nature mrs travers i assure you and i hope that you on your side will never suspect either my reserve or my frankness i respect the mysterious nature of your conviction but hasnt jorgenson given you some occasion to    he hates me said mrs travers and frowned at dalcacers incipient smile it isnt a delusion on my part the worst is that he hates me not for myself i believe he is completely indifferent to my existence jorgenson hates me because as it were i represent you two who are in danger because it is you two that are the trouble and i    well  yes yes thats certain said dalcacer hastily but jorgenson is wrong in making you the scapegoat for if you were not here cool reason would step in and would make lingard pause in his passion to make a king out of an exile if we were murdered it would certainly make some stir in the world in time and he would fall under the suspicion of complicity with those wild and inhuman moors who would regard the greatness of his daydreams his engaged honour his chivalrous feelings nothing could save him from that suspicion and being what he is you understand me mrs travers but you know him much better than i do it would morally kill him  heavens whispered mrs travers this has never occurred to me those words seemed to lose themselves in the folds of the scarf without reaching dalcacer who continued in his gentle tone  however as it is he will be safe enough whatever happens he will have your testimony to clear him  mrs travers stood up suddenly but still careful to keep her face covered she threw the end of the scarf over her shoulder  i fear that jorgenson she cried with suppressed passion one cant understand what that man means to do i think him so dangerous that if i were for instance entrusted with a message bearing on the situation i would    suppress it  dalcacer was looking up from the seat full of wonder mrs travers appealed to him in a calm voice through the folds of the scarf  tell me mr dalcacer you who can look on it calmly wouldnt i be right  why has jorgenson told you anything  directlynothing except a phrase or two which really i could not understand they seemed to have a hidden sense and he appeared to attach some mysterious importance to them that he dared not explain to me  that was a risk on his part exclaimed dalcacer and he trusted you why you i wonder  who can tell what notions he has in his head mr dalcacer i believe his only object is to call captain lingard away from us i understood it only a few minutes ago it has dawned upon me all he wants is to call him off  call him off repeated dalcacer a little bewildered by the aroused fire of her conviction i am sure i dont want him called off any more than you do and frankly i dont believe jorgenson has any such power but upon the whole and if you feel that jorgenson has the power i wouldyes if i were in your place i think i would suppress anything i could not understand  mrs travers listened to the very end her eyesthey appeared incredibly sombre to dalcacerseemed to watch the fall of every deliberate word and after he had ceased they remained still for an appreciable time then she turned away with a gesture that seemed to say so be it  dalcacer raised his voice suddenly after her stay dont forget that not only your husbands but my head too is being played at that game my judgment is not     she stopped for a moment and freed her lips in the profound stillness of the courtyard her clear voice made the shadows at the nearest fires stir a little with low murmurs of surprise  oh yes i remember whose heads i have to save she cried but in all the world who is there to save that man from himself    v  dalcacer sat down on the bench again i wonder what she knows he thought and i wonder what i have done he wondered also how far he had been sincere and how far affected by a very natural aversion from being murdered obscurely by ferocious moors with all the circumstances of barbarity it was a very naked death to come upon one suddenly it was robbed of all helpful illusions such as the free will of a suicide the heroism of a warrior or the exaltation of a martyr hadnt i better make some sort of fight of it he debated with himself he saw himself rushing at the naked spears without any enthusiasm or wouldnt it be better to go forth to meet his doom somewhere outside the stockade on that horrible beach with calm dignity pah i shall be probably speared through the back in the beastliest possible fashion he thought with an inward shudder it was certainly not a shudder of fear for mr dalcacer attached no high value to life it was a shudder of disgust because mr dalcacer was a civilized man and though he had no illusions about civilization he could not but admit the superiority of its methods it offered to one a certain refinement of form a comeliness of proceedings and definite safeguards against deadly surprises how idle all this is he thought finally his next thought was that women were very resourceful it was true he went on meditating with unwonted cynicism that strictly speaking they had only one resource but generally it servedit served  he was surprised by his supremely shameless bitterness at this juncture it was so uncalled for this situation was too complicated to be entrusted to a cynical or shameless hope there was nothing to trust to at this moment of his meditation he became aware of lingards approach he raised his head eagerly dalcacer was not indifferent to his fate and even to mr travers fate he would fain learn    but one look at lingards face was enough its no use asking him anything he said to himself for he cares for nothing just now  lingard sat down heavily on the other end of the bench and dalcacer looking at his profile confessed to himself that this was the most masculinely goodlooking face he had ever seen in his life it was an expressive face too but its present expression was also beyond dalcacers past experience at the same time its quietness set up a barrier against common curiosities and even common fears no it was no use asking him anything yet something should be said to break the spell to call down again this man to the earth but it was lingard who spoke first where has mrs travers gone  she has gone    where naturally she would be anxious to go first of all since she has managed to come to us answered dalcacer wording his answer with the utmost regard for the delicacy of the situation  the stillness of lingard seemed to have grown even more impressive he spoke again  i wonder what those two can have to say to each other  he might have been asking that of the whole darkened part of the globe but it was dalcacer who answered in his courteous tones  would it surprise you very much captain lingard if i were to tell you that those two people are quite fit to understand each other thoroughly yes it surprises you well i assure you that seven thousand miles from here nobody would wonder  i think i understand said lingard but dont you know the man is lightheaded a man like that is as good as mad  yes he had been slightly delirious since seven oclock said dalcacer but believe me captain lingard he continued earnestly and obeying a perfectly disinterested impulse that even in his delirium he is far more understandable to her and better able to understand her than    anybody within a hundred miles from here  ah said lingard without any emotion so you dont wonder you dont see any reason for wonder  no for dont you see i do know  what do you know  men and women captain lingard which you     i dont know any woman  you have spoken the strictest truth there said dalcacer and for the first time lingard turned his head slowly and looked at his neighbour on the bench  do you think she is as good as mad too asked lingard in a startled voice  dalcacer let escape a low exclamation no certainly he did not think so it was an original notion to suppose that lunatics had a sort of common logic which made them understandable to each other dalcacer tried to make his voice as gentle as possible while he pursued no captain lingard i believe the woman of whom we speak is and will always remain in the fullest possession of herself  lingard leaning back clasped his hands round his knees he seemed not to be listening and dalcacer pulling a cigarette case out of his pocket looked for a long time at the three cigarettes it contained it was the last of the provision he had on him when captured dalcacer had put himself on the strictest allowance a cigarette was only to be lighted on special occasions and now there were only three left and they had to be made to last till the end of life they calmed they soothed they gave an attitude and only three left one had to be kept for the morning to be lighted before going through the gate of doomthe gate of belarabs stockade a cigarette soothed it gave an attitude was this the fitting occasion for one of the remaining two dalcacer a true latin was not afraid of a little introspection in the pause he descended into the innermost depths of his being then glanced up at the night sky sportsman traveller he had often looked up at the stars before to see how time went it was going very slowly he took out a cigarette snappedto the case bent down to the embers then he sat up and blew out a thin cloud of smoke the man by his side looked with his bowed head and clasped knee like a masculine rendering of mournful meditation such attitudes are met with sometimes on the sculptures of ancient tombs dalcacer began to speak  she is a representative woman and yet one of those of whom there are but very few at any time in the world not that they are very rare but that there is but little room on top they are the iridescent gleams on a hard and dark surface for the world is hard captain lingard it is hard both in what it will remember and in what it will forget it is for such women that people toil on the ground and underground and artists of all sorts invoke their inspiration  lingard seemed not to have heard a word his chin rested on his breast dalcacer appraised the remaining length of his cigarette and went on in an equable tone through which pierced a certain sadness  no there are not many of them and yet they are all they decorate our life for us they are the gracious figures on the drab wall which lies on this side of our common grave they lead a sort of ritual dance that most of us have agreed to take seriously it is a very binding agreement with which sincerity and good faith and honour have nothing to do very binding woe to him or her who breaks it directly they leave the pageant they get lost  lingard turned his head sharply and discovered dalcacer looking at him with profound attention  they get lost in a maze continued dalcacer quietly they wander in it lamenting over themselves i would shudder at that fate for anything i loved do you know captain lingard how people lost in a maze end he went on holding lingard by a steadfast stare no    i will tell you then they end by hating their very selves and they die in disillusion and despair  as if afraid of the force of his words dalcacer laid a soothing hand lightly on lingards shoulder but lingard continued to look into the embers at his feet and remained insensible to the friendly touch yet dalcacer could not imagine that he had not been heard he folded his arms on his breast  i dont know why i have been telling you all this he said apologetically i hope i have not been intruding on your thoughts  i can think of nothing lingard declared unexpectedly i only know that your voice was friendly and for the rest  one must get through a night like this somehow said dalcacer the very stars seem to lag on their way its a common belief that a drowning man is irresistibly compelled to review his past experience just now i feel quite out of my depth and whatever i have said has come from my experience i am sure you will forgive me all that it amounts to is this that it is natural for us to cry for the moon but it would be very fatal to have our cries heard for what could any one of us do with the moon if it were given to him i am speaking now of uscommon mortals  it was not immediately after dalcacer had ceased speaking but only after a moment that lingard unclasped his fingers got up and walked away dalcacer followed with a glance of quiet interest the big shadowy form till it vanished in the direction of an enormous forest tree left in the middle of the stockade the deepest shade of the night was spread over the ground of belarabs fortified courtyard the very embers of the fires had turned black showing only here and there a mere spark and the forms of the prone sleepers could hardly be distinguished from the hard ground on which they rested with their arms lying beside them on the mats presently mrs travers appeared quite close to dalcacer who rose instantly  martin is asleep said mrs travers in a tone that seemed to have borrowed something of the mystery and quietness of the night  all the worlds asleep observed dalcacer so low that mrs travers barely caught the words except you and me and one other who has left me to wander about in the night  was he with you where has he gone  where its darkest i should think answered dalcacer secretly its no use going to look for him but if you keep perfectly still and hold your breath you may presently hear his footsteps  what did he tell you breathed out mrs travers  i didnt ask him anything i only know that something has happened which has robbed him of his power of thinking    hadnt i better go to the hut don martin ought to have someone with him when he wakes up mrs travers remained perfectly still and even now and then held her breath with a vague fear of hearing those footsteps wandering in the dark dalcacer had disappeared again mrs travers held her breath no nothing not a sound only the night to her eyes seemed to have grown darker was that a footstep where could i hide myself she thought but she didnt move  after leaving dalcacer lingard threading his way between the fires found himself under the big tree the same tree against which daman had been leaning on the day of the great talk when the white prisoners had been surrendered to lingards keeping on definite conditions lingard passed through the deep obscurity made by the outspread boughs of the only witness left there of a past that for endless ages had seen no mankind on this shore defended by the shallows around this lagoon overshadowed by the jungle in the calm night the old giant without shudders or murmurs in its enormous limbs saw the restless man drift through the black shade into the starlight  in that distant part of the courtyard there were only a few sentries who themselves invisible saw lingards white figure pace to and fro endlessly they knew well who that was it was the great white man a very great man a very rich man a possessor of firearms who could dispense valuable gifts and deal deadly blows the friend of their ruler the enemy of his enemies known to them for years and always mysterious at their posts flattened against the stakes near convenient loopholes they cast backward glances and exchanged faint whispers from time to time  lingard might have thought himself alone he had lost touch with the world what he had said to dalcacer was perfectly true he had no thought he was in the state of a man who having cast his eyes through the open gates of paradise is rendered insensible by that moments vision to all the forms and matters of the earth and in the extremity of his emotion ceases even to look upon himself but as the subject of a sublime experience which exalts or unfits sanctifies or damnshe didnt know which every shadowy thought every passing sensation was like a base intrusion on that supreme memory he couldnt bear it  when he had tried to resume his conversation with belarab after mrs travers arrival he had discovered himself unable to go on he had just enough selfcontrol to break off the interview in measured terms he pointed out the lateness of the hour a most astonishing excuse to people to whom time is nothing and whose life and activities are not ruled by the clock indeed lingard hardly knew what he was saying or doing when he went out again leaving everybody dumb with astonishment at the change in his aspect and in his behaviour a suspicious silence reigned for a long time in belarabs great audience room till the chief dismissed everybody by two quiet words and a slight gesture  with her chin in her hand in the pose of a sybil trying to read the future in the glow of dying embers mrs travers without holding her breath heard quite close to her the footsteps which she had been listening for with mingled alarm remorse and hope  she didnt change her attitude the deep red glow lighted her up dimly her face the white hand hanging by her side her feet in their sandals the disturbing footsteps stopped close to her  where have you been all this time she asked without looking round  i dont know answered lingard he was speaking the exact truth he didnt know ever since he had released that woman from his arms everything but the vaguest notions had departed from him events necessities thingshe had lost his grip on them all and he didnt care they were futile and impotent he had no patience with them the offended and astonished belarab dalcacer with his kindly touch and friendly voice the sleeping men the men awake the settlement full of unrestful life and the restless shallows of the coast were removed from him into an immensity of pitying contempt perhaps they existed perhaps all this waited for him well let all this wait let everything wait till tomorrow or to the end of time which could now come at any moment for all he caredbut certainly till tomorrow  i only know he went on with an emphasis that made mrs travers raise her head that wherever i go i shall carry you with meagainst my breast  mrs travers fine ear caught the mingled tones of suppressed exultation and dawning fear the ardour and the faltering of those words she was feeling still the physical truth at the root of them so strongly that she couldnt help saying in a dreamy whisper  did you mean to crush the life out of me  he answered in the same tone  i could not have done it you are too strong was i rough i didnt mean to be i have been often told i didnt know my own strength you did not seem able to get through that opening and so i caught hold of you you came away in my hands quite easily suddenly i thought to myself now i will make sure  he paused as if his breath had failed him mrs travers dared not make the slightest movement still in the pose of one in quest of hidden truth she murmured make sure  yes and now i am sure you are herehere before i couldnt tell  oh you couldnt tell before she said  no  so it was reality that you were seeking  he repeated as if speaking to himself and now i am sure  her sandalled foot all rosy in the glow felt the warmth of the embers the tepid night had enveloped her body and still under the impression of his strength she gave herself up to a momentary feeling of quietude that came about her heart as soft as the night air penetrated by the feeble clearness of the stars this is a limpid soul she thought  you know i always believed in you he began again you know i did well i never believed in you so much as i do now as you sit there just as you are and with hardly enough light to make you out by  it occurred to her that she had never heard a voice she liked so wellexcept one but that had been a great actors voice whereas this man was nothing in the world but his very own self he persuaded he moved he disturbed he soothed by his inherent truth he had wanted to make sure and he had made sure apparently and too weary to resist the waywardness of her thoughts mrs travers reflected with a sort of amusement that apparently he had not been disappointed she thought he believes in me what amazing words of all the people that might have believed in me i had to find this one here he believes in me more than in himself a gust of sudden remorse tore her out from her quietness made her cry out to him  captain lingard we forget how we have met we forget what is going on we mustnt i wont say that you placed your belief wrongly but i have to confess something to you i must tell you how i came here tonight jorgenson     he interrupted her forcibly but without raising his voice  jorgenson whos jorgenson you came to me because you couldnt help yourself  this took her breath away but i must tell you there is something in my coming which is not clear to me  you can tell me nothing that i dont know already he said in a pleading tone say nothing sit still time enough tomorrow tomorrow the night is drawing to an end and i care for nothing in the world but you let me be give me the rest that is in you  she had never heard such accents on his lips and she felt for him a great and tender pity why not humour this mood in which he wanted to preserve the moments that would never come to him again on this earth she hesitated in silence she saw him stir in the darkness as if he could not make up his mind to sit down on the bench but suddenly he scattered the embers with his foot and sank on the ground against her feet and she was not startled in the least to feel the weight of his head on her knee mrs travers was not startled but she felt profoundly moved why should she torment him with all those questions of freedom and captivity of violence and intrigue of life and death he was not in a state to be told anything and it seemed to her that she did not want to speak that in the greatness of her compassion she simply could not speak all she could do for him was to rest her hand lightly on his head and respond silently to the slight movement she felt sigh or sob but a movement which suddenly immobilized her in an anxious emotion  about the same time on the other side of the lagoon jorgenson raising his eyes noted the stars and said to himself that the night would not last long now he wished for daylight he hoped that lingard had already done something the blaze in tenggas compound had been relighted toms power was unbounded practically unbounded and he was invulnerable  jorgenson let his old eyes wander amongst the gleams and shadows of the great sheet of water between him and that hostile shore and fancied he could detect a floating shadow having the characteristic shape of a man in a small canoe  o ya man he hailed what do you want other eyes too had detected that shadow low murmurs arose on the deck of the emma if you dont speak at once i shall fire shouted jorgenson fiercely  no white man returned the floating shape in a solemn drawl i am the bearer of friendly words a chiefs words i come from tengga  there was a bullet that came on board not a long time agoalso from tengga said jorgenson  that was an accident protested the voice from the lagoon what else could it be is there war between you and tengga no no o white man all tengga desires is a long talk he has sent me to ask you to come ashore  at these words jorgensons heart sank a little this invitation meant that lingard had made no move was tom asleep or altogether mad  the talk would be of peace declared impressively the shadow which had drifted much closer to the hulk now  it isnt for me to talk with great chiefs jorgenson returned cautiously  but tengga is a friend argued the nocturnal messenger and by that fire there are other friendsyour friends the rajah hassim and the lady immada who send you their greetings and who expect their eyes to rest on you before sunrise  thats a lie remarked jorgenson perfunctorily and fell into thought while the shadowy bearer of words preserved a scandalized silence though of course he had not expected to be believed for a moment but one could never tell what a white man would believe he had wanted to produce the impression that hassim and immada were the honoured guests of tengga it occurred to him suddenly that perhaps jorgenson didnt know anything of the capture and he persisted  my words are all true tuan the rajah of wajo and his sister are with my master i left them sitting by the fire on tenggas right hand will you come ashore to be welcomed amongst friends  jorgenson had been reflecting profoundly his object was to gain as much time as possible for lingards interference which indeed could not fail to be effective but he had not the slightest wish to entrust himself to tenggas friendliness not that he minded the risk but he did not see the use of taking it  no he said i cant go ashore we white men have ways of our own and i am chief of this hulk and my chief is the rajah laut a white man like myself all the words that matter are in him and if tengga is such a great chief let him ask the rajah laut for a talk yes thats the proper thing for tengga to do if he is such a great chief as he says  the rajah laut has made his choice he dwells with belarab and with the white people who are huddled together like trapped deer in belarabs stockade why shouldnt you meantime go over where everything is lighted up and open and talk in friendship with tenggas friends whose hearts have been made sick by many doubts rajah hassim and the lady immada and daman the chief of the men of the sea who do not know now whom they can trust unless it be you tuan the keeper of much wealth  the diplomatist in the small dugout paused for a moment to give special weight to the final argument  which you have no means to defend we know how many armed men there are with you  they are great fighters jorgenson observed unconcernedly spreading his elbows on the rail and looking over at the floating black patch of characteristic shape whence proceeded the voice of the wily envoy of tengga each man of them is worth ten of such as you can find in the settlement  yes by allah even worth twenty of these common people indeed you have enough with you to make a great fight but not enough for victory  god alone gives victory said suddenly the voice of jaffir who very still at jorgensons elbow had been listening to the conversation  very true was the answer in an extremely conventional tone will you come ashore o white man and be the leader of chiefs  i have been that before said jorgenson with great dignity and now all i want is peace but i wont come ashore amongst people whose minds are so much troubled till rajah hassim and his sister return on board this ship and tell me the tale of their new friendship with tengga  his heart was sinking with every minute the very air was growing heavier with the sense of oncoming disaster on that night that was neither war nor peace and whose only voice was the voice of tenggas envoy insinuating in tone though menacing in words  no that cannot be said that voice but tuan verily tengga himself is ready to come on board here to talk with you he is very ready to come and indeed tuan he means to come on board here before very long  yes with fifty warcanoes filled with the ferocious rabble of the shore of refuge jaffir was heard commenting sarcastically over the rail and a sinister muttered it may be so ascended alongside from the black water  jorgenson kept silent as if waiting for a supreme inspiration and suddenly he spoke in his otherworld voice tell tengga from me that as long as he brings with him rajah hassim and the rajahs sister he and his chief men will be welcome on deck here no matter how many boats come along with them for that i do not care you may go now  a profound silence succeeded it was clear that the envoy was gone keeping in the shadow of the shore jorgenson turned to jaffir  death amongst friends is but a festival he quoted mumbling in his moustache  it is by allah assented jaffir with sombre fervour    vi  thirtysix hours later carter alone with lingard in the cabin of the brig could almost feel during a pause in his talk the oppressive the breathless peace of the shallows awaiting another sunset  i never expected to see any of you alive carter began in his easy tone but with much less carelessness in his bearing as though his days of responsibility amongst the shoals of the shore of refuge had matured his view of the external world and of his own place therein  of course not muttered lingard  the listlessness of that man whom he had always seen acting under the stress of a secret passion seemed perfectly appalling to carters youthful and deliberate energy ever since he had found himself again face to face with lingard he had tried to conceal the shocking impression with a delicacy which owed nothing to training but was as intuitive as a childs  while justifying to lingard his manner of dealing with the situation on the shore of refuge he could not for the life of him help asking himself what was this new mystery he was also young enough to long for a word of commendation  come captain he argued how would you have liked to come out and find nothing but two halfburnt wrecks stuck on the sandsperhaps  he waited for a moment then in sheer compassion turned away his eyes from that fixed gaze from that harassed face with sunk cheeks from that figure of indomitable strength robbed of its fire he said to himself he doesnt hear me and raised his voice without altering its selfcontained tone  i was below yesterday morning when we felt the shock but the noise came to us only as a deep rumble i made one jump for the companion but that precious shaw was before me yelling earthquake earthquake and i am hanged if he didnt miss his footing and land down on his head at the bottom of the stairs i had to stop to pick him up but i got on deck in time to see a mighty black cloud that seemed almost solid pop up from behind the forest like a balloon it stayed there for quite a long time some of our calashes on deck swore to me that they had seen a red flash above the treetops but thats hard to believe i guessed at once that something had blown up on shore my first thought was that i would never see you any more and i made up my mind at once to find out all the truth you have been keeping away from me no sir dont you make a mistake i wasnt going to give you up dead or alive  he looked hard at lingard while saying these words and saw the first sign of animation pass over that ravaged face he saw even its lips move slightly but there was no sound and carter looked away again  perhaps you would have done better by telling me everything but you left me behind on my own to be your man here i put my hand to the work i could see before me i am a sailor there were two ships to look after and here they are both for you fit to go or to stay to fight or to run as you choose he watched with bated breath the effort lingard had to make to utter the two words of the desired commendation  well done  and i am your man still carter added impulsively and hastened to look away from lingard who had tried to smile at him and had failed carter didnt know what to do next remain in the cabin or leave that unsupported strong man to himself with a shyness completely foreign to his character and which he could not understand himself he suggested in an engaging murmur and with an embarrassed assumption of his right to give advice  why not lie down for a bit sir i can attend to anything that may turn up you seem done up sir  he was facing lingard who stood on the other side of the table in a leaning forward attitude propped up on rigid arms and stared fixedly at himperhaps carter felt on the verge of despair this couldnt last he was relieved to see lingard shake his head slightly  no mr carter i think i will go on deck said the captain of the famous brig lightning while his eyes roamed all over the cabin carter stood aside at once but it was some little time before lingard made a move  the sun had sunk already leaving that evening no trace of its glory on a sky clear as crystal and on the waters without a ripple all colour seemed to have gone out of the world the oncoming shadow rose as subtle as a perfume from the black coast lying athwart the eastern semicircle and such was the silence within the horizon that one might have fancied oneself come to the end of time black and toylike in the clear depths and the final stillness of the evening the brig and the schooner lay anchored in the middle of the main channel with their heads swung the same way lingard with his chin on his breast and his arms folded moved slowly here and there about the poop close and mute like his shadow carter at his elbow followed his movements he felt an anxious solicitude     it was a sentiment perfectly new to him he had never before felt this sort of solicitude about himself or any other man his personality was being developed by new experience and as he was very simple he received the initiation with shyness and selfmistrust he had noticed with innocent alarm that lingard had not looked either at the sky or over the sea neither at his own ship nor the schooner astern not along the decks not aloft not anywhere he had looked at nothing and somehow carter felt himself more lonely and without support than when he had been left alone by that man in charge of two ships entangled amongst the shallows and environed by some sinister mystery since that man had come back instead of welcome relief carter felt his responsibility rest on his young shoulders with tenfold weight his profound conviction was that lingard should be roused  captain lingard he burst out in desperation you cant say i have worried you very much since this morning when i received you at the side but i must be told something what is it going to be with us fight or run  lingard stopped short and now there was no doubt in carters mind that the captain was looking at him there was no room for any doubt before that stern and enquiring gaze aha thought carter this has startled him and feeling that his shyness had departed he pursued his advantage for the fact of the matter is sir that whatever happens unless i am to be your man you will have no officer i had better tell you at once that i have bundled that respectable crazy fat shaw out of the ship he was upsetting all hands yesterday i told him to go and get his dunnage together because i was going to send him aboard the yacht he couldnt have made more uproar about it if i had proposed to chuck him overboard i warned him that if he didnt go quietly i would have him tied up like a sheep ready for slaughter however he went down the ladder on his own feet shaking his fist at me and promising to have me hanged for a pirate some day he can do no harm on board the yacht and now sir its for you to give orders and not for methank god  lingard turned away abruptly carter didnt budge after a moment he heard himself called from the other side of the deck and obeyed with alacrity  whats that story of a man you picked up on the coast last evening asked lingard in his gentlest tone didnt you tell me something about it when i came on board  i tried to said carter frankly but i soon gave it up you didnt seem to pay any attention to what i was saying i thought you wanted to be left alone for a bit what can i know of your ways yet sir are you aware captain lingard that since this morning i have been down five times at the cabin door to look at you there you sat     he paused and lingard said you have been five times down in the cabin  yes and the sixth time i made up my mind to make you take some notice of me i cant be left without orders there are two ships to look after a lot of things to be done     there is nothing to be done lingard interrupted with a mere murmur but in a tone which made carter keep silent for a while  even to know that much would have been something to go by he ventured at last i couldnt let you sit there with the sun getting pretty low and a long night before us  i feel stunned yet said lingard looking carter straight in the face as if to watch the effect of that confession  were you very near that explosion asked the young man with sympathetic curiosity and seeking for some sign on lingards person but there was nothing not a single hair of the captains head seemed to have been singed  near muttered lingard it might have been my head he pressed it with both hands then let them fall what about that man he asked brusquely where did he come from    i suppose he is dead now he added in an envious tone  no sir he must have as many lives as a cat answered carter i will tell you how it was as i said before i wasnt going to give you up dead or alive so yesterday when the sun went down a little in the afternoon i had two of our boats manned and pulled in shore taking soundings to find a passage if there was one i meant to go back and look for you with the brig or without the brigbut that doesnt matter now there were three or four floating logs in sight one of the calashes in my boat made out something red on one of them i thought it was worth while to go and see what it was it was that mans sarong it had got entangled among the branches and prevented him rolling off into the water i was never so glad i assure you as when we found out that he was still breathing if we could only nurse him back to life i thought he could perhaps tell me a lot of things the log on which he hung had come out of the mouth of the creek and he couldnt have been more than half a day on it by my calculation i had him taken down the main hatchway and put into a hammock in the tweendecks he only just breathed then but some time during the night he came to himself and got out of the hammock to lie down on a mat i suppose he was more comfortable that way he recovered his speech only this morning and i went down at once and told you of it but you took no notice i told you also who he was but i dont know whether you heard me or not  i dont remember said lingard under his breath  they are wonderful those malays this morning he was only half alive if that much and now i understand he has been talking to wasub for an hour will you go down to see him sir or shall i send a couple of men to carry him on deck  lingard looked bewildered for a moment  who on earth is he he asked  why its that fellow whom you sent out that night i met you to catch our first gig what do they call him jaffir i think hasnt he been with you ashore sir didnt he find you with the letter i gave him for you a most determined looking chap i knew him again the moment we got him off the log  lingard seized hold of the royal backstay within reach of his hand jaffir jaffir faithful above all others the messenger of supreme moments the reckless and devoted servant lingard felt a crushing sense of despair no i cant face this he whispered to himself looking at the coast black as ink now before his eyes in the worlds shadow that was slowly encompassing the grey clearness of the shallow waters send wasub to me i am going down into the cabin  he crossed over to the companion then checking himself suddenly was there a boat from the yacht during the day he asked as if struck by a sudden thoughtno sir answered carter we had no communication with the yacht todaysend wasub to me repeated lingard in a stern voice as he went down the stairs  the old serang coming in noiselessly saw his captain as he had seen him many times before sitting under the gilt thunderbolts apparently as strong in his body in his wealth and in his knowledge of secret words that have a power over men and elements as ever the old malay squatted down within a couple of feet from lingard leaned his back against the satinwood panel of the bulkhead then raising his old eyes with a watchful and benevolent expression to the white mans face clasped his hands between his knees  wasub you have learned now everything is there no one left alive but jaffir are they all dead  may you live answered wasub and lingard whispered an appalled all dead to which wasub nodded slightly twice his cracked voice had a lamenting intonation it is all true it is all true you are left alone tuan you are left alone  it was their destiny said lingard at last with forced calmness but has jaffir told you of the manner of this calamity how is it that he alone came out alive from it to be found by you  he was told by his lord to depart and he obeyed began wasub fixing his eyes on the deck and speaking just loud enough to be heard by lingard who bending forward in his seat shrank inwardly from every word and yet would not have missed a single one of them for anything  for the catastrophe had fallen on his head like a bolt from the blue in the early morning hours of the day before at the first break of dawn he had been sent for to resume his talk with belarab he had felt suddenly mrs travers remove her hand from his head her voice speaking intimately into his ear get up there are some people coming had recalled him to himself he had got up from the ground the light was dim the air full of mist and it was only gradually that he began to make out forms above his head and about his feet trees houses men sleeping on the ground he didnt recognize them it was but a cruel change of dream who could tell what was real in this world he looked about him dazedly he was still drunk with the deep draught of oblivion he had conquered for himself yesbut it was she who had let him snatch the cup he looked down at the woman on the bench she moved not she had remained like that still for hours giving him a waking dream of rest without end in an infinity of happiness without sound and movement without thought without joy but with an infinite ease of content like a worldembracing reverie breathing the air of sadness and scented with love for hours she had not moved  you are the most generous of women he said he bent over her her eyes were wide open her lips felt cold it did not shock him after he stood up he remained near her heat is a consuming thing but she with her cold lips seemed to him indestructibleand perhaps immortal  again he stooped but this time it was only to kiss the fringe of her head scarf then he turned away to meet the three men who coming round the corner of the hut containing the prisoners were approaching him with measured steps they desired his presence in the council room belarab was awake  they also expressed their satisfaction at finding the white man awake because belarab wanted to impart to him information of the greatest importance it seemed to lingard that he had been awake ever since he could remember it was as to being alive that he felt not so sure he had no doubt of his existence but was this lifethis profound indifference this strange contempt for what his eyes could see this distaste for words this unbelief in the importance of things and men he tried to regain possession of himself his old self which had things to do words to speak as well as to hear but it was too difficult he was seduced away by the tense feeling of existence far superior to the mere consciousness of life and which in its immensity of contradictions delight dread exultation and despair could not be faced and yet was not to be evaded there was no peace in it but who wanted peace surrender was better the dreadful ease of slack limbs in the sweep of an enormous tide and in a divine emptiness of mind if this was existence then he knew that he existed and he knew that the woman existed too in the sweep of the tide without speech without movement without heat indestructibleand perhaps immortal    vii  with the sublime indifference of a man who has had a glimpse through the open doors of paradise and is no longer careful of mere life lingard had followed belarabs anxious messengers the stockade was waking up in a subdued resonance of voices men were getting up from the ground fires were being rekindled draped figures flitted in the mist amongst the buildings and through the mat wall of a bamboo house lingard heard the feeble wailing of a child a day of mere life was beginning but in the chiefs great council room several wax candles and a couple of cheap european lamps kept the dawn at bay while the morning mist which could not be kept out made a faint reddish halo round every flame  belarab was not only awake but he even looked like a man who had not slept for a long time the creator of the shore of refuge the weary ruler of the settlement with his scorn of the unrest and folly of men was angry with his white friend who was always bringing his desires and his troubles to his very door belarab did not want any one to die but neither did he want any one in particular to live what he was concerned about was to preserve the mystery and the power of his melancholy hesitations these delicate things were menaced by lingards brusque movements by that passionate white man who believed in more than one god and always seemed to doubt the power of destiny belarab was profoundly annoyed he was also genuinely concerned for he liked lingard he liked him not only for his strength which protected his clearminded scepticism from those dangers that beset all rulers but he liked him also for himself that man of infinite hesitations born from a sort of mystic contempt for allahs creation yet believed absolutely both in lingards power and in his boldness absolutely and yet in the marvellous consistency of his temperament now that the moment had come he dreaded to put both power and fortitude to the test  lingard could not know that some little time before the first break of dawn one of belarabs spies in the settlement had found his way inside the stockade at a spot remote from the lagoon and that a very few moments after lingard had left the chief in consequence of jorgensons rockets belarab was listening to an amazing tale of hassim and immadas capture and of tenggas determination very much strengthened by that fact to obtain possession of the emma either by force or by negotiation or by some crafty subterfuge in which the rajah and his sister could be made to play their part in his mistrust of the universe which seemed almost to extend to the will of god himself belarab was very much alarmed for the material power of damans piratical crowd was at tenggas command and who could tell whether this wajo rajah would remain loyal in the circumstances it was also very characteristic of him whom the original settlers of the shore of refuge called the father of safety that he did not say anything of this to lingard for he was afraid of rousing lingards fierce energy which would even carry away himself and all his people and put the peace of so many years to the sudden hazard of a battle  therefore belarab set himself to persuade lingard on general considerations to deliver the white men who really belonged to daman to that supreme chief of the illanuns and by this simple proceeding detach him completely from tengga why should he belarab go to war against half the settlement on their account it was not necessary it was not reasonable it would be even in a manner a sin to begin a strife in a community of true believers whereas with an offer like that in his hand he could send an embassy to tengga who would see there at once the downfall of his purposes and the end of his hopes at once that moment    afterward the question of a ransom could be arranged with daman in which he belarab would mediate in the fullness of his recovered power without a rival and in the sincerity of his heart and then if need be he could put forth all his power against the chief of the seavagabonds who would as a matter of fact be negotiating under the shadow of the sword  belarab talked lowvoiced and dignified with now and then a subtle intonation a persuasive inflexion or a halfmelancholy smile in the course of the argument what encouraged him most was the changed aspect of his white friend the fierce power of his personality seemed to have turned into a dream lingard listened growing gradually inscrutable in his continued silence but remaining gentle in a sort of rapt patience as if lapped in the wings of the angel of peace himself emboldened by that transformation belarabs counsellors seated on the mats murmured loudly their assent to the views of the chief through the thickening white mist of tropical lands the light of the tropical day filtered into the hall one of the wise men got up from the floor and with prudent fingers began extinguishing the waxlights one by one he hesitated to touch the lamps the flames of which looked yellow and cold a puff of the morning breeze entered the great room faint and chill lingard facing belarab in a wooden armchair with slack limbs and in the divine emptiness of a mind enchanted by a glimpse of paradise shuddered profoundly  a strong voice shouted in the doorway without any ceremony and with a sort of jeering accent  tenggas boats are out in the mist  lingard half rose from his seat belarab himself could not repress a start lingards attitude was a listening one but after a moment of hesitation he ran out of the hall the inside of the stockade was beginning to buzz like a disturbed hive  outside belarabs house lingard slowed his pace the mist still hung a great sustained murmur pervaded it and the blurred forms of men were all moving outward from the centre toward the palisades somewhere amongst the buildings a gong clanged dalcacers raised voice was heard  what is happening  lingard was passing then close to the prisoners house there was a group of armed men below the verandah and above their heads he saw mrs travers by the side of dalcacer the fire by which lingard had spent the night was extinguished its embers scattered and the bench itself lay overturned mrs travers must have run up on the verandah at the first alarm she and dalcacer up there seemed to dominate the tumult which was now subsiding lingard noticed the scarf across mrs travers face dalcacer was bareheaded he shouted again  whats the matter  i am going to see shouted lingard back  he resisted the impulse to join those two dominate the tumult let it roll away from under his feetthe mere life of men vain like a dream and interfering with the tremendous sense of his own existence he resisted it he could hardly have told why even the sense of selfpreservation had abandoned him there was a throng of people pressing close about him yet careful not to get in his way surprise concern doubt were depicted on all those faces but there were some who observed that the great white man making his way to the lagoon side of the stockade wore a fixed smile he asked at large  can one see any distance over the water  one of belarabs headmen who was nearest to him answered  the mist has thickened if you see anything tuan it will be but a shadow of things  the four sides of the stockade had been manned by that time lingard ascending the banquette looked out and saw the lagoon shrouded in white without as much as a shadow on it and so still that not even the sound of water lapping the shore reached his ears he found himself in profound accord with this blind and soundless peace  has anything at all been seen he asked incredulously  four men were produced at once who had seen a dark mass of boats moving in the light of the dawn others were sent for he hardly listened to them his thought escaped him and he stood motionless looking out into the unstirring mist pervaded by the perfect silence presently belarab joined him escorted by three grave swarthy men himself darkfaced stroking his short grey beard with impenetrable composure he said to lingard your white man doesnt fight to which lingard answered there is nothing to fight against what your people have seen belarab were indeed but shadows on the water belarab murmured you ought to have allowed me to make friends with daman last night  a faint uneasiness was stealing into lingards breast  a moment later dalcacer came up inconspicuously watched over by two men with lances and to his anxious inquiry lingard said i dont think there is anything going on listen how still everything is the only way of bringing the matter to a test would be to persuade belarab to let his men march out and make an attack on tenggas stronghold this moment then we would learn something but i couldnt persuade belarab to march out into this fog indeed an expedition like this might end badly i myself dont believe that all tenggas people are on the lagoon    where is mrs travers  the question made dalcacer start by its abruptness which revealed the womans possession of that mans mind she is with don martin who is better but feels very weak if we are to be given up he will have to be carried out to his fate i can depict to myself the scene don martin carried shoulder high surrounded by those barbarians with spears and mrs travers with myself walking on each side of the stretcher mrs travers has declared to me her intention to go out with us  oh she has declared her intention murmured lingard absentmindedly  dalcacer felt himself completely abandoned by that man and within two paces of him he noticed the group of belarab and his three swarthy attendants in their white robes preserving an air of serene detachment for the first time since the stranding on the coast dalcacers heart sank within him but perhaps he went on this moor may not in the end insist on giving us up to a cruel death captain lingard  he wanted to give you up in the middle of the night a few hours ago said lingard without even looking at dalcacer who raised his hands a little and let them fall lingard sat down on the breech of a heavy piece mounted on a naval carriage so as to command the lagoon he folded his arms on his breast dalcacer asked gently  we have been reprieved then  no said lingard its i who was reprieved  a long silence followed along the whole line of the manned stockade the whisperings had ceased the vibrations of the gong had died out too only the watchers perched in the highest boughs of the big tree made a slight rustle amongst the leaves  what are you thinking of captain lingard dalcacer asked in a low voice lingard did not change his position  i am trying to keep it off he said in the same tone  what trying to keep thought off  yes  is this the time for such experiments asked dalcacer  why not its my reprieve dont grudge it to me mr dalcacer  upon my word i dont but isnt it dangerous  you will have to take your chance  dalcacer had a moment of internal struggle he asked himself whether he should tell lingard that mrs travers had come to the stockade with some sort of message from jorgenson he had it on the tip of his tongue to advise lingard to go and see mrs travers and ask her point blank whether she had anything to tell him but before he could make up his mind the voices of invisible men high up in the tree were heard reporting the thinning of the fog this caused a stir to run along the four sides of the stockade  lingard felt the draught of air in his face the motionless mist began to drive over the palisades and suddenly the lagoon came into view with a great blinding glitter of its wrinkled surface and the faint sound of its wash rising all along the shore a multitude of hands went up to shade the eager eyes and exclamations of wonder burst out from many men at the sight of a crowd of canoes of various sizes and kinds lying close together with the effect as of an enormous raft a little way off the side of the emma the excited voices rose higher and higher there was no doubt about tenggas being on the lagoon but what was jorgenson about the emma lay as if abandoned by her keeper and her crew while the mob of mixed boats seemed to be meditating an attack  for all his determination to keep thought off to the very last possible moment lingard could not defend himself from a sense of wonder and fear what was jorgenson about for a moment lingard expected the side of the emma to wreath itself in puffs of smoke but an age seemed to elapse without the sound of a shot reaching his ears  the boats were afraid to close they were hanging off irresolute but why did jorgenson not put an end to their hesitation by a volley or two of musketry if only over their heads through the anguish of his perplexity lingard found himself returning to life to mere life with its sense of pain and mortality like a man awakened from a dream by a stab in the breast what did this silence of the emma mean could she have been already carried in the fog but that was unthinkable some sounds of resistance must have been heard no the boats hung off because they knew with what desperate defence they would meet and perhaps jorgenson knew very well what he was doing by holding his fire to the very last moment and letting the craven hearts grow cold with the fear of a murderous discharge that would have to be faced what was certain was that this was the time for belarab to open the great gate and let his men go out display his power sweep through the further end of the settlement destroy tenggas defences do away once for all with the absurd rivalry of that intriguing amateur boatbuilder lingard turned eagerly toward belarab but saw the chief busy looking across the lagoon through a long glass resting on the shoulder of a stooping slave he was motionless like a carving suddenly he let go the long glass which some ready hands caught as it fell and said to lingard  no fight  how do you know muttered lingard astounded  there are three empty sampans alongside the ladder said belarab in a just audible voice there is bad talk there  talk i dont understand said lingard slowly  but belarab had turned toward his three attendants in white robes with shaven polls under skullcaps of plaited grass with prayer beads hanging from their wrists and an air of superior calm on their dark faces companions of his desperate days men of blood once and now imperturbable in their piety and wisdom of trusted counsellors  this white man is being betrayed he murmured to them with the greatest composure  dalcacer uncomprehending watched the scene the man of fate puzzled and fierce like a disturbed lion the whiterobed moors the multitude of halfnaked barbarians squatting by the guns standing by the loopholes in the immobility of an arranged display he saw mrs travers on the verandah of the prisoners house an anxious figure with a white scarf over her head mr travers was no doubt too weak after his fit of fever to come outside if it hadnt been for that all the whites would have been in sight of each other at the very moment of the catastrophe which was to give them back to the claims of their life at the cost of other lives sent violently out of the world dalcacer heard lingard asking loudly for the long glass and saw belarab make a sign with his hand when he felt the earth receive a violent blow from underneath while he staggered to it the heavens split over his head with a crash in the lick of a red tongue of flame and a sudden dreadful gloom fell all round the stunned dalcacer who beheld with terror the morning sun robbed of its rays glow dull and brown through the sombre murk which had taken possession of the universe the emma had blown up and when the rain of shattered timbers and mangled corpses falling into the lagoon had ceased the cloud of smoke hanging motionless under the livid sun cast its shadow afar on the shore of refuge where all strife had come to an end  a great wail of terror ascended from the settlement and was succeeded by a profound silence people could be seen bolting in unreasoning panic away from the houses and into the fields on the lagoon the raft of boats had broken up some of them were sinking others paddling away in all directions what was left above water of the emma had burst into a clear flame under the shadow of the cloud the great smoky cloud that hung solid and unstirring above the tops of the forest visible for miles up and down the coast and over the shallows  the first person to recover inside the stockade was belarab himself mechanically he murmured the exclamation of wonder god is great and looked at lingard but lingard was not looking at him the shock of the explosion had robbed him of speech and movement he stared at the emma blazing in a distant and insignificant flame under the sinister shadow of the cloud created by jorgensons mistrust and contempt for the life of men belarab turned away his opinion had changed he regarded lingard no longer as a betrayed man but the effect was the same he was no longer a man of any importance what belarab really wanted now was to see all the white people clear out of the lagoon as soon as possible presently he ordered the gate to be thrown open and his armed men poured out to take possession of the settlement later tenggas houses were set on fire and belarab mounting a fiery pony issued forth to make a triumphal progress surrounded by a great crowd of headmen and guards  that night the white people left the stockade in a cortege of torch bearers mr travers had to be carried down to the beach where two of belarabs warboats awaited their distinguished passengers mrs travers passed through the gate on dalcacers arm her face was half veiled she moved through the throng of spectators displayed in the torchlight looking straight before her belarab standing in front of a group of headmen pretended not to see the white people as they went by with lingard he shook hands murmuring the usual formulas of friendship and when he heard the great white man say you shall never see me again he felt immensely relieved belarab did not want to see that white man again but as he responded to the pressure of lingards hand he had a grave smile  god alone knows the future he said  lingard walked to the beach by himself feeling a stranger to all men and abandoned by the allknowing god by that time the first boat with mr and mrs travers had already got away out of the bloodred light thrown by the torches upon the water dalcacer and lingard followed in the second presently the dark shade of the creek walled in by the impenetrable forest closed round them and the splash of the paddles echoed in the still damp air  how do you think this awful accident happened asked dalcacer who had been sitting silent by lingards side  what is an accident said lingard with a great effort where did you hear of such a thing accident dont disturb me mr dalcacer i have just come back to life and it has closed on me colder and darker than the grave itself let me get used    i cant bear the sound of a human voice yet    viii  and now stoical in the cold and darkness of his regained life lingard had to listen to the voice of wasub telling him jaffirs story the old serangs face expressed a profound dejection and there was infinite sadness in the flowing murmur of his words  yes by allah they were all there that tyrannical tengga noisy like a fool the rajah hassim a ruler without a country daman the wandering chief and the three pangerans of the searobbers they came on board boldly for tuan jorgenson had given them permission and their talk was that you tuan were a willing captive in belarabs stockade they said they had waited all night for a message of peace from you or from belarab but there was nothing and with the first sign of day they put out on the lagoon to make friends with tuan jorgenson for they said you tuan were as if you had not been possessing no more power than a dead man the mere slave of these strange white people and belarabs prisoner thus tengga talked god had taken from him all wisdom and all fear and then he must have thought he was safe while rajah hassim and the lady immada were on board i tell you they sat there in the midst of your enemies captive the lady immada with her face covered mourned to herself the rajah hassim made a sign to jaffir and jaffir came to stand by his side and talked to his lord the main hatch was open and many of the illanuns crowded there to look down at the goods that were inside the ship they had never seen so much loot in their lives jaffir and his lord could hear plainly tuan jorgenson and tengga talking together tengga discoursed loudly and his words were the words of a doomed man for he was asking tuan jorgenson to give up the arms and everything that was on board the emma to himself and to daman and then he said we shall fight belarab and make friends with these strange white people by behaving generously to them and letting them sail away unharmed to their own country we dont want them here you tuan jorgenson are the only white man i care for they heard tuan jorgenson say to tengga now you have told me everything there is in your mind you had better go ashore with your friends and return tomorrow and tengga asked why would you fight me tomorrow rather than live many days in peace with me and he laughed and slapped his thigh and tuan jorgenson answered  no i wont fight you but even a spider will give the fly time to say its prayers  tuan jorgensons voice sounded very strange and louder than ever anybody had heard it before o rajah laut jaffir and the white man had been waiting too all night for some sign from you a shot fired or a signalfire lighted to strengthen their hearts there had been nothing rajah hassim whispering ordered jaffir to take the first opportunity to leap overboard and take to you his message of friendship and goodbye did the rajah and jaffir know what was coming who can tell but what else could they see than calamity for all wajo men whatever tuan jorgenson had made up his mind to do jaffir prepared to obey his lord and yet with so many enemies boats in the water he did not think he would ever reach the shore and as to yourself he was not at all sure that you were still alive but he said nothing of this to his rajah nobody was looking their way jaffir pressed his lords hand to his breast and waited his opportunity the fog began to blow away and presently everything was disclosed to the sight jorgenson was on his feet he was holding a lighted cigar between his fingers tengga was sitting in front of him on one of the chairs the white people had used his followers were pressing round him with daman and sentot who were muttering incantations and even the pangerans had moved closer to the hatchway jaffirs opportunity had come but he lingered by the side of his rajah in the clear air the sun shone with great force tuan jorgenson looked once more toward belarabs stockade o rajah laut but there was nothing there not even a flag displayed that had not been there before jaffir looked that way too and as he turned his head he saw tuan jorgenson in the midst of twenty spearblades that could in an instant have been driven into his breast put the cigar in his mouth and jump down the hatchway at that moment rajah hassim gave jaffir a push toward the side and jaffir leaped overboard  he was still in the water when all the world was darkened round him as if the life of the sun had been blown out of it in a crash a great wave came along and washed him on shore while pieces of wood iron and the limbs of torn men were splashing round him in the water he managed to crawl out of the mud something had hit him while he was swimming and he thought he would die but life stirred in him he had a message for you for a long time he went on crawling under the big trees on his hands and knees for there is no rest for a messenger till the message is delivered at last he found himself on the left bank of the creek and still he felt life stir in him so he started to swim across for if you were in this world you were on the other side while he swam he felt his strength abandoning him he managed to scramble on to a drifting log and lay on it like one who is dead till we pulled him into one of our boats  wasub ceased it seemed to lingard that it was impossible for mortal man to suffer more than he suffered in the succeeding moment of silence crowded by the mute images as of universal destruction he felt himself gone to pieces as though the violent expression of jorgensons intolerable mistrust of the life of men had shattered his soul leaving his body robbed of all power of resistance and of all fortitude a prey forever to infinite remorse and endless regrets  leave me wasub he said they are all deadbut i would sleep  wasub raised his dumb old eyes to the white mans face  tuan it is necessary that you should hear jaffir he said patiently  is he going to die asked lingard in a low cautious tone as though he were afraid of the sound of his own voice  who can tell wasubs voice sounded more patient than ever there is no wound on his body but o tuan he does not wish to live  abandoned by his god muttered lingard to himself  wasub waited a little before he went on and tuan he has a message for you  of course well i dont want to hear it  it is from those who will never speak to you again wasub persevered sadly it is a great trust a rajahs own words it is difficult for jaffir to die he keeps on muttering about a ring that was for you and that he let pass out of his care it was a great talisman  yes but it did not work this time and if i go and tell jaffir why he will be able to tell his rajah o wasub since you say that he is going to die    i wonder where they will meet he muttered to himself  once more wasub raised his eyes to lingards face paradise is the lot of all true believers he whispered firm in his simple faith  the man who had been undone by a glimpse of paradise exchanged a profound look with the old malay then he got up on his passage to the main hatchway the commander of the brig met no one on the decks as if all mankind had given him up except the old man who preceded him and that other man dying in the deepening twilight who was awaiting his coming below in the light of the hatchway he saw a young calash with a broad yellow face and his wiry hair sticking up in stiff wisps through the folds of his headkerchief holding an earthenware waterjar to the lips of jaffir extended on his back on a pile of mats  a languid roll of the already glazed eyeballs a mere stir of black and white in the gathering dusk showed that the faithful messenger of princes was aware of the presence of the man who had been so long known to him and his people as the king of the sea lingard knelt down close to jaffirs head which rolled a little from side to side and then became still staring at a beam of the upper deck lingard bent his ear to the dark lips deliver your message he said in a gentle tone  the rajah wished to hold your hand once more whispered jaffir so faintly that lingard had to guess the words rather than hear them i was to tell you he went onand stopped suddenly  what were you to tell me  to forget everything said jaffir with a loud effort as if beginning a long speech after that he said nothing more till lingard murmured and the lady immada  jaffir collected all his strength she hoped no more he uttered distinctly the order came to her while she mourned veiled apart i didnt even see her face  lingard swayed over the dying man so heavily that wasub standing near by hastened to catch him by the shoulder jaffir seemed unaware of anything and went on staring at the beam  can you hear me o jaffir asked lingard  i hear  i never had the ring who could bring it to me  we gave it to the white womanmay jehannum be her lot  no it shall be my lot said lingard with despairing force while wasub raised both his hands in dismay for listen jaffir if she had given the ring to me it would have been to one that was dumb deaf and robbed of all courage  it was impossible to say whether jaffir had heard he made no sound there was no change in his awful stare but his prone body moved under the cotton sheet as if to get further away from the white man lingard got up slowly and making a sign to wasub to remain where he was went up on deck without giving another glance to the dying man again it seemed to him that he was pacing the quarterdeck of a deserted ship the mulatto steward watching through the crack of the pantry door saw the captain stagger into the cuddy and flingto the door behind him with a crash for more than an hour nobody approached that closed door till carter coming down the companion stairs spoke without attempting to open it  are you there sir the answer you may come in comforted the young man by its strong resonance he went in  well  jaffir is dead this moment i thought you would want to know  lingard looked persistently at carter thinking that now jaffir was dead there was no one left on the empty earth to speak to him a word of reproach no one to know the greatness of his intentions the bond of fidelity between him and hassim and immada the depth of his affection for those people the earnestness of his visions and the unbounded trust that was his reward by the mad scorn of jorgenson flaming up against the life of men all this was as if it had never been it had become a secret locked up in his own breast forever  tell wasub to open one of the longcloth bales in the hold mr carter and give the crew a cotton sheet to bury him decently according to their faith let it be done tonight they must have the boats too i suppose they will want to take him on the sandbank  yes sir said carter  let them have what they want spades torches    wasub will chant the right words paradise is the lot of all true believers do you understand me mr carter paradise i wonder what it will be for him unless he gets messages to carry through the jungle avoiding ambushes swimming in storms and knowing no rest he wont like it  carter listened with an unmoved face it seemed to him that the captain had forgotten his presence  and all the time he will be sleeping on that sandbank lingard began again sitting in his old place under the gilt thunderbolts suspended over his head with his elbows on the table and his hands to his temples if they want a board to set up at the grave let them have a piece of an oak plank it will stay theretill the next monsoon perhaps  carter felt uncomfortable before that tense stare which just missed him and in that confined cabin seemed awful in its piercing and faroff expression but as he had not been dismissed he did not like to go away  everything will be done as you wish it sir he said i suppose the yacht will be leaving the first thing tomorrow morning sir  if she doesnt we must give her a solid shot or two to liven her upeh mr carter  carter did not know whether to smile or to look horrified in the end he did both but as to saying anything he found it impossible but lingard did not expect an answer  i believe you are going to stay with me mr carter  i told you sir i am your man if you want me  the trouble is mr carter that i am no longer the man to whom you spoke that night in carimata  neither am i sir in a manner of speaking  lingard relaxing the tenseness of his stare looked at the young man thoughtfully  after all it is the brig that will want you she will never change the finest craft afloat in these seas she will carry me about as she did before but     he unclasped his hands made a sweeping gesture  carter gave all his naive sympathy to that man who had certainly rescued the white people but seemed to have lost his own soul in the attempt carter had heard something from wasub he had made out enough of this story from the old serangs pidgin english to know that the captains native friends one of them a woman had perished in a mysterious catastrophe but the why of it and how it came about remained still quite incomprehensible to him of course a man like the captain would feel terribly cut up     you will be soon yourself again sir he said in the kindest possible tone  with the same simplicity lingard shook his head he was thinking of the dead jaffir with his last message delivered and untroubled now by all these matters of the earth he had been ordered to tell him to forget everything lingard had an inward shudder in the dismay of his heart he might have believed his brig to lie under the very wing of the angel of desolationso oppressive so final and hopeless seemed the silence in which he and carter looked at each other wistfully  lingard reached for a sheet of paper amongst several lying on the table took up a pen hesitated a moment and then wrote  meet me at daybreak on the sandbank  he addressed the envelope to mrs travers yacht hermit and pushed it across the table  send this on board the schooner at once mr carter wait a moment when our boats shove off for the sandbank have the forecastle gun fired i want to know when that dead man has left the ship  he sat alone leaning his head on his hand listening listening endlessly for the report of the gun would it never come when it came at last muffled distant with a slight shock through the body of the brig he remained still with his head leaning on his hand but with a distinct conviction with an almost physical certitude that under the cotton sheet shrouding the dead man something of himself too had left the ship    ix  in a roomy cabin furnished and fitted with austere comfort mr travers reposed at ease in a low bedplace under a snowy white sheet and a light silk coverlet his head sunk in a white pillow of extreme purity a faint scent of lavender hung about the fresh linen though lying on his back like a person who is seriously ill mr travers was conscious of nothing worse than a great fatigue mr travers restfulness had something faintly triumphant in it to find himself again on board his yacht had soothed his vanity and had revived his sense of his own importance he contemplated it in a distant perspective restored to its proper surroundings and unaffected by an adventure too extraordinary to trouble a superior mind or even to remain in ones memory for any length of time he was not responsible like many men ambitious of directing the affairs of a nation mr travers disliked the sense of responsibility he would not have been above evading it in case of need but with perverse loftiness he really in his heart scorned it that was the reason why he was able to lie at rest and enjoy a sense of returning vigour but he did not care much to talk as yet and that was why the silence in the stateroom had lasted for hours the bulkhead lamp had a green silk shade it was unnecessary to admit for a moment the existence of impudence or ruffianism a discreet knocking at the cabin door sounded deferential  mrs travers got up to see what was wanted and returned without uttering a single word to the folding armchair by the side of the bedplace with an envelope in her hand which she tore open in the greenish light mr travers remained incurious but his wife handed to him an unfolded sheet of paper which he condescended to hold up to his eyes it contained only one line of writing he let the paper fall on the coverlet and went on reposing as before it was a sick mans repose mrs travers in the armchair with her hands on the armrests had a great dignity of attitude  i intend to go she declared after a time  you intend to go repeated mr travers in a feeble deliberate voice really it doesnt matter what you decide to do all this is of so little importance it seems to me that there can be no possible object  perhaps not she admitted but dont you think that the uttermost farthing should always be paid  mr travers head rolled over on the pillow and gave a covertly scared look at that outspoken woman but it rolled back again at once and the whole man remained passive the very embodiment of helpless exhaustion mrs travers noticed this and had the unexpected impression that mr travers was not so ill as he looked hes making the most of it its a matter of diplomacy she thought she thought this without irony bitterness or disgust only her heart sank a little lower and she felt that she could not remain in the cabin with that man for the rest of the evening for all lifeyes but not for that evening  its simply monstrous murmured the man who was either very diplomatic or very exhausted in a languid manner there is something abnormal in you  mrs travers got up swiftly  one comes across monstrous things but i assure you that of all the monsters that wait on what you would call a normal existence the one i dread most is tediousness a merciless monster without teeth or claws impotent horrible  she left the stateroom vanishing out of it with noiseless resolution no power on earth could have kept her in there for another minute on deck she found a moonless night with a velvety tepid feeling in the air and in the sky a mass of blurred starlight like the tarnished tinsel of a wornout very old very tedious firmament the usual routine of the yacht had been already resumed the awnings had been stretched aft a solitary round lamp had been hung as usual under the main boom out of the deep gloom behind it dalcacer a long loose figure lounged in the dim light across the deck dalcacer had got promptly in touch with the store of cigarettes he owed to the governor generals generosity a large pulsating spark glowed illuminating redly the design of his lips under the fine dark moustache the tip of his nose his lean chin dalcacer reproached himself for an unwonted lightheartedness which had somehow taken possession of him he had not experienced that sort of feeling for years reprehensible as it was he did not want anything to disturb it but as he could not run away openly from mrs travers he advanced to meet her  i do hope you have nothing to tell me he said with whimsical earnestness  i no have you  he assured her he had not and proffered a request dont let us tell each other anything mrs travers dont let us think of anything i believe it will be the best way to get over the evening there was real anxiety in his jesting tone  very well mrs travers assented seriously but in that case we had better not remain together she asked then dalcacer to go below and sit with mr travers who didnt like to be left alone though he too doesnt seem to want to be told anything she added parenthetically and went on but i must ask you something else mr dalcacer i propose to sit down in this chair and go to sleepif i can will you promise to call me about five oclock i prefer not to speak to any one on deck and moreover i can trust you  he bowed in silence and went away slowly mrs travers turning her head perceived a steady light at the brigs yardarm very bright among the tarnished stars she walked aft and looked over the taffrail it was exactly like that other night she half expected to hear presently the low rippling sound of an advancing boat but the universe remained without a sound when she at last dropped into the deck chair she was absolutely at the end of her power of thinking i suppose thats how the condemned manage to get some sleep on the night before the execution she said to herself a moment before her eyelids closed as if under a leaden hand  she woke up with her face wet with tears out of a vivid dream of lingard in chainmail armour and vaguely recalling a crusader but bareheaded and walking away from her in the depths of an impossible landscape she hurried on to catch up with him but a throng of barbarians with enormous turbans came between them at the last moment and she lost sight of him forever in the flurry of a ghastly sandstorm what frightened her most was that she had not been able to see his face it was then that she began to cry over her hard fate when she woke up the tears were still rolling down her cheeks and she perceived in the light of the decklamp dalcacer arrested a little way off  did you have to speak to me she asked  no said dalcacer you didnt give me time when i came as far as this i fancied i heard you sobbing it must have been a delusion  oh no my face is wet yet it was a dream i suppose it is five oclock thank you for being so punctual i have something to do before sunrise  dalcacer moved nearer i know you have decided to keep an appointment on the sandbank your husband didnt utter twenty words in all these hours but he managed to tell me that piece of news  i shouldnt have thought she murmured vaguely  he wanted me to understand that it had no importance stated dalcacer in a very serious tone  yes he knows what he is talking about said mrs travers in such a bitter tone as to disconcert dalcacer for a moment i dont see a single soul about the decks mrs travers continued almost directly  the very watchmen are asleep said dalcacer  there is nothing secret in this expedition but i prefer not to call any one perhaps you wouldnt mind pulling me off yourself in our small boat  it seemed to her that dalcacer showed some hesitation she added it has no importance you know  he bowed his assent and preceded her down the side in silence when she entered the boat he had the sculls ready and directly she sat down he shoved off it was so dark yet that but for the brigs yardarm light he could not have kept his direction he pulled a very deliberate stroke looking over his shoulder frequently it was mrs travers who saw first the faint gleam of the uncovered sandspit on the black quiet water  a little more to the left she said no the other way    dalcacer obeyed her directions but his stroke grew even slower than before she spoke again dont you think that the uttermost farthing should always be paid mr dalcacer  dalcacer glanced over his shoulder then it would be the only honourable way but it may be hard too hard for our common fearful hearts  i am prepared for anything  he ceased pulling for a moment    anything that may be found on a sandbank mrs travers went on on an arid insignificant and deserted sandbank  dalcacer gave two strokes and ceased again  there is room for a whole world of suffering on a sandbank for all the bitterness and resentment a human soul may be made to feel  yes i suppose you would know she whispered while he gave a stroke or two and again glanced over his shoulder she murmured the words  bitterness resentment and a moment afterward became aware of the keel of the boat running up on the sand but she didnt move and dalcacer too remained seated on the thwart with the blades of his sculls raised as if ready to drop them and back the dinghy out into deep water at the first sign  mrs travers made no sign but she asked abruptly mr dalcacer do you think i shall ever come back  her tone seemed to him to lack sincerity but who could tell what this abruptness coveredsincere fear or mere vanity he asked himself whether she was playing a part for his benefit or only for herself  i dont think you quite understand the situation mrs travers i dont think you have a clear idea either of his simplicity or of his visionarys pride  she thought contemptuously that there were other things which dalcacer didnt know and surrendered to a sudden temptation to enlighten him a little  you forget his capacity for passion and that his simplicity doesnt know its own strength  there was no mistaking the sincerity of that murmur she has felt it dalcacer said to himself with absolute certitude he wondered when where how on what occasion mrs travers stood up in the stern sheets suddenly and dalcacer leaped on the sand to help her out of the boat  hadnt i better hang about here to take you back again he suggested as he let go her hand  you mustnt she exclaimed anxiously you must return to the yacht there will be plenty of light in another hour i will come to this spot and wave my handkerchief when i want to be taken off  at their feet the shallow water slept profoundly the ghostly gleam of the sands baffled the eye by its lack of form far off the growth of bushes in the centre raised a massive black bulk against the stars to the southward mrs travers lingered for a moment near the boat as if afraid of the strange solitude of this lonely sandbank and of this lone sea that seemed to fill the whole encircling universe of remote stars and limitless shadows there is nobody here she whispered to herself  he is somewhere about waiting for you or i dont know the man affirmed dalcacer in an undertone he gave a vigorous shove which sent the little boat into the water  dalcacer was perfectly right lingard had come up on deck long before mrs travers woke up with her face wet with tears the burial party had returned hours before and the crew of the brig were plunged in sleep except for two watchmen who at lingards appearance retreated noiselessly from the poop lingard leaning on the rail fell into a sombre reverie of his past reproachful spectres crowded the air animated and vocal not in the articulate language of mortals but assailing him with faint sobs deep sighs and fateful gestures when he came to himself and turned about they vanished all but one dark shape without sound or movement lingard looked at it with secret horror  whos that he asked in a troubled voice  the shadow moved closer its only me sir said carter who had left orders to be called directly the captain was seen on deck  oh yes i might have known mumbled lingard in some confusion he requested carter to have a boat manned and when after a time the young man told him that it was ready he said all right and remained leaning on his elbow  i beg your pardon sir said carter after a longish silence but are you going some distance  no i only want to be put ashore on the sandbank  carter was relieved to hear this but also surprised there is nothing living there sir he said  i wonder muttered lingard  but i am certain carter insisted the last of the women and children belonging to those cutthroats were taken off by the sampans which brought you and the yachtparty out  he walked at lingards elbow to the gangway and listened to his orders  directly there is enough light to see flags by make a signal to the schooner to heave short on her cable and loose her sails if there is any hanging back give them a blank gun mr carter i will have no shillyshallying if she doesnt go at the word by heavens i will drive her out i am still master herefor another day  the overwhelming sense of immensity of disturbing emptiness which affects those who walk on the sands in the midst of the sea intimidated mrs travers the world resembled a limitless flat shadow which was motionless and elusive then against the southern stars she saw a human form that isolated and lone appeared to her immense the shape of a giant outlined amongst the constellations as it approached her it shrank to common proportions got clear of the stars lost its awesomeness and became menacing in its ominous and silent advance mrs travers hastened to speak  you have asked for me i am come i trust you will have no reason to regret my obedience  he walked up quite close to her bent down slightly to peer into her face the first of the tropical dawn put its characteristic cold sheen into the sky above the shore of refuge  mrs travers did not turn away her head  are you looking for a change in me no you wont see it now i know that i couldnt change even if i wanted to i am made of clay that is too hard  i am looking at you for the first time said lingard i never could see you before there were too many things too many thoughts too many people no i never saw you before but now the world is dead  he grasped her shoulders approaching his face close to hers she never flinched  yes the world is dead she said look your fill then it wont be for long  he let her go as suddenly as though she had struck him the cold white light of the tropical dawn had crept past the zenith now and the expanse of the shallow waters looked cold too without stir or ripple within the enormous rim of the horizon where to the west a shadow lingered still  take my arm he said  she did so at once and turning their backs on the two ships they began to walk along the sands but they had not made many steps when mrs travers perceived an oblong mound with a board planted upright at one end mrs travers knew that part of the sands it was here she used to walk with her husband and dalcacer every evening after dinner while the yacht lay stranded and her boats were away in search of assistancewhich they had foundwhich they had found this was something that she had never seen there before lingard had suddenly stopped and looked at it moodily she pressed his arm to rouse him and asked what is this  this is a grave said lingard in a low voice and still gazing at the heap of sand i had him taken out of the ship last night strange he went on in a musing tone how much a grave big enough for one man only can hold his message was to forget everything  never never murmured mrs travers i wish i had been on board the emma    you had a madman there she cried out suddenly they moved on again lingard looking at mrs travers who was leaning on his arm  i wonder which of us two was mad he said  i wonder you can bear to look at me she murmured then lingard spoke again  i had to see you once more  that abominable jorgenson she whispered to herself  no no he gave me my chancebefore he gave me up  mrs travers disengaged her arm and lingard stopped too facing her in a long silence  i could not refuse to meet you said mrs travers at last i could not refuse you anything you have all the right on your side and i dont care what you do or say but i wonder at my own courage when i think of the confession i have to make she advanced laid her hand on lingards shoulder and spoke earnestly i shuddered at the thought of meeting you again and now you must listen to my confession  dont say a word said lingard in an untroubled voice and never taking his eyes from her face i know already  you cant she cried her hand slipped off his shoulder then why dont you throw me into the sea she asked passionately am i to live on hating myself  you mustnt he said with an accent of fear havent you understood long ago that if you had given me that ring it would have been just the same  am i to believe this no no you are too generous to a mere sham you are the most magnanimous of men but you are throwing it away on me do you think it is remorse that i feel no if it is anything it is despair but you must have known thatand yet you wanted to look at me again  i told you i never had a chance before said lingard in an unmoved voice it was only after i heard they gave you the ring that i felt the hold you have got on me how could i tell before what has hate or love to do with you and me hate love what can touch you for me you stand above death itself for i see now that as long as i live you will never die  they confronted each other at the southern edge of the sands as if afloat on the open sea the central ridge heaped up by the winds masked from them the very mastheads of the two ships and the growing brightness of the light only augmented the sense of their invincible solitude in the awful serenity of the world mrs travers suddenly put her arm across her eyes and averted her face  then he added  thats all  mrs travers let fall her arm and began to retrace her steps unsupported and alone lingard followed her on the edge of the sand uncovered by the ebbing tide a belt of orange light appeared in the cold sky above the black forest of the shore of refuge and faded quickly to gold that melted soon into a blinding and colourless glare it was not till after she had passed jaffirs grave that mrs travers stole a backward glance and discovered that she was alone lingard had left her to herself she saw him sitting near the mound of sand his back bowed his hands clasping his knees as if he had obeyed the invincible call of his great visions haunting the grave of the faithful messenger shading her eyes with her hand mrs travers watched the immobility of that man of infinite illusions he never moved he never raised his head it was all over he was done with her she waited a little longer and then went slowly on her way  shaw now acting second mate of the yacht came off with another hand in a little boat to take mrs travers on board he stared at her like an offended owl how the lady could suddenly appear at sunrise waving her handkerchief from the sandbank he could not understand for even if she had managed to row herself off secretly in the dark she could not have sent the empty boat back to the yacht it was to shaw a sort of improper miracle  dalcacer hurried to the top of the side ladder and as they met on deck mrs travers astonished him by saying in a strangely provoking tone  you were right i have come back then with a little laugh which impressed dalcacer painfully she added with a nod downward and martin too was perfectly right it was absolutely unimportant  she walked on straight to the taffrail and dalcacer followed her aft alarmed at her white face at her brusque movements at the nervous way in which she was fumbling at her throat he waited discreetly till she turned round and thrust out toward him her open palm on which he saw a thick gold ring set with a large green stone  look at this mr dalcacer this is the thing which i asked you whether i should give up or concealthe symbol of the last hourthe call of the supreme minute and he said it would have made no difference he is the most magnanimous of men and the uttermost farthing has been paid he has done with me the most magnanimous    but there is a grave on the sands by which i left him sitting with no glance to spare for me his last glance on earth i am left with this thing absolutely unimportant a dead talisman with a nervous jerk she flung the ring overboard then with a hurried entreaty to dalcacer stay here a moment dont let anybody come near us she burst into tears and turned her back on him  lingard returned on board his brig and in the early afternoon the lightning got under way running past the schooner to give her a lead through the maze of shoals lingard was on deck but never looked once at the following vessel directly both ships were in clear water he went below saying to carter you know what to do  yes sir said carter  shortly after his captain had disappeared from the deck carter laid the main topsail to the mast the lightning lost her way while the schooner with all her light kites abroad passed close under her stern holding on her course mrs travers stood aft very rigid gripping the rail with both hands the brim of her white hat was blown upward on one side and her yachting skirt stirred in the breeze by her side dalcacer waved his hand courteously carter raised his cap to them  during the afternoon he paced the poop with measured steps with a pair of binoculars in his hand at last he laid the glasses down glanced at the compasscard and walked to the cabin skylight which was open  just lost her sir he said all was still down there he raised his voice a little  you told me to let you know directly i lost sight of the yacht  the sound of a stifled groan reached the attentive carter and a weary voice said all right i am coming  when lingard stepped out on the poop of the lightning the open water had turned purple already in the evening light while to the east the shallows made a steely glitter all along the sombre line of the shore lingard with folded arms looked over the sea carter approached him and spoke quietly  the tide has turned and the night is coming on hadnt we better get away from these shoals sir  lingard did not stir  yes the night is coming on you may fill the main topsail mr carter he said and he relapsed into silence with his eyes fixed in the southern board where the shadows were creeping stealthily toward the setting sun presently carter stood at his elbow again  the brig is beginning to forge ahead sir he said in a warning tone  lingard came out of his absorption with a deep tremor of his powerful frame like the shudder of an uprooted tree  how was the yacht heading when you lost sight of her he asked  south as near as possible answered carter will you give me a course to steer for the night sir  lingards lips trembled before he spoke but his voice was calm  steer north he said
