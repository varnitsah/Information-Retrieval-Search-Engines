36298170	the adventures of reddy fox  by thornton w burgess     i granny fox gives reddy a scare  reddy fox lived with granny fox you see reddy was one of a large family so large that mother fox had hard work to feed so many hungry little mouths and so she had let reddy go to live with old granny fox granny fox was the wisest slyest smartest fox in all the country round and now that reddy had grown so big she thought it about time that he began to learn the things that every fox should know so every day she took him hunting with her and taught him all the things that she had learned about hunting about how to steal farmer browns chickens without awakening bowser the hound and all about the thousand and one ways of fooling a dog which she had learned  this morning granny fox had taken reddy across the green meadows up through the green forest and over to the railroad track reddy had never been there before and he didnt know just what to make of it granny trotted ahead until they came to a long bridge then she stopped  come here reddy and look down she commanded  reddy did as he was told but a glance down made him giddy so giddy that he nearly fell granny fox grinned  come across said she and ran lightly across to the other side  but reddy fox was afraid yes sir he was afraid to take one step on the long bridge he was afraid that he would fall through into the water or onto the cruel rocks below granny fox ran back to where reddy sat  for shame reddy fox said she what are you afraid of just dont look down and you will be safe enough now come along over with me  but reddy fox hung back and begged to go home and whimpered suddenly granny fox sprang to her feet as if in great fright bowser the hound come reddy come she cried and started across the bridge as fast as she could go  reddy didnt stop to look or to think his one idea was to get away from bowser the hound wait granny wait he cried and started after her as fast as he could run he was in the middle of the bridge before he remembered it at all when he was at last safely across it was to find old granny fox sitting down laughing at him then for the first time reddy looked behind him to see where bowser the hound might be he was nowhere to be seen could he have fallen off the bridge  where is bowser the hound cried reddy  home in farmer browns dooryard replied granny fox dryly reddy stared at her for a minute then he began to understand that granny fox had simply scared him into running across the bridge reddy felt very cheap very cheap indeed now well run back again said granny fox and this time reddy did     ii granny shows reddy a trick  every day granny fox led reddy fox over to the long railroad bridge and made him run back and forth across it until he had no fear of it whatever at first it had made him dizzy but now he could run across at the top of his speed and not mind it in the least i dont see what good it does to be able to run across a bridge anyone can do that exclaimed reddy one day  granny fox smiled do you remember the first time you tried to do it she asked  reddy hung his head of course he rememberedremembered that granny had had to scare him into crossing that first time  suddenly granny fox lifted her head hark she exclaimed  reddy pricked up his sharp pointed ears way off back in the direction from which they had come they heard the baying of a dog it wasnt the voice of bowser the hound but of a younger dog granny listened for a few minutes the voice of the dog grew louder as it drew nearer  he certainly is following our track said granny fox now reddy you run across the bridge and watch from the top of the little hill over there perhaps i can show you a trick that will teach you why i have made you learn to run across the bridge  reddy trotted across the long bridge and up to the top of the hill as granny had told him to then he sat down to watch granny trotted out in the middle of a field and sat down pretty soon a young hound broke out of the bushes his nose in grannys track then he looked up and saw her and his voice grew still more savage and eager granny fox started to run as soon as she was sure that the hound had seen her but she did not run very fast reddy did not know what to make of it for granny seemed simply to be playing with the hound and not really trying to get away from him at all pretty soon reddy heard another sound it was a long low rumble then there was a distant whistle it was a train  granny heard it too as she ran she began to work back toward the long bridge the train was in sight now suddenly granny fox started across the bridge so fast that she looked like a little red streak the dog was close at her heels when she started and he was so eager to catch her that he didnt see either the bridge or the train but he couldnt begin to run as fast as granny fox oh my no when she had reached the other side he wasnt halfway across and right behind him whistling for him to get out of the way was the train  the hound gave one frightened yelp and then he did the only thing he could do he leaped down down into the swift water below and the last reddy saw of him he was frantically trying to swim ashore  now you know why i wanted you to learn to cross a bridge its a very nice way of getting rid of dogs said granny fox as she climbed up beside reddy     iii bowser the hound isnt fooled  reddy fox had been taught so much by granny fox that he began to feel very wise and very important reddy is naturally smart and he had been very quick to learn the tricks that old granny fox had taught him but reddy fox is a boaster every day he swaggered about on the green meadows and bragged how smart he was blacky the crow grew tired of reddys boasting  if youre so smart what is the reason you always keep out of sight of bowser the hound asked blacky for my part i dont believe that you are smart enough to fool him  a lot of little meadow people heard blacky say this and reddy knew it he also knew that if he didnt prove blacky in the wrong he would be laughed at forever after suddenly he remembered the trick that granny fox had played on the young hound at the railroad bridge why not play the same trick on bowser and invite blacky the crow to see him do it he would  if you will be over at the railroad bridge when the train comes this afternoon ill show you how easy it is to fool bowser the hound said reddy  blacky agreed to be there and reddy started off to find out where bowser was blacky told everyone he met how reddy fox had promised to fool bowser the hound and every time he told it he chuckled as if he thought it the best joke ever  blacky the crow was on hand promptly that afternoon and with him came his cousin sammy jay presently they saw reddy fox hurrying across the fields and behind him in full cry came bowser the hound just as old granny fox had done with the young hound reddy allowed bowser to get very near him and then as the train came roaring along he raced across the long bridge just ahead of it he had thought that bowser would be so intent on catching him that he would not notice the train until he was on the bridge and it was too late as had been the case with the young hound then bowser would have to jump down into the swift river or be run over as soon as reddy was across the bridge he jumped off the track and turned to see what would happen to bowser the hound the train was halfway across the bridge but bowser was nowhere to be seen he must have jumped already reddy sat down and grinned in the most selfsatisfied way  the long train roared past and reddy closed his eyes to shut out the dust and smoke when he opened them again he looked right into the wideopen mouth of bowser the hound who was not ten feet away  did you think you could fool me with that old trick roared bowser  reddy didnt stop to make reply he just started off at the top of his speed a badly frightened little fox  you see bowser the hound knew all about that trick and he had just waited until the train had passed and then had run across the bridge right behind it  and as reddy fox out of breath and tired ran to seek the aid of granny fox in getting rid of bowser the hound he heard a sound that made him grind his teeth  haw haw haw how smart we are  it was blacky the crow     iv reddy fox grows bold  reddy fox was growing bold everybody said so and what everybody says must be so reddy fox had always been very sly and not bold at all the truth is reddy fox had so many times fooled bowser the hound and farmer browns boy that he had begun to think himself very smart indeed he had really fooled himself yes sir reddy fox had fooled himself he thought himself so smart that nobody could fool him  now it is one of the worst habits in the world to think too much of ones self and reddy fox had the habit oh my yes reddy fox certainly did have the habit when anyone mentioned bowser the hound reddy would turn up his nose and say pooh its the easiest thing in the world to fool him  you see he had forgotten all about the time bowser had fooled him at the railroad bridge  whenever reddy saw farmer browns boy he would say with the greatest scorn whos afraid of him not i  so as reddy fox thought more and more of his own smartness he grew bolder and bolder almost every night he visited farmer browns henyard farmer brown set traps all around the yard but reddy always found them and kept out of them it got so that unc billy possum and jimmy skunk didnt dare go to the henhouse for eggs any more for fear that they would get into one of the traps set for reddy fox of course they missed those fresh eggs and of course they blamed reddy fox  never mind said jimmy skunk scowling down on the green meadows where reddy fox was taking a sun bath farmer browns boy will get him yet i hope he does jimmy said this a little spitefully and just as if he really meant it  now when people think that they are very very smart they like to show off you know it isnt any fun at all to feel smart unless others can see how smart you are so reddy fox just to show off grew very bold very bold indeed he actually went up to farmer browns henyard in broad daylight and almost under the nose of bowser the hound he caught the pet chicken of farmer browns boy ol mistah buzzard sailing overhead high up in the blue blue sky saw reddy fox and shook his bald head  ah see trouble on the way yes ah do yes ah do hope it aint agwine to stay yes ah do yes ah do trouble am a spry ol man bound to find yo if he can if he finds yo bound to stick when ah sees him ah runs quick yes ah do yes ah do  but reddy fox thought himself so smart that it seemed as if he really were hunting for ol mr trouble and when he caught the pet chicken of farmer browns boy ol mr trouble was right at his heels     v reddy grows careless  ol mistah buzzard was right trouble was right at the heels of reddy fox although reddy wouldnt have believed it if he had been told he had stolen that plump pet chicken of farmer browns boy for no reason under the sun but to show off he wanted everyone to know how bold he was he thought himself so smart that he could do just exactly what he pleased and no one could stop him he liked to strut around through the green forest and over the green meadows and brag about what he had done and what he could do  now people who brag and boast and who like to show off are almost sure to come to grief and when they do very few people are sorry for them none of the little meadow and forest people liked reddy fox anyway and they were getting so tired of his boasting that they just ached to see him get into trouble yes sir they just ached to see reddy get into trouble  peter rabbit happygolucky peter rabbit shook his head gravely when he heard how reddy had stolen that pet chicken of farmer browns boy and was boasting about it to everyone  reddy fox is getting so puffed up that pretty soon he wont be able to see his own feet said peter rabbit  well what if he doesnt demanded jimmy skunk  peter looked at jimmy in disgust  he comes to grief however fleet who doesnt watch his flying feet  jimmy skunk if you didnt have that little bag of scent that everybody is afraid of you would be a lot more careful where you step replied peter if reddy doesnt watch out someday hell step right into a trap  jimmy skunk chuckled i wish he would said he  now when farmer browns boy heard about the boldness of reddy fox he shut his mouth tight in a way that was unpleasant to see and reached for his gun i cant afford to raise chickens to feed foxes said he then he whistled for bowser the hound and together they started out it wasnt long before bowser found reddys tracks  bow wow wow wow roared bowser the hound  reddy fox taking a nap on the edge of the green forest heard bowsers big deep voice he pricked up his ears then he grinned i feel just like a good run today said he and trotted off along the crooked little path down the hill  now this was a beautiful summer day and reddy knew that in summer men and boys seldom hunt foxes its only bowser the hound thought reddy and when ive had a good run ill play a trick on him so that he will lose my track so reddy didnt use his eyes as he should have done you see he thought himself so smart that he had grown careless yes sir reddy fox had grown careless he kept looking back to see where bowser the hound was but didnt look around to make sure that no other danger was near  ol mistah buzzard sailing round and round way up in the blue blue sky could see everything going on down below he could see reddy fox running along the edge of the green forest and every few minutes stopping to chuckle and listen to bowser the hound trying to pick out the trail reddy had made so hard to follow by his twists and turns and he saw something else did ol mistah buzzard it looked to him very much like the barrel of a gun sticking out from behind an old tree just ahead of reddy  ah reckon its just like ah said reddy fox is gwine to meet trouble right smart soon muttered ol mistah buzzard     vi drummer the woodpecker drums in vain  once upon a time before he had grown to think himself so very very smart reddy fox would never never have thought of running without watching out in every direction he would have seen that thing that looked like the barrel of a gun sticking out from behind the old tree toward which he was running and he would have been very suspicious very suspicious indeed but now all reddy could think of was what a splendid chance he had to show all the little meadow and forest people what a bold smart fellow he was  so once more reddy sat down and waited until bowser the hound was almost up to him just then drummer the woodpecker began to make a tremendous noiseratatattattat ratatattattat ratatattattat now everybody who heard that ratatattattat knew that it was a danger signal drummer the woodpecker never drums just that way for pleasure but reddy fox paid no attention to it he didnt notice it at all you see he was so full of the idea of his own smartness that he didnt have room for anything else  stupid thing said drummer the woodpecker to himself i dont know what i am trying to warn him for anyway the green meadows and the green forest would be better off without him a lot better off nobody likes him hes a dreadful bully and is all the time trying to catch or scare to death those who are smaller than he still he is so handsome drummer cocked his head on one side and looked over at reddy fox  reddy was laughing to see how hard bowser the hound was working to untangle reddys mixedup trail  yes sir he certainly is handsome said drummer once more  then he looked down at the foot of the old tree on which he was sitting and what he saw caused drummer to make up his mind i surely would miss seeing that beautiful red coat of his i surely would he muttered if he doesnt hear and heed now it wont be my fault then drummer the woodpecker began such a furious ratatattattat on the trunk of the old tree that it rang through the green forest and out across the green meadows almost to the purple hills  down at the foot of the tree a freckled face on which there was a black scowl looked up it was the face of farmer browns boy  what ails that pesky woodpecker he muttered if he doesnt keep still hell scare that fox  he shook a fist at drummer but drummer didnt appear to notice he kept right on ratatattattat ratatattattat ratatattattat     vii too late reddy fox hears  drummer the woodpecker was pounding out his danger signal so fast and so hard that his red head flew back and forth almost too fast to see ratatattatatattat beat drummer on the old tree trunk on the edge of the green forest when he stopped for breath he looked down into the scowling face of farmer browns boy who was hiding behind the old tree trunk  drummer didnt like the looks of that scowl not a bit and he didnt like the looks of the gun which farmer browns boy had he knew that farmer browns boy was hiding there to shoot reddy fox but drummer was beginning to be afraid that farmer browns boy might guess what all that drumming meantthat it was a warning to reddy fox and if farmer browns boy did guess that whywhyanyway on the other side of the tree there was a better place to drum so drummer the woodpecker crept around to the other side of the tree and in a minute was drumming harder than ever whenever he stopped for breath he looked out over the green meadows to see if reddy fox had heard his warning  but if reddy had heard he hadnt heeded just to show off before all the little meadow and forest people reddy had waited until bowser the hound had almost reached him then with a saucy flirt of his tail reddy fox started to show how fast he could run and that is very fast indeed it made bowser the hound seem very slow as with his nose to the ground he came racing after reddy making a tremendous noise with his great voice  now reddy fox had grown as careless as he had grown bold instead of looking sharply ahead he looked this way and that way to see who was watching and admiring him so he took no note of where he was going and started straight for the old tree trunk on which drummer the woodpecker was pounding out his warning of danger  now reddy fox has sharp eyes and very quick ears my my indeed he has but just now reddy was as deaf as if he had cotton stuffed in his ears he was chuckling to himself to think how he was going to fool bowser the hound and how smart everyone would think him when all of a sudden he heard the ratatattatatattat of drummer the woodpecker and knew that that meant danger  for just a wee little second it seemed to reddy fox that his heart stopped beating he couldnt stop running for he had let bowser the hound get too close for that reddys sharp eyes saw drummer the woodpecker near the top of the old tree trunk and noticed that drummer seemed to be looking at something down below reddy fox gave one quick look at the foot of the old tree trunk and saw a gun pointed at him and behind the gun the freckled face of farmer browns boy reddy fox gave a little gasp of fright and turned so suddenly that he almost fell flat then he began to run as never in his life had he run before it seemed as though his flying feet hardly touched the grass his eyes were popping out with fright as with every jump he tried to run just a wee bit faster  bang bang two flashes of fire and two puffs of smoke darted from behind the old tree trunk drummer the woodpecker gave a frightened scream and flew deep into the green forest peter rabbit flattened himself under a friendly bramble bush johnny chuck dived headfirst down his doorway  reddy fox gave a yelp a shrill little yelp of pain and suddenly began to go lame but farmer browns boy didnt know that he thought he had missed and he growled to himself  ill get that fox yet for stealing my pet chicken     viii granny fox takes care of reddy  reddy fox was so sore and lame that he could hardly hobble he had had the hardest kind of work to get far enough ahead of bowser the hound to mix his trail up so that bowser couldnt follow it then he had limped home big tears running down his nose although he tried hard not to cry oh oh oh moaned reddy fox as he crept in at the doorway of his home  whats the matter now snapped old granny fox who had just waked up from a sun nap  iive got hurt said reddy fox and began to cry harder granny fox looked at reddy sharply what have you been doing nowtearing your clothes on a barbedwire fence or trying to crawl through a bullbriar thicket i should think you were big enough by this time to look out for yourself said granny fox crossly as she came over to look at reddys hurts  please dont scold please dont granny fox begged reddy who was beginning to feel sick to his stomach as well as lame and to smart dreadfully  granny fox took one look at reddys wounds and knew right away what had happened she made reddy stretch himself out at full length and then she went to work on him washing his wounds with the greatest care and binding them up she was very gentle was old granny fox as she touched the sore places but all the time she was at work her tongue flew and that wasnt gentle at all oh my no there was nothing gentle about that  you see old granny fox is wise and very very sharp and shrewd just as soon as she saw reddys hurts she knew that they were made by shot from a gun and that meant that reddy fox had been careless or he never never would have been where he was in danger of being shot  i hope this will teach you a lesson said granny fox what are your eyes and your ears and your nose for to keep you out of just such trouble as this  a little fox must use his eyes or get someday a sad surprise  a little fox must use his ears and know what makes each sound he hears  a little fox must use his nose and try the wind whereer he goes  a little fox must use all three to live to grow as old as me  now tell me all about it reddy fox this is summer and men dont hunt foxes now i dont see how it happens that farmer browns boy was waiting for you with a gun  so reddy fox told granny fox all about how he had run too near the old tree trunk behind which farmer browns boy had been hiding but reddy didnt tell how he had been trying to show off or how in broad daylight he had stolen the pet chicken of farmer browns boy you may be sure he was very careful not to mention that  and so old granny fox puckered up her brows and thought and thought trying to find some good reason why farmer browns boy should have been hunting in the summertime  caw caw caw shouted blacky the crow  the face of granny fox cleared blacky the crow has been stealing and farmer browns boy was out after him when reddy came along said granny fox talking out loud to herself  reddy fox grew very red in the face but he never said a word     ix peter rabbit hears the news  johnny chuck came running up to the edge of the old briarpatch quite out of breath you see he is so round and fat and rolypoly that to run makes him puff and blow johnny chucks eyes danced with excitement as he peered into the old briarpatch trying to see peter rabbit  peter peter rabbit oh peter he called no one answered johnny chuck looked disappointed it was the middle of the morning and he had thought that peter would surely be at home then he would try once more oh you peter rabbit he shouted in such a highpitched voice that it was almost a squeal  what you want asked a sleepy voice from the middle of the old briarpatch  johnny chucks face lighted up come out here peter where i can look at you cried johnny  go away johnny chuck im sleepy said peter rabbit and his voice sounded just a wee bit cross for peter had been out all night a habit which peter has  ive got some news for you peter called johnny chuck eagerly  how do you know its news to me asked peter and johnny noticed that his voice wasnt quite so cross  im almost sure it is for ive just heard it myself and ive hurried right down here to tell you because i think youll want to know it replied johnny chuck  pooh said peter rabbit its probably as old as the hills to me you folks who go to bed with the sun dont hear the news until its old what is it  its about reddy fox began johnny chuck but peter rabbit interrupted him  shucks johnny chuck you are slow why it was all over green meadows last night how reddy fox had been shot by farmer browns boy jeered peter rabbit thats no news and here youve waked me up to tell me something i knew before you went to bed last night serves reddy fox right hope hell be lame for a week added peter rabbit  he cant walk at all cried johnny chuck in triumph sure now that peter rabbit hadnt heard the news  whats that demanded peter and johnny chuck could hear him begin to hop along one of his little private paths in the heart of the old briarpatch he knew now that peter rabbits curiosity was aroused and he smiled to himself  in a few minutes peter thrust a sleepylooking face out from the old briarpatch and grinned rather sheepishly what was that you were saying about reddy fox he asked again  ive a good mind not to tell you mr knowitall exclaimed johnny chuck  oh please johnny chuck pleaded peter rabbit  finally johnny gave in i said that reddy fox cant walk arent you glad peter  how do you know asked peter for peter is very suspicious of reddy fox and has to watch out for his tricks all the time  jimmy skunk told me he was up by reddys house early this morning and saw reddy try to walk he tried and tried and couldnt you wont have to watch out for reddy fox for some time peter serves him right doesnt it  lets go up and see if it really is true said peter suddenly  all right said johnny chuck and off they started     x poor reddy fox  peter rabbit and johnny chuck stole up the hill toward the home of reddy fox as they drew near they crept from one bunch of grass to another and from bush to bush stopping behind each to look and listen they were not taking any chances johnny chuck was not much afraid of reddy fox for he had whipped him once but he was afraid of old granny fox peter rabbit was afraid of both the nearer he got to the home of reddy fox the more anxious and nervous he grew you see reddy fox had played so many tricks to try and catch peter that peter was not quite sure that this was not another trick so he kept a sharp watch in every direction ready to run at the least sign of danger  when they had tiptoed and crawled to a point where they could see the doorstep of the fox home peter rabbit and johnny chuck lay down in a clump of bushes and watched pretty soon they saw old granny fox come out she sniffed the wind and then she started off at a quick run down the lone little path johnny chuck gave a sigh of relief for he wasnt afraid of reddy and now he felt safe but peter rabbit was just as watchful as ever  ive got to see reddy for myself before ill go a step nearer he whispered just then johnny chuck put a hand on his lips and pointed with the other hand there was reddy fox crawling out of his doorway into the sun peter rabbit leaned forward to see better was reddy fox really so badly hurt or was he only pretending  reddy fox crawled painfully out onto his doorstep he tried to stand and walk but he couldnt because he was too stiff and sore so he just crawled he didnt know that anyone was watching him and with every movement he made a face that was because it hurt so  peter rabbit watching from the clump of bushes knew then that reddy was not pretending he knew that he had nothing not the least little thing to fear from reddy fox so peter gave a whoop of joy and sprang out into view  reddy looked up and tried to grin but made a face of pain instead you see it hurt so to move  i suppose youre tickled to death to see me like this he growled to peter rabbit  now peter had every reason to be glad for reddy fox had tried his best to catch peter rabbit to give to old granny fox for her dinner and time and again peter had just barely escaped so at first peter rabbit had whooped with joy but as he saw how very helpless reddy really was and how much pain he felt suddenly peter rabbits big soft eyes filled with tears of pity  he forgot all about the threats of reddy fox and how reddy had tried to trick him he forgot all about how mean reddy had been  poor reddy fox said peter rabbit poor reddy fox     xi granny fox returns  up over the hill trotted old granny fox she was on her way home with a tender young chicken for reddy fox poor reddy of course it was his own fault for he had been showing off and he had been careless or he never would have gone so near to the old tree trunk behind which farmer browns boy was hiding  but old granny fox didnt know this she never makes such mistakes herself oh my no so now as she came up over the hill to a place where she could see her home she laid the chicken down and then she crept behind a little bush and looked all over the green meadows to see if the way was clear she knew that bowser the hound was chained up she had seen farmer brown and farmer browns boy hoeing in the cornfield so she had nothing to fear from them  looking over to her doorstep she saw reddy fox lying in the sun and then she saw something else something that made her eyes flash and her teeth come together with a snap it was peter rabbit sitting up very straight not ten feet from reddy fox  so thats that young scamp of a peter rabbit whom reddy was going to catch for me when i was sick and couldnt ill just show reddy fox how easily it can be done and he shall have tender young rabbit with his chicken said granny fox to herself  so first she studied and studied every clump of grass and every bush behind which she could creep she saw that she could get almost to where peter rabbit was sitting and never once show herself to him then she looked this way and looked that way to make sure that no one was watching her  no one did she see on the green meadows who was looking her way then granny fox began to crawl from one clump of grass to another and from bush to bush sometimes she wriggled along flat on her stomach little by little she was drawing nearer and nearer to peter rabbit  now with all her smartness old granny fox had forgotten one thing yes sir she had forgotten one thing never once had she thought to look up in the sky  and there was ol mistah buzzard sailing round and round and looking down and seeing all that was going on below  ol mistah buzzard is sharp he knew just what old granny fox was planning to doknew it as well as if he had read her thoughts his eyes twinkled  ah certnly cant allow lil brer rabbit to be hurt ah certnly cant muttered ol mistah buzzard and chuckled  then he slanted his broad wings downward and without a sound slid down out of the sky till he was right behind granny fox  do yo always crawl home granny fox asked ol mistah buzzard  granny fox was so startled for she hadnt heard a sound that she jumped almost out of her skin of course peter rabbit saw her then and was off like a shot  granny fox showed all her teeth i wish you would mind your own business mistah buzzard she snarled  certnly certnly ah sholy will replied ol mistah buzzard and sailed up into the blue blue sky     xii the lost chicken  when old granny fox had laid down the chicken she was bringing home to reddy fox to try to catch peter rabbit she had meant to go right back and get it as soon as she had caught peter now she saw peter going across the green meadows lippertylippertylip as fast as he could go she was so angry that she hopped up and down she tore up the grass and ground her long white teeth she glared up at ol mistah buzzard who had warned peter rabbit but all she could do was to scold and that didnt do her much good for in a few minutes ol mistah buzzard was so far up in the blue blue sky that he couldnt hear a word she was saying my my but old granny fox certainly was angry if she hadnt been so angry she might have seen johnny chuck lying as flat as he could make himself behind a big clump of grass  johnny chuck was scared yes indeed johnny chuck was dreadfully scared he had fought reddy fox and whipped him but he knew that old granny fox would be too much for him so it was with great relief that johnny chuck saw her stop tearing up the grass and trot over to see how reddy fox was getting along then johnny chuck crept along until he was far enough away to run how he did run he was so fat and rolypoly that he was all out of breath when he reached home and so tired that he just dropped down on his doorstep and panted  serves me right for having so much curiosity said johnny chuck to himself  reddy fox looked up as old granny fox came hurrying home he was weak and very very hungry but he felt sure that old granny fox would bring him something nice for his breakfast and as soon as he heard her footsteps his mouth began to water  did you bring me something nice granny asked reddy fox  now old granny fox had been so put out by the scare she had had and by her failure to catch peter rabbit that she had forgotten all about the chicken she had left up on the hill when reddy spoke she remembered it and the thought of having to go way back after it didnt improve her temper a bit  no she snapped i haventyou dont deserve any breakfast anyway if you had any gumptionthats the word granny fox used gumptionif you had any gumption at all you wouldnt have gotten in trouble and could get your own breakfast  reddy fox didnt know what gumption meant but he did know that he was very very hungry and do what he would he couldnt keep back a couple of big tears of disappointment granny fox saw them  there there reddy dont cry ive got a fine fat chicken for you up on the hill and ill run back and get it said granny fox  so off she started up the hill to the place where she had left the chicken when she started to try to catch peter rabbit when she got there there wasnt any chicken no sir there was no chicken at alljust a few feathers granny fox could hardly believe her own eyes she looked this way and she looked that way but there was no chicken just a few feathers old granny fox flew into a greater rage than before     xiii granny fox calls jimmy skunk names  granny fox couldnt believe her own eyes no sir she couldnt believe her own eyes and she rubbed them two or three times to make sure that she was seeing right that chicken certainly had disappeared and left no trace of where it had gone  it was very queer old granny fox sat down to think who would dare steal anything from her then she walked in a big circle with her nose to the ground sniffing and sniffing what was she doing that for why to see if she could find the tracks of anyone who might have stolen her chicken  aha exclaimed old granny fox starting to run along the top of the hill her nose to the ground aha ill catch him this time  in a few minutes she began to run more slowly and every two or three steps she would look ahead suddenly her eyes snapped and she began to creep almost flat on her stomach just as she had crept for peter rabbit but it wasnt peter rabbit this time it waswho do you think jimmy skunk yes sir it was jimmy skunk he was slowly ambling along for jimmy skunk never hurries every big stick or stone that he could move he would pull over or look under for jimmy skunk was hunting for beetles  old granny fox watched him he must have a tremendous appetite to be hunting for beetles after eating my chicken muttered she then she jumped out in front of jimmy skunk her eyes snapping her teeth showing and the hair on her back standing on end so as to make her look very fierce but all the time old granny fox took the greatest care not to get too near to jimmy skunk  wheres my chicken snarled old granny fox and she looked very very fierce  jimmy skunk looked up as if very much surprised hello granny fox he exclaimed have you lost a chicken  youve stolen it youre a thief jimmy skunk snapped granny fox       words can never make black white      before you speak be sure youre right  said jimmy skunk im not a thief  you are cried granny working herself into a great rage  im not  you are  all the time jimmy skunk was chuckling to himself and the more he chuckled the angrier grew old granny fox and all the time jimmy skunk kept moving toward old granny fox and granny fox kept backing away for like all the other little meadow and forest people she has very great respect for jimmy skunks little bag of scent  now backing off that way she couldnt see where she was going and the first thing she knew she had backed into a bramble bush it tore her skirts and scratched her legs ooch cried old granny fox  ha ha ha laughed jimmy skunk thats what you get for calling me names     xiv granny fox finds what became of the chicken  old granny fox was in a terrible temper dear dear it certainly was a dreadful temper jimmy skunk laughed at her and that made it worse when he saw this jimmy skunk just rolled over and over on the ground and shouted he was so tickled of course it wasnt the least bit nice of jimmy skunk but you know that granny fox had been calling jimmy a thief then jimmy doesnt like granny fox anyway nor do any of the other little meadow and forest people for most of them are very much afraid of her  when old granny fox finally got out of the bramble bush she didnt stop to say anything more to jimmy skunk but hurried away muttering and grumbling and grinding her teeth old granny fox wasnt pleasant to meet just then and when bobby coon saw her coming he just thought it best to get out of her way so he climbed a tree  it wasnt that bobby coon was afraid of old granny fox bless you no bobby coon isnt a bit afraid of her it was because he had a full stomach and was feeling too goodnatured and lazy to quarrel  good morning granny fox i hope you are feeling well this morning said bobby coon as old granny fox came trotting under the tree he was sitting in granny fox looked up and glared at him with yellow eyes  it isnt a good morning and im not feeling fine she snapped  my goodness how you have torn your skirts exclaimed bobby coon  old granny fox started to say something unpleasant then she changed her mind and instead she sat down and told bobby coon all her troubles as she talked bobby coon kept ducking his head behind a branch of the tree to hide a smile finally granny fox noticed it  what do you keep ducking your head for bobby coon she asked suspiciously  im just looking to see if i can see any feathers from that chicken replied bobby coon gravely though his eyes were twinkling with mischief  well do you demanded old granny fox  and just then bobby coon did they were not on the ground however but floating in the air bobby coon leaned out to see where they came from and granny fox turned to look too what do you think they saw why sitting on a tall dead tree was mr goshawk just then swallowing the last of grannys chicken  thief thief robber robber shrieked old granny fox  but mr goshawk said nothing just winked at bobby coon puffed out his feathers and settled himself for a comfortable nap     xv reddy fox has a visitor  hardly was old granny fox out of sight on her way to hunt for the chicken she had left on the hill when unc billy possum came strolling along the lone little path he was humming to himself for he had just had a good breakfast one of the merry little breezes spied him and hurried to meet him and tell him about how reddy fox had been shot  unc billy listened and the grin with which he had greeted the merry little breeze grew into a broad smile  are yo all sure about that he asked  the merry little breeze was sure  unc billy possum stopped for a few minutes and considered  serves that no count reddy fox right chuckled unc billy he done spoil mah hunting at farmer browns he raised such a fuss among the hens up there tisnt safe to go there any mo no suh tisnt safe and it wont be safe for a right smart while did yo say that granny fox is home  the merry little breeze hadnt said anything about granny fox but now remembered that she had gone up the hill  ah believe ah will just tote my sympathy over to reddy fox said unc billy possum as he started in the direction of reddy foxs house but he made sure that old granny fox was not at home before he showed himself reddy fox lay on his doorstep he was sick and sore and stiff indeed he was so stiff he couldnt walk at all and he was weakweak and hungry dreadfully hungry when he heard footsteps he thought old granny fox was bringing him the chicken after which she had gone he felt too ill even to turn his head  did you get the chicken granny he asked weakly no one answered i say did you get the chicken granny reddys voice sounded a little sharp and cross as he asked this time  still there was no reply and reddy began to be a little bit suspicious he turned over and raised his head to look instead of old granny fox there was unc billy possum grinning at him       smarty smarty is a thief       smarty smarty came to grief       tried to show off just for fun       and ran too near a loaded gun  yo all certainly has got just what yo deserve and ahm glad of it ahm glad of it suh said unc billy possum severely  an angry light came into the eyes of reddy fox and made them an ugly yellow for just a minute but he felt too sick to quarrel unc billy possum saw this he saw how reddy was really suffering and down deep in his heart unc billy was truly sorry for him but he didnt let reddy know it no indeed he just pretended to be tickled to death to see reddy fox so helpless he didnt dare stay long for fear granny fox would return so after saying a few more things to make reddy feel uncomfortable unc billy started off up the lone little path toward the green forest  too bad too bad he muttered to himself if ol granny fox isnt smart enough to get reddy enough to eat ahll have to see what wealls can do ah certnly will     xvi unc billy possum visits the smiling pool  joe otter and billy mink were sitting on the big rock in the smiling pool because they had nothing else to do they were planning mischief jerry muskrat was busy filling his new house with food for the winter he was too busy to get into mischief  suddenly billy mink put a finger on his lips as a warning to little joe otter to keep perfectly still billys sharp eyes had seen something moving over in the bulrushes together he and little joe otter watched ready to dive into the smiling pool at the first sign of danger in a few minutes the rushes parted and a sharp little old face peered out little joe otter and billy mink each sighed with relief and their eyes began to dance hi unc billy possum shouted billy mink  a grin crept over the sharp little old face peering out from the bulrushes  hi yoself he shouted for it really was unc billy possum  what are you doing over here called little joe otter  just alooking round replied unc billy possum his eyes twinkling  have you heard about reddy fox shouted billy mink  ah done jes come from his home replied unc billy possum  how is he asked little joe otter  poly he sholy is poly replied unc billy possum shaking his head soberly then unc billy told billy mink and little joe otter how reddy fox was so stiff and sore and sick that he couldnt get anything to eat for himself and how old granny fox had lost a chicken which she had caught for him  serves him right exclaimed billy mink who has never forgotten how reddy fox fooled him and caught the most fish once upon a time  unc billy nodded his head yo are right yo certnly are right yes suh ah reckons yo are right was yo ever hungry billy minkreal hungry asked unc billy possum  billy mink thought of the time when he went without his dinner because mr night heron had gobbled it up when billy had left it in a temper he nodded his head  ah was just awondering continued une billy possum how it would seem to be right smart powerful hungry and not be able to hunt fo anything to eat  for a few minutes no one said a word then billy mink stood up and stretched goodby said billy mink  where are you going so suddenly demanded little joe otter  im going to catch a fish and take it up to reddy fox if you must know snapped billy mink  good cried little joe otter you neednt think that you can have all the fun to yourself either billy mink im going with you  there was a splash in the smiling pool and unc billy possum was left looking out on nothing but the smiling pool and the big rock he smiled to himself as he turned away ah reckon ahll sho have to do my share too said he  and so it happened that when old granny fox finally reached home with nothing but a little wood mouse for reddy she found him taking a nap his stomach as full as it could be and just a little way off were two fish tails and the feathers of a little duck     xvii farmer browns boy is determined  farmer browns boy had made up his mind when he shut his teeth with a click and drew his lips together into a thin straight line those who knew him were sure that farmer browns boy had made up his mind that is just what he had done now he was cleaning his gun and as he worked he was thinking of his pet chicken and of all the other chickens that reddy fox had taken  im going to get that fox if it takes all summer exclaimed farmer browns boy i ought to have gotten him the other day when i had a shot at him next time well well see mr fox what will happen next time  now someone heard farmer browns boy heard everything he said though farmer browns boy didnt know it it was unc billy possum who was hiding in the very pile of wood on which farmer browns boy was sitting unc billy pricked up his ears  he didnt like the tone of voice in which farmer browns boy spoke he thought of reddy fox still so stiff and sore and lame that he could hardly walk all from the shot which farmer browns boy thought had missed  there isnt gwine to be any next time no suh there isnt gwine to be any next time ah sholy doan love reddy fox but ah cant nohow let him be shot again ah certnly cant muttered unc billy possum to himself  of course farmer browns boy didnt hear him he didnt hear him and he didnt see him when unc billy possum crept out of the back side of the woodpile and scurried under the henhouse he was too intent on his plan to catch reddy fox  im just going to hunt over the green meadows and through the green forest until i get that fox said farmer browns boy and as he said it he looked very fierce as if he really meant it im not going to have my chickens stolen any more no siree that fox has got a home somewhere on the green meadows or in the green forest and im going to find it then watch out mr fox  farmer browns boy whistled for bowser the hound and started for the green forest  unc billy possum poked his sharp little old face out from under the henhouse and watched them go usually unc billy is grinning but now there wasnt any grin not the least sign of one instead unc billy possum looked worried  there goes that boy with a gun and nobody knows whatll happen when it goes off if he cant find reddy fox just as likely as not hell point it at somebody else just fo fun ah hope he doan meet up with mah ol woman or any of mah lil pickaninnies ahm plumb afraid of a boy with a gun ah am pears like he doan have any sense ah reckon ah better be moving along right smart and tell mah family to stay right close in the ol hollow tree muttered unc billy possum slipping out from his hiding place then unc billy began to run as fast as he could toward the green forest     xviii the hunt for reddy fox  trouble trouble trouble i feel it in the air trouble trouble trouble its round me everywhere  old granny fox muttered this over and over as she kept walking around uneasily and sniffing the air  i dont see any trouble and i dont feel any trouble in the air its all in the sore places where i was shot said reddy fox who was stretched out on the doorstep of their home  thats because you havent got any sense when you do get some and learn to look where you are going you wont get shot from behind old tree trunks and you will be able to feel trouble when it is near without waiting for it to show itself now i feel trouble you go down into the house and stay there granny fox stopped to test the air with her nose just as she had been testing it for the last ten minutes  i dont want to go in whined reddy fox its nice and warm out here and i feel a lot better than when i am curled up way down there in the dark  old granny fox turned and her eyes blazed as she looked at reddy fox she didnt say a word she didnt have to reddy just crawled into his house muttering to himself granny stuck her head in at the door  dont you come out until i come back she ordered then she added farmer browns boy is coming with his gun  reddy fox shivered when he heard that he didnt believe granny fox he thought she was saying that just to scare him and make him stay inside but he shivered just the same you see he knew now what it meant to be shot for he was still too stiff and sore to run all because he had gone too near farmer browns boy and his gun  but old granny fox had not been fooling when she told reddy fox that farmer browns boy was coming with a gun it was true he was coming down the lone little path and ahead of him was trotting bowser the hound how did old granny fox know it she just felt it she didnt hear them she didnt see them and she didnt smell them she just felt that they were coming so as soon as she saw that reddy fox had obeyed her she was off like a little red flash  it wont do to let them find our home said granny to herself as she disappeared in the green forest  first she hurried to a little point on the hill where she could look down the lone little path just as she expected she saw farmer browns boy and ahead of him sniffing at every bush and all along the lone little path was bowser the hound old granny fox waited to see no more she ran as fast as she could in a big circle which brought her out on the lone little path below farmer browns boy and bowser the hound but where they couldnt see her because of a turn in the lone little path she trotted down the lone little path a very little way and then turned into the woods and hurried back up the hill where she sat down and waited in a few minutes she heard bowsers great voice he had smelled her track in the lone little path and was following it old granny fox grinned you see she was planning to lead them far far away from the home where reddy fox was hiding for it would not do to have them find it  and farmer browns boy also grinned as he heard the voice of bowser the hound  ill hunt that fox until i get him he said you see he didnt know anything about old granny fox he thought bowser was following reddy fox     xix unc billy possum gives warning  whats the matter with you unc billy you look as if you had lost your last friend it was jimmy skunk who spoke  unc billy possum stopped short he had been hurrying so fast that he hadnt seen jimmy skunk at all  matter enuff suh matter enuff said unc billy possum when he could get his breath do you hear that noise  sure i hear that noise thats only bowser the hound chasing old granny fox when she gets tired shell lose him replied jimmy skunk what are you worrying about bowser the hound for  bowser the hound will have to be smarter than he is now befo he can worry me ah reckon said unc billy possum scornfully it isnt bowser the hound its farmer browns boy and his gun then unc billy told jimmy skunk how he had been hiding in the woodpile at farmer browns and had heard farmer browns boy say that he was going to hunt over the green meadows and through the green forest until he got reddy fox  what of it asked jimmy skunk if he gets reddy fox so much the better reddy always did make trouble for other people i dont see what youre worrying about reddy fox for hes big enough to take care of himself  yo certnly are plumb slow in your wits this morning jimmy skunk yo certnly are plumb slow supposing yo should meet up with farmer browns boy with that gun in his hands and supposing he had grown tired of watching fo reddy fox that gun might go off jimmy skunk it might go off when it was pointing right straight at yo said unc billy possum  jimmy skunk looked serious thats so unc billy thats so he said boys with guns do get dreadfully careless dreadfully careless they dont seem to think anything about the feelings of those likely to get hurt when the gun goes off what was you thinking of doing unc billy  just passing the word along so everybody in the green meadows and in the green forest will keep out of the way of farmer browns boy replied unc billy possum  good idea unc billy ill help you said jimmy skunk  so unc billy possum went one way and jimmy skunk went another way and everyone they told hurried to tell someone else happy jack squirrel told chatterer the red squirrel chatterer told striped chipmunk and striped chipmunk told danny meadow mouse danny meadow mouse told johnny chuck johnny chuck told peter rabbit peter rabbit told jumper the hare jumper the hare told prickly porky prickly porky told bobby coon bobby coon told billy mink billy mink told little joe otter little joe otter told jerry muskrat and jerry muskrat told grandfather frog and everybody hastened to hide from farmer browns boy and his terrible gun  by and by farmer browns boy noticed how still it was in the green forest nowhere did he see or hear a bird nowhere could he catch a glimpse of anybody who wore fur  that fox must have scared away all the other animals and driven away all the birds ill get him see if i dont muttered farmer browns boy and never once guessed that they were hiding from him     xx old granny fox makes a mistake  old granny fox was running through the overgrown old pasture way up back of farmer browns she was cross and tired and hot for it was a very warm day behind her came bowser the hound his nose in grannys tracks and making a great noise with his big voice granny fox was cross because she was tired she hadnt done much running lately she didnt mind running when the weather was cold but nowoh dear it is hot sighed old granny fox as she stopped a minute to rest  now old granny fox is very very smart and very very wise she knows all the tricks with which foxes fool those who try to catch them she knew that she could fool bowser the hound and puzzle him so that he wouldnt be able to follow her track at all but she wasnt ready to do that yet no indeed old granny fox was taking great care to see that her tracks were easy to follow she wanted bowser the hound to follow them although it made her tired and hot and cross why did she well you see she was trying to lead him and with him farmer browns boy far far away from the home where reddy fox was nursing the wounds that he had received when farmer browns boy had shot at him a few days before  bow wow wow roared bowser the hound following every twist and turn which granny fox made just as she wanted him to back and forth across the old pasture and way up among the rocks on the edge of the mountain granny fox led bowser the hound it was a long long long way from the green meadows and the green forest granny fox had made it a long way purposely she was willing to be tired herself if she could also tire bowser the hound and farmer browns boy she wanted to tire them so that when she finally puzzled and fooled them and left them there they would be too tired to go back to the green meadows  by and by granny fox came to a hole in the ground an old house that had once belonged to her grandfather now this old house had a back door hidden close beside the hollow trunk of a fallen tree old granny fox just ran through the house out the back door through the hollow tree and then jumped into a little brook where there was hardly more than enough water to wet her feet walking in the water she left no scent in her tracks  bowser the hound came roaring up to the front door of the old house grannys tracks led right inside and bowser grew so excited that he made a tremendous noise at last he had found where granny fox lived at least he thought he had he was sure that she was inside for there were her fresh tracks going inside and none coming out bowser the hound never once thought of looking for a back door if he had he wouldnt have been any the wiser because you know old granny fox had slipped away through the hollow tree trunk  granny fox grinned as she listened to the terrible fuss bowser was making then when she had rested a little she stole up on the hill where she could look down and see the entrance to the old deserted house she watched bowser digging and barking after a while a worried look crept into the face of old granny fox  wheres farmer browns boy i thought surely he would follow bowser the hound she muttered     xxi reddy fox disobeys  when old granny fox had sent reddy fox into the house and told him to stay there until she returned home he had not wanted to mind but he knew that granny fox meant just what she said and so he had crawled slowly down the long hall to the bedroom way underground  pretty soon reddy fox heard a voice it was very faint for you know reddy was in his bedroom way underground but he knew it he pricked up his ears and listened it was the voice of bowser the hound and reddy knew by the sound that bowser was chasing granny fox  reddy grinned he wasnt at all worried about granny fox not the least little bit he knew how smart she was and that whenever she wanted to she could get rid of bowser the hound then a sudden thought popped into reddys head and he grew sober  granny did feel trouble coming just as she said he thought  then reddy fox curled himself up and tried to sleep he intended to mind and not put his little black nose outside until old granny fox returned but somehow reddy couldnt get to sleep his bedroom was small and he was so stiff and sore that he could not get comfortable he twisted and turned and fidgeted the more he fidgeted the more uncomfortable he grew he thought of the warm sunshine outside and how comfortable he would be stretched out full length on the doorstep it would take the soreness out of his legs something must have happened to granny to keep her so long if she had known that she was going to be gone such a long time she wouldnt have told him to stay until she came back thought reddy  by and by reddy fox crept a little way up the long dark hall he could just see the sunlight on the doorstep pretty soon he went a little bit nearer he wasnt going to disobey old granny fox oh no no indeed she had told him to stay in the house until she returned she hadnt said that he couldnt look out reddy crawled a little nearer to the open door and the sunlight  granny fox is getting old and timid just as if my eyes arent as sharp as hers id like to see farmer browns boy get near me when i am really on the watch said reddy fox to himself and then he crept a little nearer to the open door  how bright and warm and pleasant it did look outside reddy just knew that he would feel ever and ever so much better if he could stretch out on the doorstep he could hear jenny wren fussing and scolding at someone or something and he wondered what it could be he crept just a wee bit nearer he could hear bowsers voice but it was so faint that he had to prick up his sharp little ears and listen with all his might to hear it at all  grannys led them way off on the mountain good old granny thought reddy fox then he crawled right up to the very doorway he could still hear jenny wren scolding and fussing  what does ail her        if its hot or if its cold       jenny wren will always scold       from morn till night the whole day long       her limber tongue is going strong  im going to find out what it means said reddy talking to himself  reddy fox poked his head out andlooked straight into the freckled face of farmer browns boy and the muzzle of that dreadful gun     xxii ol mistah buzzards keen sight  old granny fox had thought that when she fooled bowser the hound up in the old pasture on the edge of the mountain she could take her time going home she was tired and hot and she had planned to pick out the shadiest paths going back she had thought that farmer browns boy would soon join bowser the hound when bowser made such a fuss about having found the old house into which granny fox had run  but farmer browns boy had not yet appeared and granny fox was getting worried could it be that he had not followed bowser the hound after all granny fox went out on a high point and looked but she could see nothing of farmer browns boy and his gun just then ol mistah buzzard came sailing down out of the blue blue sky and settled himself on a tall dead tree now granny fox hadnt forgotten how ol mistah buzzard had warned peter rabbit just as she was about to pounce on him but she suddenly thought that ol mistah buzzard might be of use to her  so old granny fox smoothed out her skirts and walked over to the foot of the tree where ol mistah buzzard sat  how do you do today neighbor buzzard inquired granny fox smiling up at ol mistah buzzard  ahm so as to be up and about thank yo replied ol mistah buzzard spreading his wings out so that air could blow under them  my exclaimed old granny fox what splendid great wings you have mistah buzzard it must be grand to be able to fly i suppose you can see a great deal from way up there in the blue blue sky mistah buzzard  ol mistah buzzard felt flattered yes said he ah can see all thats going on on the green meadows and in the green forest  oh mistah buzzard you dont really mean that exclaimed old granny fox just as if she wanted to believe it but couldnt  yes ah can replied ol mistah buzzard  really mistah buzzard really oh i cant believe that your eyes are so sharp as all that now i know where bowser the hound is and where farmer browns boy is but i dont believe you can see them said granny fox  ol mistah buzzard never said a word but spread his broad wings and in a few minutes he had sailed up up up until he looked like just a tiny speck to old granny fox now old granny fox had not told the truth when she said she knew where farmer browns boy was she thought she would trick ol mistah buzzard into telling her  in a few minutes down came ol mistah buzzard bowser the hound is up in the old back pasture said he  right cried old granny fox clapping her hands and where is farmer browns boy  farmer browns boy is ol mistah buzzard paused  where where asked granny fox so eagerly that ol mistah buzzard looked at her sharply  yo said you knew so whats the use of telling yo said ol mistah buzzard then he added but if ah was yo ah certnly would get home right smart soon  why do do tell me what you saw mistah buzzard begged granny fox  but ol mistah buzzard wouldnt say another word so old granny fox started for home as fast as she could run  oh dear i do hope reddy fox minded me and stayed in the house she muttered     xxii granny fox has a terrible scare  old granny fox felt her heart sink way down to her toes for she felt sure ol mistah buzzard had seen farmer browns boy and his gun over near the house where reddy fox was nursing his wounds or he wouldnt have advised her to hurry home she was already very tired and hot from the long run to lead bowser the hound away from the green meadows she had thought to walk home along shady paths and cool off but now she must run faster than ever for she must know if farmer browns boy had found her house  its lucky i told reddy fox to go inside and not come out till i returned its very lucky i did that thought granny fox as she ran presently she heard voices singing they seemed to be in the treetops over her head        happily we dance and play       all the livelong sunny day       happily we run and race       and win or lose with smiling face  granny fox knew the voices and she looked up just as she expected she saw the merry little breezes of old mother west wind playing among the leaves just then one of them looked down and saw her  theres old granny fox just see how hot and tired she looks lets go down and cool her off shouted the merry little breeze  in a flash they were all down out of the treetops and dancing around old granny fox cooling her off of course granny fox kept right on running she was too worried not to but the merry little breezes kept right beside her and it was not nearly as hard running now as it had been  have you seen farmer browns boy panted granny fox  oh yes we saw him just a little while ago over near your house granny fox we pulled his hat off just to hear him scold shouted the merry little breezes and then they tickled and laughed as if they had had a good time with farmer browns boy  but old granny fox didnt laughoh my no indeed her heart went lower still and she did her best to run faster pretty soon she came out on the top of the hill where she could look and then it seemed as if her heart came right up in her mouth and stopped beating her eyes popped almost out of her head there was farmer browns boy standing right in front of the door of her home and while she was watching what should reddy fox do but stick his head out the door  old granny fox saw the gun of farmer browns boy pointed right at reddy and she clapped both hands over her eyes to shut out the dreadful sight then she waited for the bang of the gun it didnt come then granny peeped through her fingers farmer browns boy was still there but reddy fox had disappeared inside the house  granny fox sighed in relief it had been a terrible scare the worst she could remember     xxiv granny and reddy have to move  i dont want to move whined reddy fox im too sore to walk  old granny fox gave him a shove you go along and do as i say she snapped if you had minded me we wouldnt have to move its all your own fault the wonder is that you werent killed when you poked your head out right in front of farmer browns boy now that he knows where we live he will give us no peace move along lively now this is the best home i have ever had and now ive got to leave it oh dear oh dear  reddy fox hobbled along up the long hall and out the front door he was walking on three legs and at every step he made a face because you know it hurt so to walk  the little stars looking down from the sky saw reddy fox limp out the door of the house he had lived in so long and right behind him came old granny fox granny sighed and wiped away a tear as she said goodby to her old home reddy fox was thinking too much of his own troubles to notice how badly granny fox was feeling every few steps he had to sit down and rest because it hurt him so to walk  i dont see the use of moving tonight anyway it would be a lot easier and pleasanter when the sun is shining this night air makes me so stiff that i know i never will get over it grumbled reddy fox  old granny fox listened to him for a while and then she lost patience yes sir granny fox lost patience she boxed reddy fox first on one ear and then on the other reddy began to snivel  stop that said granny fox sharply do you want all the neighbors to know that we have got to move theyll find it out soon enough now come along without any more fuss if you dont ill just go off and leave you to shift for yourself then how will you get anything to eat  reddy fox wiped his eyes on his coat sleeve and hobbled along as best he could granny fox would run a little way ahead to see that the way was safe and then come back for reddy poor reddy he did his best not to complain but it was such hard work and somehow reddy fox didnt believe that it was at all necessary he had been terribly frightened when he had disobeyed granny fox that afternoon and put his head out the door only to look right into the freckled face of farmer browns boy he had ducked back out of sight again too quickly for farmer browns boy to shoot and now he couldnt see why old granny fox wanted to move that very night  shes getting old shes getting old and timid and fussy muttered reddy fox as he hobbled along behind her  it seemed to reddy as if they had walked miles and miles he really thought that they had been walking nearly all night when old granny fox stopped in front of the worstlooking old fox house reddy had ever seen  here we are said she  what are we going to live in that thing cried reddy it isnt fit for any respectable fox to put his nose into  it is where i was born snapped old granny fox if you want to keep out of harms way dont go to putting on airs now        who scorns the simple things of life         and tilts his nose at all he sees       is almost sure to feel the knife         of want cut through his pleasant ease  now dont let me hear another word from you but get inside at once  reddy fox didnt quite understand all granny fox said but he knew when she was to be obeyed and so he crawled gingerly through the brokendown doorway     xxv peter rabbit makes a discovery  hardly had jolly round red mr sun thrown off his nightcap and come out from his home behind the purple hills for his daily climb up in the blue blue sky when farmer browns boy started down the lone little path through the green forest  peter rabbit who had been out all night and was just then on his way home saw him peter stopped and sat up to rub his eyes and look again he wasnt quite sure that he had seen aright the first time but he had there was farmer browns boy sure enough and at his heels trotted bowser the hound  peter rabbit rubbed his eyes once more and wrinkled up his eyebrows farmer browns boy certainly had a gun over one shoulder and a spade over the other where could he be going down the lone little path with a spade farmer browns garden certainly was not in that direction peter watched him out of sight and then he hurried down to the green meadows to tell johnny chuck what he had seen my how peters long legs did fly he was so excited that he had forgotten how sleepy he had felt a few minutes before  halfway down to johnny chucks house peter rabbit almost ran plump into bobby coon and jimmy skunk who had been quarreling and were calling each other names they stopped when they saw peter rabbit        peter rabbit runs away         from his shadder so they say       peter peter what a sight         tell us why this sudden fright  shouted bobby coon  peter rabbit stopped short indeed he stopped so short that he almost turned a somersault say he panted ive just seen farmer browns boy  you dont say so said jimmy skunk pretending to be very much surprised you dont say so why now i think of it i believe ive seen farmer browns boy a few times myself  peter rabbit made a goodnatured face at jimmy skunk and then he told all about how he had seen farmer browns boy with gun and spade and bowser the hound going down the lone little path you know there isnt any garden down that way he concluded  bobby coons face wore a sober look yes sir all the fun was gone from bobby coons face  whats the matter asked jimmy skunk  i was just thinking that reddy fox lives over in that direction and he is so stiff that he cannot run replied bobby coon  jimmy skunk hitched up his trousers and started toward the lone little path come on said he lets follow him and see what he is about  bobby coon followed at once but peter rabbit said he would hurry over and get johnny chuck and then join the others  all this time farmer browns boy had been hurrying down the lone little path to the home old granny fox and reddy fox had moved out of the night before of course he didnt know that they had moved he put down his gun and by the time jimmy skunk and bobby coon and peter rabbit and johnny chuck reached a place where they could peep out and see what was going on he had dug a great hole  oh cried peter rabbit hes digging into the house of reddy fox and hell catch poor reddy     xxvi farmer browns boy works for nothing  the grass around the doorstep of the house where reddy fox had always lived was all wet with dew when farmer browns boy laid his gun down took off his coat rolled up his shirt sleeves and picked up his spade it was cool and beautiful there on the edge of the green meadows jolly round red mr sun had just begun his long climb up in the blue blue sky mr redwing was singing for joy over in the bulrushes on the edge of the smiling pool yes it was very beautiful very beautiful indeed it didnt seem as if harm could come to anyone on such a beautiful morning  but there was farmer browns boy he had crawled on his hands and knees without making a sound to get near enough to the home of reddy fox to shoot if reddy was outside but there was no sign of reddy so farmer browns boy had hopped up and now he was whistling as he began to dig his freckled face looked goodnatured it didnt seem as if he could mean harm to anyone  but there lay the gun and he was working as if he meant to get to the very bottom of reddy foxs home  deeper and deeper grew the hole and bigger and bigger grew the pile of sand which he threw out he didnt know that anyone was watching him except bowser the hound he didnt see johnny chuck peeping from behind a tall bunch of meadow grass or peter rabbit peeping from behind a tree on the edge of the green forest or bobby coon looking from a safe hiding place in the top of that same tree he didnt see jimmy skunk or unc billy possum or happy jack squirrel or digger the badger he didnt see one of them but they saw him they saw every shovelful of sand that he threw and their hearts went pitapat as they watched for each one felt sure that something dreadful was going to happen to reddy fox  only ol mistah buzzard knew better from way up high in the blue blue sky he could look down and see many things he could see all the little meadow and forest people who were watching farmer browns boy the harder farmer browns boy worked the more ol mistah buzzard chuckled to himself what was he laughing at why he could see the sharp face of old granny fox peeping out from behind an old fence corner and she was grinning so ol mistah buzzard knew reddy fox was safe  but the other little people of the green forest and the green meadows didnt know that old granny fox and reddy fox had moved and their faces grew longer and longer as they watched farmer browns boy go deeper and deeper into the ground  reddy fox has worried me almost to death and would eat me if he could catch me but somehow things wouldnt be quite the same without him around oh dear i dont want him killed moaned peter rabbit  perhaps he isnt home said jimmy skunk  of course hes home hes so stiff and sore he can hardly walk at all and has to stay home replied johnny chuck hello whats the matter now  everybody looked farmer browns boy had climbed out of the hole he looked tired and cross he rested for a few minutes and as he rested he scowled then he began to shovel the sand back into the hole he had reached the bottom and found no one there  hurrah shouted peter rabbit and struck his heels together as he jumped up in the air  and the others were just as glad as peter rabbit johnny chuck was especially glad for you see farmer browns boy had once found johnnys snug home and johnny had had to move as suddenly as did granny and reddy fox johnny knew just how reddy must feel for he had had many narrow escapes in his short life you can read all about them in the next book the adventures of johnny chuck
