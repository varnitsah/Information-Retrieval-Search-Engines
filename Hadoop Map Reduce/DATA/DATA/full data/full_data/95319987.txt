pied piper of hamelin   i        hamelin towns in brunswick     by famous hanover city       the river weser deep and wide       washes its wall on the southern side       a pleasanter spot you never spied     but when begins my ditty       almost five hundred years ago       to see the townsfolk suffer so         from vermin was a pity   ii        rats     they fought the dogs and killed the cats       and bit the babies in the cradles       and ate the cheeses out of the vats       and licked the soup from the cooks own ladles     split open the kegs of salted sprats     made nests inside mens sunday hats     and even spoiled the womens chats       by drowning their speaking       with shrieking and squeaking     in fifty different sharps and flats   iii      at last the people in a body         to the town hall came flocking     tis clear cried they our mayors a noddy         and as for our corporationshocking     to think we buy gowns lined with ermine     for dolts that cant or wont determine     whats best to rid us of our vermin     you hope because youre old and obese     to find in the furry civic robe ease     rouse up sirs give your brains a racking     to find the remedy were lacking     or sure as fate well send you packing     at this the mayor and corporation     quaked with a mighty consternation   iv      an hour they sate in council       at length the mayor broke silence     for a guilder id my ermine gown sell       i wish i were a mile hence     its easy to bid one rack ones brain     im sure my poor head aches again     ive scratched it so and all in vain     oh for a trap a trap a trap     just as he said this what should hap     at the chamber door but a gentle tap     bless us cried the mayor whats that     with the corporation as he sat     looking little though wondrous fat     nor brighter was his eye nor moister     than a toolongopened oyster     save when at noon his paunch grew mutinous     for a plate of turtle green and glutinous     only a scraping of shoes on the mat     anything like the sound of a rat     makes my heart go pitapat   v      come inthe mayor cried looking bigger     and in did come the strangest figure     his queer long coat from heel to head     was half of yellow and half of red     and he himself was tall and thin     with sharp blue eyes each like a pin     and light loose hair yet swarthy skin     no tuft on cheek nor beard on chin     but lips where smile went out and in     there was no guessing his kith and kin     and nobody could enough admire     the tall man and his quaint attire     quoth one its as my greatgrandsire     starting up at the trump of dooms tone     had walked this way from his painted tombstone   vi      he advanced to the counciltable     and please your honours said he im able     by means of a secret charm to draw     all creatures living beneath the sun     that creep or swim or fly or run     after me so as you never saw     and i chiefly use my charm     on creatures that do people harm     the mole and toad and newt and viper     and people call me the pied piper     and here they noticed round his neck     a scarf of red and yellow stripe     to match with his coat of the selfsame cheque     and at the scarfs end hung a pipe     and his fingers they noticed were ever straying     as if impatient to be playing     upon his pipe as low it dangled     over his vesture so oldfangled     yet said he poor piper as i am     in tartary i freed the cham     last june from his huge swarms of gnats     i eased in asia the nizam     of a monstrous brood of vampyrebats     and as for what your brain bewilders     if i can rid your town of rats     will you give me a thousand guilders     one fifty thousandwas the exclamation     of the astonished mayor and corporation   vii      into the street the piper stept       smiling first a little smile     as if he knew what magic slept       in his quiet pipe the while     then like a musical adept     to blow the pipe his lips he wrinkled     and green and blue his sharp eyes twinkled     like a candleflame where salt is sprinkled     and ere three shrill notes the pipe uttered     you heard as if an army muttered     and the muttering grew to a grumbling     and the grumbling grew to a mighty rumbling     and out of the houses the rats came tumbling     great rats small rats lean rats brawny rats     brown rats black rats grey rats tawny rats     grave old plodders gay young friskers       fathers mothers uncles cousins     cocking tails and pricking whiskers       families by tens and dozens     brothers sisters husbands wives     followed the piper for their lives     from street to street he piped advancing     and step for step they followed dancing     until they came to the river weser     wherein all plunged and perished     save one who stout as julius c√¶sar     swam across and lived to carry     as he the manuscript he cherished     to ratland home his commentary     which was at the first shrill notes of the pipe     i heard a sound as of scraping tripe     and putting apples wondrous ripe     into a ciderpresss gripe     and a moving away of pickletubboards     and a leaving ajar of conservecupboards     and a drawing the corks of trainoilflasks     and a breaking the hoops of buttercasks     and it seemed as if a voice     sweeter far than by harp or by psaltery     is breathed called out oh rats rejoice     the world is grown to one vast drysaltery     so munch on crunch on take your nuncheon     breakfast supper dinner luncheon     and just as a bulky sugarpuncheon     all ready staved like a great sun shone     glorious scarce an inch before me     just as methought it said come bore me     i found the weser rolling oer me   viii      you should have heard the hamelin people     ringing the bells till they rocked the steeple     go cried the mayor and get long poles     poke out the nests and block up the holes     consult with carpenters and builders     and leave in our town not even a trace     of the ratswhen suddenly up the face     of the piper perked in the marketplace     with a first if you please my thousand guilders   ix      a thousand guilders the mayor looked blue     so did the corporation too     for council dinners made rare havoc     with claret moselle vindegrave hock     and half the money would replenish     their cellars biggest butt with rhenish     to pay this sum to a wandering fellow     with a gipsy coat of red and yellow     beside quoth the mayor with a knowing wink     our business was done at the rivers brink     we saw with our eyes the vermin sink     and whats dead cant come to life i think     so friend were not the folks to shrink     from the duty of giving you something to drink     and a matter of money to put in your poke     but as for the guilders what we spoke     of them as you very well know was in joke     beside our losses have made us thrifty     a thousand guilders come take fifty   x      the pipers face fell and he cried     no trifling i cant wait beside     ive promised to visit by dinnertime     bagdad and accept the prime     of the headcooks pottage all hes rich in     for having left in the caliphs kitchen     of a nest of scorpions no survivor     with him i proved no bargaindriver     with you dont think ill bate a stiver     and folks who put me in a passion     may find me pipe after another fashion   xi      how cried the mayor d ye think i brook     being worse treated than a cook     insulted by a lazy ribald     with idle pipe and vesture piebald     you threaten us fellow do your worst     blow your pipe there till you burst   xii      once more he stept into the street       and to his lips again     laid his long pipe of smooth straight cane       and ere he blew three notes                                      such sweet     soft notes as yet musicians cunning       never gave the enraptured air     there was a rustling     that seemed like a bustling     of merry crowds justling at pitching and hustling     small feet were pattering wooden shoes clattering     little hands clapping and little tongues chattering     and like fowls in a farmyard when barley is scattering     out came the children running     all the little boys and girls     with rosy cheeks and flaxen curls     and sparkling eyes and teeth like pearls     tripping     and skipping     ran merrily after     the wonderful music with shouting and laughter   xiii      the mayor was dumb and the council stood     as if they were changed into blocks of wood     unable to move a step or cry     to the children merrily skipping by     could only follow with the eye     that joyous crowd at the pipers back     but how the mayor was on the rack     and the wretched councils bosoms beat     as the piper turned from the high street     to where the weser rolled its waters     right in the way of their sons and daughters     however he turned from south to west     and to koppelberg hill his steps addressed     and after him the children pressed     great was the joy in every breast     he never can cross that mighty top     hes forced to let the piping drop     and we shall see our children stop     when lo as they reached the mountainside     a wondrous portal opened wide     as if a cavern was suddenly hollowed     and the piper advanced and the children followed     and when all were in to the very last     the door in the mountain side shut fast     did i say all no one was lame     and could not dance the whole of the way     and in after years if you would blame     his sadness he was used to say     its dull in our town since my playmates left     i cant forget that im bereft     of all the pleasant sights they see     which the piper also promised me     for he led us he said to a joyous land     joining the town and just at hand     where waters gushed and fruittrees grew     and flowers put forth a fairer hue     and everything was strange and new     the sparrows were brighter than peacocks here     and their dogs outran our fallow deer     and honeybees had lost their stings     and horses were born with eagles wings     and just as i became assured     my lame foot would be speedily cured     the music stopped and i stood still     and found myself outside the hill     left alone against my will     to go now limping as before     and never hear of that country more   xiv      alas alas for hamelin       there came into many a burghers pate       a text which says that heavens gate       opes to the rich at as easy rate     as the needles eye takes a camel in     the mayor sent east west north and south     to offer the piper by word of mouth       wherever it was mens lot to find him     silver and gold to his hearts content     if hed only return the way he went       and bring the children behind him     but when they saw twas a lost endeavour     and piper and dancers were gone for ever     they made a decree that lawyers never       should think their records dated duly     if after the day of the month and year     these words did not as well appear     and so long after what happened here       on the twentysecond of july     thirteen hundred and seventysix     and the better in memory to fix     the place of the childrens last retreat     they called it the pied pipers street     where any one playing on pipe or tabor     was sure for the future to lose his labour     nor suffered they hostelry or tavern       to shock with mirth a street so solemn     but opposite the place of the cavern       they wrote the story on a column     and on the great churchwindow painted     the same to make the world acquainted     how their children were stolen away     and there it stands to this very day     and i must not omit to say     that in transylvania theres a tribe     of alien people that ascribe     the outlandish ways and dress     on which their neighbours lay such stress     to their fathers and mothers having risen     out of some subterraneous prison     into which they were trepanned     long time ago in a mighty band     out of hamelin town in brunswick land     but how or why they dont understand   xv      so willy let me and you be wipers     of scores out with all menespecially pipers     and whether they pipe us free from rats or from mice     if weve promised them aught let us keep our promise         first published 1888     original wood block designs engraved     by edward evans
