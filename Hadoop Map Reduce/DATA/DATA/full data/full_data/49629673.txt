49629673	the rover boys in new york   or   saving their fathers honor  by arthur m winfield    introduction  my dear boys this volume is a complete story in itself but forms the seventeenth in a line issued under the general title of the rover boys series for young americans  as i have mentioned several times in other volumes this line was started with the publication of the rover boys at school on the ocean and in the jungle the cordial reception afforded the stories called for the publication of the next volume the rover boys out west and then year after year by the issuing of on the great lakes in camp on land and sea on the river on the plains in southern waters on the farm on treasure isle at college down east and then by in the air where we last met them  the boys are not as young as they once were indeed in this book dick the oldest gets married and settles down to business but all are as bright and lively as ever and tom is just as full of fun when they go to new york city they have some strenuous times and all prove their worth in more ways than one their father is in deep trouble and they aid him and clear up quite a mystery  up to this writing the sale on this line of books is but a trifle short of one million and a quarter copies this is to me of course tremendously gratifying again as in the past i thank my many readers for their interest in what i have written for them and i trust the perusal of my works will do them good  affectionately and sincerely yours                                                     arthur m winfield       chapter i   the boys at brill  boys what do you say to a trip in the dartaway this afternoon  suits me sam replied tom rover  providing the breeze doesnt get too strong returned dick rover as he put up his hand to feel the air  oh i dont think it will blow too much went on sam rover i dont mind some air  but no more storms for me cried his brother tom with a shake of his head that last old corker was enough for me  where shall we go questioned dick with a queer little smile creeping around the corners of his mouth  oh my just to hear dick cried tom with a grin as if he would go anywhere but to hope seminary to call on dora  and as if you would go anywhere but to call on nellie at the same place retorted the oldest rover boy  now children children came sweetly from sam you mustnt quarrel about the dear girls i know both of you are as much gone as can be but  and how about grace sam said tom didnt i hear you making up some poetry about her yesterday those limpid eyes and pearly ears and  rats tom i dont make up poetry i leave that to songbird interrupted the youngest rover boy just the same it will be nice to call on the girls theyll be looking for us some day this week  thats right and maybe we can give them a little ride put in dick rover  do you remember the ride we gave dora and nellie when we rescued them from sobber crabtree and the others asked tom  not likely to forget that in a hurry answered his big brother by the way i wonder when the authorities will try those rascals  not right away im thinking dick answered tom the law is rather slow up here in these back counties  never mind they will get what is coming to them sooner or later was sams comment  abduction is rather a serious offense  right you are answered dick and ill be glad to see crabtree sobber and our other enemies behind the bars then they wont be able to bother us any more  that will he the end of sobbers efforts to annex the stanhope fortune mused sam how hard he did try to get it away from mrs stanhope and the girls  i shouldnt have minded that had he used fair methods sam returned the big brother but when it came to stealing and abducting  hello you fellows shouted a voice from behind the rover boys plotting mischief  not just now stanley answered dick as his college chum caught him by the shoulder and swung him around playfully  want to go for a row on the river asked stanley browne  not just now stanley ive got a lecture to attend and this afternoon we are going over to hope in the biplane  wish i had a flying machine said the student wistfully  better swap the boat for one suggested sam  no i think rowing is safer some day if you are not careful youll get an awful tumble from that machine  we try to be as careful as possible answered dick seriously though stanley i dont care for flying as much as i thought i would  is that so now i thought you were planning a honeymoon trip by aeroplane think of the novelty of it  no a steamboat or a parlor car will be good enough for me when i go on a honeymoon trip answered dick and for a very good reason he blushed deeply  hello william philander tubbs cried tom as a tall dudishlooking student crossed the college campus whats the price of eggs this morning  what is that tom questioned the stylishlydressed youth as he turned in the direction of the others  i asked what was the price of eggs said tom innocently  the er the price of eggs how should i know stammered william philander tubbs in astonishment  werent you in the chicken business once  gracious me no tom no  funny i made the mistake and i want to know the price of eggs the worst way went on the funloving rover innocently  what do you want to know the price of eggs for questioned william philander curiously  why you see weve got a new problem in geometry to solve and the price of eggs will help out continued tom looking very serious  what is it tom  its this tubby my boy if the diameter of an egg ten degrees west of its north pole is two and eleventenths inches what is the value of the shell unfilled i thought you might help me out on that  tom you are poking fun at me cried the dudish student as a snicker went up from the other youths and please dont call me tubby i beg of you pleaded william philander  all right billy gander murmured tom it shant occur again  billy gander that is worse than tubby groaned the dudish youth oh you are awful he added and strode off trying to look very indignant  poor tubbs i wonder if he will ever be sensible and get over his dudish ways was dicks comment  i doubt it for it seems to be born in him returned sam  but hes a good sort with it all ventured stanley browne  firstrate agreed tom but i well i simply cant help poking fun at him when hes around hes such a dandy and so lordly in his manner  here comes songbird interrupted sam and see he is writing verses as usual i wonder  look exclaimed dick oh theres a collision for you  william philander tubbs had started across the campus with his head high in the air he was looking to one side and did not notice the approach of another student who was coming forward thoughtfully carrying a pad in one hand and writing as he walked there was a sudden meeting of the pair and the pad fell to the ground and with it the fancy headgear the dudish student was wearing  oh i er i beg your pardon really i do dont you know stammered william philander  great hannibals tombstone spluttered the other student what are you trying to do tubbs knock me down  i beg your pardon powell i didnt see you coming answered the other as he picked up his hat and commenced to brush it off with care  you must be getting blind growled john powell otherwise known as songbird confound the luck you spoilt one of my best rhymes he added as he stooped to pick up his writing pad  sorry upon my honor i am returned william philander can i help you out on it  i dont think you can did you ever try to write poetry real poetry i mean  no my dear boy no im afraid i would not be equal to it  then i dont see how you are going to help me murmured songbird and he passed on a few steps coming to a halt presently to jot down some words on his pad  hello songbird called out tom how is the muse today redhot  for a moment john powell did not answer but kept on writing then his face broke out into a sudden smile  there thats it he cried ive got it at last i knew id get it if i kept at it long enough  knew youd get what the measles asked the funloving tom  measles nothing snorted the wouldbe poet i have been writing a poem on the springtime of love and i wished to show how  the springtime of love interrupted tom that must be a second cousin to the ditty entitled tis well to meet her at the well   i never heard of such a poem answered songbird with a serious air how does it go  it doesnt go songbird it stands still but what have you got on the pad  yes let us hear the latest effusion put in sam  but not if it takes too long was dicks comment ive only got about ten minutes before that lecture on the cave dwellers  i can give songbird six minutes said stanley as he consulted his watch  this is er something of a private poem stammered songbird i wrote it for a er for a personal friend of mine  minnie sanderson cried sam mentioning the name of a farmers daughter with whom all were well acquainted and a young lady songbird called on occasionally  read it anyway songbird said dick  well if you care to hear it responded the wouldbe poet and he began to read from the pad    in early spring when flowers bloom    in garden and on fields afar    my thoughts go out to thee sweet love    and then i wonder where you are    when pansies show their varied hues    and birds are singing as they soar    i listen and i look and dream    of days when we shall meet once more  grand fine immense murmured tom byron couldnt hold a candle to that songbird    i listen to the tiny brook    that winds its way oer rock and sand    and in the running water see    a face that that that  go ahead songbird cried sam as the wouldbe poet stumbled and halted  i er i had the last line but tubbs knocked it out of me grumbled songbird and say he knocked something else out of me he exclaimed suddenly i was going to tell you an important bit of news  you were cried dick what  the word just came in over the telephone from the weekly newspaper office doctor wallington said you would want to know about it  but what is it demanded sam impatiently  josiah crabtree has escaped from jail  escaped ejaculated tom  why we were just talking about him put in dick when did this happen  last night so the newspaper man said it seems there was a small fire at the jail down in the kitchen there was great excitement for supper was just being served in the excitement three of the prisoners who were out of their cells escaped josiah crabtree was one of them  too bad murmured sam and we thought he was safe  this spells trouble for us was toms comment and dick nodded his head to show that he was of the same opinion    chapter ii   about the past  did you get any more particulars asked sam of the college poet  no the newspaper man was busy so the doctor said and didnt have time to go into details answered songbird  did he say who the other prisoners were who got away asked dick  yes a tramp who was up for robbing a man on the road and a bank clerk who took some money from the bank  none of the crowd we are interested in said tom  im glad of it returned his older brother it is bad enough for crabtree to get away i hope they keep a strict guard over the others after this  oh they will rest assured of that came from stanley browne the head jailer will get a raking over the coals for this mark my words  the stanhopes and the lanings will be sorry to learn that crabtree got away said sam i wonder if they arent searching for him mused sam  oh theyll search for all of them put in songbird i think the newspaper man said the sheriff had a posse out  too bad said dick shaking his head gravely and just when we felt sure old crabtree wouldnt be able to give us any more trouble  it beats the nation what that man can do cried sam maybe be hypnotized one of the jailers just as he hypnotized mrs stanhope years ago  hed be equal to it if he got the chance answered tom and then all of the students had to go in to their classes  to those who have read the previous volumes in this rover boys series of books the lads we have just met will need no special introduction for the benefit of my new readers however let me state that the rover boys were three in number dick being the oldest funloving tom coming next and sam being about a year younger still when at home they lived with their father anderson rover and their uncle randolph and aunt martha on a beautiful farm called valley brook in new york state  years before and while their father was in africa the three boys had been sent by their uncle to putnam hall military academy as related in detail in the first volume of this series called the rover boys at school at the hall they had made a number of friends including songbird powell and the dudish student william philander tubbs they had also made some enemies who did their best to bring the rover boys to grief but without success  a term at school had been followed by a short cruise on the ocean and then a trip to the jungles of africa whither the lads went to find their father who had disappeared then during vacation the boys took a trip west and then another trip on the great lakes after that they went in the mountains and then came back to putnam hall to go into camp with their fellow cadets  this term at putnam hall was followed by a long journey on land and sea to a faraway island of the pacific where the boys and their friends had to play robinson crusoe for a while then they returned to this country and in a houseboat sailed down the ohio and the mississippi rivers after leaving the mississippi they took an outing on the plains and then went down into southern waters where in the gulf of mexico they solved the mystery of a deserted steam yacht  and now for home and a big rest said dick and they went back to the farm but here something very unusual occurred and the boys had as lively a time as ever  while at school the three rover boys had become well acquainted with three girls dora stanhope and her cousins the two laning sisters nellie and grace dora was the only daughter of mrs stanhope a widow and soon she and dick became the warmest of friends while tom was quite taken by nellie and sam often paired off with grace  in those days josiah crabtree had been an instructor at putnam hall he was very dictatorial and none of the cadets liked him and the rovers liked him still less when they learned that he was trying to practically hypnotize mrs stanhope into marrying him so that he could get control of the fortune which the widow was holding in trust for dora they foiled the teachers efforts to wed the lady and in the end josiah crabtree had to leave putnam hall later still he was arrested for some of his misdeeds and given a short sentence in jail  the stanhope fortune as a part of the money coming to the stanhopes and the lanings was called had come to mr stanhope in a peculiar way and some outsiders claimed the treasure which at that time was secreted in a spot among the west indies called treasure isle there was a lively chase to get there first but the rovers won out and because of this their enemies were more bitter than ever  the boys had finished their term at putnam hall and on their return home became students at brill college a fine institution of learning of the middle west at the same time dora nellie and grace became pupils at hope seminary located not many miles from brill at the college the rovers made many friends including stanley browne already introduced and will otherwise known as spud jackson a lad who loved potatoes and who also loved to tell big yarns  a term at college had been followed by a trip down east taken for a peculiar reason and then while on a visit home the three lads had become the possessors of an uptodate biplane which they named the dartaway in the biplane as related in the volume before this called the rover boys in the air our heroes made a somewhat spectacular trip from the farm to the college campus much to the amazement of their fellow collegians and their instructors later they made a trip through the air to hope seminary and at that time dick was delighted to place upon doras finger a diamond engagement sing  a short while later an alarming thing occurred the boys were out in the dartaway when they met grace on the road and learned that dora and nellie had been abducted by josiah crabtree tad sobber and some of their other old enemies they gave chase in the biplane and after several adventures located the girls in a lonely mansion in the country where they were prisoners in charge of sobbers aunt the boys at once went for the authorities and after something of a fight the rascals were made prisoners and the girls were rescued and taken back to the seminary  you will appear against these scoundrels asked the sheriff jackson fells of the rover boys as they were about to leave the sheriffs office at plankville  well appear all right enough tom had answered why mr sheriff you couldnt beat us away with a club and so it had been arranged that the rover boys should appear in court against the evildoers whenever wanted then crabtree sobber and the others had been put under lock and key in the oldfashioned country jail and there for the time being the matter had rested  i wish we could learn more about crabtrees escape remarked tom as he and his brothers entered the main building of the college  so do i added sam cant we telephone over to plankville to sheriff fells  more than likely the sheriff is out hunting for crabtree and the others answered dick but ill tell you what we might do if the weather stays good he added suddenly  sail to plankville in the dartaway queried both of the others  yes if doctor wallington will give us permission  he ought to since we are so much interested in this case returned tom  well find out as soon as the morning session is over said the eldest rover boy and then all hurried to their classes for the final bell had ceased to ring  it was hard work for the boys to keep their minds on their lessons dick especially was very serious and for a good reason something was worrying him greatly something of which tom and sam knew little what it was we shall learn later  the boys had a quarter of an hour after classes before going to lunch and they immediately sought out doctor wallington whom they found in his private office  yes it is too bad that that rascal crabtree escaped said the head of the college i can well imagine that you are worried since he has caused you and your friends so much trouble in the past let us hope that the authorities will quickly recapture him  have you had any further word sir asked dick  i had word at eleven oclock from the newspaper office up to that time he had not been located  we wish to ask a favor went on dick and spoke about the proposed trip to plankville  very well you may go and in your biplane if you deem it safe said the worthy doctor secretly he was quite proud of the students success with the dartaway as it had advertised brill college not a little  possibly we wont be able to get back until tomorrow said tom we may be detained or it may storm  take your time on the trip only be careful that you have no accidents  well try to be careful answered dick with a grim smile we dont want a tumble if we can help it  it is a grand sport answered the head of the college before long i expect to see aeroplanes in constant use  wouldnt you like to go up with us some day doctor questioned tom slyly  well er perhaps thomas but not just yet i wish er to see them more in general use first and then the doctor bowed the students out  the boys lost no time in preparing for the trip to plankville after a somewhat hasty lunch they put on their flying suits and then went down to where the dartaway was housed in one of the buildings attached to the gymnasium  looks to be all right remarked dick after an inspection of the flying machine and while sam and tom were filling the gasoline tank and the oil distributor  the engine was tried out for a minute and found to be in perfect order as usual as soon as the explosions of the motor were heard a crowd commenced to gather to see the start of the flight  wish you luck cried stanley  say look out that you dont forget how to stop and sail to the north pole sang out spud jackson  as if that could really occur murmured william philander tubbs with a lofty look of disdain  sure it could happen returned spud goodnaturedly why i heard of an airman who went up once and forgot how to turn his machine down and he went around and around in a circle for sixteen hours and then he dropped kerplunk right on top of a bakers wagon and smashed twentysix pies all because his gasoline gave out  ridiculous murmured william philander  absolute fact tubbs responded spud earnestly come with me some day and ill show you where the pies made a dent in the street when the flying machine struck em and then a general laugh went up and the dudish student stepped back in the crowd out of sight  all aboard sang out dick as he hopped into the drivers seat and took hold of the wheel start her up somebody  sam and tom got aboard and willing hands grasped the propellers and gave each a twist bang bang bang went the explosions and soon the propellers were revolving swiftly and then with a swoop the dartaway ran over the campus on its wheels and suddenly arose in the air a cheer went up and the students threw up their caps then dick swung around in a quarter circle and headed directly for plankville  it was an ideal day for flying not too hot or too cold and with very little breeze and that of the steady kind not likely to develop holes the one great terror of all airmen  wish we had the girls along remarked sam when they were well on the way  not for this trip sam answered dick grimly we have got our work cut out for us  why what do you mean  if old crabtree hasnt been caught yet me must see if we cant round him up    chapter iii   a useless hunt  say thats the talk cried tom quickly i hadnt thought of that but its just what we ought to do  it wont be easy tom said his younger brother the chances are that crabtree has made good use of his time he may be hundreds of miles away bound for the west or the south or canada or europe  well we can have a try at finding him anyway put in dick someti a criminal sticks close to the jail until the excitement is over look at those fellows who escaped from jail in new york city not long ago the detectives thought they had gone to chicago or st louis and all the while they were on the east side right in new york  oh my but wouldnt i just like to land on old crabtree muttered tom i think id be apt to put him in the hospital first and jail afterwards he certainly deserves it for all the trouble he has caused us and our er friends  friends is good with dick engaged to marry dora and you as good as engaged to nellie snorted sam precisely and you and grace making googoo eyes at each other added tom with a wink at his younger brother then he quickly changed the subject dick do you think you can strike a straight course for plankville  ill try it was the answer i dont think ill go much out of the way  the dartaway had a powerful motor and once on the right trail the eldest rover advanced his gasoline and spark and they went rushing through the air at expresstrain speed the boys were provided with face guards so they did not mind this they did not fly high and so kept the railroad and other familiar objects fairly well in view they passed over several villages the inhabitants gazing up at them in openmouthed wonder and finally came in sight of a big church spire that they knew belonged in plankville then dick slowed down the engine and soon they floated down in an open field close to the main street and not a great distance from the sheriffs office and the jail  well it certainly didnt take long to get here cried tom as he consulted his watch  a man who lived close by was approaching and he readily agreed for a small amount to guard the biplane  have they caught those men who escaped from the jail asked sam of the man  got two on em was the reply dacker and penfield  what of crabtree asked dick  nuthin doin up to an hour ago the sheriff is out with about ten men lookin fer him  then there is no use of our going to the sherifs office said dick to his brothers well go right to the jail  will they let us in asked sam  in the office yes we wont want to go to the cells answered dick with a short laugh  when they reached the office of the jail they found several men present including the head keeper and one of the state detectives the keeper had seen the rover boys at the time of the capture of crabtree and the others and he smiled a little as he shook hands  bad business he said in answer to a question dick put but i cant exactly blame my men for what happened  werent you here at the time asked tom  no i was out of town calling on my mother who is very old and quite sick there was a fire in the pantry off the kitchen and for a few minutes it looked as if the old jail would burn to the ground of course the guards got excited and all they thought of was to put out the blaze and its a good thing they did that thats how the prisoners got away i suppose youve heard that we rounded up two of them  yes answered dick have they any idea what became of crabtree  i havent if the sheriff knows anything he hasnt told it by the way boys ill tell you something now you are here that man is a hypnotist  we know it said dick i thought i told you  he tried to hypnotize one of the men one day almost got away doing it  did he hire any lawyer to defend him asked tom curiously  i dont know about a lawyer he had a man out to see him several times the two were very friendly  they were cried dick i never knew josiah crabtree had any friends outside of the rascals he associated with who was the man  he gave his name as john smith but i guess that was false for he acted as if he didnt want to be known  what kind of a looking man was he asked sam  why he was a tall thin fellow with a very pointed chin and bushy black hair and heavy black eyebrows when he spoke his voice had a regular rumble to it  at this description the rover boys shook their heads they could think of nobody they had met who would fit the picture  when was that man here last asked dick  a couple of days ago i didnt like him for a cent but as the prisoners havent been convicted of any crimes as yet i had to let em see their friends explained the jail keeper  what of sobber larkspur and the others questioned tom  all safe enough nobody else is going to get out of here if i can help it and the keeper shook his head decidedly  the boys remained at the jail for a while longer and heard the particulars of how the fire had originated and of how the prisoners had gotten away two of the men had kept together but crabtree had gone off by himself and the last seen of him was when he was running for the river which flowed some distance back of the jail  let us go down to the river and take a look around suggested dick at last and bidding the jailer goodbye they hurried away  along the river bank they found several men and boys all looking for crabtree some thinking there might be a reward offered for the capture of the criminal the rovers joined in the hunt for the best part of an hour but without success  its worse than looking for a pin in a haystack grumbled tom presently we might as well give it up  let us walk around the town and see if we can learn anything suggested his big brother  they walked down the main street of plankville from end to end questioning several people they knew at last they got word that a mysterious automobile had passed through the town about midnight of the day josiah crabtree had broken from jail but who had been in the touring car nobody could tell  he may have escaped in that declared dick  and if he did that man who came to see him at the jail had the car added sam  just what i think cried tom well if he got away in an auto there is no use of our looking for him here he added with a sigh  nevertheless the boys hung around plankville for an hour longer then they got aboard of the dartaway and with tom at the wheel and dick with a pair of field glasses to his eyes swung in several circles about the neighborhood  no use declared the oldest rover boy at last it is getting late we might as well return to college we can do nothing here  havent we got time to go to hope asked sam a bit wistfully  well i dont know answered his big brother just as wistfully  let us take time doctor wallington didnt want us to hurry back put in tom i think the girls ought to know about this so as to be on guard in case old crabtree tries to molest them again  as the lads were all of one mind the biplane was headed in the direction of hope as before the flying machine swung through the air at a good rate of speed and half an hour before sundown they came in sight of the seminary buildings  wonder where they are mused dick as the biplane came to earth at the spot where they had landed before  if they are around they must have heard us answered tom the engine makes noise enough to wake the dead and this was well expressed for the motor like many of the flying machine kind had no muffler attached and the explosions were not unlike the firing of a gatling gun  some girls had seen them come down and presently the boys saw three figures hurrying towards them  oh what made you come so late cried grace as she rushed up and shook hands with sam and then with the others  we thought you might come today put in nellie as she beamed on tom and extended both hands  i heard the machine first declared dora and came straight to dick who did not hesitate to give her the hearty kiss to which he thought his engagement entitled him  we have been to plankville came from tom and sam in a breath  have you heard the news questioned their big brother and he looked anxiously from dora to her cousins  what news cried dora quickly we have heard nothing unusual  josiah crabtree broke out of the plankville jail and ran away  oh dick and dora grew suddenly pale do you really mean it  when was this demanded nellie  tell us all about it supplemented grace  we cant tell you any more than what we have heard answered sam we just got word ourselves this morning  then the boys told their story and answered innumerable questions which the girls put to them  this will be bad news for mother said dora to dick she is afraid of josiah crabtree and always has been because of his strange hypnotic power  i dont think he will dare to show himself at least not for a while dora he answered he knows only too well that the jail is waiting to receive him  that strange man with the bushy eyebrows and the pointed chin must have helped him to get away was nellies comment  so we think answered tom  but who was he questioned her sister  thats a conundrum we cant answer returned sam i think he was waiting around with that auto and as soon as the fire started crabtree saw the chance he wanted and got out  maybe crabtree started the fire suggested dora  no that was purely an accident so the jailer says the wind blew a curtain against a lamp and the burning curtain fell into some excelsior in a box of new dishes the excelsior made quite a blaze and a lot of smoke and everybody in the jail was badly frightened for a while  after that the talk became general and quite unconsciously dick and dora strolled off by themselves down towards a tiny brook that flowed past the campus grounds  you must be very careful dora now that crabtree is at liberty said the eldest rover boy i wouldnt have him run off with you again for the world he added tenderly  i shall watch out dick and ill make the others watch out too and then as he squeezed her hand she added in a lower voice how is that other matter coming along  not very well dora and dicks face became more serious than ever  cant your father manage it  i dont think so you see he isnt in very good health he breaks down every once in a while those business matters worry him a great deal  cant your uncle help him  no uncle randolph means well but he is no business man he showed that when he allowed those men to swindle him out of those bonds went on dick referring to an event which has been related in detail in the rover boys on the farm  but what can you do dick questioned the girl earnestly  i think ill have to quit college and take up the matter myself answered dick rover    chapter iv   the end of the dartaway  quit college oh dick do you want to do that  not exactly dora and yet i dont think i am exactly fitted for a professional career that seems to be more in tom and sams line i like business and id enjoy getting into something big something worth while i think i could handle those matters if father would only let me try and then there is another thing dora went on the youth looking squarely into his companions face perhaps you can guess what that is  she blushed deeply  what she whispered  i want to marry you and take you some place where i know youll be safe from such creatures as crabtree and sobber and larkspur and i want the right to look after your mother too  oh dick and she clung tightly to his arm  arent you willing dora  yes she looked at him frankly yes dick whenever you say  and your mother  mamma depends upon me in everything and she has told me to do just as we thought best  dick gave a swift look around nobody was in sight at that moment he pressed dora to him  you best and dearest sweetheart in all the world he cried in a low tone then i can depend on you well be the happiest couple in the whole world  indeed yes dick and doras eyes fairly beamed with happiness as she snuggled closer to him but about your father she continued a moment later i am selfish to forget him then he is not so well  he is fairly well but he gets a bad spell ever so often and then to attend to business is out of the question but that isnt the worst of it he has gotten tangled up in some sort of financial scheme with some brokers in new york city and it is worrying him half to death he has told me something about it but i dont know half as much as id like to know  then you must find out dick and help him all you possibly can declared the girl promptly  im looking for a letter from home every day i mean one telling about these financial affairs as soon as it comes ill know what to do  all too soon the boys visit to hope seminary had to come to an end sam and tom returned to the biplane and gave the motor a brief tryout which noise reached dicks ears just as he was trying to break away from dora he gave her a last hug and a kiss and then ran to join his brothers  the best of friends must part as the hook said to the eye sang out tom merrily  i believe you are anxious to leave us returned nellie teasingly  sure thing he retorted promptly i planned to get away an hour before i came and then she playfully boxed his ear at which he chased her around the biplane and gave her a hearty smack just below her own pretty ear  tom rover she gasped but somehow she looked pleased nevertheless  a11 in the family sang out the funloving rover coolly as the lady said when she kissed her cow  who is going to run the dartaway back questioned sam i think its my turn at the wheel  its rather dark sam answered dick but you can try it if you want to  all right i think i can see as much as you or tom responded the youngest rover if i get off the course and you find it out let me know  darkness was settling down when the boys finally bid the girls goodbye and flew away beware of old crabtree sang out dick  well watch out answered nellie  indeed we will came from dora and grace  if you catch sight of him have him arrested yelled sam and then the biplane sailed out of hearing  sam knew how to handle the dartaway almost as well as did dick and tom and as there was but little wind and the flying machine appeared to be in good condition the others did not doubt but what sam would make a fine flight of the trip  keep a little to the south called out dick after hope had been left behind and when they were sailing over some broad fields if you do that you can follow the old turnpike for quite a distance  i thought id run for the railroad tracks answered the lad at the steering wheel  you can do that later after we pass that big farmhouse with the four barns  running along in the air is a different proposition from running on the ground and the airman has to be careful about the lay of the land below him or he will soon go astray from his course the earth looks altogether different when viewed from the sky from what it does when looked at from a level and when an airman is five or six hundred feet up he has all he can do to make out what is below him  it had begun to cloud up a little and this made it darker than ever after following the turnpike for nearly two miles sam veered slightly to catch the railroad tracks and the gleam of the signal lights  i can follow the lights best of all he shouted into dicks ear its too dark to see the road  all right follow the railroad right to ashton answered the oldest rover boy naming the town that was the railroad station for brill college  the cloudiness increased rapidly and long before ashton was gained it commenced to blow gently at first and then stronger and stronger evidently a storm was in the air  we are going to catch it was toms comment  oh i dont think it will storm just yet returned sam  watch yourself sam cried dick warningly if the wind gets too strong bring her down in the first field we come to  i will was the answer  they were now flying close to the railroad tracks presently they saw a glare of light illuminate the rails and a long line of freight cars drawn by a big locomotive passed beneath them  wish that was going our way we could follow it with ease said sam as the train disappeared from view leaving the landscape below darker than ever  the youngest rover boy now had to give the dartaway all of his attention the breeze was coming in fitful gusts sending the biplane first to one side and then to the other they struck a bank and he had to use all his wit and courage to bring the flying machine to a level keel once more  better go down cried tom this is getting dangerous  dont go down here sang out dick there are woods on both sides of the track  sam had been working the horizontal rudder to bring the biplane down but at dicks words he shifted again and they went up  ill tell you when we reach an open field went on the oldest rover say this sure is some blow he added  another fitful gust struck the dartaway and for one brief moment it looked as if the biplane would be turned over had this occurred the machine would have dropped like a shot and most likely all of the boys would have been killed  but sam was on guard and worked his levers like lightning as quickly as she had tipped the dartaway righted herself and then they shot upward on a long slant  phew that was some escape muttered tom dick cant you see any open field where we can land  must be one ahead was the answer i fancy  dick did not finish for at that moment came a blast of air stronger than any that had gone before the dartaway spun around left the railroad tracks made a semicircle and then came back again as it made the final turn there was a crack like that of a pistol  what was that cried tom was it the engine  no it was one of the stays answered dick he glanced around the right plane is giving way sam let her down as quick as you can  on the tracks gasped the lad at the wheel  yes anywhere before we tumble  the biplane was already out of control sam manipulated the rudders as best he could and likewise the ailerons and the machine dropped in several wild dashes  the train yelled tom look out for the express  there was another gleam of light along the railroad tracks the evening express was approaching running at topmost speed to make up some lost time  the biplane was coming down swiftly it veered towards the woods beside the railroad tracks then it took another wild turn and hung directly over the railroad the boys were speechless not knowing what to do the light of the express train kept coming closer and closer  crash the biplane had struck the earth directly beside the railroad tracks one end of the machine rested across the rails the other end hung in the bushes bordering the tracks  as they struck tom and dick were thrown out the former into the bushes and the latter on the tracks sam kept at the wheel the force of the intact smashing the landing wheels beneath him  for the instant all three boys were too stunned to do anything then as the gleam from the express train came closer tom let out a wild cry  jump jump for your lives we havent a moment to lose  dick screamed sam save dick he is on the tracks  where  there and sam pointed with one hand while he clambered down from his seat the seat was broken and his coat got caught in the splinters and it was several seconds before he could release himself  tom looked to where his brother pointed and saw dick lying in a heap face downward the fall had been sufficient to stun him and he was thus unable to help himself  tom did not hesitate over what to do dick was very dear to him and never for an instant did he consider the risk he was running in going to the rescue he made a flying leap from the bushes to the tracks and took another leap to his brothers side  get up dick he yelled here let me get you off the tracks the train is coming  only a faint groan answered him dick was still too dazed to think or to act  tom caught hold of his brother and raised him up and commenced to drag him to the other side of the tracks away from the wrecked biplane as he did this there came a shrill warning shriek from the locomotive whistle the engineer had seen the obstruction on the tracks and had put on brakes in a vain endeavor to stop the express  as tom commenced to haul dick across the tracks sam came bounding to his assistance the shreds of his torn coat flapping behind him he caught his big brother by one arm  hurry he yelled hoarsely the express is almost here  both boys made a wild leap to the edge of the railroad dragging dick between them tom got his foot caught in the rails and almost pitched headlong they fairly fell into the bushes and dick went down with them  then the express thundered up the whistle shrieking loudly and the sparks flying from the wheels where the brakes gripped them the locomotive struck the dartaway and the next instant the biplane was smashed to pieces the broken parts flying in all directions    chapter v   two visitors  thats the last of the dartaway  are you hurt dick  my wasnt that a narrow escape  a minute later and it would have been all up with us  i i guess im all right stammered dick putting one hand to his forehead where a lump was rapidly rising i got some fall though he added grimly  look what hit me cried sam picking up a section of a bamboo stick one which had supported one of the planes of the flying machine  im glad we werent closer to that smashup  having plowed through the biplane the express train had come to a halt with the last car standing not a great distance beyond the scene of the collision already the trainmen were hurrying out some with lanterns to learn if anybody had been killed or hurt  why its an airship cried the conductor how in the name of adam did that get here  here are three fellows cried the engineer as the rays of a lantern revealed the rover boys were you in that flying machine he called  we were answered tom grimly  anybody hurt  my brother got a bad tumble and is partly stunned  we didnt hit anybody did we questioned the engineer anxiously  nothing but the biplane answered sam you made mincemeat of that  how did you happen to land on the track asked the fireman  the wind put the machine out of control and we came down quicker than we wanted to explained sam then you came along before we had a chance to drag the biplane off the tracks  well im glad i didnt hit anybody said the engineer in tones of relief  we had a close shave returned tom and then he and sam told of how they had struck and of how dick had been dragged out of the way by this time the oldest rover boy was feeling more like himself and he managed to stand up even though somewhat dizzy  well were losing time said the conductor consulting his watch by the light of his lantern well have to get into ashton and report this  and somebody has got to pay for the biplane said tom  i dont see as it is our fault answered the trainman and then he gave the order to go ahead after it had been ascertained that the track was clear  well ride to ashton with you said dick no use of staying with this wreckage he added to his brothers we can drive down tomorrow and look it over i dont think it is worth much  never mind i am glad nobody was seriously hurt returned sam  i guess we all feel that way added tom  it was a run of only a few minutes to ashton on the way the conductor of the train took the rover boys names and address  i dont see how you can blame us for smashing the flying machine he said you had no business to come down on the track  we might have gotten our biplane off the track if you had halted the train returned dick we could have dragged it into the bushes  i dont know about that  as soon as the train rolled into ashton the bays alighted the only other passenger to get off was one of the local storekeepers  you were lucky boys said the man pleasantly he knew them by sight for they had traded at his shop  thats true mr striker said dick but we dont seem to be lucky just now  hows that  there isnt a conveyance of any kind here to take us to brill and i must say i dont feel like walking  you go around to carsons livery stable hell take you over to the college answered mr striker  the livery stable was but a short distance away and they found the proprietor on hand reading a newspaper and smoking his pipe  its a wonder you wouldnt have a rig over at the depot to meet the main trains grumbled tom  twouldnt pay answered neal carson i tried it once and earned two dollars and a half in two weeks folks that want me can come here for me  well we want to get to brill college said dick  all right but it will cost you fifty cents each  very well  the livery stable keeper hustled around and soon had a team ready the boys were glad enough to take it easy in the carriage and on the way to college but little was said  rather late young gentlemen remarked professor blackie sharply as they entered  we had an accident professor returned dick  an accident and the instructor was all attention  our biplane got smashed up put in tom  indeed i am sorry to hear that are you hurt  got a shaking up and a few scratches answered sam  then their story had to be told in detail soon it became noised all over the place that the dartaway had been wrecked and before they could get a mouthful to eat the three rovers had to tell the story over and over again  im sorry the biplane was wrecked but glad you escaped said songbird earnestly he cherished his old friends as if they were brothers  just what i say already cried max spangler a germanamerican student you can buy a new flying machine yes but you cant buy a new head or a body not much and he shook his head earnestly  even while the lads were eating they had to give further details of the disastrous flight doctor wallington congratulated them on their escape  you had better leave flying alone after this he remarked  i think we shall for a while at least answered tom dryly  as soon as it was possible to do so the boys sent a message to the girls and to their folks telling about the accident and of their escape  its bound to get in the newspapers said dick and if we dont send word the others will be scared to death  the oldest rover boy was right about the affair getting in the newspapers the local sheets gave the accident a column or more and some city sheets took it up and made a spread of it with pictures that were truly thrilling even though they were inaccurate  humph look at this picture cried sam showing up the supplement to a new york sunday newspaper looks as if we hit the smokestack of the locomotive and sailed along on that for a mile or two phew what an imagination that artist must have  and here is a picture showing the train climbing over the biplane returned tom say its a wonder we didnt wreck the express instead of the express wrecking us  on the day following the accident the boys were told after class hours that some gentlemen wished to see them they went to the reception room to find two men there a lawyer and a doctor  you are the er the young gentlemen who were in the er the flying machine smashup queried one of the visitors sharply  yes answered dick  mr rover  yes richard rover  just so glad to know you my name is fogg belright fogg this is doctor slamper we represent the railroad company mr rover the doctor came along to see if you had been hurt  i got this answered dick with a quiet smile and pointed to the lump on his forehead  ah yes i see put in doctor slamper not very serious i take it  oh it didnt kill me  ha ha good joke mr rover feel pretty good otherwise eh  oh im able to sit up  and these other young gentlemen are all right of course went on the doctor smoothly  his manner was such that the boys were disgusted evidently he had come to smooth matters over so that they would not put in a claim for personal injuries and the lawyer had come to ward off a claim for the loss of the dartaway  no im not all right doctor far from it cried tom before the others could say another word and then the funloving rover went on my knee is sprained and my back twisted and i have a pain in one of my right teeth and my brothers both got their arms wrenched and one got his left big toe out of joint and none of us can see extra good and i think my big brothers right ear is out of order and my digestion is not what it should be and i fear  stop stop interrupted the doctor in amazement do you mean to say  and the back of my neck feels out of kilter somehow continued tom and sams left hip isnt just as straight as it should be and when i hit my elbow i have the funniest sensation crawl down my shoulder blade ever was and we all think we ought to go to a sanitarium for at least six months or a year dont you think so too doctor  well i never gasped doctor slamper falling back against a center table why my dear young men i think  and the dartaway is gone our dear old flying machine groaned tom the machine we hoped to fly in to washington to the next inauguration why dont you know that the planes of that machine were covered with the autographs of most of the big men of this country whenever we sailed around to visit our friends or the big men we had them write their autographs on the canvas wings of the machine those autographs alone were worth about a million more or less  whats this put in belright fogg quickly a flying machine valuable because of the autographs on it preposterous if you think the railroad will stand to pay anything on such a thing as that you are mistaken  but how are we to get those autographs back whined tom some of the men who gave them may be dead now  see here let us get down to business cried belright fogg you dont look to be knocked out at least not a great deal anyway am i right doctor  i i think so of course they may be be shocked a little returned the physician probably they are from the way this young man talks little nervous disorder and he pointed at tom while dick and sam had to turn away to keep from bursting into laughter  um nervous eh well a few days of quietness will remedy that answered the lawyer now see here he looked wisely at the three rovers our railroad disclaims all responsibility for this accident but at the same time we er we want to do the right thing you know rather do that than have any unpleasant feelings understand now if you are willing to accept our offer well fix this matter right up and say no more about it  what is you offer questioned dick  three hundred dollars one hundred dollars each  you mean for our personal injuries questioned sam  i mean for everything  nothing doing returned dick promptly and with a bit of pardonable slang  you will not accept  we might accept three hundred dollars for the shaking up we got although we dont know if our nerves are all right or not sometimes these things turn out worse than at first anticipated but the railroad has got to pay for the biplane it smashed  never  i think it will  you got in the way of the train it was your own fault  your track isnt fenced in i have a right to cross it where i please if i had a wagon and it broke down you would have no right to run into it the law might not hold you criminally liable but it would hold you liable for the worth of the wagon and contents  say are you a lawyer queried belright fogg curiously  no but i know my rights returned dick promptly    chapter vi   the missing biplane  for a moment there was silence the lawyer and the doctor who represented the railroad company looked from one to another of the rover boys  pretty shrewd arent you said the lawyer finally  we have to be in dealing with a railroad company answered dick bluntly now let us get to business if that is what you came for he continued we might put in a big claim for damages and i think a jury would sustain our claim but we want to do what is fair the question then is do you want to do what is fair  why yes of course returned belright fogg but he did not say it very cordially  very well then that flying machine cost us twentyeight hundred dollars new and we have spent over two hundred dollars on improvements so when she was smashed she was worth at least three thousand dollars  but you can save something cant you gut in the lawyer  perhaps we can save the engine and a dealer in secondhand machinery may give a hundred dollars for it now what i propose is this you pay for half the value of the biplane and well call it square  preposterous  very well then mr fogg well consider the interview closed  if you sue you wont get a cent mr rover  that remains to be seen  i am willing to give you five hundred dollars in place of the three hundred first offered  no sir it is fifteen hundred or nothing mr fogg  but you have not been hurt  yes we have been hurt i have been to our college doctor about this lump on my head and my brothers have been to him too we were badly shaken up not as much as my brother made out but enough if we have to sue well put in our claim for personal injuries as well and maybe for time lost from our studies  but fifteen hundred dollars i er i cant see it and the lawyer began to pace the floor  maybe we had better sue suggested sam we might get the full amount of our loss three thousand for the dartaway and some for our injuries  this did not suit the lawyer at all for he had been instructed to settle if possible and thus avoid litigation for the railroad authorities had heard that the rovers were rich and might make the affair cost a good deal  i will er make my offer an even thousand dollars he said after some more talk but that is my limit if you wont take that youll get nothing  all right well sue said dick and he made a move as if to close the interview  see here are you of age have you authority to close this matter demanded belright fogg suddenly  i can close the matter yes answered dick my father will be perfectly satisfied with whatever i do i transact much of his business for him  ah well then let us consider this thing a little more mr rover and thereupon the lawyer went all over the matter again presently he offered twelve hundred dollars but dick was firm and in the end the lawyer said he would pay them fifteen hundred dollars the next day provided they would sign off all claims on the railroad  well do it as soon as we see the money answered dick  cant you trust me mr rover demanded belright fogg  i like to do business in a businesslike way answered dick coolly when you bring that check kindly have it certified he added  very well snapped the lawyer and then he and the doctor got out belright fogg stating he would return the next morning  dick you ought to be a lawyer yourself cried tom you managed that in fine style  tom helped added sam he nearly scared that doctor into a fit talking about our aches and pains  wait perhaps the lawyer wont come back with the money said dick he may reconsider the offer  you didnt say anything about the wreckage said sam who gets that  we do sam they are to pay us for damages dont you see if they pay only that they cant claim the wreckage  promptly at the appointed time the next day belright fogg appeared he was a bit nervous for the railroad officials had told him to settle at once before the rovers took it into their heads to bring suit  i have the check certified he said producing the paper here is what you must sign in the presence of witnesses he added and brought out a legallooking document  well call in two of the teachers answered dick  the oldest rover boy read the document over with care it was all right excepting that in it the railroad claimed the wreckage of the dartaway absolutely  here this comes out cried dick the wreckage belongs to us  at this there was another long discussion but the rovers remained firm and in the end the clause concerning the wreckage was altered to show that the dartaway must remain the boys property then the three brothers signed the paper and it was duly witnessed by two teachers and the certified check was handed to dick  very sharp young man you are was belright foggs comment as he was about to leave you ought to be a lawyer  perhaps i will be some day was dicks answer  better get that check right in the bank cried sam when he and his brothers were alone that fellow may stop payment on it  he cant stop a certified check sam ill put it in the school safe for the present what we want to do is to look after the dartaway she may not be worth much but what there is of her belongs to us  right you are let us get permission to go after her right away for all we know somebody may have carted her off already  the boys readily obtained permission to see to their property and walked down to the college stables to get a horse and carriage to take them to the spot where the accident had occurred just then came a toot of an automobile horn and a fine fivepassenger car rolled into view with stanley browne and a stranger on the front seats  hello you fellows cried stanley as the auto came to a stop come over here i hoped id see you  the rovers hurried across the campus and were introduced to jack mason stanleys cousin the driver of the car he was passing through ashton on the way to join his folks in the white mountains  jack wants me to take a ride with him this afternoon said stanley and i can invite three others to go along will you come with us  that is kind answered dick but we have some business to attend to and he related what it was  say lets take a look at the wrecked biplane cried jack mason id just as soon go there as anywhere  so would i added stanley  very well that will suit us down to the ground cried tom  we were going to drive over in a carriage explained dick we can get there much quicker in the auto  the boys piled into the tonneau of the car and they started off  got to show me the roads said jack mason all i know around here is the regular auto road to the white mountains and i dont know that any too well  you cant lose us on the roads cried tom well keep you straight  jack mason loved to run fast and soon they were bowling along at a fortymileanhour rate stanley and tom told the driver what turns to make and almost before they knew it they had passed the outskirts of ashton and were approaching the locality where the fast express had dashed into the crippled biplane  here we are cried tom presently we cant go any further on the road well have to walk through the woods to the tracks  i see a wood road exclaimed jack mason if the ground isnt too soft ill try that  he went on and passed in between the trees and soon they were within a hundred feet of the railroad tracks as the car came to a stop the rover boys jumped to the ground and ran forward then of a sudden all three set up a shout  the biplane is gone  gone queried stanley who was close behind them  yes gone returned tom  are you sure this is the spot where it was struck  of course i am  there are the marks where we landed and where the locomotive hit the dartaway said sam he looked around wonder who took her and to where  thats to be found out answered dick seriously  i dont see any airship said jack mason as he came up having shut off the engine of the touring car  somebody has hauled it away answered dick he looked on both sides of the track this is queer he added presently i cant see any marks in the sand or mud or bushes shed make marks if anybody hauled her  ive got it cried tom they hoisted her on a flat car the railroad people have taken her  but she is our biplane cried sam stubbornly  maybe they took her to the freight house in ashton suggested stanley  well soon find out if youll take us there in the auto  sure answered jack mason promptly  the boys were about to leave the neighborhood when they heard the strokes of an axe ringing through the woods  theres a wood chopper cried dick maybe he knows something about this i guess ill ask him  they soon located the man an elderly individual who worked for the farmer who owned the woods  yes i see em hoist the airship on the flat car said he in answer to their questions had quite a job o it too  did they take it to ashton queried dick  no they was goin to fust but then jimmy budley the section boss said it would be better to take it up to the freight yards at rallston  and they took it there  i spect they did they went off that way anyway replied the old wood chopper  to the rallston freight yards cried sam what a nerve  ill make em bring it back cried dick firmly  how far is it to rallston asked jack mason  about nine miles  pooh thats nothing jump in and ill take you there in no time if the roads any good  the road is o k answered dick  the automobile was backed out of the woods and turned in the direction of rallston jack mason was in his element and in less than twenty minutes they came in sight of the town and turned into a side street leading to the freight yards  there she is cried sam a minute later  he pointed to one of the tracks in the yards and there on a flat car the boys beheld the wreck of the biplane a small crowd of curious men and boys surrounded the remains of the dartaway  what yer going to do with her jimmy asked a man in the crowd of a burly individual on the flat car  i guess the railroad is going to sell her replied the section boss    chapter vii   the sale of the biplane  did you hear what that man said demanded sam in a whisper of his brothers  i did returned dick but he isnt going to sell our property added tom warmly  hardly responded dick he pushed his way through the crowd and walked straight up to the flat car  who is in charge here he demanded  whats that came in some surprise from the section boss  i asked who was in charge of this flat car with this flying machine  what business is that of yours young fellow  this is our biplane it belongs to me and my brothers here and dick waved his hand at tom and sam  oh are you the rover brothers  yes and i want to know what business you had to bring that flying machine here went on dick sharply for he saw the kind of a man with whom he had to deal  say look here if youve got any kick coming you go to the office with it cried jimmy budley  very well i will but i want to know who ordered you to bring that biplane here  never mind you go to the office and find out  you brought it here didnt you asked tom who had now come up to dicks side along with the others  i aint answering questions when i dont have to returned the section boss with a sneer  sure he brought it here on this flat car cried a man in the crowd why dont you answer the young fellow straight jimmy  this biplane belongs to my brothers and me went on dick as sharply as before you had absolutely no right to touch it if i wished to do so i could have you arrested for this he continued  say i dont allow nobody to talk to me like that growled the section boss you git out of here and see the men at the office  well not get out put in tom this flying machine is ours and we want it  youll take it right back to where you found it added sam and be careful that you dont break it worse than it is or youll foot the bill  i wont listen to you stormed the section boss who was of an ugly disposition naturally and not liked in the neighborhood  very well then answered dick he turned to stanley will you go out and see if you can find a policeman he asked loudly  sure returned the college youth readily  wow hes goin to have budley locked up exclaimed a small boy  see here dont you get fresh stormed the section boss eying dick angrily  well have a policeman settle this answered the oldest rover boy this is our property and we can easily prove it you had no right to touch it  i had orders said jimmy budley doggedly  why dont you telephone to the office jimmy suggested a friend maybe there was some mistake  wasnt no mistake growled the section boss nevertheless he hopped down from the flat car and hurried in the direction of a shanty wherein was located a telephone dick followed him  you can tell them what i said said the youth and they may find it to their interest to call up mr belright fogg before they give you orders  have you seen fogg demanded the section boss  yes  did he say you could take the machine  he said nothing about our taking it he settled for what damage the railroad did to the biplane we went to get our property and found it gone nobody had a right to touch it excepting to take it from the tracks  huh grumbled the section boss and shot into the shanty banging the door behind him dick heard him shout something into the telephone and quite a lengthy conversation ensued  in the meanwhile stanley had gone off for a policeman and presently came back with a bluecoat who did duty in the streets beyond the railroad yards  well what have you got to say about it demanded dick when the section bass came from the shanty and while stanley and the policeman were approaching do we get our property or not  its yours returned the railroad man and his voice was much milder than before they had no right to give me the orders they did  what about taking it back went on dick  ive got orders to take it to any place where you want it answered the section boss and he looked anything but happy as he made the confession  then you can run it down to ashton answered dick will you do it right away  i guess so ill see was the answer  what do you want me for asked the policeman as he came up  i dont believe youll be needed now answered dick  its all right murphy put in jimmy budley quickly we had a misunderstanding over orders thats all  this young man told me a flying machine had been stolen said murphy and nodded towards stanley  it was a misunderstanding i wasnt to blame the section boss turned to dick ill get a freight engine to run the car with the machine down to ashton inside of an hour  very well answered dick and be careful that the biplane isnt damaged in unloading  she aint much but kindlin wood now and the section boss smiled a trifle  well the engine is all right and thats the valuable part of her returned dick ill look for her at ashton in an hour  want to ride down on the flat car with her  ill see about that  the matter was talked over and in the end it was agreed that dick and sam should ride on the flat car while tom went with stanley and jack mason in the automobile then the section boss went off to get the freight engine to haul the flat car  got out of that better than i expected whispered sam to his big brother  it pays to put on a front sam was the answer if i had been weakkneed about it that fellow wouldnt have done a thing  oh youve got a head for business dick i can see that said the youngest rover admiringly  i hope so sam for i think ill need it soon  you mean for helping dad  yes  its too bad he has these weak spells isnt it  yes what he needs i think is a good long rest  the others went off in the touring auto and dick and sam made themselves at home on the flat car soon a freight engine backed up the car was attached and off they started in company with the section boss and two track laborers in the direction of ashton  as the rovers could readily see the dartaway was a complete wreck beyond the possibility of being repaired but the motor looked to be in good order and the stays and turnbuckles would of course be worth something  when ashton was reached sam and dick found that the automobile and its party had gotten there ahead of them  ive found a place where we can store the biplane or whats left of it said tom in that barn and he pointed to a structure directly beside the tracks  good enough cried dick that will save the trouble and expense of hauling it any distance  the flat car was stopped in front of the barn and after some trouble the remains of the biplane were transferred to the structure then the section boss brought out a receipt which dick signed  next time i move a flying machine ill make sure that orders are o k he remarked grimly  it might save a lot of trouble answered tom dryly  tell me didnt you act on orders from that lawyer fogg questioned dick curiously  i did if you want to know  i thought so hes too sharp for his own good  youre right and maybe hell catch it for this answered jimmy budley and then he and his men rode away on the flat car leaving our friends to themselves  well now youve got the wreckage what are you going to do with it questioned stanley  offer it to the folks who build flying machines answered dick ill write the letters tonight  with the biplane off their minds the rovers rejoined their friends in the automobile and took a run through the country for fifty miles or more they stopped at a country hotel and there dick treated to cake ice cream and other refreshments  the letters to the flying machine manufacturers brought various replies several did not care to buy the wreckage at all while others offered a ridiculously low price  this doesnt look encouraging was dicks comment boys i guess well have to pocket our share of the loss  the next day however came another letter one from a young aviator of worcester he wrote that he had heard that they had the wreckage for sale and if it was still on the market he would come and look at it  maybe hell give us a little more than those manufacturers offer said sam hopefully  the letter was answered and the young aviator came on the next day going first to inspect the remains of the dartaway and then coming up to the college  pretty well smashed said he to the rover boys about all that is good is the motor and fittings  but that engine is a dandy said tom  how much do you want for the outfit as it stands  i dont know answered dick the biplane cost us about three thousand dollars  yes but shes a complete wreck all i can use is the engine and maybe a few other things  well make an offer put in tom  i might pay three hundred dollars  make it double that and the machine is yours returned dick  no it wouldnt be worth six hundred dollars to me answered the young aviator  a discussion lasting the best part of half an hour ensued the aviator went up to four hundred dollars and then to four hundred and fifty finally dick said he would accept five hundred dollars cash and the bargain was concluded at that figure the money was paid over and the rover boys gave the purchaser a bill of sale and he departed without delay stating he wished to make arrangements for shipping the wrecked biplane away  not so bad after all declared dick when the brothers were alone  its very good put in tom  thats the end of the dartaway came from sam mournfully well we had some pretty good times in her while she lasted    chapter viii   a box of candy  say ive got to have some fun or bust  it was tom who uttered the words for over a week everything had run along smoothly at brill college the boys had settled down to their studies they had sent letters home and to the girls and had received several communications in return they had been congratulated on their escape from the wrecking of the biplane and dora had written to dick urging him to give up flying  im going to give it up for a while at least dick had answered during those days the search had been kept up for josiah crabtree but so far nothing had been heard of the fugitive from justice that the man had left the neighborhood was quite probable  what sort of fun do you want tom asked sam throwing down the book he had been studying  oh anything was the answer i feel as if i was getting musty and rusty and ive simply got to do something wish there was a hazing on or something like that and the funloving rover gazed moodily out of the window  now dont you get yourself into trouble tom warned dick better get at that theme youve got to write on educational institutions of the revolutionary period  hang the themes dick ive got to have some fun and im going out for it answered tom and catching up his cap he passed out of the dormitory  guess ill go too added sam and quickly followed soon dick came also not wishing to be left behind if anything unusual was to take place  in the lower hallway the boys found several men at work cleaning and oiling the hardwood floor they had a box of wax polish with them and this immediately gave tom an idea  id like to buy a little of that he said to the head workman and a bargain was quickly struck and the funloving rover walked away with half a box of the wax polish  what are you going to do with it asked sam  dont know yet but ill do something was the reply  looks like maple sugar candy said dick gazing at the wax  wait ive struck it cried tom just the thing hurray and his face brightened  what is it tom asked both of his brothers  ill make william philander tubbs a present of this was the reply come on and watch how i do it  william philander has gone to see that new girl of his answered sam  not just yet but hell be on the way soon ill have to hurry if i want to do something  tom led the way up a back stairs and to the room occupied that term by tubbs and some other students they met the dudish student half dressed going to the lavatory to wash up  quick cried tom i hope i can find the box  what box asked dick as he and sam followed tom into tubbs room  the box of candy he bought for miss ruggles it was a dandy but maybe we can improve it just a little and tom grinned broadly  all looked around and presently found the box of candy on a dresser it was tied up with a blue ribbon but this tom slipped off with ease inside of the box were chocolates and bonbons and some candied fruit  hold the box sam said tom whipping out his knife weve got to move mighty quick  on the instant he was at work with his pocketknife cutting the floor wax into various shapes to resemble candy he took out some of the candied fruit and substituted the wax then he felt in his pocket  this will help he said bringing forth a soapstone slate pencil which he cracked into tiny lengths the candy that lasts he cried softly as he dropped the bits into the box  rather rough on the girl declared dick  not at all dick said sam i was introduced to her last week and the very next day she passed me on the road with a stare as if she had never seen me  and stanley says she is stuck up to the last degree added tom maybe this will take her down a peg anyway i hope so  sam was searching his pockets he brought out several dried beans and a heavy rubber elastic  the remains of a slingshot and ammunition i confiscated from a freshy who was taking shots at me he explained  drop the beans in theyll look like jelly beans cried tom and cut up that rubber band into pieces for jujubepaste  dick was at the door on guard and presently he gave a low whistle to notify the others that tubbs was coming back instantly tom shut the candy box put back the paper covering and ribbon and then he and sam slipped out of the dormitory by a side door so that the dudish student might not see them  such a joke as had been played tom could not keep to himself and when the rovers went downstairs he told stanley songbird and spud jackson  fine cried stanley that miss ruggles deserves it too she thinks just because her father has rocks that she is too good to even recognize any of us the only fellow she tolerates is tubby i guess because hes such a dude  tom wanted to follow william philander tubbs when he went to see the young lady who was stopping with an aunt who lived not far from brill the others were willing and all hung around the campus until the stylish student made his appearance  shes crazy for candy tubby told me so himself said spud eats about a barrelful a week so i understand thats why he got her the box i guess  if she eats that boxful shell be a good one was toms dry comment  it was not long before tubbs appeared the stylish student was faultlessly attired in light trousers dark prince albert coat white vest spats and a silk hat in one hand he carried a cane and in the other the box of candy  my but we are some swell murmured sam  he ought to pose for a fashion magazine returned tom keep back fellows or hell spot us and he pulled those nearest to him behind some shrubbery  william philander passed them and they followed at a safe distance in the darkness the dudish student headed directly for the house at which miss clarabel ruggles was stopping and the others saw him ascend the front piazza and ring the bell a servant ushered him in and the boys saw the light turned up in a parlor  come on and see the fun said tom and led the way across a lawn the curtains to the parlor windows were half up so they could look into the room with ease one window was partly open for ventilation  they saw william philander sitting in a chair the box of candy on his lap presently clarabel ruggles came in attired in an elaborate evening gown tubbs at once arose to his feet and bowing very low accepted her hand which was held on high then the dudish student said something and offered the box of candy  oh is this really for me those outside heard the young lady cry the words coming through the partly open window  no he bought it for the cat murmured tom and at this the others had to snicker  a er a slight token of my regard dont you know said william philander with a flourish  so kind of you mr tubbs the girl gazed hungrily at the box shall i open it now  if you wish to answered the dudish student gallantly  i will and you shall have a share of the candy said the young lady and quickly drew off the ribbon and paper oh my how perfectly delicious she murmured oh mr tubbs how could you guess just the kind i like  help yourself my dear miss ruggles said tubbs as the box was held out ladies first dont you know and he smiled sweetly  she took a candy and he did likewise and as they ate they talked of various things then the box was passed back and forth  yes i came to see if you would go to the er to the er stammered william philander and then he came to a dead halt oh my tooth he gasped suddenly  what is it mr tubbs  i er i really think ive broken one of my er teeth dont you know gasped the stylish student oh dear that candy is awfully hard  i didnt find it so mr tubbs here try another piece answered the young lady and helped both him and herself as you were going to say she added with a smile was it that concert that she too stopped short oh my she gasped  wha what is it stammered william philander  this piece of candy i have it tastes awfully queer  so does this piece i have groaned the dudish student  oh mr tubbs what kind of candy is it anyway my teeth are are stuck fast in it  at this moment the aunt of the young lady came in she looked in wonder at the others for both were making wry faces  its the candy aunt mabel cried the young lady it it tastes so queer  ha let me see that box exclaimed the aunt who was a portly person i read in the newspaper only yesterday of some folks being poisoned by eating cheap candy and she looked severely at poor tubbs  this is er not cheap candy my dear mrs garlett spluttered william philander it is some of the best to be had in ashton i assure you  by this time the lady had taken something from the box and was sampling it as it chanced to be a piece of the rubber band she made slow progress in chewing it  i never saw such candy she declared with vigor she took another piece that was all right she added a moment later but this piece why i declare it tastes like wax and it is wax too she continued inspecting the lump more closely  wax gasped poor william philander hollowly  yes wax mr tubbs  oh you must be mistaken my dear mrs garlett  humph i think i know wax when i see it and this is rubber nothing but rubber  oh aunt clarabel murmured the young lady  let me look at that box cried the lady of the house she commenced to make an inspection holding the box close to a lamp humph rubber bands beans slate pencils and polishing wax she declared mr tubbs do you call this a box of candy  upon my word mrs garlett i gasped the dudish student he did not know how to finish  its just some old horrid joke declared miss ruggles haughtily one of your college jokes i presume and she gazed scornfully at poor tubbs  no no i er i didnt i really gasped william philander  you can have your box of candy back mr tubbs went on the girl sarcastically i do not wish it and allow me to bid you good evening and with a stately bow she passed out of the room  ill keep this box of socalled candy and have it investigated said mrs garlett i dont want to be poisoned good night mr tubbs  but my dear mrs garlett  i said good night interrupted the lady of the house mary will show you to the door she added and then in complete bewilderment poor william philander rushed out of the residence and along the garden walk in the direction of the road leading to brill    chapter ix   a breakdown on the road  i rather think that was rough on william philander remarked dick with a serious shake of his head  oh he has got to be taken down somehow replied tom thats right added stanley why the way he acts towards some of the fellows is outrageous just because they dont dress as well as he does he thinks them beneath his notice  and i wouldnt waste any sympathy on that girl put in spud she is as bad as tubby when it comes to cutting the fellows she doesnt care to know  well i guess it will all pass over remarked sam and it must have for a few days later william philander and clarabel ruggles were seen out driving together and apparently as friendly as over the dudish student had sent the young lady a letter stating he thought some of his fellow collegians had doctored the box of candy and this explanation was accepted by the girl and her aunt then william philander sent the girl some candy he was sure was all right and also a big bouquet of roses and that was the end of the unpleasantness  it must not be thought that in those days the girls at hope seminary were forgotten whenever the rover boys got a chance they visited the place and many a nice time they and the girls had together on those occasions dick and dora would roam off together the others making no attempt to follow them and the pair would plan the many things they hoped to do in the future  you have not heard from josiah crabtree have you questioned dick on one of these visits  not a word and i dont want to hear from him replied dora  hes in hiding but hell let us hear from him sooner or later mark my words  oh i wish he hadnt escaped dick and dora clung tightly to his arm  well that cant be helped  is there anything new about your fathers business  nothing of any importance  how does he feel  in his last letter he said he felt somewhat better and was going to take a trip to new york how is your mother  quite well but the fact that old crabtree is at large disturbs her very much as soon as she heard of it she went over to the lanings home to stay  the boys had driven over to hope in a carriage when they started to return to brill it was quite dark  weve got to hurry up remarked tom as they rode away sam driving the team  why so asked dick we have no boning to do tonight  have you forgotten the spread bob grimes is going to give he said it was to be the finest yet given at brill and i dont want to miss it  thats so cried dick sure we want to be on hand since we are invited bob is a firstclass fellow  queer we forgot about that feast murmured sam but i suppose we were thinking too much of the girls and he grinned sheepishly  what time is the spread to come off tom asked his big brother  ten oclock sharp so bob said  in his room  his room and the one next to it they connect you know  well get there in plenty of time unless we have a breakdown which i dont expect  dont be too sure of that this carriage is none too good i said so when abner filbury brought it around for me  the wheels do appear to be somewhat shaky remarked sam  we miss the biplane for making quick trips returned tom with a sigh we ought to get a runabout an auto runabout i mean  thats the talk cried his younger brother if we had one of those we could run over to hope whenever we pleased  the main road was being repaired so at a certain place the boys had to turn off on a side road for a distance of nearly a mile here the going was anything but good and they went down in more than one rut or hollow  be careful sam warned dick dont drive so fast  oh go ahead put in tom impatiently we are losing a lot of time on this side road  just then came a narrow turn with a down grade very uneven and full of rocks over the latter bumped the carriage then came a sudden jounce followed by a crash  whoa yelled sam to the team and brought them to a standstill at the foot of the hill  what broke asked dick anxiously  the back axle i think answered tom as he leaped to the ground  the boys had a lantern with them and with this they looked for the damage done toms guess proved correct the back axle had given way close to the left wheel  whats to be done now asked sam in some dismay say i dont think that was my fault he added quickly  i told you to be careful returned dick now we are in a pickle and no mistake  if we had a wire we might bind up that axle said tom looking at the fracture which was in the form of a long split  but we havent any said dick he looked into the carriage nothing here but the hitching strap and i dont think that will do  there is a farmhouse said sam pointing to a light in a nearby field maybe i can get help there  well see said dick just draw up alongside the fence so that nobody will run into the carriage now that the main road is shut off everybody has to use this one  soon the carriage was safe by the roadside and then the three rovers hurried to where the light gleamed from the kitchen windows of a small farmhouse dick knocked on the door of the place  there was a stir from within and then the door was opened revealing an old man who held a lighted lamp in his trembling hand  who be yeou he drawled  we have had a breakdown on the road answered dick we thought we might get some help here  a breakdown eh what sort and the old man gazed curiously at the boys  in a few brief words the rovers explained matters  if you can let us have some wire or straps well pay you for them went on dick  i haint got much replied the old man im poor i am with havin sech rheumatism i cant work the farm but yeou kin look in the barn an see wot there is  the boys waited to hear no more but hurried to the structure indicated a building all but ready to fall down in a harness closet they found a few old straps and a coil of fence wire  i guess these will answer said dick  anyway let us try them sam you go back and pay the old man whatever he wants while tom and i do the mending  all right answered the youngest rover and hurried off in the direction of the farmhouse  sam found the old man sitting by a small table eating a frugal meal of beans and bread and coffee  we found three old straps and some fence wire said the youth what do you suppose they are worth  well im a poor man i be whined the old man i dont think yeou be goin to rob a poor old man  not at all answered sam kindly how much do you want  them tudder fellers wot had a breakdown give me a dollar fer wot they got said the old man shrewdly  if i give you a dollar will that be all right  i guess so answered the old man he knew what three straps and what wire were meant and knew they were not worth half the amount offered  who had the other breakdown asked sam as he handed over a dollar bill  some fellers in an autymobile a couple o weeks ago or so  some men in an automobile cried sam with sudden interest who were they  i dunno they left the autymobile in the barn one night an come fer it the next day they give me a dollar  how many men  two i think there was although one on em kept putty well out o sight as if he didnt want to be seen  how did the man look that you saw  oh he was a tall feller with a face that stuck out here and the old man pointed to his chin  and did he have real heavy eyebrows  he sure did eyebrows most as heavy as a moustache  how did the other man look  i dunno didnt git no good sight o him but say wot you askin about them fer do you know em  i think i know one of the men but i am not sure returned sam and went outside to join his brothers  dick and tom were deeply interested in what the old farmer had told their brother and as soon as the strapping and wiring of the split axle was completed all of the boys went into the house to ask the farmer more about the two men and the automobile  i cant tell yeou nuthin more said the farmer they left the autymobile in the barn all night an paid me a dollar fer it i dont know who they was or where they went  can you remember the date this happened asked dick  i certainly kin do that fer it was on my birthday the tenth  the day crabtree escaped murmured dick and sam and tom nodded  where did they go asked tom  i dunno they went off at night  this was all the old farmer could tell and a few minutes later the boys left him all were rather thoughtful as they got into the carriage once more and drove off  just to think of it cried tom crabtree was around here a night and a day and nobody knew it  its too bad we didnt get news of it before returned dick we might have followed up that autymobile as the old man called it but its too late now they must be miles and miles away crabtree may be in canada or on his way to africa or china  i dont believe hed go to africa or china said tom i think hell hang around trying to do us or the stanhopes or lanings an injury  just what i think put in sam id like to know who the fellow with the pointed chin and heavy eyebrows is  he must be some old friend or he wouldnt help crabtree to get away  either an old friend or else crabtree paid him pretty well for his services  well crabtree is gone and that is all there is to it  all the way to brill the boys discussed the situation at first they thought they would notify the authorities about what they had learned but finally concluded that this would do no good too much time had elapsed since the automobile had stopped at the old farmhouse  arriving at the college they turned the carriage over to abner filbury explaining about the axle and offering to pay for the damage done then they hurried to their room to get ready for the feast bob grimes was to give  as they entered the dormitory they saw a letter lying on the table it bore a special delivery stamp and was addressed to dick  hello whats this cried the oldest rover boy a letter from home and sent by special delivery what can it mean  no bad news i hope said sam his face sobering  read it dick put in tom it must be something important    chapter x   startling news  sam and tom watched with interest while dick tore open the envelope and took out the letter it contained the oldest rover boy scanned the communication hastily  what is it questioned both of his brothers impatiently  its from uncle randolph replied dick he says father went to new york several days ago  is that all  no he adds that he sent father a telegram and so far no answer has come back went on dick seriously he thinks something has happened to dad  oh dick cried sam what could happen to him  a great many things sam in a big city like new york he might get run down by a street car or an automobile or be hurt in the subway or on the elevated railroad he wasnt very well remember  yes i know that is that all  uncle randolph wants to know at once whether we have heard from dad during the past three days  we havent had a word broke in tom i thought it kind of strange too  the other boys read the letter and then the three talked the matter over they were interrupted by a knock on the door and stanley appeared  going to the spread arent you he questioned hurry up its getting late  i dont think i can go answered dick ive got something i must attend to this letter from my uncle and he held the communication up sam and tom can go  i dont feel much like it now murmured sam  neither do i added tom  oh you might as well go urged dick ill attend to the message to uncle randolph everything may be all right and there is no use of the three of us disappointing bob you go and explain why i didnt come  maybe you can come later suggested stanley  ill see but i must get word to my uncle first answered dick  while sam and tom got ready to attend the spread bob grimes was to give dick hurried downstairs again in the hallway he ran into paul orben one of the older students whom he knew real well  why in such a hurry dick questioned paul goodnaturedly grabbing him by the shoulder  i want to get to town to send a telegram home answered dick then struck by a sudden idea he added paul is your motorcycle ready for use  it is and if you want to use it to run down to ashton with take it answered the other readily he had once been up in the dartaway and was glad of a chance to pay the debt he thought he owed the rovers  thanks very much ill use it returned dick  come on then and ill make sure that it is all right  the two young collegians hurried to a room attached to the gymnasium where bicycles motorcycles and other things were kept soon the motorcycle was brought out and paul gave it a brief inspection  all right he announced i thought it would be  then im off answered dick and pushing the machine along the path towards the road he hopped into the seat and turned on the power  dick had never had much experience in running a motorcycle but he had tried one enough to know how it should be handled and soon he was well on his way and riding at a fair rate of speed the road was good and he had a fine headlight and almost before he knew it he had reached ashton and was approaching the depot  he had been afraid the ticket and telegraph office would be closed but he found the man inside making up a report  i want to rush a message home he said and i want to arrange to have it telephoned to our house i will pay the bill whatever it is  it will depend on whether we can get the operator at oak run said the man he may have locked up for the night  the message was written out and dick waited in the depot for an answer quarter of an hour passed slowly and then the telegraph operator came to him  sorry mr rover but oak run doesnt answer i guess the office is closed for the night  try for spotstown said dick naming another railroad station several miles further from his home  again came a wait  same story cant get spotstown either said the operator  well ive got to get somebody somehow murmured the oldest rover boy i guess you can get new york city cant you he asked with a faint smile  of course  then ill write another message  dick knew that when his father was in the habit of going to the metropolis he usually stopped at a large place on broadway which i shall call the outlook hotel he accordingly addressed a message to the manager of that hotel as follows  is anderson rover at your hotel if so have him telegraph me otherwise send me word at once  now i guess ill hear something thought dick as he turned in this telegram and paid for having it transmitted send it rush please he told the operator  again there was a wait this time of nearly half an hour at last the instrument commenced to click in the telegraph office and dick waited anxiously while the man took the message down  is it for me he asked and the man nodded as he continued to write  when the sheet was passed over the operator looked curiously at dick a look that made the youths heart sink with a hand that trembled in spite of his efforts to steady it the oldest rover boy held up the paper and read this    anderson rover was at this hotel until yesterday morning his   baggage is here bill unpaid left no word                                                              manager  gone murmured dick brokenly left no word bill unpaid what can it mean  something unusual eh said the operator as he took the bankbill the youth handed out to him for the message and gave back the change  very unusual was the reply i dont know what to make of this dick thought for a moment i suppose i cant get a train home before morning  no the first train for you is the eightfortyfive tomorrow  too bad i wish there was a train right away  there was no help for it and a few minutes later the youth left the depot and jumping on the motorcycle started back for brill college  as he rode along dicks thoughts were busy what had taken his parent to new york and why had he disappeared so mysteriously  he certainly must have gone there on business the business that has been bothering him so long he mused but would that cause him to disappear maybe he had an accident or was waylaid for his money  a thousand thoughts surged through poor dicks brain but he could reach no definite conclusion regarding his fathers disappearance yet he was certain of one thing  he didnt leave the hotel that way of his own accord he reasoned he would pay his bill and look after his baggage its for some outside reason that he didnt return to his hotel and answer uncle randolphs telegram  when dick arrived at the college he put the motorcycle away and went directly to his room sam and tom were still away but he heard them returning just as he was on the point of going after them as they came in he motioned for them to close and lock the door fortunately they had their rooms to themselves songbird their only roommate having gone away for the night  what did you learn dick asked both brothers quickly  not much and still a great deal he answered and told them how he had tried to send word home and had then called up the hotel in the metropolis  what do you make of this asked tom after he and sam had read the brief message from the hotel manager  do you think he met with an accident questioned sam  i dont know what to think  it looks mighty suspicious to me the bill unpaid and baggage left behind murmured tom then of a sudden he drew a sharp breath oh dick do you think and then tom stopped short  what tom  i i hate to say it but do you think its possible that dad got got a little bit out of his head with that business worrying him  its possible tom men have been known to get that way from business troubles and dad was far from well we all know that  he should have taken somebody to new york with him put in sam but its no use talking about that now the question is what are we going to do i cant stay here and study when he is missing  not much i couldnt study a thing cried tom  i know what i am going to do replied dick i am going to take that early train home and see uncle rudolph ill send another message to that hotel manager too and then unless we get word that everything is o k im going to new york as fast as i can get there  and ill go along cried each of the two brothers  yes that might be best for if he is still missing we may have a great task to learn what became of him well have to hunt the hospitals and the police headquarters and the the dick was going to add morgue but he could not bring himself to utter the word it was too awful to think that their father might be dead  well have to explain to doctor wallington or professor blackie said tom  and send word to the girls added sam  i dont want to worry anybody more than i have to said dick this may turn out all right after all he added but he had his doubts that something unusual had happened to his father he was certain  the boys spent some little time in packing their suitcases with such things as they deemed necessary for the trip and then turned out the lights and went to bed but none of them slept well all tumbled and tossed on their couches trying in vain to solve the mystery that surrounded the disappearance of their parent  they were up an hour earlier than usual and it was dick who took the liberty to knock on the door of the head of the institution  who is it asked the worthy doctor and the young collegian told him a moment later the head of the college appeared wrapped in a dressing gown  i am sorry to disturb you sir said dick but something has happened that has upset me and my brothers a great deal and he briefly related the condition of affairs and asked leave of absence for himself and tom and sam  this is certainly alarming said doctor wallington sympathetically i trust your father is speedily found and that nothing serious has happened to him yes you may go and remain as long as is necessary when he is found let me know  thank you sir said dick and after a few words more he hurried off then he and his brothers got an early breakfast and had abner filbury drive them to the ashton depot only a handful of students saw them depart  wish you success boys cried stanley after them  yes indeed added spud keep up a stout heart maybe its all right after all there may be some mistake somewhere    chapter xi   at the farm  oak run all out for oak run  it was the familiar cry of the brakeman of the train as the cars rolled into the little station at which the rover boys were to alight the ride from ashton had been without incident they had had to make two changes and had fretted not a little over a delay of half an hour at one junction point  theres old ricks cried sam motioning to the station master who was looking after some baggage remember the fun we had with him on our last trip here tom  indeed yes was the reply and the funloving rover grinned a little  no time for fun now put in dick quickly we want to get home just as soon as possible  from one of the telegraph offices along the line the boys had sent word ahead and at the station they found jack ness the hired man who had brought the family touring car  glad to see you back said the hired man touching his cap  any news jack asked the three in one voice  you mean from your father  yes  no and jack ness shook his head slowly not a line for several days your aunt an uncle are worried most to death  the boys leaped into the touring car dick taking the wheel and sam getting in beside him tom and the hired man occupied the tonneau with the baggage away they went in a cloud of dust over the frail bridge that spanned the river and through the village of dexters corners then they struck the country road leading to valley brook farm their home dick increased the speed to thirty miles an hour all the car would stand on such a highway  say well have an accident cried jack ness in alarm it aint safe to run so fast nohow  sit still jack dick knows what he is doing commanded tom we want to get home just as soon as we can  well i dont blame ye fer wantin to git home but i dont want to git kilt murmured the man of all work  farm after farm was passed and also a patch of timber land then they swept around a turn and came in sight of valley brook with its broad fields and its gurgling brook flowing down to swift river  theres aleck shouted sam pointing to a colored man who was standing at the entrance to a lane he waved his hand and alexander pop one of the servants and a man who had made many trips with the rovers took off his hat and waved in return  as he swung up to the broad piazza of the house dick honked the automobile horn at once the door flew open and mrs rover ran out followed by her husband  oh boys i am so glad to see you cried mrs rover  how are you aunt martha returned sam leaping out and kissing her an example speedily followed by his brothers  very glad you came said randolph rover a tall thin and studiouslooking man wearing big spectacles he shook hands all around come right into the house  you havent any word from dad questioned sam  nothing boys and i do not know what to make of it  it is a fearful state of affairs burst out mrs rover and tears stood in her motherly eyes we cannot imagine what has happened to your father  i sent another telegram to that hotel said dick i asked the manager to send his reply here  it was a rather sad homecoming and even tom felt much depressed in spirits all filed into the house and to the sittingroom leaving jack ness and aleck pop to look after the automobile and the baggage  we ought to get a message from new york soon remarked dick after his uncle had related the little he had to tell about how anderson rover had gone away on the trip to the metropolis evidently randolph rover knew little about the business that had taken his brother to the city he was no business man himself being wrapped up in what he called scientific farming and probably the boys father had not thought it worth while to take him into his confidence  dinner was on the table and the boys went to the diningroom to eat but nobody had any appetite and the fine repast prepared by the cook under mrs rovers directions was much of a failure once the telephone rang and the boys rushed to it but the call was only a local one of little consequence  i think the best thing i can do will be to go over dads private papers said dick presently they may give me a clew of where to look for him in new york  thats the talk cried tom come on lets get busy he hated to sit still at any time and just at present inactivity was doubly irksome  during the past year a room had been added to the house and this was used as a library and sort of office combined being provided with a substantial safe and two rollertop desks one of the desks was used exclusively by anderson rover for his private letters and papers when sick the man had given dick the extra key to the desk telling him to keep it the father trusted his three sons implicitly only keeping to himself such business affairs as he thought would not interest them  the boys sat down and led by dick began a careful inspection of the many letters and documents which the rollertop desk contained a large number of the papers and letters they knew had no bearing on the affair now in hand but presently dick took up some letters of recent date and scanned them with interest  i guess this is what we are after he cried  i was afraid it might be that  what is it asked his brothers  that old irrigation scheme the one run by pelter japson  company of wall street new york  why i thought dad had dropped that said sam in surprise  he tried to but they held him to some agreement i dont know exactly what they wanted to get more money out of him if they could  and you think he went to new york on that account dick asked tom  it looks so to me  but that doesnt account for his disappearance  perhaps it does  what do you mean  those fellows may be holding him a prisoner or they may even have put him out of the way altogether although i doubt if they are as bad as all that  some men would do anything for money grumbled sam but what good would it do to hold him a prisoner  they may want to force him to sign some papers or give up some papers he is holding sam one thing is certain they were very anxious to see him these letters show that  hadnt we better telegraph to them and see what they have to say suggested tom  perhaps tom but somehow i dont think that would be a wise move to make father did not trust them he said they were sharpers if we sent them any word it might put them more on guard than they would otherwise be i think the best thing to do is to go to new york and interview them personally if we dont get word from dad before we leave  i think commenced tom and just then the telephone bell rang and all rushed to it dick took up the receiver  is this the rovers house asked a voice over the wire  yes  i have a telegraph message for richard rover  all right mr barnes answered dick what is it he had recognized the voice of the telegraph operator at oak run  oh its you is it mr rover returned the operator this is from new york city and is signed thomas a garley  yes yes read the message cried dick and all three boys listened closely while dick held the receiver  he says no news of anderson rover better come on and investigate  is that all  yes and the operator repeated the message ill mail the sheet to you he added  all right much obliged dick turned to his brothers shall i send word back that we are coming he questioned  yes  take this message down mr barnes went on dick and dictated what he wished to say ill settle next time i see you he added and hung up the receiver  the uncle and the aunt of the boys wished to know the news if such it can be called and the lads told them at once mrs rover burst into tears  i am sure something has befallen anderson she sobbed oh what shall we do randolph  i i think i had better go to new york and er make some er inquiries answered her husband somewhat helplessly for a visit to the teeming metropolis always appalled him  no you stay here and wait for some word uncle randolph said dick sam and tom and i are going to new york  oh boys cried mrs rover going alone  why not aunt martha asked sam we are not afraid  i know that but this is er no ordinary trip you may get into trouble and  if we do well get out of it again put in tom grimly  oh if only we knew what had become of your dear father and the ladys eyes filled again with tears while uncle randolph looked deeply sympathetic  i think we had better start at once went on dick we can get the fivethirty train down  what tonight exclaimed the aunt why that will get you to new york at midnight  just about said tom  you had better start in the morning what will you do at midnight in a big city like new york  well go direct to the outlook hotel answered dick and then if we cant find out anything about father we can go down to the offices of pelter japson  company in the morning  and if you dont find out anything there asked randolph rover timidly  then well go to the police and maybe get a detective or two on the case returned dick and well have to look up the hospitals in case he met with an accident but i dont think he has met with any accident he continued hastily for he saw how alarmed his aunt was becoming for if he had an accident the authorities would find out from the things in his pockets who he was and notify us or the hotel  mrs rover heaved a deep sigh and her husband shook his head slowly dick closed the desk again and locked it and then the three boys hurried to their rooms to prepare for the trip to the metropolis  say i dun heah dat you am gwine to new york came a voice from the entrance to dicks bedroom and looking up from the suitcase he was packing the oldest rover boy saw aleck pop standing there an anxious look on his ebony face  yes aleck we are going to take the fivethirty train you can tell jack to get the car ready  want me to go along asked the colored man wistfully  no aleck not this trip you stay here and do what you can for my aunt and uncle  yo father am missing aint he  yes  its too bad hope you find him dick i do indeed ill tell jack about dat auto and aleck pop went off shaking his head in sorrow he loved all of the rovers and their troubles were his own    chapter xii   off for new york  boys you must take care and not get into trouble  and as soon as you have word of your father let us know  thus spoke aunt martha and uncle randolph as the three rover boys stood ready to say goodbye the automobile was already at the door and their suitcases were in the tonneau  well take care of ourselves said dick and as soon as we get any word well let you know and remember uncle randolph if any word comes to the farm you are to forward it at once to the outlook hotel  yes ill remember that answered the uncle  the boys kissed their aunt who shed silent tears at their departure to aunt martha the great metropolis was a wonderful as well as dangerous place  goodbye cried tom and was the first to climb into the automobile getting into the drivers seat jack ness was to go with them as far as oak run to bring the touring car back  the other lads climbed in and all those left at the farm waved them an adieu then tom threw in the dutch and off they sped down the lane to the main road soon a cloud of dust hid them from view  its awful randolph murmured mrs rover to her husband new york is such a busy place and there are so many wicked people in it  the boys know how to take care of themselves answered randolph rover why they even took care of themselves when they were cast away on that island in the pacific ocean he added referring to happenings which i have related in detail in the volume entitled the rover boys on land and sea  true but but i am nervous about this trip and then what can have happened to anderson  that i dont know maybe a street car or an automobile ran over him they have such accidents in new york every day so ive been told  i know it oh it is terrible this suspense and mrs rover walked away the tears still coursing down her cheeks  in the meanwhile the touring car was making good time along the road to oak run at dexters corners they stopped at the postoffice for letters there were three one for each boy but not one was postmarked new york they were from the girls at brill  glad to hear from the girls said sam but just the same this time id rather get word from new york  so would i added dick  ditto here echoed tom with a longdrawn sigh  without waiting to read the communications the lads kept on to the oak run depot they could hear the train coming through the hills and presently it glided into sight and up to the station  good luck to ye shouted jack ness as they boarded one of the cars and then he turned back towards the farm with the touring car  the train was not more than half filled so the three youths had but little difficulty in getting seats they turned one of the seats over so that they might face each other and put their suitcases in the racks overhead  guess we might as well read our letters said dick as soon as they were settled he was anxious to learn what dora had written he had asked her to write to her mother concerning their proposed marriage  just what i say added tom and soon he and sam had settled back following their big brothers example  the communication from dora was quite long and dick enjoyed it so thoroughly that he read it twice before stowing it away in his breast pocket the girl stated that her mother had left everything to her own judgment and that she in turn was willing to leave everything to dick  dear dear dora he mused the sweetest girl in all the world i only hope i prove worthy of her and then he sat back and pictured to himself the happy home they would establish as soon as everything could be arranged had it not been for the cloud concerning his father dick would have been the happiest youth in the world  well they are not doing much at hope remarked sam society meetings fudge patties and grinding away at themes  just what nellie writes answered tom well you cant expect much fun when you are trying to get an education and he sighed as he thought of what was before him at brill in a way he envied dick his opportunity to break away and get out into the business world  it had been too early to get supper before leaving home although their aunt had offered it so about seven oclock the lads went into the dining car attached to the train they found a table for four vacant and took possession and presently ordered what they wanted  hello look there exclaimed tom in a low voice after looking around the dining car and he pointed to a man at one of the tables for two  its that lawyer who settled for the smashed biplane returned sam must be going to new york too  most likely his profession takes him to the city quite often remarked dick  wonder if hell speak to us if he sees us ventured sam  i dont know and i dont care came from his big brother i didnt like him at all he was too craftylike  their food served the boys fell to eating with that gusto that characterizes youths who are still growing they had about half finished when dick felt himself touched on the arm at his side stood belright fogg  taking a little trip eh remarked the railroad lawyer with a bland smile  yes answered dick shortly  to new york i suppose  yes  well you got settled about that flying machine didnt you went on the lawyer and dropped into the vacant seat opposite dick on the side where tom sat  we did but we had some trouble replied tom  that was a mistake to remove the machine said belright fogg he gazed at the boys a moment i understand you sold the wreck for quite a price he continued  we didnt get as much as we wanted said sam we are still quite something out of pocket  but not as much as the railroad company the lawyer gave a brief chuckle which surprised the lads oh its all right so far as i am concerned he continued maybe youd be interested to know that i no longer represent that road  you dont and now dick was interested  no i handed in my resignation three days ago answered belright fogg he did not add that he had been asked to resign by the head of the railroad company because of irregularities in his accounts and because of several professional shortcomings  going to give up law asked tom for the want of something better to say  not at all my boy i am going down to the city to practice my profession there is a much larger field for my abilities down there than up here belright fogg answered loftily  yes new york is pretty large responded tom dryly  i expect to open my offices in a few days went on the lawyer if you ever have any business down there come in and see me i will mail you one of my cards and with another bland smile and a bow he passed out of the dining car  oh my but we are some pumpkins murmured tom first thing you know hell be putting all the other lawyers in new york out of business  i shouldnt want him for a lawyer remarked sam he doesnt impress me very favorably  handed in his resignation eh mused dick more than likely he had to do it no i shouldnt want anything to do with him  the boys finished their meal and after paying the bill returned to their former seats they looked around for belright fogg but he was evidently in some other car of the train  it was dark so they could see little of the country through which they were passing at one station at which they stopped a newsboy came through the train crying his wares and dick purchased several metropolitan evening papers and handed them around  nothing but politics a murder a big auto race and a new war in central america remarked tom thumbing over his paper how tired the reporters must get of writing about the same kind of things every day  they must have exciting times getting the news sometimes returned sam  heres an advertisement that will interest you remarked dick and he pointed to the bottom of a page pelter japson  company advertise themselves as brokers and dealers in highclass western securities and they offer stock in that sunset irrigation company thats the company dad was interested in  all of the boys read the advertisement carefully but it added nothing to their stock of knowledge then they looked the newspapers over some more and finally threw them away  wish we were in new york sighed sam he was growing tired having been on the go since early morning  well be there inside of half an hour returned dick after consulting his watch  presently the long train rolled into the city and came to a stop at one hundred and twentyfifth street then they rolled on and on through the city past block after block of apartment houses stores and offices and private dwellings  talk about a bee hive murmured tom you cant beat new york city no matter where you go  well chicago is a close second answered dick  and st louis and philadelphia and some other cities put in sam ours is a big country and no mistake  the passengers were already getting their belongings together and in the parlor cars the porters were brushing off the people and incidentally pocketing various tips then the train rolled into the grand central depot now called the grand central terminal  last stop was the cry and the boys piled out each with his suitcase the sleepy crowd moved along the long platform in the glare of the electric lights and through the depot into the busy street  cab taxi carry your baggage such were some of the cries which greeted the boys ears as they emerged on fortysecond street the clang of the street car gongs added to the din and newsboys were everywhere crying the latest editions of the afternoon papers  ill get a taxi to take us down to the hotel said dick and soon the brothers were in a taxicab with the suitcases in front next to the driver outlook hotel he ordered and away they moved out of the maze of vehicles for certain thoroughfares of the metropolis are crowded nearly every hour out of the twentyfour  somebody told me that new york never sleeps and i guess that is true remarked sam it is halfpast twelve and look at the people  the taxicab turned over into fifth avenue and sped down that noted thoroughfare for about ten blocks then it made another turn westward and reached broadway and almost before they knew it the boys were at the main entrance to the outlook hotel  leaving the driver to turn the baggage over to the hotel porters dick paid the fellow and hurried into the building with tom and sam at his heels they found the night clerk and his assistant at the desk  i am richard rover said dick to the head clerk  oh yes mr rover was the answer i am glad you have come  have you any word about my father went an dick quickly  nothing mr rover we have made all sorts of inquiries but we havent learned a single thing excepting that he walked out of this hotel alone and didnt come back    chapter xiii   at the outlook hotel  the news had not been totally unexpected yet the three lads felt very much depressed they had hoped that some sort of word might have been received concerning their father while they were speeding towards new york on the train  i wish you would give me all the particulars went on dick  here comes the manager he can tell you more than i can replied the clerk and he nodded in the direction of a tall heavyset individual who was approaching  so you are mr rovers sons eh said mr garley as he shook hands i am sorry for you indeed i am this is certainly a puzzle come in here and i will tell you all i know and he led the way to a small reception parlor that was just then unoccupied he drew two chairs up to a small sofa so that all might sit close together  i dont suppose any word came from the farm for us suggested sam as he was about to sit down  if anything came in the name of rover id know about it returned the hotel manager i am very much interested in this case  have you spoken to the police about it asked tom  not yet i thought that perhaps you would not like it sometimes you know men go away and leave no word and later on they come back and they dont want anything said about it so we have to be careful  what have you got to tell us asked dick  it isnt very much in the first place though i dont think your father was in the best of health i noticed that and so did one of my clerks and one of the elevator men  did he have an attack while he was here cried sam  i dont know about that but we all noticed that he was feeble at times and that he seemed to be very much worried over something he was continually getting his notebook out and doing some writing or figuring and then he would shake his head as if it didnt please him at all  yes he was worried over some business matters answered dick but that wasnt bad enough to make him go off like this and leave no word when was he last seen  in the morning about ten oclock he came down in one of the elevators with a small package in his hand a package so the elevator man said that looked like some legal documents he seemed to be very much disturbed and the man said he talked to himself he hurried out of the side door of the hotel but one of the doormen saw him go to the corner and turn down broadway and that was the last seen of him so far as we knew  and what of the things in his room questioned dick  outside of the usual cleaning up i have had everything left as it was answered the hotel manager you may go up there if you wish  we will and well most likely want rooms too  the room next to his is vacant you can have that if you wish  all right well take it returned tom do they connect  yes ill have the hallman unlock the connecting door for you  they were soon in an elevator a boy bringing up their baggage they passed to the fourth floor of the hotel and to the rear  your father wanted a quiet room so we put him on the court explained the manager of the outlook hotel as he unlocked the door and turned on the electric lights  it was a typical hotel room of the better class with a brass bed a bureau a desk and several chairs at one side was a small bathroom  on a chair rested mr rovers suitcase locked but unstrapped on the bureau were his comb and brush a whisk broom and some other toilet articles on some hooks hung a coat and a cap they glanced into the bathroom and in a cup on the marble washstand saw his toothbrush  he certainly meant to come back murmured tom  yes and that very soon or else he wouldnt have left these things lying around added his younger brother  dick passed over to the coat that hung on a hook and felt in the pockets they contained nothing but some railroad timetables  cant you call up some of your fathers business friends or acquaintances suggested the hotel manager  he had very few acquaintances in the city answered dick he used to have some close friends but they are either dead or have moved away as for the business men he had dealings with i guess i had better see them in the morning  then if there isnt anything more i can do ill leave you returned the hotel manager  nothing more at present answered dick  with the hotel manager gone the boys closed the door leading to the hallway and sat down to discuss the situation the door between the two bedrooms had already been opened by a hallman so that they would have ample sleeping accommodations when they wished to retire but just now they were too excited and worried to think of sleeping  maybe we had better put the police at work suggested sam  we surely ought to do something added tom  what can the police do with no clews to work on asked their big brother  they might look around in the hospitals for him  i dont think well find him in any hospital  why not if he met with an accident  i dont believe there was any accident continued dick earnestly  do you think he met with foul play at the hands of those men he came to see demanded sam  it looks that way to me sam  then we ought to have them locked up at once  how can we when we have no evidence against them  let us look into dads suitcase suggested tom  ill see if i can unlock it  dick had a bunch of keys in his pocket as did tom and sam and the boys tried the keys one after another at last they found one which fitted and the suitcase came open  the bag contained the usual assortment of wearing apparel which mr rover was in the habit of carrying when on a trip that was to last but a few days or a week in addition there were several letters and documents placed in a thick manila envelope and marked with the owners name  the boys read the letters and documents with interest from them they learned that mr rover had been requested to come to the city immediately to see about some business connected with the sunset irrigation company the documents were some transfers of stock which they did not quite understand  he came down here to see pelter japson  company thats certain remarked dick it eras evidently the only reason why he came to new york now the question is did he go and see those men and did they waylay him or did they hire somebody to do it  i wish we knew more about those men said tom you can soon size a fellow up when you talk to him  not always answered sam sometimes the smoothest talkers are the greatest rascals dont you remember how nicely josiah crabtree used to talk to mrs stanhope and see what a rascal he turned out to be  i wonder if they have captured him yet mused tom  never mind crabtree now put in dick what we want to do is to find father i dont know exactly how we are going at it but i think ill have some sort of plan by morning  we can go down to pelter japson  company and make them tell what they know said sam  theyll tell what they feel like telling sam and that might not do us any good mind you i dont say they did father any harm but i know they didnt like the way he was getting after them for they knew that sooner or later he might sue them and possibly put one or more of them in jail for fraud  for fully an hour the boys talked the situation over and by that time sam was so sleepy he could scarcely keep his eyes open then they retired dick remaining in the apartment his father had occupied and sam and tom taking the next room  for over half an hour dick turned and tossed on the bed his mind filled with thoughts of his father what had become of his parent had he been hurt or killed or was he being held a prisoner by his enemies what if his father should never be heard of again the last thought was so horrible it made the youth shiver  weve got to find him he murmured as he drew the bedclothes around him weve got to do it  at last dick fell into a troubled sleep following the example of his brothers who had also found difficulty in settling themselves  presently the oldest rover boy awoke with a start he sat up in bed wondering what had thus awakened him  from the next room came the regular breathing of sam and tom showing that they were still in the land of slumber dick listened but no unusual sound broke the stillness  it must have been my nervousness he thought fathers disappearance has been too much for me well its enough to get on anybodys nerves  he prepared to lie down again when a faint scraping sound caught his ear he listened intently  somebody was at the hallway door trying to insert a key in the lock but the key would not go in because of the key already there  maybe its father coming back thought the youth and leaped from the bed to the floor three steps took him to the door and he quickly turned the key and caught hold of the handle  as dick started to fling the door open he heard a muttered exclamation of dismay in the hall outside then came the sound of retreating footsteps and a slight tinkle as of metal striking metal  hi stop who are you called the youth and the cry aroused tom and sam he flung open the door and leaped into the semidark hallway the figure of a man was just disappearing around a corner dick saw that he wore a heavy beard and that was all  the oldest rover boy was thoroughly aroused now and calling to sam and tom to follow he darted after the flying individual but by the time he reached the corner of the corridor the man was out of sight he heard a distant door shut and then all became quiet  who was it asked tom as he joined dick  was the fellow in your room asked sam  no but he was trying to get in answered dick when i woke up he was trying to put a key in the lock when i started to open the door thinking it might be dad the fellow ran away  was it a hallman  i dont think so  where did he go to  somewhere in this part of the hotel i just heard a door shut  then he must be on this floor said tom say we ought to investigate this did you get a look at him dick  not much of a look i saw he had a heavy beard  by this time one of the hallmen was coming up and to him the boys explained what had happened he was much interested for he knew about the disappearance of mr rover and said he would report to the office  i think i heard something drop said dick as the boys returned to the rooms to put on some clothing hello here they are a bunch of keys and he held them up  one of em is new said sam examining the bunch  maybe it was made for the lock of the door to the room father occupied suggested tom  its like the old key returned dick comparing the two that rascal whoever he is must have had the key made for the sole purpose of getting into this room  but for what reason questioned sam  to get at dads private papers answered his big brother boys if we catch that man maybe well be able to find out what has become of father    chapter xiv   dick makes a discovery  while the boys were discussing the situation one of the night clerks of the hotel arrived having been summoned by the hallman he listened with interest to what the lads had to tell  ill set the house detective on this he said we cant allow anybody to prowl around trying to use false keys  we want to catch that man ourselves said dick we are going to set a watch for him no more sleep for us tonight  i dont blame you returned the clerk if you spot him call up the office and well give you all the help you want  the boys hurried into their clothing and then led by dick walked noiselessly through the various hallways of the big hotel in the direction where the oldest rover boy had heard the door shut but though they passed many doors dick could not determine which was the right one  let us set a regular watch suggested tom we can take turns one can watch while the others sleep  all right ill watch first answered dick  call me in an hour dick returned tom  and call me an hour after that if you want me added sam  the hallway was long and but dimly lighted at the end was a sofa and after walking up and down several times dick sat down on this the long journey from valley brook farm had made him sleepy but he resolved to keep wide awake in case the mysterious individual should again show himself  hes got to come out of his door some time unless he tries to get away by a fire escape thought the youth and i guess all the fire escapes on this side of the building are at the end of the hall i hope ive got him trapped whoever he is  half an hour went by and nothing unusual happened then dick heard a distant elevator stop and two men got off and came down the hallway they stared rather curiously at the youth  whats the matter asked one presently  waiting for a friend was the answer  humph rather late remarked the man  better say early jack laughed the other its ten after two  is that so great scott time we got to bed and the two men passed into a nearby room locking the door after them  after that came another period of silence broken only by the sounds of the two men undressing to keep himself awake dick commenced to walk up and down the long hallway again  i guess ill call tom he thought at last after more than an hour had passed ive got to get some sleep or i wont be worth anything in the morning and if i am to call on messrs pelter japson  company i want to have my wits about me  he stepped around the corner of the hallway in the direction where his own room was located he did not know that a man with eager eyes was watching him a man who stood on a chair in one of the rooms peering through the transom light of the door  gone at last i was afraid he would stay here all night muttered the man now is my chance to get away i didnt think theyd get here tonight i should have gotten that key made sooner and opening the door noiselessly he came out into the hallway he wore a thin overcoat and a slouch hat and a heavy beard covered his face  dick hurried his steps and called tom and then went back to the other hallway unwilling to leave it unguarded even for a few minutes he was just in time to see somebody disappearing down a broad flight of stairs to the floor below  hello whos that he asked himself and ran towards the stairs when he arrived there he looked down to see the man going down further to the ground floor of the hotel  the same fellow ill bet all im worth cried dick there is that heavy beard he must have been watching for a chance to get away what a chump i was to let him get out ive got to stop him and he bounded down the stairs three steps at a time  by the time dick reached the next floor the man was in the lower corridor of the big hotel here in spite of the hour quite a few people were stirring coming in from late suppers after an evening at the play or opera the man moved into the crowd and towards the main entrance on broadway  hi stop him stop that man cried the oldest rover boy as he too gained the lower corridor but the man had already gotten out on broadway as dick came out he saw the fellow run across the street to a distant corner and leap into a taxicab that was empty the driver was on the seat and the turnout started rapidly away  youre not going to get away if i can help it muttered dick desperately and looked around for another taxicab one stood halfway down the block the driver taking a nap inside  wake up exclaimed dick shaking the man see that taxi i want to follow it dont let it get out of your sight if you want your fare and a couple of dollars besides  im on answered the driver and leaped into his seat while dick got into the cab away they started in the full glare of the electric lights of broadway  the course was downtown and the first taxicab made rapid progress the man inside looked back and when he saw dick following him he spoke hurriedly to his driver then the cab turned swiftly into a side street and reaching fifth avenue shot northward on that wellknown thoroughfare  can you catch that other taxi asked dick anxiously  i can try was the grim answer hes going some though  maybe theyll be held up at some cross street  not this time in the morning answered the driver theyve got a straight road to the park  on and on went one taxicab after the other fiftyfifth street was passed and still the first turnout kept well in the lead but then a big furniture van appeared out of a side street and the cab ahead had to slow down  now is your chance cried dick run up alongside of em  his driver did as requested but then came a mixup as two more cabs appeared and dicks was caught between them he looked ahead and saw the man with the heavy beard leap to the ground  guess your man is going to run for the park cried the taxicab driver hold on i want my money first young fellow  dick had leaped to the ground bent on catching the fleeing individual he pulled some bills from his pocket  here is five dollars wait for me he cried or maybe you had better come along that fellow is a criminal  ill wait here answered the taxicab driver he did not wish to become mixed up in an affair which he did not understand  the corner of central park at fiftyseventh street was already in sight the bearded man ran swiftly across the broad plaza and the sidewalk then he darted along the side of the park and on to the path leading to the menagerie in a moment more the darkness of the place swallowed him up  hey there what are you running for it was a challenge from a park policeman as he stepped in front of dick  i wanted to catch that man who just ran in here explained the youth  i didnt see any man  well he went in here just now he ran away from the outlook hotel in a taxi and got out just below here  who is he asked the policeman becoming interested  i dont know but he tried to get in my room at the hotel the hotel men want to catch him  humph well hes gone now  dick continued to look around for the escaped man but it was all to no purpose then he returned to where he had left the taxicab he found his driver in earnest conversation with the other driver  that fellow didnt pay me a cent complained the other driver bitterly an after me doing my best for him too  why did you try to run away asked dick coldly  i thought it was all right he said he had a phone message that his father was dying and he must git up town at once and he promised me big pay i didnt know he was trying to git away from anybody  well its too bad he got away from all of us by the way can you describe him to me went on dick curiously  dont you know him  only by reputation and thats bad and dick smiled grimly  he was tall and thin and didnt have much hair on his head i think them whiskers was false  anything else that you remember  he had two of his front teeth filled with gold i noticed it when he yawned under the electric lights  two front teeth filled with gold cried dick in amazement and tall and thin can it be possible  do you know him after all asked the man who had given the information  perhaps i do tell me some more about him how was he dressed and how did he talk  as well as he was able the taxicab man described the individual who had gotten away as he proceeded dick became more and more convinced that he was on the right trail  here is a dollar for what you have told me said he to the driver if you spot that rascal have him arrested and call up the outlook hotel he added  all right ill remember that was the ready answer  ill go back to the hotel said the youth to his own driver he knew that sam and tom would be wondering what had become of him  it took but a short while to reach the outlook hotel and there dick found not only sam and tom but also a clerk and several others awaiting his return he settled with the driver and dismissed him  do you know anything about the man who got away asked dick of the clerk  not much he came here several days ago and registered under the name of peter smith of pittsburgh all he had was a small valise and that is still in his room  anything in it  i dont know we can go up and take a look  its a pity you didnt catch the rascal whoever he is was toms comment  wait whispered dick to his brothers ive got something to tell you  all passed upstairs in an elevator and the clerk led the way to the room which the patron calling himself peter smith had occupied all the apartment contained was a rustylooking valise  must have picked that up at some secondhand store was sams comment  the valise was unlocked and the clerk opened it it contained nothing but a comb and brush and some magazines  humph a dead beat muttered the clerk he put the magazines inside to make the valise feel as if it was filled with clothing its an old game be intended to leave without paying his bill i wish you had collared him  i wish i had answered dick and then he and his brothers returned to their own rooms  what have you got to tell demanded tom when they were alone  ive found out who that man was answered dick  who questioned sam  josiah crabtree    chapter xv   at the brokers office  sam and tom gazed at their brother in amazement  josiah crabtree exclaimed the youngest rover  how did you find that out questioned tom  i suspected crabtree as soon as i saw the man jump into the taxicab answered dick there was something about his form and in the way he ran that looked familiar then the taxi driver told me he had two front teeth filled with gold that put me on the trail and from what the man told me i am sure the fellow was old crabtree  but if it was crabtree what has he to do with dads visit to new york asked sam  that remains to be found out but one thing is sure crabtree knows that father is missing and he had that extra key made to get into the room during fathers absence  but where is dad do you imagine crabtree had anything to do with his disappearance came from tom  i certainly do maybe crabtree is holding him a prisoner  then pelter japson  company havent anything to do with it  i wouldnt say that tom the whole crowd may be working together  you think crabtree knows those other men  it may be so i am not sure but i am sure of one thing went on dick decidedly dad didnt meet with any accident his disappearance is due to crabtree and likely to some of his other enemies  well that clears up one corner of the mystery said sam but it doesnt get us any nearer to finding dad  i think it does sam if we can locate crabtree i think we can locate father  but how are we going to locate crabtree  i dont know but if we keep our eyes and ears open we may learn something in the morning some of us can call on those brokers and see what they have to say continued the big brother  some of us i thought we were all going remarked tom  ive got a new plan tom ill tell you about it in the morning now as there is no use of watching that room any longer let us try to get a little sleep  it will be very little murmured sam consulting his watch it is nearly five oclock already  well sleep until eight oclock those brokers dont get to business until nearly ten  once more the boys retired and after much turning all dropped into slumber dick had made up his mind to awaken at eight oclock and promptly at that hour he opened his eyes his brothers were still asleep and he allowed them half an hour longer for he knew they needed it  now then dick whats your programme asked tom while he was dressing  my programme is this answered the big brother instead of the three of us calling on pelter japson  company i think one is enough and that ought to be me for i have already met mr pelter once when i came to new york with dad  but what do you want to leave us out for grumbled sam  i dont want to leave you out i want you to be doing something else for we have no time to lose in this matter i want you sam to come with me and when i go into the offices i want you to hang around outside and watch for old crabtree if he is in league with the brokers he may be looking for a chance to interview them but he will be on his guard knowing that we are here  what am i to do asked tom  i think you had better go up to central park tom and see if you can find out anything there about crabtree maybe some of the night prowlers around there saw him last night anyway i dont want you to be seen at the offices with me for ive got another plan in my head if this one fails went on dick  all right dick well do what you say was toms reply  the boys went below and obtained breakfast in the hotel restaurant then they went to the desk to ask for letters and then to the telegraph office to send a brief message to the farm  have you discovered anything questioned the hotel manager as he came up to them  not a great deal answered dick but we hope to get on the track of something today  hope you do what about those two rooms  well keep them for the present mr garley  all right  and i want you to watch out so that no outsider gets into them went on dick  leave that to me mr rover my men have their instructions we cant afford to leave our guests go unprotected  good if anybody tries to get into our rooms i want you to have him arrested and held  hell be held dont worry about that answered the hotel manager grimly  a little later the three rover boys separated tom walking over to fifth avenue to take an auto bus going uptown as that would land him close to the park entrance  we might as well take a broadway car down to wall street said dick to sam we have plenty of time and i dont like the air in the subway  i like the street cars better anyway responded the younger brother a fellow can see more  as was to be expected the car was crowded and the boys had to take strap seats as sam called them standing up in the aisle holding on to a strap to keep from falling or sitting down suddenly into somebodys lap when the car made a turn they swept down past union square and block after block of tall business buildings  my what a big place new york is remarked sam its a regular bee hive and no mistake  we are coming down to the post office said dick a little later  gracious see the building opposite gasped sam its higher than a church steeple wonder how many stories it is  fifty stories answered a young man standing beside him  soon the car was in lower broadway and the boys watched out for wall street that narrow but famous thoroughfare opposite trinity church it was soon reached and in company with several men and boys they left the car  dick had the address of the brokers in his pocket and the place was easily found the offices were located in an old building one of the oldest on the street and also one of the shabbiest but it was five stories in height and boasted of two elevators and was from appearances filled with prosperous tenants in wall street rents are so high that many a person doing business there is willing to take whatever quarters he can get  now you hang around in the street here until i come back said dick to sam keep out of sight all you can so that if crabtree comes along he wont see you ill go up and see what pelter japson  company have to say  how long will you be gone dick  not more than half an hour at the most and maybe not half that responded the big brother  sam dropped behind and dick entered the dingy office building from the directory on the wall the oldest rover boy learned that the brokers were located on the fourth floor rooms 408 to 412 the numerals really meaning offices 8 to 12 on floor 4 he got into one of the narrow elevators and soon reached the fourth floor  the offices of pelter japson  company were located in the rear overlooking the roof of a restaurant on the street beyond dick entered a tiny waiting room and an office boy came to ask what he wanted  i wish to see mr pelter said dick  not in yet  when do you expect him  ought to be here now  then ill wait and dick dropped on a chair he had hardly done so when the door opened and a burly individual hurried in he gave dick an inquiring look  wants to see you mr pelter said the office boy just came in  want to see me what is it and the head of the brokerage firm stepped up to dick  you are mr pelter  yes  i am richard rover anderson rovers son  ah indeed cried jesse pelter and gave a slight start glad to meet you mr rover and he held out his hand will you er step into my office  he led the way through two offices to one in the extreme rear this was well furnished with a desk a table several chairs and a bookcase filled with legallooking volumes in one corner was a telephone booth and a telephone connection also rested on the desk  i came to see about my father said dick as he sat down in a chair to which the broker motioned  you mean about your fathers business i suppose  no about my father do you know where he is mr pelter   know where he is what do you mean isnt he in new york the broker pretended to arrange some papers on his desk as he spoke and did not look at dick  he has disappeared and i thought you might know something about it  dick looked the man full in the face he saw the broker start and then try to control himself  well that er accounts for it said jesse pelter slowly as if trying to make up his mind what to say  accounts for what  why he didnt come back here as he said he would  he has been here then  yes a number of days ago we had quite some important business to transact he said he would come back the next day and sign some papers and fix up some other matters but he didnt come  did he say he would be here sure  he did so he has disappeared that is strange perhaps some accident happened to him  i hope not i knew he came to new york to see you and your partners i thought you could tell me something about him  i dont know any more than that he called here one day and said he would come in again the next mr rover if he is er missing you had better notify the police unless you have some idea where he went to continued the broker  i have no idea further than that he came to new york to see you and that he came here from his hotel  see here do you mean to insinuate that we er may know where he is why he is missing demanded jesse pelter sharply  i insinuate nothing mr pelter but if you expected him the next day after he was here and he didnt come why didnt you telephone to him  i er i didnt know where he was stopping if i had known i might have telephoned to him although he had a right to stay away from here if he wanted to  he is transacting quite some business with you isnt he  we have done quite some business together in the past yes answered the broker coldly  and matters were not going very well were they questioned dick sharply  they were going as well as could be expected  you owed my father a great deal of money didnt you   we did owe him something but we dont owe him anything now we settled up with him in full was the reply which filled dick with new astonishment    chapter xvi   more discoveries  you settled up with him in full gasped rick  yes some time ago  not for that stock in the sunset irrigation company  i was not talking about the irrigation company that is another affair your father was to see us about that on the morning when he er when he failed to come here i er i thought he had gone back home to get certain documents which he stated he did not have with him  and you havent seen or heard of him since  not a word mr rover i give you my word  did he leave any of his papers with you when he was here last  no jesse pelter took up the telephone on his desk give me 2345 river he said to central he turned to dick you will have to excuse me mr rover i have some important business to transact  it isnt as important as finding my father answered dick bluntly  i do not know how i can aid you  perhaps you dont care to try returned dick pointedly as he arose  what do you mean demanded the broker and hanging up the telephone receiver he too arose  never mind what i mean mr pelter if you will give me no aid ill find my father alone and having thus spoken dick marched from the offices leaving the broker staring after him curiously  hum looks like a smart young man murmured jesse pelter to himself and i thought anderson rovers boys were all school kids this lad has grown up fast i wonder what hell do next i guess i had better keep my eye on him  when dick reached the street he saw nothing of sam he looked up and down and then walked slowly in the direction of broadway on the corner he came to a halt  he must be somewhere around he mused perhaps id better go back and wait for him  dick the cry came from sam as he arrived on a run did you learn anything  not much but you look excited sam whats up  i think i saw crabtree  you did where why didnt you collar him  i didnt get the chance returned the youngest rover answering the last question first it was on the corner below here i was standing in a doorway watching up and down when i saw a tall man come along slowly he halted at the corner and presently another man came out of the side street and touched him on the arm the second man wore a heavy beard and a slouch hat and colored eyeglasses but i am almost sure it was josiah crabtree  why didnt you go up and make sure you could have pulled the beard from his face if it was false  just what i thought but i decided that first i would listen to what the two men had to say when i got closer to the pair i made another discovery  what was that  the first man had a pointed chin and the heaviest pair of eyebrows i ever saw  what ejaculated dick and his mind ran back to the jail at plankville and to what had been said about the man who had visited josiah crabtree and then he thought of the mysterious automobile and its driver  yes i know what you think dick and i think the same that that man was the one who aided crabtree to escape from jail said sam  what did the men say sam  i didnt get a chance to listen as i was coming up i saw the first man give the second man some money then the second man looked up and saw me and shoving the money into his pocket he dove across the street and into the crowd that made me feel sure it was crabtree and i ran after him pellmell i followed him for about half a block but the crowd was too much for me and he got away i was going to tell a policeman but then i thought he couldnt do any more than i could and i made up my mind id wait for you  what became of the other fellow the man with the pointed chin  i dont know he went off somewhere while i was after crabtree if it was crabtree answered sam  show me which way crabtree went said dick and the brothers walked in the direction the fugitive had taken but though they spent over an hour in looking for the man not a trace of him could be found  well this proves one thing anyway said dick as he and sam started on the return to the hotel crabtree is in league with pelter japson  company if he wasnt he wouldnt show himself so close to their offices  just what i think returned his brother and another thing dick i think that man with the pointed chin is in with the brokers too  more than likely for all we know he may be one of the firm went on dick suddenly wait ive got an idea i think ill go back to those offices  and see if the man with the pointed chin is there  yes  all right want me to go back too  you might hang around as you did before i dont know of anything else to do  the boys walked back and while sam stationed himself in the street dick walked into the office building which he had before visited he was just in time to see a boy come from the elevator some letters in his hand  their office boy he thought maybe i can get something out of him  he walked up to the youth and nodded pleasantly  youre the boy from pelter japson  company arent you he asked  yep was the laconic reply  i want to find a man connected with your concern i dont know his name continued dick he has a pointed chin and very heavy eyebrows  oh you mean mr japson said the boy quickly  is that mr japson repeated dick scarcely able to suppress his astonishment  sure it is hes got a very long chin and his eyebrows is so heavy they come right down over his eyes i dont see why he dont cut em off some i would quick enough went on the office boy  is mr japson in the offices now  no  are you sure of that he was coming down  i know it but he just telephoned to mr pelter that he couldnt come something important  how long ago was this  oh just a couple of minutes ago  is mr pelter there yet  no he went out as soon as he got the message nobody there but a clerk  when will mr pelter be back  i dunno maybe not till late or maybe not till tomorrow answered the office boy and hurried away  in a thoughtful mood dick rejoined sam and the pair this time hurried to the subway to get a train uptown  ive found out who the second man was said the oldest rover boy it was japson of pelter japson  company sam i begin to think this is some deep game this fellow japson aided crabtree to escape from the plankville jail and in return crabtree is aiding these brokers in their efforts to get the best of father  if we can prove that we ought to have the brokers arrested  but we cant prove it absolutely but i am convinced that i am right the office boy told me that japson telephoned to pelter that he could not come in more than likely japson was afraid you would be on guard and spot him as soon as japson telephoned in pelter went out most likely to meet his partner  and maybe to hunt up crabtree dick  perhaps  but what of father went on the youngest rover anxiously  i cant answer that question sam but it is going to be answered sooner or later if i have to have all those men arrested i am certain in my own mind that they are responsible for dads disappearance they got him out of the way so that they could get the best of him in that sunset irrigation company scheme  i think we ought to watch the men and see where they go  so do i but now they know we are on guard they will be very careful  do you think they had father abducted  that is just what i do think if youll remember that is one of crabtrees favorite tricks he would not dare to put father out of the way take his life i mean and that would be the only other thing he could do  where could they take him to in such a city as this  oh there are a dozen places empty stores and basements vacant flats and apartments and then they may have taken him away from new york in an automobile or on some vessel in one of the rivers  id give a good deal to know where he is now cried sam bitterly  so would i sam well well do what we can added dick with determination  it did not take the boys long to return to the outlook hotel they looked around for tom but he was not in sight however he arrived a few minutes later his face showed that his quest had been an unsuccessful one  i talked to everybody around that end of central park he said one man saw crabtree but he couldnt tell where the rascal went to did you learn anything  we did answered dick come on to dinner and well tell you  while the three ate a hasty midday meal dick and sam told of their discoveries tom listened with interest  i think you are right he cried crabtree is in with the brokers and the whole bunch is a bad one i think they are holding dad a prisoner somewhere the question is where and how can we get to him and rescue him  we might watch those offices suggested sam but those fellows will be on guard and we may not learn anything for days and days  we could have them arrested suggested tom but it wont do any good without positive evidence  there is something about this whole affair that i cant understand said dick that man pelter claims that he settled up with father for everything excepting this irrigation company project father never told me that he settled up and i think he would have said something if it was so  the three boys talked the affair over from every possible standpoint but could arrive at no satisfactory conclusion all were sorry that they had not captured josiah crabtree  let me get my hands on him and ill make him tell what has become of dad said dick  the meal concluded they went up to their rooms to talk the matter over further  i suppose aunt martha and uncle randolph are as anxious almost as we are said sam hang the luck i wish old crabtree was back in jail and pelter japson  company were with him  there was a knock on the door and a boy appeared with a telegram it was addressed to dick  maybe its from dad cried sam and tom in a breath  dick tore open the envelope and read the message rapidly his brow darkened and he shook his head slowly  what does it say asked sam  who it is from added tom  it is from uncle randolph answered dick listen and he read as follows    important news your fathers signature demanded on important   documents inside of three days or great financial loss and   dishonor to all of us                                                      randolph rover    chapter xvii   an important telephone message  theres the answer cried tom  its as plain as day added sam  you are right came from dick i see it all now he signed for the telegram and dismissed the boy closing the door after him they are keeping father a prisoner somewhere so that he cannot sign those documents  and it means a big financial loss and dishonor to all of us went on tom that must mean uncle randolph as well as dad  i wish uncle randolph had sent some particulars sighed sam  they may come in by mail most likely they will answered dick it would be just like him to send a letter and then telegraph afterwards  well one thing is clear remarked tom we have got to find dad and do it pretty quickly too we know or at least we are pretty sure of it that he is in the power of crabtree and pelter japson  company now the question is what are we going to do about it  i said this morning i had an idea tom answered his big brother i dont know whether it will work out or not or if youll care to try it you know i told you to go to central park while sam and i went down to those offices i did that so that those brokers wouldnt see you they dont know you and you can go down and interview them as a stranger do you catch the idea  i do cried tom eagerly and ill do it but what shall i say he asked suddenly sobering  you might state that you had heard of the sunset irrigation company and thought of investing or something like that maybe they might give you some information that would be valuable for us and while there you may hear something about crabtree or something about where father may be  ill go this afternoon cried tom the idea of playing the spy pleased him greatly  but you want to be careful warned his older brother if cornered those brokers may prove to be desperate men  ill be on my guard dick  sam and i can go down part of the way with you and when you go in we can hang around outside one at the upper and one at the lower street corner perhaps by doing that well catch another sight of crabtree although i think for the present hell keep away from wall street and meet those brokers somewhere else or telephone to them  it was not long after this when the three rover boys set out for the lower part of the great metropolis they took the subway that being the quickest way to get there dick gave tom directions how to find the brokers offices and then the brothers separated as agreed  tom had fixed himself up for the occasion wearing a slouch hat and a flowing tie in the manner of a young man from the west or south he carried a pocket full of timetables and another pocket full of legallooking documents he also carried half a dozen visiting cards with the name and address                              roy a putnam denver colo  with eyes on the alert for the possible appearance of somebody who might know him tom walked into the office building where pelter japson  company did business and entered the elevator he was the only passenger and arriving at the fourth floor he found himself alone in the corridor leading to the brokers offices  guess ill listen a bit and see if i can hear anything he told himself and tiptoed his way to one of the doors  he listened intently but the only sound that broke the stillness was the click of a typewriter and the occasional shifting of some papers then he tiptoed his way to the next door that marked private  straining his ears tom caught the scratching of a pen and then a deep sigh as if somebody had just completed an important bit of work then he heard the footsteps of a man walking from the inner to the outer office  if he comes out ill have to show myself thought the youth but the man did not appear instead tom presently heard him return to the inner office then the telephone rang and the man answered it  yes tom heard him say all right wait a second and then the man kicked shut a door between the offices to assure himself of privacy  there followed a long wait during which time the man in the office was probably receiving some message  tomorrow morning tom heard him ask what time ten oclock that is rather early but i can go there directly from my home there came another pause leave that to me cried the man ill make him do it he paused again i am not afraid of those boys he added ill be there sure another pause yes the boat is the best place nobody can disturb us there goodbye and then the man hung up the telephone receiver  tom had taken in every word that the man said if it was pelter he must be talking to japson or crabtree or somebody else in the affair and tom did not doubt but what by those boys the man had meant himself and his brothers  and when he said ill make him do it he must have been speaking of father he reasoned and he mentioned a boat maybe they have dad on a boat  tom waited for some time longer in the corridor but nothing of importance occurred then he stepped loudly to the main door of the offices and entered  the same boy dick had met was there and asked him what he wanted  i want to see about some shares in the sunset irrigation company answered tom anybody in i can talk to and he handed out one of the cards he had fixed up  ill see answered the office boy and disappeared into the inner office with the card  a moment later jesse pelter appeared holding the card in his hand he smiled pleasantly  glad to meet you mr putnam he said bowing i am mr pelter ill be glad to let you know all about our irrigation company and its prospects  he ushered tom into his private office and offered him a chair  want to make an investment for yourself he said suggestively  if its a good one returned tom with an assumed grin a fellow who comes into a fat legacy has got to do something hasnt he  surest thing you know responded jesse pelter and this irrigation company of ours is the best thing in the world for rapid money making he continued just come on from denver mr putnam  ive been in new york a couple of days answered tom i want to look around a bit before i invest anything i heard something of this company before i reached here  no doubt no doubt it is a big thing and our rivals are all watching and envying us did you get our printed prospectus  no but i saw one somewhere some time ago  here you have it with a map of the property the shares are now selling at sixtyfive but next week i think well have to advance them to seventy or seventyfive owing to the demand  could a fellow buy five thousand dollars worth at sixtyfive asked tom trying to show an interest  you could if you were quick about it  well i want to know something more about this property first continued tom i dont want to throw any money away  quite right i see you are a levelheaded young man and that is the kind i like to deal with well go over this matter carefully and then jesse pelter plunged into the details of the irrigation scheme showing up its many good points and how in the near future it was bound to make a lot of money for all who invested in it  and you have the shares to sell asked tom  oh yes  do you own the property mr pelter  our company owns it that is we have a controlling interest in it  there are no other big stockholders  none at all we have invested heavily buying out the old company and reorganizing it all of the other stockholders are small ones you see we have such faith in this scheme that we dont want to let too much stock get away from us  tom did not see but he did not say so not a word had been said about mr rover and his interest mr pelter ignored toms father entirely and yet the youth knew that his parent had fifty thousand dollars or more tied up in that very company  id like to know some of the people who have invested in this stock said tom after the matter had been talked over for nearly an hour  i will give you some names was the brokers reply and he wrote them down they are the principal stockholders outside of ourselves  tom took the list and glanced at it his fathers name did not appear nor did the names of two other men he knew were interested in the concern  thank you said the youth rising i will look into this it might be a good investment for me  finest in the world returned jesse pelter better let me put you down for five thousand dollars worth of shares today  no i want to think it over first  supposing i hold the shares for you until tomorrow went on the broker persuasively  you can do that if you wish answered tom  do you want to leave a deposit on them  i didnt bring any money with me that is not enough  you might write out a check mr putnam  no ill think it over first  then ill hold the shares and look for you tomorrow returned jesse pelter somewhat disappointedly he loved to get his hands on anothers money at the first interview please come in after lunch he added i have an important engagement for the morning  with the map and prospectus and list of names in his pocket tom left the offices he saw that the man with the pointed chin and heavy eyebrows was not present the force consisted of mr pelter the office boy a girl at a typewriter and a very old man who was at the books  japson must be keeping out of the way mused tom as he descended to the street i wonder if it was he or old crabtree who talked to pelter over the phone  tom soon rejoined his brothers and all three walked away from the vicinity of wall street the youth told of his interview with the broker and of the talk he had overheard while jesse pelter was at the telephone  they must have been talking about father cried dick eagerly  maybe they have him a prisoner on a boat added sam  it looks that way to me said tom and i know what i think we ought to do he continued  so do i answered dick quickly watch this pelter tomorrow when he leaves his home and see where he goes to  right you are  where does he live questioned sam  i dont know but we can easily find out  the boys presently passed an office building in which there was a large telephone station and there they hunted up jesse pelters home address  he lives up in the bronx said dick taking down the street and number we can find out up at the hotel how to reach the place let us go back to the outlook and see if there is any letter from home maybe well get more news about that financial loss mentioned in that telegram    chapter xviii   on the hudson river  when the boys returned to the outlook hotel they found several letters awaiting them there was one each from the girls and also a communication from songbird written partly in verse and telling of matters at brill  but the letter that interested them most just then was one from their uncle randolph in which he explained something of the financial matters mentioned in the telegram their uncle was not a good business man and often got his statements mixed but from the communication the boys learned the truth  there were two matters of importance the irrigation scheme and the purchase of a large tract of land which would be benefited by the flow of water when the irrigation plant was put into operation in both of the schemes the rovers held large interests that is they held what were called options for which anderson rover had put up large sums of money and he had likewise induced some friends to let him put up money for them in order to clinch their hold on the two business propositions anderson rover must sign certain papers and have them delivered to the right parties inside of the next three days should he fail to do this then his options on the property would terminate and pelter japson  company would be able to step in and gain control the brokers had at first tried to gain control by getting anderson rover to assign his interest in the options but this the boys father had refused to do  and now that father wouldnt turn the control over to them they have had him kidnapped so that he cant sign those papers and serve them said dick the case is as plain as day  and they got old crabtree to manage the kidnapping put in tom  but how did they know about crabtree asked sam  most likely he has been mixed up in some of their shady transactions of the past replied dick when he got in jail he sent for japson and made him fix it up so he could escape that fire helped the rascals then both came down to new york and all hands hatched the plot to put dad out of the way  poor dad if only we knew he was safe murmured tom  thats just it he may be suffering terribly added sam  i think well find out something definite tomorrow when we follow pelter said dick he too was greatly worried  the evening proved a long one to the boys even though they spent some time in penning letters to the girls and to the folks at home dick had received a most sympathetic letter from dora in which the girl stated that she wished she was with him to help him  dear dora he murmured as he placed the letter in his pocket i wish all this trouble was over and we could be married and go off on our honeymoon  the boys had found out from the hotel clerk how to reach the address in the bronx as the upper portion of new york city is locally called they could take a subway train to within two blocks of pelters home  they were up bright and early and after a hasty breakfast went out to a nearby store where all purchased variouslycolored caps of the automobile variety and also some automobile goggles  well pass for chauffeurs in a crowd said dick the goggles will change our appearance even if we only wear em on our foreheads  they were soon on a subway train and being whirled northward the train was an express making but few stops and almost before they knew it the guard called out their station  dick had consulted a street map at the hotel so he knew exactly how to turn they easily located the apartment house in which jesse pelter resided and then stopped at a nearby corner to await his appearance  we have got to be very careful how we follow him said dick if he spots us it will be all up with us i think sam had better go first i will follow and tom you can bring up the rear and let us all act as if we were perfect strangers to each other  then came a wait of nearly half an hour at last they saw the front door of the apartment open and several men came out two of the men turned in one direction and the other man hurried off alone  there he is theres pelter cried dick in a low voice now sam see to it that he doesnt get out of your sight  ill do my best answered the youngest rover and walked off after the broker  as jesse pelter hurried along he consulted his watch then he hastened his steps making his way to the nearest railroad station he boarded a train and the boys followed sam getting in the same car with the broker and dick and tom entering the next car but keeping in sight of their brother  a number of stations were passed and then the broker left the train and the boys did likewise on the street jesse pelter called a cab that was handy and entered it  say this looks as if we might lose him cried dick in alarm then he chanced to see another cab and hurried to it waving for tom and sam to do the same he ordered the driver to keep the first turnout in sight but not to get too close  i can do that with ease said the driver with a broad grin its jerry dillons cab and jerrys horse is no good at all  the two cabs rolled on for several blocks and then the first turned in the direction of the hudson river it halted near the railroad and jesse pelter sprang to the ground he paid the driver of the cab and dismissed him then he hurried along the railroad on foot  i guess he is going up to the dock yonder said tom while the boys got out  looks like it answered dick  all left the cab and hurried after jesse pelter who was now all but out of sight he passed between two buildings and the boys followed him slowly  wait cried dick presently look  why its crabtree exclaimed sam as another figure came into view that of a heavilybearded man with a slouch hat  exactly returned dick now keep back or we may spoil everything he continued cautiously  the three boys saw pelter and josiah crabtree converse earnestly for several minutes the man who had escaped from jail pointed to a big bundle he carried and pelter nodded then both walked slowly across the railroad tracks to a dock jutting out into the hudson  at the dock lay a rowboat with a man who looked like a sailor at the oars pelter and crabtree climbed down into the boat which was quickly shoved away then the sailor took up the oars and commenced to row out into the broad river  now we are stumped murmured tom as he and his brothers watched the departure of the rowboat from behind a shed at the inner end of the dock  let us watch that rowboat as far as we can returned dick i dont believe they intend to row very far  maybe they are going to one of the vessels anchored out yonder remarked sam  more than likely  the sailor was pulling up the stream close to the shore and the brothers could watch him with ease the tide was running out and the oarsman had all he could do to make any headway  if he is going to keep to the shore we might follow him on foot suggested tom after several minutes had passed and while the rowboat was still clearly in view  he is turning out now cried dick see i think he is making for yonder twomasted schooner  the rowboat had turned out and in a few minutes more the boys felt certain it was headed for the schooner  oh if we only had a rowboat groaned tom  dick did not reply he was watching a steam tug that had come up the river a line had been thrown from the tug to the schooner and made fast  the steam tug is going to tow her down the river exclaimed sam oh dick what shall we do  dad may be on that schooner supplemented tom  dick gazed up and down the stream a rowboat was coming along manned by two boys dick gave the lads a hail  hi want to earn a dollar quick he asked  how questioned both lads in a breath  see that schooner we want to get on board of her as quickly as possible  all right but let us see the dollar first answered one of the lads shrewdly  the rowboat came to the dock and the three rovers leaped on board dick produced a dollar bill and the boys commenced to row with all the power at their command  in the meantime the first rowboat had reached the schooners side and the men and the sailor had gone on hoard the boat was tied fast to the stern and orders were given to the captain of the tug to go ahead  stop stop you rascals cried tom as the schooner commenced to move down the hudson and in his anger he shook his fist at those on the vessel  at first the actions of the boys attracted no attention then there was a stir on the rear deck of the craft  somebody in a rowboat calling to you remarked the captain of the schooner to josiah crabtree  to me exclaimed the former teacher in surprise i will see about this  he hurried to the stern of the schooner the rowboat with the rovers had now come quite close josiah crabtree gave a start  can it be possible he gasped  what is it asked jesse pelter who had stepped up  those young men in yonder boat unless i am mistaken they are anderson rovers sons  is it possible ejaculated the broker oh there must be some mistake  no no i know them well and see they are motioning to us they want us to stop  they must have seen and followed us said the broker and his manner showed his sudden fear  want to take those fellows on board questioned the captain of the schooner  no no cried josiah crabtree tell the captain of the tug to hurry up that we er that we must make better time  i will sir said the captain of the schooner and hurried forward to give the necessary order  a big steamboat was passing up the river and the wash from this sent the rowboat containing the rover boys dancing up and down the lads at the oars headed the craft to meet the rollers and the schooner passed further and further away  they are leaving us groaned sam oh what luck  mr rover yelled dick at the top of his lungs are you on board rover anderson rover its dick dick  for fully a minute no answer came back then there was a commotion on the deck of the schooner and a man appeared clad in a torn suit of clothing and hatless  dick where are you was the exclamation and the man rushed to the stern of the craft dick and tom and sam help me  its father yelled dick stop that schooner stop her i say  get back there exclaimed josiah crabtree catching mr rover by the arm get back i say help me somebody this man is crazy  he and jesse pelter hustled anderson rover back and then the boys saw their father disappear from view swiftly the tug and the schooner gathered headway the boys shouted in vain they looked around for some other boat to come to their aid but none was in sight then the schooner passed down the hudson river and the rover boys were left in the rowboat gazing at each other in dismay    chapter xix   the search for the schooner  anyway we have got the name of the schooner remarked sam after a moment of silence shes the ellen rodney  and we ought to be able to follow her somehow added tom  we must cried dick let us get to shore and see what we can do  dont we get that dollar queried one of the boys who rowed the boat  yes answered dick and handed the money over now get us to shore as quickly as possible  if you want to catch that schooner why dont you go downtown after her asked the second boy of the rowboat  just what i was thinking of doing answered dick i think we can get down there ahead of them the only question is can we get anybody down there to go out after the schooner  you can get a boat at the battery if youre willing to pay for it plenty of tug captains down there looking for jobs  then well get to the battery as fast as possible said tom  the boys who had been rowing the boat were tired so tom and dick took the oars and thus the little craft was speedily brought back to the dock from which it had started  you can get an elevated train over there said one of the boys pointing with his hand it will take you right to the battery  the rover boys lost no time in leaving the dock and crossing the railroad tracks then they fairly ran to the nearest station of the elevated railroad dick purchased the tickets and dropped them in the box then came a wait of several minutes on the platform  train for south ferry called out the guard as a rumble was heard  does that go to the battery questioned dick  sure  the boys piled on board and away swept the line of cars on the way downtown but it was a local train making all the stops so their progress was not as fast as they wished  here and there through the cross streets they caught sight of the glistening river with its numerous craft once tom thought he saw the ellen rodney but at that distance he could not he sure  at last the train swept around a curve into the battery as the little park at the extreme lower point of the great metropolis is called here were located several ferries and also some shipping offices as well as the aquarium dick almost ran to the nearest shipping office  i want to stop a schooner that is coming down the hudson river he said to the clerk in charge can i hire a boat around here to take me out  anything wrong asked the clerk curiously  yes very much wrong  in that case why dont you put the harbor police on the job  can i get them handy  yes the office is up there and the man pointed it out  thanks returned dick and headed for the place in question with tom and sam at his heels  an officer was in charge of the office of the harbor police and he listened with interest to what the boys had to tell  this is certainly a serious matter he said when they had finished those men are actually kidnapping your father in fact they have already kidnapped him well have to get after them  you have a boat handy  yes several of em  the officer touched a bell and another man in uniform appeared he was given some instructions and then the second man told the rover boys to follow him he led the way to a dock where a steam tug lay the smoke pouring from the funnel  quick work here andy he cried to an officer on board weve got to catch a schooner coming down the river the ellen rodney do you know her  ive seen her was the answer from the tug officer  the fellows on board the schooner are kidnapping the father of these boys i reckon its a serious case a money affair he added in a lower tone  who is the man  anderson rover is his name if you find him and the boys make a charge place all hands under arrest  i will  the steam tug was fully manned carrying a crew and several police officers the rover boys were told to get aboard and the tug was headed out into the hudson or as here called the north river  you dont suppose they have passed here do you questioned the captain of the tug  i dont think so unless that towing tug was an extra fast one answered dick  they wouldnt dare to run too fast with so many ferryboats crossing the river it would be too dangerous  the police tug swept out into the bay and then started slowly up the river moving from one shore to the other the police officer in charge had a pair of glasses and he used these on the various craft that came into view and also allowed the boys to use them  ought to be along soon said tom after a quarter of an hour had passed it took us quite some time to get down here you know  maybe they didnt come down the river suggested the officer  didnt come down cried sam what do you mean  maybe they thought you would come down here and wait for them and so changed their plans and went up the river instead  thats so exclaimed tom they might do that  well if they went up the river we ought to be able to catch them sooner or later put in dick  let us hope so returned the officer  soon they had passed up the river to a point opposite the twentythird street ferries here a number of boats were moving up and down the stream and from the hoboken shore a big transatlantic steamer was coming out to start on its trip across the ocean  that looks like her cried sam pointing to a craft behind the transatlantic steamer  so it does returned tom  they made a semicircle other boats giving way to the police tug but when they got closer to the schooner in question all the rover boys uttered a cry of dismay it was a craft similar to the ellen rodney but that was all  either we missed her or else the schooner went up the river said dick at last  looks that way returned tom with a sigh  they continued to move up the stream scanning each shore closely they passed numerous boats but not one that looked like the craft they were after  well here we are at the spot where crabtree and pelter got aboard said dick a while later so either we have missed them or else the ellen rodney went up the river instead of down  the boys were much disheartened for they had thought that the police tug would surely locate the craft and that they would thus be able to come to their fathers rescue they scarcely knew what to do next  ill go up the river a bit further if you say so said the police officer in charge of the tug  perhaps we had better run down first and make another search on our second trip suggested dick i shouldnt like them to get out into the bay and give us the slip  the tug was turned back and a little later they reached the vicinity of the battery once more then began another search up the river from shore to shore as before but not a trace of the schooner could be found  must have gone up the river said the police official well try it for a way and see  this they did the police tug moving from side to side as before  this is the end of it so far as we are concerned said the officer in charge of the tug at last we dont go up the river any further than this  all right then answered dick much disheartened i guess the only thing for you to do is to put us ashore  sorry we couldnt find that schooner of course if youll make a regular charge against these men well send word up the river to be on the lookout for them  well make the charge answered dick  the steam tug turned in on the new york city side and the rover boys went ashore  ill make the regular charge a little later said dick it may be that ill have some men in the city arrested first and then he and his brothers moved off after receiving instructions from the police official as to what might be best to do  are you going to have japson arrested asked sam  if i can find him but i guess hell keep out of sight for the present sam you must remember one thing these rascals only want to keep dad a prisoner for three days after that they will let him go and then it will be too late to save that property  would that be so if we could prove that dad had been kept a prisoner asked tom with much anxiety  i dont know another thing they may make dad sign certain papers dont you remember pelter said over the telephone that he would make him do it theyll force father into something if they can  well whats our next move asked sam impatiently  as it is after noon we had better visit a quick lunch room and get a bit to eat then i think we had better hire some private tug to take us up the river i am almost certain now that the ellen rodney went that way  if she went up the river she might go all the way to albany said tom  possibly but i think those rascals would be too afraid to do that theyll leave the schooner at the first chance they get and take father with them  the boys did not have to walk far before they came to a small shedlike building displaying the sign quick lunch they entered and ordered some sandwiches pie and coffee while they were eating they questioned the proprietor about some craft to take them up the river  we are hunting for a schooner explained dick we dont know just where she is well pay somebody well for finding her for us  i know a young fellow who owns a motorboat said the quick lunch man he could take you anywhere youd want to go  just the thing cried dick quickly where is that fellow  he ought to be here now he generally comes in about noon for sandwiches and coffee  i wish he would come now murmured sam  after that they did not hurry their lunch hoping the owner of the motorboat would appear he came in ten minutes later a bright cheery individual not much older than dick  sure i can take you anywhere along the river if you are willing to pay for it said he in answer to a question from the oldest rover boy just give me time to get a mouthful and i will be with you  let us take some lunch along suggested tom there is no telling how long this search will last  we might take a little answered dick but i dont think well be on the river long  ten minutes later the crowd was on the way to the river to a dock where lay the motorboat it was not a very elegant craft but it had a good engine and could travel well and that just then meant everything to the rover boys a bargain was struck for the run and the boys and the owner got aboard and then the search for the schooner was begun anew    chapter xx   a minute too late  well this looks like a wild goose chase dick  it was sam who spoke from the bow of the motorboat for over two hours they had been moving up the hudson river slowly scanning one shore and the other with care they had noted many boats but nothing that looked like the schooner for which they were so eagerly searching  they had a pretty good start of you said john slater the owner of the motorboat maybe they are up to nyack or haverstraw by this time  well all we can do is to keep on and watch out said tom with a sigh his disposition for fun seemed to have entirely left him  another half hour went by and they came in sight of a number of lumber barges all heavily loaded the barges were being towed by a big tug  i know the captain of that tug said john slater we might ask him about the schooner  a good idea answered dick  they were soon close to the steam tug and the motorboat owner waved his hand to the captain of the larger craft who waved in return  i want to find a schooner named the ellen rodney shouted john slater did you pass her captain voss  i did was the answer she was opposite nyack heading in to shore  opposite nyack exclaimed dick how far is that from here  not more than two miles answered john slater as he turned his motorboat up the river again  we ought to be able to catch them now cried sam his face brightening a bit  wish we had the police along remarked tom bringing those rascals to terms may not be as easy as you imagine  ive got a gun on board said john slater a doublebarreled shotgun i keep on hand to guard against river thieves i use it to go gunning with too  good better bring it out and let us look at it returned dick  the weapon was produced and found to be in good condition and loaded it was placed on one of the seats an oilskin raincoat being thrown over it to hide it from view  we wont use force unless it is necessary said dick grimly  they soon came in sight of nyack but nothing that looked like the schooner came into view  maybe they went further suggested sam their turning in might have been a bluff to throw us off the trail  or they may have sent a message ashore maybe a message to japson cried dick  of course they would want to put him on guard and put those at the offices on guard too murmured tom  they continued on up the river with their eyes ever on the alert it was now growing late in the afternoon and the sky was clouded as if a storm was coming  look cried dick suddenly and he pointed ahead and to the right  the schooner sure enough said tom and see a rowboat is alongside  maybe we are just in time added sam i hope so  without delay the motorboat was headed in the direction of the ellen rodney as they drew closer they saw but one man on the deck of the schooner a burly fellow who looked like a sailor  schooner ahoy shouted dick as they ran alongside  ahoy the motorboat cried the burly man coming towards them  are you the captain  no the captain is ashore was the short answer  ill come aboard said dick and without waiting for another word from the man he made his way to the deck followed by tom he had already directed sam to remain in the motorboat with john slater to summon assistance if necessary  what do you want here demanded the burly man surlily  i guess you know well enough answered dick shortly where is that man who is a prisoner  you mean the crazy man  he isnt crazy and you know it  those men who had him in charge said he was crazy grumbled the burly individual  where is he  what is that to you  everything that man is my father and they have kidnapped him maybe you know that kidnapping is a states prison offense added the oldest rover boy sharply  humph i aint had nothing to do with any kidnapping young fellow growled the man im the mate o this schooner thats all if anything is wrong youll have to see the captain about it  you say he went ashore  yes  did those men and my father go with him  all of em went yes  who was left here besides you  those two dago sailors thats all and the mate pointed to two men who lay on the forward deck asleep  are you willing to have me take a look around went on dick after a pause  youll have to wait till the captain gets back answered the man doggedly if there is anything wrong i dont want to be mixed up in it  if you want to keep out of trouble youll help us all you can put in tom this is a serious business  i dont know a thing about it and the man shrugged his shoulders  without another word dick walked across the deck and descended into the cabin the burly mans face clouded and he made a move as if to follow him  you stay here said tom and put his hand in his hip pocket as if about to draw some weapon  the man changed color and shifted uneasily  all right have your own way he said he was a coward at heart and as he had not been in the plot against anderson rover he did not wish to get any deeper into the trouble  it did not take dick long to convince himself that his father was not on board the schooner he called his parents name and then passed swiftly through the cabin and several staterooms and also a cooks galley he saw where somebody had been locked in one of the staterooms for the compartment was in disorder and the door was marred and cracked  dad must have struggled to get away he murmured i hope they didnt hurt him  when dick came on deck he found tom guarding the burly man the two sailors were still asleep or pretended to be  nothing doing below he announced i guess they took him ashore  we might as well go ashore too then said his brother we are wasting valuable time here he turned to the mate will you tell us where they went it will be to your interest to open your mouth  they mentioned the old blue horseshoe tavern growled the burly mate but i dont know if they went there  dick said no more but hurried over the side followed by tom as he left the schooner the funloving rover could not help but bring from his hip pocket an extra handkerchief and flourish it at the mate  theres my gun how do you like it he cried with a grin  go to grass grunted the burly fellow and scowled deeply  in a few words the pair told sam what they had learned the motorboat was headed for a nearby dock and a few minutes later the rovers leaped ashore  i dont know if i will need you again or not said dick to john slater  if it wasnt for watching my boat id go along said the motorboat youth i am interested in this case  here is your money but i wish you would hang around a while went on dick paying him  i sure will hang around and ill watch that schooner  good our address in new york is the outlook hotel said dick  the boys saw nobody around the dock which was in the rear of a small lumber yard they walked through the yard to an office in front a road ran out of the side of the yard and the boys wondered if the men they were after had taken that  nobody but a boy of fifteen was in the office clicking out a letter on an old typewriter  the boss aint around he had to go to new york on business he announced as soon as the boys appeared want to leave an order for anything  we are looking for some men who came ashore a while ago said dick did you see em  the boy shook his head  aint nobody been here all afternoon he said  do you know anything of a place called the blue horseshoe tavern  sure i do its up on the post road the place where all the auto parties stop was the knowing reply  how far from here  not over a quarter of a mile  which way  ill show you and the boy reached for his cap going outside he led them from the yard to a road running up a hill  keep right on that till you get to the blue horseshoe he said you cant miss it because its the only place around here  they thanked the lad and hurried on by this time it was quite dark and a few drops of rain had begun to fall  the blue horseshoe tavern must be one of the oldtime roadhouses that has had a revival of business since auto parties became popular said dick as he and his brothers trudged along i wonder what those rascals will tell the proprietor  most likely the same old story that dad is crazy answered tom thats crabtrees favorite game  they had just turned a curve in the road and come in sight of a low rambling tavern when they saw a big touring car of the enclosed pattern coming towards them to avoid the machine which was being driven rapidly they leaped to the side of the road  as the touring car came closer they saw that two men sat on the front seat the driver and a man who had his hat pulled far down over his face and his coat collar turned up  look yelled tom pointing to the man beside the driver  look into the car yelled sam  the automobile rolled on lost to sight in less than a minute around the bend of the road it was headed in the direction of new york city  the man on the front seat with the driver was pelter exclaimed tom  and dad was inside the car gasped sam  you are right returned dick and crabtree and another man was with him dad looked as if he had his hands bound behind him  what shall we do now  how can we follow that car  how did they get that auto so quick  i think i know how they got the auto said the oldest rover boy after a pause there must be a garage at the tavern come on and see maybe we can get another auto and follow that car    chapter xxi   captain rodneys testimony  it was raining steadily when the three rover boys reached the blue horseshoe tavern an ancient hostelry standing at the junction of two main roads in the rear was a barn and a big carriage shed which had been converted into a garage the youths headed for the latter place and entered quickly to get out of the downpour  a colored man came forward to see what they wanted  can we hire a car here and at once questioned dick  sorry boss but we aint got no car in jest now answered the colored man i expect one back in about an hour  the car that just went out demanded tom  yes sah  cant you get us any sort of a car pleaded sam  aint got nuffin in ceptin a roadster an that wont run sumthin the matter with the carburetor  are you sure that other car will be back in an hour demanded dick  i think so the gents as took it said they didnt want to go more than ten miles  all right well wait till the car gets back answered dick struck with a sudden idea  but dick well lose valuable time whispered sam  perhaps not sam if we got a car now we wouldnt know where to go if that driver comes back and takes us  oh i see  fine murmured tom  you call us as soon as that car shows itself said dick to the colored man well be in the tavern  yes sah was the reply and the man readily pocketed the quarter that the oldest rover tossed to him  the boys ran to the tavern by a side entrance which was not far from the shed they walked along a porch until they came to some windows opening from a dining room  look in there cried tom coming to a halt  the others did as directed and saw at one of the tables the man they had seen on the deck of the ellen rodney its captain rodney went on tom who had learned the name from the schooners mate  and he is alone which proves that the others were in that auto with dad returned sam  im going to interview him cried dick and maybe ill have him arrested  all three boys walked into the dining room of the tavern and took seats at the same table with the master of the schooner he started and was about to spring to his feet when dick stopped him  sit where you are said the oldest rover boy sternly if you attempt to leave ill call the police  what do you er mean stammered the man and he looked decidedly uncomfortable  i reckon you know who we are captain rodney said tom  i dont  we are anderson rovers sons said sam  never heard of that man faltered the captain  you had him a prisoner only a short while ago  oh you mean that crazy man who was aboard my schooner i thought his name was brown  see here captain rodney you cant fool us so you had better not try said dick sternly you know the game those men are trying to play they are going to prison for it and youll go too if you are not careful  what you threaten me roared the man growing red in the face  i do  i can have the law on you for it  go ahead the sooner the better responded dick coolly those men are rascals and you know it now i am going to give you one chance just one went on dick looking the master of the ellen rodney squarely in the eyes  what do you mean  as i said before those men are rascals they abducted my father and you aided them i can prove it as soon as we rescue my father we are going to prosecute those rascals if you want to save your own skin you had better help us all you can  at these plain words the face of captain rodney became a study  they told me he was a crazy man a brother to one of the others and they wanted to get him to some sanitarium  if that was so why did they run away  i didnt know they ran away until just now  you started to go down the river said tom  why did you change your mind and come here  they chartered the schooner for a week i was under their orders  where were they going at first  down the jersey coast and back they said they thought a little ocean air would do the crazy man good before they put him in the sanitarium i own up that i was suspicious but they claimed everything was straight  they were going to take my father down the coast for several days so that he could not sign important papers returned dick it is a welllaid plot to do our family out of a great deal of money and dishonor my father  well i aint in it i give you my word i chartered my vessel to em thats all  we will take you at your word then but you must tell all you know about them and their plans said dick after a pause  and if i do that will you er drop the charge against me questioned the master of the ellen rodney eagerly  if you dont we are going to have you  placed under arrest as soon as we can get an officer  dont do that i never had any trouble before and i dont want it now ill help you all i can if what you say its true and that man is your father  after that the captain was quite willing to talk and he told how crabtree and japson had come to him and questioned him about the schooner and finally chartered the craft for a week they had at first wanted to pay him at the end of the time but he had insisted upon receiving his money in advance and it was then paid over he had been told that the strange man was crabtrees brother who had gone crazy because of the loss of his money in a western irrigation scheme  they said they would take him down the coast for three or four days to brace him up a bit then we were to run in at absecon near atlantic city and land all hands they said they would go from atlantic city to lakewood where the sanitarium was located  probably they intended to let him go at absecon and then deny that they had ever touched him said dick  maybe i dont know anything about that replied the captain  but how did you come to change your plans asked tom  when you came out in that rowboat and the crazy man excuse me i mean your father cut up so they hustled him back to one of the staterooms went on captain rodney then they had a long talk i think they were afraid you would go down the river by train and try to head them off which we did murmured sam  after a while pelter and japson came to me and said they must come up the river that a sister of the crazy man lived up here and they must visit her before they went down the coast i was suspicious but what could i do i had chartered my vessel and i had my money so i obeyed orders then we came up here as fast as we could the steam tug was dismissed and we came ashore to this place then they hired an auto and went off and thats all i know about it  you dont know where they went cried dick  no more than what they said that they were going to the crazy mans sister  which was false muttered tom  what were you to do asked dick  they told me i might sail up the river to newburgh and wait there for a telegram  after that the captain talked freely but what he had to say shed but little more light on the subject the boys came to the conclusion that he had been dragged into the plot without knowing what it was but that he had been willing to lend his help provided he was well paid for it  when the proper time comes i shall want your testimony said dick at the conclusion of the interview in the meantime i advise you to have no more to do with those fellows  they shant come near the schooner even if they did charter her growled captain rodney    chapter xxii   hot on the trail  the boys had no appetite but as they were in the dining room they ordered a light lunch and paid for it then they saw an automobile come splashing through the mud of the road  there is that car cried sam as be recognized the driver  the boys ran out and made their way through the rain to the garage the enclosed touring car had just entered and the driver had shut off the power the wind shield had been up but the man had gotten quite wet and stood shaking the water from his coat  heres the car cried the colored man coming forward  so i see returned dick he turned to the driver pretty bad traveling i imagine  you bet the road is a mass of slippery mud i came near skidding half a dozen times  where did you go and dick stepped closer to the chauffeur  the man started and looked at the oldest rover boy sharply  whats that to you he asked shortly  everything we want to go to the same place  and as quickly as you can get us there added tom  the chauffeur surveyed the three rovers in amazement then he took off his coat and shook it briskly  sorry but i cant take you he said slowly ive got another job in er in half an hour  you are going to take us said dick firmly and right away what did those men pay you  what is that  how much out with it i havent any time to spare  ten dollars  all right youd like another ten wouldnt you  sure but  ten dollars to get us to the same place inside of twenty minutes went on dick and showed a roll of bankbills  cant do it in this slippery weather answered the man his eyes glistening at the sight of the money make it in half an hour  all tight then  ill put on the chains cried the chauffeur and brought out the antiskidding chains for the rear wheels the boys got the colored man to assist him and the chains were soon adjusted then the car was backed out of the garage and the three rovers leaped inside  now dont lose a minute said dick  i wont but we are taking chances on this road sir i can tell you that  it was still raining steadily and the highway was a mass of oily mud a splendid compound upon which to skid on and on rushed the touring car at a rate of speed varying from twenty to thirtyfive miles an hour  i could eat this road up if it was dry shouted the chauffeur the machine is good for fifty miles an hour  well dont climb a tree or a stone wall cautioned dick grimly  ordinarily the rover boys might have been anxious because of such wild riding but now every thought was centered on their father how he was faring and would they be able to rescue him  twice the touring car made dangerous lurches to one side once fairly brushing some trees which lined the roadway but the driver stuck to his post and gained the middle of the roadway again and rushed on as rapidly as ever  ill wager he doesnt own the machine muttered sam if he did hed be more careful of it  well he owns his own neck returned tom grimly so maybe hell be careful of that  they passed through several small villages the inhabitants gazing out curiously at the rushing and swaying car then they took to a side road where the traveling was worse than ever  suddenly the car made a turn they had struck a rut in the road and even the chains did not save them around swung the automobile there was a grinding of the brakes and the power was shut off then came a jar that sent the rover boys in a heap  something has happened sure cried tom who was the first to get up  they looked out of the door of the enclosed car they had come up to a mass of bushes beside the road and the left front wheel had struck a rock and was twisted around the mud guard on that side had crumpled up  i guess the journey is over so far as this car is concerned muttered dick as he leaped out followed by his brothers  the chauffeur was trying his steering wheel the right wheel responded but that which had hit the rock did not  out of commission he said with a frown i was afraid something would happen  if its only the steering gear it wont cost much said dick how much further to that place  not over half a mile  then well walk it cried tom  of course added sam  aint you going to pay me exclaimed the chauffeur in dismay i did my best  yes ill pay you responded dick and give you an extra five for the repairs now tell us just where that place is and what sort  its a country home a white place set in a lot of trees with a wind mill back of the barn got a green hedge in front the right side of the road you cant miss it  did you hear the name of the owner  belongs to one of the crowd man named japson its an old country home that was in his family for years he dont live there but its furnished i understand  the boys said no more but as soon as the chauffeur was paid they set off through the rain it was a disagreeable journey and but little was said all wondered what would be best to do when they reached the place for which they were bound  i wish we had the sheriff and his posse with us as we had when we rounded up those rascals at plankville said tom  or if we only had john slaters shotgun added sam  never mind as i understand it we are three to three said dick and we can arm ourselves with heavy sticks which they presently proceeded to do tearing up some bushes for that purpose  it was not long before they came in sight of a long high hedge back of it was a white house surrounded by numerous old trees over the trees showed the top of an old wind mill used for pumping water from a driven well  think we had better go right up to the door and knock asked sam as they halted at the edge of the hedge  no i think we had better spy around a little at first answered his big brother  all crawled through a gap in the hedge and skulking from tree to tree gradually neared the house near one of the windows grew some bushes and they crept along to these then dick looked through the window  he saw pelter and japson seated at a table going over some legal papers nobody else was visible  perhaps crabtree took father to some other place after the chauffeur left thought the youth in dismay  the window was closed so the boys could not hear what was being said they consulted among themselves and walked around the house being careful to keep well under the windows which were rather high  here is a cellar door let us try that said tom and he raised it up and almost before they knew it they were in the cellar under the building  above them they could hear footsteps and a murmur of voices evidently josiah crabtree had joined the brokers  you stay here and ill investigate further said dick after a pause during which he had espied a stairs leading upward to the rear of the house  he mounted the stairs and came out into a wide kitchen no one was present nor did any fire burn in the big stove from the kitchen a door led to a dining room which in turn led to a sitting room in the lastnamed room were the three men  do you think hell raise a row pelter was asking  he cant raise much of a row with that towel bound over his mouth replied josiah crabtree  its lucky we had this place to come to put in japson i only hope they dont get on our trail and follow us  i dont think they will follow us here said pelter then followed a murmur as he and the other broker went over the legal papers on the table  dick wondered what he had best do next he gazed around the kitchen and saw a small side door opening on an enclosed stairs leading to the second floor he went up the stairs noiselessly    chapter xxiii   the rescue  the oldest rover boy had reached a rapid conclusion this was that his father was not on the first floor of the house nor in the cellar consequently if he was in the building at all and dick believed he was he must be somewhere upstairs while the three rascals were in the sitting room he intended to make a quick investigation  with his stick still in his hand in case of attack dick reached the second floor and entered a small bed chamber opening from this was a second room containing a cot beyond the rooms was a closet and that was all  too bad this stairs leads only to a kitchen addition murmured the boy how can i get into the main house why didnt they cut a door through  he looked out of a window and saw the roof of a porch at the end of the roof was another window one of a room in the main building without hesitation dick raised the sash of the window at which he stood and stepped out on the porch top soon he was at the other window  it was locked but the catch was not a strong one and with the blade of his pocketknife he easily pushed it back then the sash came up and he stepped into the bedroom beyond  the room was empty and the bed showed that it had not been used for some time dick crossed the apartment and opened a door leading to a wide hallway from downstairs came a murmur of voices the rascals were still in consultation  swiftly the oldest rover boy passed from one room to another of the big house each was empty and in the last he came to a halt somewhat dismayed then he thought of an enclosed staircase he had noticed leading to the next floor and he hurried to this  the third floor of the building was but an open garret piled high with old furniture and discarded things generally the two windows were covered with dirt and cobwebs and as it was dark outside because of the rain dick could see but little  father he called softly father are you here  he listened and heard a tapping coming from one end of the garret he moved over in the direction and struck a match then he gave a cry half of gladness and half of dismay  his parent was there bound to an upright of the garret floor he had his hands behind him and a towel was tied over his mouth with deft fingers dick unloosed the towel and then he cut his fathers bonds with his pocketknife  oh dick how glad i am that you have come gasped anderson rover when he could speak that towel nearly smothered me  did they hurt you any dad asked the boy anxiously  not so very much dick we had several rough and tumble fights when i tried to get away from them but they were too many for me have they gone  no they are in the sitting room below talking matters over  and you came here all alone asked mr rover stretching his cramped limbs  no tom and sam are down in the cellar i told them i would come upstairs and investigate  good then we are four to three i am glad to know that it will make it easier to get away from them  have you done anything for them i mean signed any papers or anything like that asked the son anxiously  no they wanted to keep me from signing certain papers that must be signed inside of two days dick  i know it  they also wanted me to sign other documents and crabtree said if i didnt do it he would leave me here to starve  the rascal muttered dick we have got to get him back to jail thats sure are you sure you are well enough to go with me dad   i i think so dick but this has been an awful strain on me sighed anderson rover  he was very pale and the hand he placed on dicks shoulder trembled greatly  after this you must let me attend to business for you said the son i am old enough to do it you need a complete rest  yes dick but your college career  well talk about those things later dad first i want to get you away from here and in a safe place then well attend to crabtree pelter and japson added dick grimly  the business matters have been too much for me i realize it now sighed anderson rover i must take a rest a good long rest they would not have gotten the best of me if i had been stronger  come said dick dont make any noise if you can help it he added in a whisper  he guided his parent and both tiptoed their way to the second floor of the dwelling then they entered the bed chamber opening on the top of the porch and so made their way down to the kitchen and then into the cellar  father cried sam and tom simultaneously and rushed to embrace their parent  my boys murmured anderson rover and the tears stood in his eyes never before had he realized how much they were to him  come on no time to talk now said dick in a low voice well get away from here first  but those rascals began sam  well take care of them sam never fear  the boys led their father from the cellar and across the back yard to the barn from the barn a lane ran to the main road the lane had a hedge that practically hid it from the house  wait here in the barn said dick but keep out of sight  where are you going asked tom  to watch on the road for a wagon or an auto to take us to the nearest town or railroad station  going to leave those men here dick  not much i thought sam might take dad back to new york while you and i had it out with crabtree and the others  good im with you cried tom  dick posted himself on the highway and presently saw a covered wagon approaching drawn by a spirited team the driver was a young man evidently from some nearby town  going to town asked dick as he stopped the fellow  yes want a ride and the young man smiled  i dont but another fellow my brother and my father do said dick if youll take them well pay you  all right was the answer come right along  how far is it to the railroad station went on dick  about two miles  will you take em over  sure im going there myself  dick hurried back to the barn and soon sam and mr rover were in the wagon before sam left his big brother gave him some instructions in private then the wagon went on through the rain  thank heaven dad is safe murmured tom when the wagon had disappeared i hope sam doesnt let him out of his sight until those business affairs are settled up  he is going to take him to the outlook hotel first answered dick but he is going to do more than that tom if it is possible  what  i told him to stop in that town and send some help here a police official or a constable or some men crabtree has got to go back to jail and i think we ought to have pelter and japson locked up too although that may depend upon what father may have to say  then we cant do anything until somebody gets here from town said tom somewhat disappointedly  we can watch those rascals and listen to what they are talking about returned dick  both boys returned to the barn to get out of the rain then they sneaked to the cellar of the house and up to the kitchen and then to a little storeroom next to the dining room from the storeroom they could catch much of the conversation coming from the three men in the dining room  there were some matters dick and tom did not understand but from what was said they learned that japson was a distant relative of josiah crabtree and the two had been in several shady transactions together crabtree had agreed if aided in his escape from the plankville jail to assist the brokers in making anderson rover a prisoner and keeping him such until he signed certain documents and until the time had passed when he could no longer take up the options which were so valuable to the rovers and their friends  well i think these documents are all right the boys heard jesse pelter say presently now we can turn them over to belright fogg and tell him to go ahead  the boys looked at each other in amazement belright fogg the lawyer who had tried to outwit them in their claim against the railroad company because of the smashed dartaway was that fellow mixed up in this game also it looked like it    chapter xxiv   from a garret window  this is getting interesting whispered tom  i should say so murmured dick  that must have been what was bringing belright fogg down to new york city  it looks like it  well if he is mixed up in this he can get pinched with the rest of the rascals  right you are  after that the boys listened to more of the talk between the brokers and josiah crabtree from what was said it was easy to guess that the plotters expected to make quite a large sum of money out of their evil doings  but you have got to get rovers signatures to those papers said jesse pelter  well do it cried josiah crabtree even if we have to starve him into it  i hope those boys didnt come after the schooner muttered japson  i reckon captain rodney will know how to throw em off the scent returned crabtree  we were lucky to find that automobile at the tavern went on pelter  some more talk followed and then japson exclaimed  why cant we make rover sign those papers now maybe we can scare him into it  we might try answered his partner slowly  the men arose and japson lit a lantern for he knew it was dark in the garret then one behind the other they filed out into the hallway and went upstairs  they are going to find out something pretty soon chuckled tom  come on let us follow em tom answered his brother ive got a new idea  what is it  perhaps we can lock em in that garret until help arrives  just the cheese dick i remember there was a lock on the door and maybe we can fasten it in some other way too so they cant break out  they cant get out by the windows they are too high from the ground  by this time the three men were mounting the garret stairs they had to pass around a pile of furniture to get to where anderson rover had been kept a prisoner  quick now cried dick as the men disappeared from view he closed the garret door and turned the key in the lock get a chair or two tom so we can wedge the door fast  tom understood and ran into a nearby room to bring out a square table the stairway to the garret ran from a right angle of the wall so that the table could be stood up against the door with the bottom of the four legs against the wall opposite some books chanced to be handy and the lads were able to place these against the wall under the feet of the table legs thus wedging the door fast  now i reckon theyll have their own job getting out cried tom grimly  go to a front window and watch the road ordered his big brother if you see any help coming call them  tom at once departed to station himself at the window of one of the front bed chambers by this time a clattering of feet could be heard on the garret stairs  he has locked the door on us came a cry in jesse pelters voice  how did he get free asked japson i thought we tied him good  he cut the ropes cried josiah crabtree but how he got hold of his knife to do it i cant guess  dick had to smile to himself evidently the rascals thought his father had liberated himself and turned the tables on them  hi rover are you out there called jesse pelter if you are you had better unlock that door  to this call dick did not answer  he must have run away exclaimed japson break the door down we must catch him  thats the talk added josiah crabtree in great excitement  touch the door at your peril cried dick sharply i am armed and i will stand no nonsense  who is that asked japson  that wasnt rovers voice added his partner  i think i know who that is answered josiah crabtree and his voice commenced to tremble dick rover is that you he called faintly  yes dont you dare to touch that door crabtree replied dick  is it dick rover questioned pelter  yes  anderson rovers oldest son the one who was in the rowboat with the others  yes  then we have been followed after all shouted japson hoarsely we have been trapped  youve hit the nail on the head called out dick now dont touch that door or it will be the worse for you  is he alone whispered pelter  no i am not alone answered dick hi tom am i alone he called  not much answered tom we are all on deck here and all armed you just sit still and suck your thumbs until the officers come he added dryly  the officers shrieked josiah crabtree and was so overcome that he sank down on one of the steps of the stairs  see here dick rover said jesse pelter after a pause let us see if we cant er patch this up somehow  you can do your patchingup after you are in jail mr pelter  if you have me arrested boy you will be sorry for it growled the broker  we can ruin your family and disgrace your father added japson better let us go and fix this up without the police  no i am going to have you locked up replied dick determinedly as to what charge will be brought against you ill have to consult my father about that first  you lock us up and youll get nothing out of us growled japson we can ruin your family and well do it  cant we get out another way asked josiah crabtree in a whisper  i dont think so said the owner of the house we can go up and look around  all returned to the garret floor and walked to one window and the other the distance to the ground was all of twentyfive feet too far for any of them to risk a drop  we might make a rope of these old blankets suggested jesse pelter talk to rover at the door while i try it  his partner went back to the door while the others commenced to make a rope by tearing a blanket into strips and tying the ends together the back window was raised and the rope lowered  nobody in sight cried crabtree looking down oh i trust we can get away from them he saw a term in prison staring him in the face  dont lose any time cried japson here tie the end fast to that old bed now let me get out  ill go first cried josiah crabtree and shoved the broker aside with trembling hands he grasped the improvised rope and slipped out of the window  in the meantime dick commenced to suspect that all was not right and called to tom  go below and outside and look at those windows he said if they try to drop shy some stones at em  i will answered tom and ran down the stairs three steps at a time he looked up at the front of the house but saw nothing unusual then he dashed to the rear  hi stop he called out as he saw josiah crabtree dangling just under the garret window get back there or ill fire at you and looking around tom saw a sharp stone and picked it up  as he did this there was a sudden tearing sound and the blanketrope parted at the point where it passed over the window sill josiah crabtree uttered a wild yell of terror and clutched vainly at the sill and the clapboards under it then he came tumbling to the ground doubling up in a heap as he did so tom expected him to arise and run but he lay still where he had fallen  hes hurt seriously hurt muttered the youth maybe hes killed    chapter xxv   what happened to tom  tom glanced up to see the white face of jesse pelter peering down upon him  you had better let us out of this cried the broker hoarsely  you stay where you are if you know what is best for you returned tom  is he dead went on the broker referring to crabtree  i dont know  the youth ran up to the former school teacher and turned him over as he did this josiah crabtree gave a gasp and a groan and opened his eyes  oh oh what a a fa fall  if you hadnt tried to get away it wouldnt have happened returned tom briefly he could have but little sympathy for such a hardened rascal  josiah crabtree sat up and then tried to get to his feet there was a cut on his forehead from which the blood was flowing  oh oh cried the man and put his hand to his left leg it was twisted under him in a peculiar fashion to get up on it was impossible and crabtree fell back with a cry of pain and fright  my leg it is broken oh what shall i do rover please help me and the former teacher turned a look of genuine misery on tom  let me examine it said the boy in a more kindly tone he approached the man and felt of the injured limb by the way it was doubled up tom felt certain it must be broken perhaps in two places  i dont know what i can do said tom i guess you need a doctor ill carry you to the barn if you say so or into the house  cant you you began josiah crabtree and then another look of pain crossed his face and he fainted  alarmed tom picked up the tall thin form and carried the man into the house for it was still raining although not as hard as before he placed crabtree on an old couch in the sitting room and getting some water laid a wet cloth over his bruised and swelling forehead knowing but little about broken limbs he did not attempt to do anything for the broken leg but placed that member out in a somewhat straight position he called up to dick and told his brother of what had happened  keep the other fellows up there tom yelled back the big brother dont let em get away  at this tom ran out of the house once more with the fall of crabtree had come the greater portion of the blanketrope pelter had disappeared from the window and evidently he and japson were in consultation  see here rover we want to talk to you called out the broker reappearing at the window a minute later call your brothers  what do you want  we want to fix matters up with you  you can do that after you are in jail  youll gain nothing by having us arrested  that remains to be seen  we have got the upper hand in those deals with your father and if you have us locked up we wont let go no matter what happens put in japson  well make you let go returned tom with determination you fellows have reached the end of your string and the sooner you realize it the better it will be for you  bah do you think well give up the things we have fought so hard to get not much  while japson was speaking pelter had stepped back into the garret now he came again to the window at the same time whispering to his companion  hello dixon he called as if to somebody behind tom  as was but natural the youth below turned quickly thinking some friend of the brokers had appeared the moment tom turned pelter hurled something down at him it was an old wooden footstool and it struck the youth squarely on the head down went poor tom in the grass senseless  now is our time exclaimed pelter quick with that other rope  a second rope also made from sections of a blanket but stronger than the first was produced as the lower end struck the ground pelter commenced to slide down closely followed by his partner evidently they were both willing to risk their lives in an effort to escape the thought of going to jail filled them with grim terror  reaching the ground neither of the men hesitated an instant over what to do next the man who owned the place knew it thoroughly and he turned in the direction of the barn and his partner went after him they crossed a back lot and then coming to a side road took to that running as fast as their wind and strength permitted  in the meantime dick hearing crabtree groaning came down in the sitting room to look at the sufferer the man was still flat on his back  oh my leg he groaned oh my leg cant you get a doctor  perhaps later on answered dick  oh rover i never thought i would come to this whined the criminal oh the pain  well do what we can for you crabtree you had better lie still for the present  dick listened in the hallway as nobody seemed to be at the garret stairway he ran outside to learn how tom was faring  tom tom what happened to you he cried in horror when he beheld his brother on the ground then he saw the footstool and a cut on toms head and understood what had occurred the dangling rope told the rest of the story  they have gotten away he groaned and after all our efforts to hold them prisoners until help came too bad  he wanted to go after the brokers but just now his concern was entirely for his brother  he turned tom over and then ran for some water when he returned tom was just opening his eyes  dick some something hi hit me gasped the hurt one  they threw that wooden footstool at you tom im afraid youre badly hurt  am i i i feel mighty queer returned tom and then he closed his eyes again  dick was now more alarmed than ever he carried his brother to the dining room and laid him on some chairs with a doubledup blanket from a bed for a pillow he washed toms head and bound it up as best he could once or twice the injured youth opened his eyes for an instant but he did not make a sound  it was a fearful blow it must have been thought dick i hope they didnt crack his skull  josiah crabtree was still groaning in the next room but dick paid little attention to the man nor did he think of the rascals who had escaped all his thoughts were centered on tom  if i only knew where to get a doctor he mused then he ran out of the house by the front door and looked up and down the road  a carriage was approaching containing three men as it drew closer dick saw that one of the men wore a shining badge on his coat and carried a policemans club  want me here he cried on catching sight of the youth  are you a policeman  i am  then come right in  the policeman and the other two men followed dick into the house the youth took them first to where josiah crabtree lay  there is a man who escaped from the jail at plankville he tried to get out of a garret window and had a fall i guess his leg is broken  if thats the case he wont need much watching from me replied the policeman grimly  the other two rascals who were with him got away after hitting my brother with a footstool and hurting him quite badly here he is can i get a doctor anywhere around here  doctor martin lives up the road about half a mile said the man who had driven the carriage  will you get him for me just as soon as you can  i will said the man and went off at once after the physician  while he was gone dick told his story to the policeman and the other man who was a local constable both listened with interest and said they would make a hunt for pelter and japson  they may go back to new york said dick if they do telephone down there to have them arrested and he gave the address of the brokers offices  it was about half an hour later when doctor martin and elderly physician arrived dick escorted him at once to where tom lay still in a semiconscious state  a bad case i am afraid said the doctor after a brief examination his skull may be fractured we had better get him to the hospital at once    chapter xxvi   dick takes the reins  it was long after dark before an ambulance could be brought to the old house tom was still unconscious in fact he had not even opened his eyes for the past half hour dicks heart was filled with fear was it possible that his brother so full of fun and high spirits was so badly hurt that he was going to die  no no not that groaned poor dick and sent up an earnest prayer to heaven that tom might be spared  the doctor had said that josiah crabtrees leg was broken in two places above and below the knee the physician had done what he could for the sufferer and crabtree was to be removed to the hospital after tom was taken there  neither the policeman nor the constable had come back to the house so dick did not know whether or not the brokers had been captured to tell the truth he hardly thought of the men so anxious was he concerning toms condition  can i go to the hospital with you he asked when they were about to take tom away  if you wish mr rover said the ambulance doctor hop up on the seat with the driver and dick did so  it was a drive of several miles and during that time dick said but little once tom roused up to murmur something about his head but that was all  as soon as the hospital was reached tom was placed in a private room dick asking for such accommodations  do your best for my brother said he to those in attendance dont let money stand in the way ill see that all bills are paid  well have the best doctor we can get for your brother answered the physician in attendance and then he sent for a specialist  after that there was nothing to do but to wait dick went down to the office and called up the outlook hotel in new york by telephone he found that sam had just arrived there with his father and told his younger brother of what had occurred  dont worry father too much about it said he maybe it will all come out right in the end anyway i hope so and then he told sam to get the police to watch the offices of pelter japson  company and also look out for belright fogg  before the specialist arrived to care for tom the ambulance came back with josiah crabtree the former teacher of putnam hall showed his cowardly nature by groaning dismally every time he was moved he was placed in a public ward and those in attendance were told that he was an escaped prisoner and must not be allowed to get away again under any circumstances  he wont try it himself for a good many weeks said one of the doctors grimly those breaks are had ones hell be lucky if he gets over them  at last the specialist came and took charge of tom for over an hour dick waited for a report on his brothers condition when the specialist came to the youth he looked unusually grave  your brothers case is a peculiar one mr rover said he i do not find any crack in the skull but he has received a great shock and what the outcome of that will be i cannot say  you dont think he will will die faltered dick hardly able to frame the words  hardly as bad as that mr rover but the shock has been a heavy one and he will need close attention for some time i will come in again tomorrow morning and see him  well do your best said dick brokenly  i always do that answered doctor garrison gravely  there were no accommodations for dick at the hospital so he found a room at a hotel several blocks away from the hotel he sent another telephone message to sam telling him what the specialist had said then he asked sam if he would come up  if youll do that i can go down and help father he added  all right ill come up tonight or first thing in the morning said sam  it was eight oclock in the morning when the youngest rover boy appeared he was as anxious as dick concerning tom and both waited for the specialist to appear and report tom had regained consciousness for a few minutes but that was all  he is no worse reported doctor garrison i hope to see him improved by this afternoon i will call again about three oclock and then he left directions with the nurse as to what should be done  this is terrible dick murmured sam when the brothers were alone in the room at the hotel poor tom i cant bear to see him lay as he does  i feel the same way sam answered dick but i think i ought to go down to new york and help father with his business affairs he isnt well enough to do anything alone  thats true dick and this news about tom has upset him worse than ever  a little later they separated sam promising to send word both to new york city and to valley view farm as soon as there was any change in toms condition dick hurried to the railroad station and a little later got a train that took him to the grand central depot  the youth found his father at the rooms in the outlook hotel he having promised to remain there until sam returned or dick arrived mr rover looked much careworn and dick realized more than ever that his parent was in no physical or mental condition to transact business  you ought to return to the farm and rest father said he kindly  i must fix up these papers first dick was the answer but tell me about poor tom oh to think that those villains should strike him down that way  they are desperate and will stop at nothing now answered the son  then he told as much as he could about his stricken brother anderson rover shook his head sadly  i am afraid he will never get over it dick he groaned  let us hope for the best father answered the son as bravely as he could  then he questioned his father about the investments in the sunset irrigation company and in the lands out west and soon the pair were going over the matters carefully  i think we need the services of a firstclass lawyer one we can trust absolutely said dick  but where can you find such a lawyer asked the father  oh there must be plenty of them dick thought for a moment one of my best chums at putnam hall and at brill was john powell songbird you know him he has an uncle here frank powell who is a lawyer the family are wellconnected perhaps this frank powell may be the very man we need i can call him up on the telephone and find out  do as you think best dick sighed mr rover from now on i shall leave these business matters in your hands i realize that i am too feeble to attend to them properly  dick lost no time in communication with mr frank a a powell as his name appeared in the telephone book when the youth explained who he was the lawyer said he would be glad to meet the rovers his office was not far from the outlook hotel and he said he would call at once dick explaining that his father was not feeling very well  mr powells coming inspired dick with immediate confidence he was a cleancut man with a shrewd manner but a look of absolute honesty  my nephew has often spoken of you he said shaking hands with dick i shall be pleased to do what i can for you  its a complicated case answered dick my father can tell you about it first and then ill tell you what i know and show you all our papers  a talk lasting over an hour followed the lawyer asked many questions and studied the various documents with interest  from what i can make out mr rover that concern pelter japson  company are a set of swindlers said he at last if i were you id close down on them at once and with the heaviest possible hand to give them any leeway at all might be fatal to your interests  do as you think best with dicks advice returned mr rover i am going to leave my business affairs in his hands after this he added  then well go ahead at once cried the lawyer i will draw up the necessary papers and you can sign them well get after that whole bunch hotfooted  and dont spare them added dick thinking of poor tom they deserve all that is coming to them  and theyll get it said the lawyer briefly    chapter xxvii   dan baxter gives aid  the next morning was a busy one for dick he visited the lawyers office at an early hour and then went to the police station  we are watching those offices in wall street said the officer at the desk in the station but so far neither pelter nor japson has shown himself the clerks say they are out of town one in boston and the other in philadelphia but cant give any addresses  well dont let up on the watch replied dick we want to get them if it can possibly be done i may have another charge to make against them and he told of how tom had been struck with the footstool and was now in the hospital  they sure must be rascals returned the man at the desk well wed do all we can but maybe theyve cleared out for good  towards noon came a telephone message from sam to the hotel dick had just come in and he answered it  tom is a little better said the youngest rover he is conscious and has asked about dad and you he has taken a little nourishment too  what does the doctor say about the case questioned dick anxiously  he said it is a strange case and that he will watch it closely i heard him say to the nurse to watch tom very closely  why that he was so low  no that he might go out of his mind oh dick wouldnt that be awful and sams voice showed his distress  you mean that he might go go insane or something like that  yes not for always you understand but temporarily  well all they can do is to watch him sam and you keep close by in case anything more happens added dick and then told his brother of what had been done in the metropolis towards straightening out the business tangle  mr powell was to see some people in brooklyn regarding the land deal in which anderson rover held an interest and he had asked dick to meet him in that borough at four oclock at three oclock dick left the outlook hotel to keep the engagement  you had better stay here until i get back in case any word comes in about tom said he to his father  very well dick i shall be glad of the rest replied anderson rover  he had already given the particulars of how he had been kidnapped while on his way to meet japson the broker had come up accompanied by the disguised crabtree and he had been forced into a taxicab and a sponge saturated with chloroform had been held to his nose he had become unconscious and while in that condition had been taken to some house up in harlem from there he had been transferred to the ellen rodney on the evening before the boys had discovered his whereabouts  they treated me very harshly mr rover had said mr crabtree was particularly mean  well he is suffering for it dick had answered sam telephoned that his leg was in very bad shape and the doctors thought he would be a cripple for life  to get to brooklyn dick took the subway crossing under the east river he did not know much about the place but had received instructions how to reach the offices where he was to meet mr powell and the others  there was a great rush on the streets owing to a small fire in the vicinity dick stopped for a minute to watch a fire engine at work on a corner and as he did so somebody tapped him on the shoulder  dick rover of all people came the exclamation what are you doing in brooklyn  dick turned quickly to find himself confronted by a tall heavyset youth dressed in a business suit  dan baxter he cried how are you and he shook hands  as my old readers well know dan baxter was an old acquaintance of the rover boys when at putnam hall he had been a great bully and had tried more than once to get the best of our heroes but he had been foiled and then he had drifted to the west and south and there the rovers had found him away from home and practically penniless they had set him on his feet and he had gotten a position as a traveling salesman and now he counted the rovers his best friends and was willing to do anything for them  oh im pretty well answered dan baxter with a grin my job agrees with me  what are you doing dan  oh im still selling jewelry doing firstrate too added the former bully a bit proudly  i am mighty glad to hear it  how are you and the others getting along dick went on baxter curiously thought you were at brill college  im here on business and dick gave the other a brief account of what had happened  sorry tom got hurt and hope he will come out all right said dan baxter sympathetically but who are those men you mentioned  a firm of brokers named pelter japson  company  what ejaculated dan baxter did you say japson  yes dan do you know him  sure i do he used to be in a jewelry firm in albany they tried to stick our firm but we shut down on em but that isnt all dick i saw japson today not two hours ago  you did where and now dick was all attention  i visited a er a lady friend of mine she lives in an apartment house near prospect park i might as well tell you that some day we are going to be married well when i was coming out of the place i saw japson go in he and two other men  dan show me that place and do it as quickly as possible cried dick come on dont tell me you cant ill pay you for your time and dick caught the other youth by the arm  ill do it willingly dick and there wont be any time to pay for even if it takes a week cried dan baxter i am glad to be able to do you a favor indeed i am and he gazed admiringly at the oldest rover boy just you come with me  dan baxter led the way to the nearest elevated station and they ran upstairs to the platform and soon boarded a car bound for the vicinity of prospect park  the young lady lives in the nirwick apartments explained baxter it is a big place with elevator service i dont know to which apartment japson went but maybe the elevator man can tell us  describe the other two men to me if you can dan  the young traveling salesman did so and dick came to the conclusion that one of the men must have been pelter the identity of the third was a mystery  maybe it was that belright fogg thought the youth well ill soon find out if they are still at the apartment house and i hope they are  at last the elevated train reached the proper station and dick and baxter alighted the latter led the way for a distance of two blocks  there is the apartment said baxter pointing the building out if you want those men arrested hadnt you better call a policeman or two  i can do that later after i have spotted them answered dick  a colored man ran the elevator he had often seen dan and knew him  the gentlemen you mean went up to the fourth floor to the apartment that was rented last week  may i ask who rented it asked dick  a lawyer sah a mr fogg hes got a queer first name  belright  thats it sah belright fogg  just as i thought murmured dick they didnt go out did they  i dont think they did i didnt see em and i dont think they would go downstairs without using the elevator although they could use the stairs  which apartment is it  on the fourth floor the apartment in front on the right answered the elevator man  ill go up said dick he motioned baxter to one side dan will you go out and get a policeman or two just as quickly as you can he whispered  i will returned the young traveling salesman and hurried out on the street again  dick stepped into the elevator and in a few seconds was deposited on the fourth floor of the apartment house he walked to the front and to the right and stopped in front of one of the doors from the room beyond came a murmur of voices he listened intently the voices were those of pelter japson and fogg    chapter xxviii   the capture  with bated breath dick knelt at the door and applied his ear to the keyhole at first he could hear only indistinctly but gradually he caught the drift of the conversation between the rascally brokers and the former railroad lawyer  then you want me to date those papers a week back he heard belright fogg ask  thats it answered pelter  and remember we signed them just before we went to the west added japson  and remember also that you saw us take a train at the grand central depot went on pelter  oh ill remember that returned the lawyer with a sly chuckle and ill remember also that i got two telegrams from you one from chicago and one from detroit and he laughed again  that alibi ought to fix us up remarked japson anyway it will set the authorities to guessing  it will help provided that fellow crabtree doesnt squeel said pelter he gave his word when we were in the garret that he would keep mum no matter what happened but if he was badly hurt he may have told everything  fogg you must try to see him in the hospital said japson tell him it will do no good for him to tell anything and that if he keeps mum we will remain his friends and do all we possibly can for him  you are piling a lot of work on my shoulders grumbled the lawyer and shady work too what do i get out of this  you know what i promised you answered jesse pelter  a thousand isnt enough just look at the risk i am running  well if you help us to clear ourselves well make it two thousand dollars cried japson he paused a moment quite a swell apartment fogg  its good enough  why cant we stay here for a day or two questioned japson  i er suppose you could answered the lawyer with some hesitation but dont you think you would be better off out of the state or in canada  thats what i say cried pelter canada for mine ive been wanting to visit montreal and quebec now is our chance  all right whatever you say answered japson maybe we would be safer out of the country until this matter blew over hang the luck it was too bad to have rover get away from us as he did if we could have held him back a couple of days longer that land and maybe those stocks would have been ours  hes got some smart sons that man observed fog i know for i once ran up against them and he told about the biplane incident  they are altogether too smart growled pelter id like to wring their necks for em  well well turn the trick on em yet said japson remember the game isnt ended until the last card is played  thats right thought dick and it wont be long before i play the last card  after this affair is a thing of the past i am going after those business interests of the rovers went on jesse pelter they are pretty well tangled up they got so while rover was sick i think we can make something out of them yet  not if i know it murmured dick to himself you are a firstclass fellow to put in jail you and the others too  the talk in the apartment went on covering the things belright fogg was to do while pelter and japson were in hiding in canada the unscrupulous lawyer was to produce a power of attorney dated some days before so that he might act in place of the brokers he was also to do his best to help the brokers prove an alibi when accused of the abduction of anderson rover  im getting dry remarked japson presently fogg havent you got something to drink and some cigars  sure i have answered the lawyer and dick heard him leave the apartment and go into a diningroom  while dick was listening at the door he also kept his ears open for the return of dan baxter presently he heard the elevator come upstairs and then there sounded a low whistle a whistle dick had heard many times while he was a cadet at putnam hall  eagerly the oldest rover boy tiptoed his way down the corridor baxter came forward to meet him accompanied by two policemen and the elevator man who wanted to know what the trouble was  the two brokers are in that room whispered dick pointing to the door of the apartment they are planning to skip out to canada and leave their affairs in the hands of the lawyer who has rented this apartment he is almost as much of a rascal as any of them for he is to take their power of attorney dated some days back and is going to try to prove an alibi for them i heard em arrange the whole thing  the rascals murmured baxter glad you cornered em dick  you helped dan i shant forget that returned dick warmly  what do you want us to do asked one of the policemen  i want all three men arrested answered dick ill make a charge against them dont let em get away theyll do it if its possible  all right but you must come along to make the charge answered the bluecoat  all right  please dont make no more row in the house than you can help put in the elevator man this is a swell apartment and we dont like rows i didnt know that lawyer who took this apartment was a crook  well do the job as quietly as possible answered the second policeman who chanced to know the elevator man  dan i think you can help me out suggested dick you might go to the door and call out that there is a telegram for belright fogg then when he opens the door push into the room and well follow  want me to help asked the elevator man who was becoming interested  if you will said dick you can guard the stairs so they cant run down that way  ill do it  without further delay dan baxter walked to the door at which dick had been listening he chanced to have an old telegram envelope in his pocket and this he produced he knocked loudly on the portal  who is there cried the lawyer in a somewhat startled voice and baxter heard several chairs shifted back as the occupants of the apartment leaped to their feet  telegram for mr fogg belright fogg drawled dan in imitation of an a d t youth  a telegram eh muttered the lawyer wonder what is up now  he came to the door and unlocked it cautiously he was going to open it only a few inches to peer out but baxter threw his weight against the portal sending the lawyer backwards and bumping into jesse pelter  hi whats this stammered belright fogg what do you mean by  he got no further for at that instant dick came into the apartment closely followed by the two policemen  at once there was a wild commotion pelter and japson let out yells of alarm and both tried to back away into the next room but dick was too quick for them and barred their progress  let me go yelled pelter and tried to hurl dick to one side then japson struck out with his fist but the oldest rover boy dodged  so thats your game is it cried dan baxter as he saw the attack two can play at that and drawing back the young traveling salesman hit japson a blow on the chin that bowled the broker over like a tenpin  in the meantime dick had grappled with pelter and was holding the rascally broker against the wall one of the policemen already held fogg who was trembling from head to foot in sudden panic  surrender in the name of the law said the bluecoat and he made a move as if to draw a pistol  i i sur render gasped belright fogg and up went his hands tremblingly  the other policeman produced a pair of handcuffs and in a twinkling they were slipped upon japsons wrist then the bluecoats turned towards pelter  you shant arrest me yelled that broker savagely and with a wrench he tore himself from dicks grasp and started through the rooms to the rear of the apartment    chapter xxix   brought to terms  stop him  he must not get away  such were some of the cries that echoed through the apartment as jesse pelter ran for the rear room  he knew there was a fire escape there and thought he might reach the ground from that  but dick was at his heels determined that the broker should not escape if he could possibly prevent it  the window to the fire escape was open for a maid in the kitchen had just set out some cooked dish to cool  pelter made a leap for the window nearly scaring the maid into a fit she screamed loudly and as she did so dick made a wild leap and caught pelter by the foot  let go rover yelled the broker hoarsely  i wont you are not going to get away pelter  there was a struggle and the broker aimed a blow at dicks head then the oldest rover boy suddenly caught the rascal by the neck and banged his head vigorously against the window casing  ouch dont groaned the broker oh my skull is broken  then keep still answered dick grimly and he continued to hold the man soon one of the policemen came up and then much against his will the head of the firm of pelter japson  company was handcuffed like his partner in crime  youll suffer for this rover see if you dont growled jesse pelter after the excitement was over i have done nothing wrong and i can prove it this is all a plot on the part of you and your family to get our firm into trouble  you can do your talking when you are in jail answered dick briefly i know what i am doing  maybe you got crabtree to hatch up a story against us came from japson  never mind what crabtree confessed said dick youll get what is coming to you never fear  i guess i had better send in a call for the patrol wagon said one of the policemen can you watch em jake  sure answered the second bluecoat i guess the young fellows will help  i will said dick  so will i put in dan he turned to dick im mighty glad to be of service to you it kind of helps to to pay off old scores eh he faltered  yes dan you are doing us a great service and i shant forget it returned dick with warmth  a number of tenants in the apartment house had been alarmed by what was going on and among them were the girl baxter was engaged to marry and her mother dan quickly explained matters to them and introduced dick and the latter told of the service baxter had done then the police patrol wagon came along and the prisoners and the others went below  maybe i had better go to headquarters with you suggested dan to dick  yes youll have to go put in one of the policemen  the ride was not a long one and as soon as the prisoners were brought in dick explained the situation and asked that the authorities in brooklyn communicate with those in new york this was done and then pelter japson and fogg were held for a further hearing  cant we get bail demanded the lawyer  certainly if you wish was the reply and then the amount was fixed and the prisoners sent out a messenger to see if they could not get somebody to go on their bail bonds  dicks parting with baxter was very cordial the oldest rover boy realized that the former bully of putnam hall was greatly changed and that he had done him a great service  i wish you all kinds of luck dan he said youve got a nice position and a fine girl and you ought to do well  do you like her dick and dan blushed a little we expect to be married soon  well i am going to be married myself before long  is that so good enough i guess i know the girl and dan grinned  you do dan  give her my best regards and tell her i think she is getting the best fellow in the world said baxter and shook dicks hand and thus the two former enemies parted  dick had already called up mr powell on the telephone telling the lawyer of what had occurred now he engaged a taxicab to take him to the place which he had started out to visit when coming to brooklyn it was rather late but the lawyer had persuaded the people he had come to see to wait  an interview lasting over an hour followed the lawyer had already explained many things and now dick told of others  you have opened our eyes mr rover said one of the men present when dick had finished we rather suspected pelter japson  company and we were bewildered by what your father proposed to do now all is perfectly clear and if you wish us to do so well stand by your father to the end  thank you very much cried the youth in delight  your father is not very well you say said another of the men in that case  i am going to transact his business for him after this answered dick he is going to place it in my hands  you are rather young mr rover but the way you handled those brokers shows you can do things i wish you success  i shall rely upon mr powell for assistance said dick  and ill do what i can put in the lawyer  when dick got back to the outlook hotel it was quite late but he had telephoned to his father so mr rover was not alarmed the youth found his parent smiling pleasantly  good news all around cried anderson rover  then youve heard from sam asked dick quickly  yes he sent in word about an hour ago tom is doing very well and the specialist says he will soon be himself again  thats the best news yet cried dick and his face showed his relief  yes it is even better than this news you sent me that pelter and japson have been captured  well i am mighty glad we rounded up those rascals said the son  so am i  did sam say anything about crabtree  he said crabtree was about the same the doctors are doing what they can for him but he will most likely be a cripple for life  thats bad but he has nobody to blame but himself  after that dick had to sit down and tell his father the details of all that had occurred then he got a late supper and some time after that he and his parent retired the youth was thoroughly tired out but happy  the next few days were as busy as those just past had been dick and his father ran up to where tom lay in the hospital they found the sufferer had come to his senses sam and a nurse were with him  oh ill be all right again in a few days cried tom with a brave attempt at a smile i guess i fared better than old crabtree they tell me hell limp for life  limp for life cried dick  that is what they say  what a terrible affliction murmured the oldest rover boy but he has nobody to blame but himself  tom are you quite comfortable here asked mr rover anxiously  oh yes they do all they can for me dad was the answer  we must send you home as soon as we can  well ill be willing to go returned tom he thought of the quiet farm and of his aunt marthas motherly care and gave a deep sigh  he can be moved in four or five days the doctor said so put in sam ive figured it all out we can take him to the train in an auto and ill see that he gets to oak run all right there jack can meet us with our own machine and the rest will be easy  i can go along said dick  it wont be necessary dick said tom you stay in new york and get dads affairs straightened out  the matter was talked over and it was at length decided that sam should remain with tom and take him home while mr rover and dick returned to the city  four days later the youngest rover got permission from the specialist who had attended tom to take him home an easyriding automobile was procured and in this the two brothers drove to the nearest railroad station a compartment in a parlor car had already been engaged and tom was placed in this and made as comfortable as circumstances permitted the ride was a long and tedious one for the youth and by the time he had made the necessary changes to get to oak run he was pretty well exhausted and had a severe headache  poor boy murmured the hired man who had brought the family touring car to the station  dis am de wust yet de werry wust came from aleck pop who had come along both men aided sam in getting tom into the car and then jack started for valley brook farm running the machine with the greatest possible care  aunt martha stood on the piazza ready to receive the boys and when she beheld toms pale face the tears streamed down her cheeks  my boy my poor boy she cried oh what a terrible happening and she bent over and kissed him  oh dont worry aunt martha ill soon be myself again answered tom as cheerfully as his spirits permitted  ive got the front room all ready for you went on the aunt and she led the way into the house and to the apartment in question here the sufferer was put to bed and his aunt did all in her power to make him comfortable the local doctor had already been notified and soon he appeared to read a note written by the city specialist and listen to what sam had to tell him then he took charge and said tom must be kept very quiet  it shall be as you say doctor said mrs rover and after that for a number of days nobody but the members of the family was allowed to go in and talk to the youth  in the meantime dick and his father had several interviews with their lawyer and also with a lawyer who represented pelter japson and belright fogg the brokers and fogg were anxious to hush matters up and promised to do whatever was wanted by the rovers if they would drop the case against them  i think we had better arrange matters dick said mr rover with a sigh i am tired of fighting if they will do the fair thing all around let them go  just as you say father replied dick but they must give up everything that belongs to us  well you can see to it that they do you and mr powell answered anderson rover i am going back to the farm to rest and after that i think ill travel a little for my health  all right dad but but dick stammered and grew red you er you wont go away until after my wedding will you  no dick ill stay home until after you and dora are married answered mr rover with a quiet smile    chapter xxx   mrs dick rover conclusion  the day of days dick  right you are sam and what a perfect day it is  oh i had this weather made to order came from tom rover with a grin  how do you feel tom questioned his big brother kindly as he turned away from the window to look at the lad who had been hurt  oh im as chipper as a catbird with two tails sang out the funloving rover but his pale face was not in keeping with his words tom was not yet himself but be wasnt going to show it especially on dicks wedding day  all of the rovers had come up to cedarville and they were now stopping at the home of mr laning the father of grace and nellie as my old readers know the stanhopes lived but a short distance away and nearby was putnam hall where the boys had spent so many happy days  dora had left hope as soon as it was settled that she and dick should be married and she and her mother and the others had been busy for some time getting ready for the wedding nellie and grace were also home and were as much excited as dora herself for they were both to be bridesmaids the girls had spent several days in new york shopping and a dressmaker from the city had been called in to dress the young ladies as befitted the occasion  tom was to be dicks best man while sam was to head the ushers at the church the other ushers being songbird stanley fred garrison larry colby and bart conners a delegation of students from brill including william philander tubbs had also come up and were quartered at the cedarville hotel  the wedding was to take place at the cedarville union church a quaint little stone edifice covered with ivy which the stanhopes and the lanings both attended and which the rover boys had often visited while they were cadets at putnam hall the interior of the church was a mass of palms sent up on the boat from ithaca  following the sending out of the invitations to the wedding presents had come in thick and fast to the stanhope home from dicks father came an elegant silver service and from his brothers a beautifullydecorated dinner set while uncle randolph and aunt martha contributed a fine set of the latest encyclopaedias and a speciallybound volume of the uncles book on scientific farming mr anderson rover also contributed a bank book with an amount written therein that nearly took away doras breath  oh dick just look at the sum she cried  it sure is a tidy nest egg smiled the husbandtobe i knew dad would come down handsomely hes the best dad ever was  yes dick and i know i am going to love him just as if i was his own daughter answered dora  mrs stanhope gave her daughter much of the family silver and jewelry and also a full supply of table and other linen from captain putnam came a handsome morris chair and songbird sent in a beautifullybound volume of household poetry with a poem of his own on the flyleaf the students of brill sent in a fine oil painting in a gold frame and the girls at hope contributed an inlaid workbox with a complete sewing outfit from dan baxter who had been invited along with the young lady to whom he was engaged came two gold napkin rings each suitably engraved dan had written to dick saying he would come to the wedding if he had to take a week off to get there he being then in washington on a business trip  the wedding was to take place at high noon and long before that time the many guests began to assemble at the church among the first to arrive was captain putnam in military uniform and attended by about a dozen of the hall cadets george strong the head teacher was also present for he and dick had always been good friends then came the students from brill all in full dress and led by william philander tubbs bedecked as only that dudish student would think of bedecking himself  the lanings and mrs stanhope came together and the rovers followed closely soon the little church was packed and many stood outside unable to get in the organ was playing softly  suddenly the bell in the tower struck twelve as the last stroke died away the organ peeled forth in the grand notes of the wedding march then came the wedding party up the middle aisle a little flower girl preceding them dora was on her uncles arm and wore white satin daintily embroidered and carried a bouquet of bridal roses around her neck was a string of pearls dick had given her the bridesmaids were in pink and also carried bouquets  dick was already at the altar to meet his bride and then began the solemn ceremony that made the pair one for life it was simple and short and at the conclusion dick kissed dora tenderly  the organ pealed out once more and the happy couple marched from the church everybody gazing after them in admiration  a fine couple was captain putnams comment a fine couple truly  yes indeed echoed george strong i wish them every happiness  a perfectly splendid wedding dont you know lisped william philander tubbs why i really couldnt run it off better myself  it was all to the merry was stanleys comment shes a dandy girl too wish i had one half as good  dick rover deserves the best girl in the world was songbirds conclusion he is the finest fellow i know barring none  i suppose youll get up a poem about this songbird suggested one of the other students  perhaps was the answer and the wouldbe poet smiled in a dreamy fashion  it seems only yesterday that the rover boys came to the hall remarked captain putnam to one of his friends my how the years have flown  but they are still boys at least tom and sam are was the ready reply and tom is just as full of sport as he ever was i dont believe hell ever settle down  time will tell but with all his fun he is a good lad at heart and that is what counts  right you are captain putnam i wouldnt give a rap for a lad who didnt have some fun in his makeup  all of them had plenty of fun while they were at my school they cut up a good deal sometimes but i liked them all the better for it somehow concluded the captain with a twinkle in his eyes  carriages and automobiles were in waiting and dick and his bride along with their relatives and many friends were quickly whirled away to the stanhope home here followed numerous congratulations interspersed with not a few kisses mrs stanhopes eyes were still full of tears but she smiled at her newlymade soninlaw  its all right dick she whispered im not a bit sorry but but a woman cant help crying when she sees her only girl getting married  you are not going to lose dora he answered tenderly you are going to get a son thats all  a long table had been spread from the diningroom to the sittingroom with another table in the library and soon a grand wedding dinner was in progress dora sat at her husbands side and never did a pair feel or look more happy close at hand was tom paying his attentions to nellie and at the smaller table sam was doing his best to entertain grace mr anderson rover sat beside mrs stanhope and not far away were the others of the families  well they are married at last said mr rover to mrs stanhope i for one am well satisfied i think they will get along well together  yes mr rover i think they will get along finely answered mrs stanhope i liked dick from the first time i met him and dora well there was nobody else after he came into view and she smiled faintly then her eyes traveled over to where tom and nellie were talking earnestly and his followed i think that is another pair she whispered  i shouldnt wonder was the reply but they can wait a while tom is rather young yet  he looks rather pale  yes that blow he received on the head was a severe one i am worried about it went on mr rover soberly  it had been arranged that dick and dora should depart on a honeymoon trip to washington late that afternoon the dinner over the rooms were cleared and the young folks enjoyed themselves in dancing an orchestra having been engaged for that purpose  how perfectly happy they all seem to be remarked aunt martha to anderson rover as they sat watching the dancing  yes he answered i trust that nothing happens to make it otherwise after this  oh something is bound to happen to those boys murmured the aunt you simply cant hold them in and something did happen and what is was will be related in the next volume of this series to be entitled the rover boys in alaska or lost in the fields of ice in that book we shall learn how tom suddenly lost his mind and wandered away from home and what strenuous things happened to dick and sam when they went after their brother  but for the time being all went well the young folks danced to their hearts content and tom kept them roaring over the many jokes he had saved up for the occasion his head ached a good deal but he refused to let anybody know about it  then came the time for dick and dora to depart an auto was at the door gaily decorated with white ribbons and bearing on the back a sign painted by tom which read were just married another auto was in the backyard to take some of the guests to the steamboat dock  goodbye was the cry as the pair came down the stairs ready for the trip goodbye and good luck and then came a generous shower of rice and several old shoes dora kissed her mother for the last time and she and dick hurried to the auto away they went and the other auto after them tom and sam and some others tooting horns and the girls shrieking gaily  to the steamboat dock i suppose said the driver of the auto to dick  not much cried the newlymarried youth here is where we fool them straight for ithaca and as fast as the law allows  i get you replied the chauffeur grinning  we want to catch the sevenfortyfive train for new york went on dick  well do it sir was the answer and then the auto driver turned on the speed made a whirl around a corner of the road and in a minute more was on the way to ithaca with the second car far behind  hello hes given us the slip cried sam in dismay  never mind let them go whispered grace  yes weve had fun enough added nellie oh what a grand wedding it has been she added with a sigh and then when tom squeezed her hand she blushed  in the other automobile dora and dick sat close together on the back seat under the robe her hand the one with the wedding ring upon it was clasped tightly within his own  glad he whispered  perfectly she answered   the end
