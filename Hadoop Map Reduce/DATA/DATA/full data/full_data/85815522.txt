85815522	in defense of harriet shelley  by mark twain     i  i have committed sins of course but i have not committed enough of them to entitle me to the punishment of reduction to the bread and water of ordinary literature during six years when i might have been living on the fat diet spread for the righteous in professor dowdens life of shelley if i had been justly dealt with  during these six years i have been living a life of peaceful ignorance i was not aware that shelleys first wife was unfaithful to him and that that was why he deserted her and wiped the stain from his sensitive honor by entering into soiled relations with godwins young daughter this was all new to me when i heard it lately and was told that the proofs of it were in this book and that this books verdict is accepted in the girls colleges of america and its view taught in their literary classes  in each of these six years multitudes of young people in our country have arrived at the shelleyreading age are these six multitudes unacquainted with this life of shelley perhaps they are indeed one may feel pretty sure that the great bulk of them are to these then i address myself in the hope that some account of this romantic historical fable and the fabulists manner of constructing and adorning it may interest them  first as to its literary style our negroes in america have several ways of entertaining themselves which are not found among the whites anywhere among these inventions of theirs is one which is particularly popular with them it is a competition in elegant deportment they hire a hall and bank the spectators seats in rising tiers along the two sides leaving all the middle stretch of the floor free a cake is provided as a prize for the winner in the competition and a bench of experts in deportment is appointed to award it sometimes there are as many as fifty contestants male and female and five hundred spectators one at a time the contestants enter clothed regardless of expense in what each considers the perfection of style and taste and walk down the vacant central space and back again with that multitude of critical eyes on them all that the competitor knows of fine airs and graces he throws into his carriage all that he knows of seductive expression he throws into his countenance he may use all the helps he can devise watchchain to twirl with his fingers cane to do graceful things with snowy handkerchief to flourish and get artful effects out of shiny new stovepipe hat to assist in his courtly bows and the colored lady may have a fan to work up her effects with and smile over and blush behind and she may add other helps according to her judgment when the review by individual detail is over a grand review of all the contestants in procession follows with all the airs and graces and all the bowings and smirkings on exhibition at once and this enables the bench of experts to make the necessary comparisons and arrive at a verdict the successful competitor gets the prize which i have before mentioned and an abundance of applause and envy along with it the negroes have a name for this grave deportmenttournament a name taken from the prize contended for they call it a cakewalk  this shelley biography is a literary cakewalk the ordinary forms of speech are absent from it all the pages all the paragraphs walk by sedately elegantly not to say mincingly in their sundaybest shiny and sleek perfumed and with boutonnieres in their buttonholes it is rare to find even a chance sentence that has forgotten to dress if the book wishes to tell us that mary godwin child of sixteen had known afflictions the fact saunters forth in this nobby outfit mary was herself not unlearned in the lore of painmeaning by that that she had not always traveled on asphalt or as some authorities would frame it that she had been there herself a form which while preferable to the books form is still not to be recommended if the book wishes to tell us that harriet shelley hired a wetnurse that commonplace fact gets turned into a dancingmaster who does his professional bow before us in pumps and kneebreeches with his fiddle under one arm and his crushhat under the other thus the beauty of harriets motherly relation to her babe was marred in shelleys eyes by the introduction into his house of a hireling nurse to whom was delegated the mothers tenderest office  this is perhaps the strangest book that has seen the light since frankenstein indeed it is a frankenstein itself a frankenstein with the original infirmity supplemented by a new one a frankenstein with the reasoning faculty wanting yet it believes it can reason and is always trying it is not content to leave a mountain of fact standing in the clear sunshine where the simplest reader can perceive its form its details and its relation to the rest of the landscape but thinks it must help him examine it and understand it so its drifting mind settles upon it with that intent but always with one and the same result there is a change of temperature and the mountain is hid in a fog every time it sets up a premise and starts to reason from it there is a surprise in store for the reader it is strangely nearsighted crosseyed and purblind sometimes when a mastodon walks across the field of its vision it takes it for a rat at other times it does not see it at all  the materials of this biographical fable are facts rumors and poetry they are connected together and harmonized by the help of suggestion conjecture innuendo perversion and semisuppression  the fable has a distinct object in view but this object is not acknowledged in set words percy bysshe shelley has done something which in the case of other men is called a grave crime it must be shown that in his case it is not that because he does not think as other men do about these things  ought not that to be enough if the fabulist is serious having proved that a crime is not a crime was it worth while to go on and fasten the responsibility of a crime which was not a crime upon somebody else what is the use of hunting down and holding to bitter account people who are responsible for other peoples innocent acts  still the fabulist thinks it a good idea to do that in his view shelleys first wife harriet free of all offense as far as we have historical facts for guidance must be held unforgivably responsible for her husbands innocent act in deserting her and taking up with another woman  any one will suspect that this task has its difficulties any one will divine that nice work is necessary here cautious work wily work and that there is entertainment to be had in watching the magician do it there is indeed entertainment in watching him he arranges his facts his rumors and his poems on his table in full view of the house and shows you that everything is thereno deception everything fair and above board and this is apparently true yet there is a defect for some of his best stock is hid in an appendixbasket behind the door and you do not come upon it until the exhibition is over and the enchantment of your mind accomplishedas the magician thinks  there is an insistent atmosphere of candor and fairness about this book which is engaging at first then a little burdensome then a trifle fatiguing then progressively suspicious annoying irritating and oppressive it takes one some little time to find out that phrases which seem intended to guide the reader aright are there to mislead him that phrases which seem intended to throw light are there to throw darkness that phrases which seem intended to interpret a fact are there to misinterpret it that phrases which seem intended to forestall prejudice are there to create it that phrases which seem antidotes are poisons in disguise the naked facts arrayed in the book establish shelleys guilt in that one episode which disfigures his otherwise superlatively lofty and beautiful life but the historians careful and methodical misinterpretation of them transfers the responsibility to the wifes shoulders as he persuades himself the few meagre facts of harriet shelleys life as furnished by the book acquit her of offense but by calling in the forbidden helps of rumor gossip conjecture insinuation and innuendo he destroys her character and rehabilitates shelleysas he believes and in truth his unheroic work has not been barren of the results he aimed at as witness the assertion made to me that girls in the colleges of america are taught that harriet shelley put a stain upon her husbands honor and that that was what stung him into repurifying himself by deserting her and his child and entering into scandalous relations with a schoolgirl acquaintance of his  if that assertion is true they probably use a reduction of this work in those colleges maybe only a sketch outlined from it such a thing as that could be harmful and misleading they ought to cast it out and put the whole book in its place it would not deceive it would not deceive the janitor  all of this book is interesting on account of the sorcerers methods and the attractiveness of some of his characters and the repulsiveness of the rest but no part of it is so much so as are the chapters wherein he tries to think he thinks he sets forth the causes which led to shelleys desertion of his wife in 1814  harriet westbrook was a schoolgirl sixteen years old shelley was teeming with advanced thought he believed that christianity was a degrading and selfish superstition and he had a deep and sincere desire to rescue one of his sisters from it harriet was impressed by his various philosophies and looked upon him as an intellectual wonderwhich indeed he was he had an idea that she could give him valuable help in his scheme regarding his sister therefore he asked her to correspond with him she was quite willing shelley was not thinking of love for he was just getting over a passion for his cousin harriet grove and just getting well steeped in one for miss hitchener a schoolteacher what might happen to harriet westbrook before the letterwriting was ended did not enter his mind yet an older person could have made a good guess at it for in person shelley was as beautiful as an angel he was frank sweet winning unassuming and so rich in unselfishness generosities and magnanimities that he made his whole generation seem poor in these great qualities by comparison besides he was in distress his college had expelled him for writing an atheistical pamphlet and afflicting the reverend heads of the university with it his rich father and grandfather had closed their purses against him his friends were cold necessarily harriet fell in love with him and so deeply indeed that there was no way for shelley to save her from suicide but to marry her he believed himself to blame for this state of things so the marriage took place he was pretty fairly in love with harriet although he loved miss hitchener better he wrote and explained the case to miss hitchener after the wedding and he could not have been franker or more naive and less stirred up about the circumstance if the matter in issue had been a commercial transaction involving thirtyfive dollars  shelley was nineteen he was not a youth but a man he had never had any youth he was an erratic and fantastic child during eighteen years then he stepped into manhood as one steps over a doorsill he was curiously mature at nineteen in his ability to do independent thinking on the deep questions of life and to arrive at sharply definite decisions regarding them and stick to themstick to them and stand by them at cost of bread friendships esteem respect and approbation  for the sake of his opinions he was willing to sacrifice all these valuable things and did sacrifice them and went on doing it too when he could at any moment have made himself rich and supplied himself with friends and esteem by compromising with his father at the moderate expense of throwing overboard one or two indifferent details of his cargo of principles  he and harriet eloped to scotland and got married they took lodgings in edinburgh of a sort answerable to their purse which was about empty and there their life was a happy one and grew daily more so they had only themselves for company but they needed no additions to it they were as cozy and contented as birds in a nest harriet sang evenings or read aloud also she studied and tried to improve her mind her husband instructing her in latin she was very beautiful she was modest quiet genuine and according to her husbands testimony she had no fine lady airs or aspirations about her in matthew arnolds judgment she was a pleasing figure  the pair remained five weeks in edinburgh and then took lodgings in york where shelleys college mate hogg lived shelley presently ran down to london and hogg took this opportunity to make love to the young wife she repulsed him and reported the fact to her husband when he got back it seems a pity that shelley did not copy this creditable conduct of hers some time or other when under temptation so that we might have seen the author of his biography hang the miracle in the skies and squirt rainbows at it  at the end of the first year of marriagethe most trying year for any young couple for then the mutual failings are coming one by one to light and the necessary adjustments are being made in pain and tribulationshelley was able to recognize that his marriage venture had been a safe one as we have seen his love for his wife had begun in a rather shallow way and with not much force but now it was become deep and strong which entitles his wife to a broad credit mark one may admit he addresses a long and loving poem to her in which both passion and worship appear  exhibit a                                          o thou           whose dear love gleamed upon the gloomy path           which this lone spirit travelled                  wilt thou not turn           those spiritbeaming eyes and look on me           until i be assured that earth is heaven           and heaven is earth                    harriet let death all mortal ties dissolve           but ours shall not be mortal   shelley also wrote a sonnet to her in august of this same year in celebration of her birthday  exhibit b           ever as now with love and virtues glow           may thy unwithering soul not cease to burn           still may thine heart with those pure thoughts oerflow           which force from mine such quick and warm return   was the girl of seventeen glad and proud and happy we may conjecture that she was  that was the year 1812 another year passed still happily still successfullya child was born in june 1813 and in september three months later shelley addresses a poem to this child ianthe in which he points out just when the little creature is most particularly dear to him  exhibit c            dearest when most thy tender traits express           the image of thy mothers loveliness   up to this point the fabulist counsel for shelley and prosecutor of his young wife has had easy sailing but now his trouble begins for shelley is getting ready to make some unpleasant history for himself and it will be necessary to put the blame of it on the wife  shelley had made the acquaintance of a charming grayhaired younghearted mrs boinville whose face retained a certain youthful beauty she lived at bracknell and had a young daughter named cornelia turner who was equipped with many fascinations apparently these people were sufficiently sentimental hogg says of mrs boinville            the greater part of her associates were odious  i generally           found there two or three sentimental young butchers an           eminently philosophical tinker and several very           unsophisticated medical practitioners or medical students all           of low origin and vulgar and offensive manners  they sighed           turned up their eyes retailed philosophy such as it was           etc  shelley moved to bracknell july 27th this is still 1813 purposely to be near this unwholesome prairiedogs nest the fabulist says it was the entrance into a world more amiable and exquisite than he had yet known  in this acquaintance the attraction was mutualand presently it grew to be very mutual indeed between shelley and cornelia turner when they got to studying the italian poets together shelley responding like a tremulous instrument to every breath of passion or of sentiment had his chance here it took only four days for cornelias attractions to begin to dim harriets shelley arrived on the 27th of july on the 31st he wrote a sonnet to harriet in which one detects already the little rift in the lovers lute which had seemed to be healed or never to have gaped at all when the later and happier sonnet to ianthe was writtenin september we remember  exhibit d            evening  to harriet            o thou bright sun  beneath the dark blue line           of western distance that sublime descendest           and gleaming lovelier as thy beams decline           thy million hues to every vapor lendest           and over cobweb lawn and grove and stream           sheddest the liquid magic of thy light           till calm earth with the parting splendor bright           shows like the vision of a beauteous dream           what gazer now with astronomic eye           could coldly count the spots within thy sphere           such were thy lover harriet could he fly           the thoughts of all that makes his passion dear           and turning senseless from thy warm caress           pick flaws in our closewoven happiness   i cannot find the rift still it may be there what the poem seems to say is that a person would be coldly ungrateful who could consent to count and consider little spots and flaws in such a warm great satisfying sun as harriet is it is a little rift which had seemed to be healed or never to have gaped at all that is one detects a little rift which perhaps had never existed how does one do that how does one see the invisible it is the fabulists secret he knows how to detect what does not exist he knows how to see what is not seeable it is his gift and he works it many a time to poor dead harriet shelleys deep damage  as yet however if there was a speck upon shelleys happiness it was no more than a speckmeaning the one which one detects where it may never have gaped at allnor had harriet cause for discontent  shelleys latin instructions to his wife had ceased from a teacher he had now become a pupil mrs boinville and her young married daughter cornelia were teaching him italian poetry a fact which warns one to receive with some caution that other statement that harriet had no cause for discontent  shelley had stopped instructing harriet in latin as before mentioned the biographer thinks that the busy life in london some time back and the intrusion of the baby account for this these were hindrances but were there no others he is always overlooking a detail here and there that might be valuable in helping us understand a situation for instance when a man has been hard at work at the italian poets with a pretty woman hour after hour and responding like a tremulous instrument to every breath of passion or of sentiment in the meantime that man is dogtired when he gets home and he cant teach his wife latin it would be unreasonable to expect it  up to this time we have submitted to having mrs boinville pushed upon us as ostensibly concerned in these italian lessons but the biographer drops her now of his own accord cornelia perhaps is sole teacher hogg says she was a prey to a kind of sweet melancholy arising from causes purely imaginary she required consolation and found it in petrarch he also says bysshe entered at once fully into her views and caught the soft infection breathing the tenderest and sweetest melancholy as every true poet ought  then the author of the book interlards a most stately and fine compliment to cornelia furnished by a man of approved judgment who knew her well in later years it is a very good compliment indeed and she no doubt deserved it in her later years when she had for generations ceased to be sentimental and lackadaisical and was no longer engaged in enchanting young husbands and sowing sorrow for young wives but why is that compliment to that old gentlewoman intruded there is it to make the reader believe she was wellchosen and safe society for a young sentimental husband the biographers device was not well planned that old person was not presentit was her other self that was there her young sentimental melancholy warmblooded self in those early sweet times before antiquity had cooled her off and mossed her back  in choosing for friends such women as mrs newton mrs boinville and cornelia turner shelley gave good proof of his insight and discrimination that is the fabulists opinionharriet shelleys is not reported  early in august shelley was in london trying to raise money in september he wrote the poem to the baby already quoted from in the first week of october shelley and family went to warwick then to edinburgh arriving there about the middle of the month  harriet was happy why the author furnishes a reason but hides from us whether it is history or conjecture it is because the babe had borne the journey well it has all the aspect of one of his artful devicesflung in in his favorite casual waythe way he has when he wants to draw ones attention away from an obvious thing and amuse it with some trifle that is less obvious but more usefulin a history like this the obvious thing is that harriet was happy because there was much territory between her husband and cornelia turner now and because the perilous italian lessons were taking a rest and because if there chanced to be any respondings like a tremulous instrument to every breath of passion or of sentiment in stock in these days she might hope to get a share of them herself and because with her husband liberated now from the fetid fascinations of that sentimental retreat so pitilessly described by hogg who also dubbed it shelleys paradise later she might hope to persuade him to stay away from it permanently and because she might also hope that his brain would cool now and his heart become healthy and both brain and heart consider the situation and resolve that it would be a right and manly thing to stand by this girlwife and her child and see that they were honorably dealt with and cherished and protected and loved by the man that had promised these things and so be made happy and kept so and because alsomay we conjecture thiswe may hope for the privilege of taking up our cozy latin lessons again that used to be so pleasant and brought us so near togetherso near indeed that often our heads touched just as heads do over italian lessons and our hands met in casual and unintentional but still most delicious and thrilling little contacts and momentary clasps just as they inevitably do over italian lessons suppose one should say to any young wife i find that your husband is poring over the italian poets and being instructed in the beautiful italian language by the lovely cornelia robinsonwould that cozy picture fail to rise before her mind would its possibilities fail to suggest themselves to her would there be a pang in her heart and a blush on her face or on the contrary would the remark give her pleasure make her joyous and gay why one needs only to make the experimentthe result will not be uncertain  however we learnby authority of deeply reasoned and searching conjecturethat the baby bore the journey well and that that was why the young wife was happy that accounts for two per cent of the happiness but it was not right to imply that it accounted for the other ninetyeight also  peacock a scholar poet and friend of the shelleys was of their party when they went away he used to laugh at the boinville menagerie and was not a favorite one of the boinville group writing to hogg said the shelleys have made an addition to their party in the person of a cold scholar who i think has neither taste nor feeling this shelley will perceive sooner or later for his warm nature craves sympathy true and shelley will fight his way back there to get itthere will be no way to head him off  toward the end of november it was necessary for shelley to pay a business visit to london and he conceived the project of leaving harriet and the baby in edinburgh with harriets sister eliza westbrook a sensible practical maiden lady about thirty years old who had spent a great part of her time with the family since the marriage she was an estimable woman and shelley had had reason to like her and did like her but along about this time his feeling towards her changed part of shelleys plan as he wrote hogg was to spend his london evenings with the newtonsmembers of the boinville hysterical society but alas when he arrived early in december that pleasant game was partially blocked for eliza and the family arrived with him we are left destitute of conjectures at this point by the biographer and it is my duty to supply one i chance the conjecture that it was eliza who interfered with that game i think she tried to do what she could towards modifying the boinville connection in the interest of her young sisters peace and honor  if it was she who blocked that game she was not strong enough to block the next one before the month and year were outno date given let us call it christmasshelley and family were nested in a furnished house in windsor at no great distance from the boinvillesthese decoys still residing at bracknell  what we need now is a misleading conjecture we get it with characteristic promptness and depravity            but prince athanase found not the aged zonoras the friend of           his boyhood in any wanderings to windsor  dr lind had died           a year since and with his death windsor must have lost for           shelley its chief attraction  still not to mention shelleys wife there was bracknell at any rate while bracknell remains all solace is not lost shelley is represented by this biographer as doing a great many careless things but to my mind this hiring a furnished house for three months in order to be with a man who has been dead a year is the carelessest of them all one feels for himthat is but natural and does us honor besidesyet one is vexed for all that he could have written and asked about the aged zonoras before taking the house he may not have had the address but that is nothingany postman would know the aged zonoras a dead postman would remember a name like that  and yet why throw a rag like this to us ravening wolves is it seriously supposable that we will stop to chew it and let our prey escape no we are getting to expect this kind of device and to give it merely a sniff for certaintys sake and then walk around it and leave it lying shelley was not after the aged zonoras he was pointed for cornelia and the italian lessons for his warm nature was craving sympathy     ii  the year 1813 is just ended now and we step into 1814  to recapitulate how much of cornelias society has shelley had thus far portions of august and september and four days of july that is to say he has had opportunity to enjoy it more or less during that brief period did he want some more of it we must fall back upon history and then go to conjecturing            in the early part of the year 1814 shelley was a frequent           visitor at bracknell  frequent is a cautious word in this authors mouth the very cautiousness of it the vagueness of it provokes suspicion it makes one suspect that this frequency was more frequent than the mere common everyday kinds of frequency which one is in the habit of averaging up with the unassuming term frequent i think so because they fixed up a bedroom for him in the boinville house one doesnt need a bedroom if one is only going to run over now and then in a disconnected way to respond like a tremulous instrument to every breath of passion or of sentiment and rub up ones italian poetry a little  the young wife was not invited perhaps if she was she most certainly did not come or she would have straightened the room up the most ignorant of us knows that a wife would not endure a room in the condition in which hogg found this one when he occupied it one night shelley was awaywhy nobody can divine clothes were scattered about there were books on every side wherever a book could be laid was an open book turned down on its face to keep its place it seems plain that the wife was not invited no not that i think she was invited but said to herself that she could not bear to go there and see another young woman touching heads with her husband over an italian book and making thrilling handcontacts with him accidentally  as remarked he was a frequent visitor there where he found an easeful restingplace in the house of mrs boinvillethe whitehaired maimunaand of her daughter mrs turner the aged zonoras was deceased but the whitehaired maimuna was still on deck as we see three charming ladies entertained the mocker hogg with cups of tea late hours wielands agathon sighs and smiles and the celestial manna of refined sentiment  such says hogg were the delights of shelleys paradise in bracknell  the whitehaired maimuna presently writes to hogg            i will not have you despise homespun pleasures  shelley is           making a trial of them with us  a trial of them it may be called that it was march 11 and he had been in the house a month she continues            shelley likes them so well that he is resolved to leave off           rambling  but he has already left it off he has been there a month            and begin a course of them himself  but he has already begun it he has been at it a month he likes it so well that he has forgotten all about his wife as a letter of his reveals            seriously i think his mind and body want rest  yet he has been resting both for a month with italian and tea and manna of sentiment and late hours and every restful thing a young husband could need for the refreshment of weary limbs and a sore conscience and a nagging sense of shabbiness and treachery            his journeys after what he has never found have racked his           purse and his tranquillity  he is resolved to take a little           care of the former in pity to the latter which i applaud and           shall second with all my might  but she does not say whether the young wife a stranger and lonely yonder wants another woman and her daughter cornelia to be lavishing so much inflamed interest on her husband or not that young wife is always silentwe are never allowed to hear from her she must have opinions about such things she cannot be indifferent she must be approving or disapproving surely she would speak if she were allowedeven today and from her grave she would if she could i thinkbut we get only the other side they keep her silent always            he has deeply interested us  in the course of your intimacy           he must have made you feel what we now feel for him  he is           seeking a house close to us  ah he is not close enough yet it seems            and if he succeeds we shall have an additional motive to           induce you to come among us in the summer  the reader would puzzle a long time and not guess the biographers comment upon the above letter it is this            these sound like words of a considerate and judicious friend  that is what he thinks that is it is what he thinks he thinks no that is not quite it it is what he thinks he can stupefy a particularly and unspeakably dull reader into thinking it is what he thinks he makes that comment with the knowledge that shelley is in love with this womans daughter and that it is because of the fascinations of these two that shelley has deserted his wifefor this month considering all the circumstances and his new passion and his employment of the time amounted to desertion that is its rightful name we cannot know how the wife regarded it and felt about it but if she could have read the letter which shelley was writing to hogg four or five days later we could guess her thought and how she felt hear him            i have been staying with mrs boinville for the last month           i have escaped in the society of all that philosophy and           friendship combine from the dismaying solitude of myself  it is fair to conjecture that he was feeling ashamed            they have revived in my heart the expiring flame of life           i have felt myself translated to a paradise which has nothing           of mortality but its transitoriness my heart sickens at the           view of that necessity which will quickly divide me from the           delightful tranquillity of this happy homefor it has become           my home                   eliza is still with usnot herebut will be with me when           the infinite malice of destiny forces me to depart  eliza is she who blocked that gamethe game in londonthe one where we were purposing to dine every night with one of the three charming ladies who fed tea and manna and late hours to hogg at bracknell  shelley could send eliza away of course could have cleared her out long ago if so minded just as he had previously done with a predecessor of hers whom he had first worshipped and then turned against but perhaps she was useful there as a thin excuse for staying away himself            i am now but little inclined to contest this point           i certainly hate her with all my heart and soul            it is a sight which awakens an inexpressible sensation of           disgust and horror to see her caress my poor little ianthe           in whom i may hereafter find the consolation of sympathy           i sometimes feel faint with the fatigue of checking the           overflowings of my unbounded abhorrence for this miserable           wretch  but she is no more than a blind and loathsome worm           that cannot see to sting            i have begun to learn italian again  cornelia           assists me in this language  did i not once tell you that i           thought her cold and reserved  she is the reverse of this as           she is the reverse of everything bad  she inherits all the           divinity of her mother  i have sometimes forgotten           that i am not an inmate of this delightful homethat a time           will come which will cast me again into the boundless ocean of           abhorred society            i have written nothing but one stanza which has no meaning           and that i have only written in thought                      thy dewy looks sink in my breast                     thy gentle words stir poison there                     thou hast disturbed the only rest                     that was the portion of despair                     subdued to dutys hard control                     i could have borne my wayward lot                     the chains that bind this rained soul                     had cankered then but crushed it not            this is the vision of a delirious and distempered dream which           passes away at the cold clear light of morning  its surpassing           excellence and exquisite perfections have no more reality than           the color of an autumnal sunset  then it did not refer to his wife that is plain otherwise he would have said so it is well that he explained that it has no meaning for if he had not done that the previous soft references to cornelia and the way he has come to feel about her now would make us think she was the person who had inspired it while teaching him how to read the warm and ruddy italian poets during a month  the biography observes that portions of this letter read like the tired moaning of a wounded creature guesses at the nature of the wound are permissible we will hazard one  read by the light of shelleys previous history his letter seems to be the cry of a tortured conscience until this time it was a conscience that had never felt a pang or known a smirch it was the conscience of one who until this time had never done a dishonorable thing or an ungenerous or cruel or treacherous thing but was now doing all of these and was keenly aware of it up to this time shelley had been master of his nature and it was a nature which was as beautiful and as nearly perfect as any merely human nature may be but he was drunk now with a debasing passion and was not himself there is nothing in his previous history that is in character with the shelley of this letter he had done boyish things foolish things even crazy things but never a thing to be ashamed of he had done things which one might laugh at but the privilege of laughing was limited always to the thing itself you could not laugh at the motive back of itthat was high that was noble his most fantastic and quixotic acts had a purpose back of them which made them fine often great and made the rising laugh seem profanation and quenched it quenched it and changed the impulse to homage  up to this time he had been loyalty itself where his obligations laytreachery was new to him he had never done an ignoble thingbaseness was new to him he had never done an unkind thingthat also was new to him  this was the author of that letter this was the man who had deserted his young wife and was lamenting because he must leave another womans house which had become a home to him and go away is he lamenting mainly because he must go back to his wife and child no the lament is mainly for what he is to leave behind him the physical comforts of the house no in his life he had never attached importance to such things then the thing which he grieves to leave is narrowed down to a personto the person whose dewy looks had sunk into his breast and whose seducing words had stirred poison there  he was ashamed of himself his conscience was upbraiding him he was the slave of a degrading love he was drunk with his passion the real shelley was in temporary eclipse this is the verdict which his previous history must certainly deliver upon this episode i think  one must be allowed to assist himself with conjectures like these when trying to find his way through a literary swamp which has so many misleading fingerboards up as this book is furnished with  we have now arrived at a part of the swamp where the difficulties and perplexities are going to be greater than any we have yet met withwhere indeed the fingerboards are multitudinous and the most of them pointing diligently in the wrong direction we are to be told by the biography why shelley deserted his wife and child and took up with cornelia turner and italian it was not on account of cornelias sighs and sentimentalities and tea and manna and late hours and soft and sweet and industrious enticements no it was because his happiness in his home had been wounded and bruised almost to death  it had been wounded and bruised almost to death in this way  1st harriet persuaded him to set up a carriage  2d after the intrusion of the baby harriet stopped reading aloud and studying  3d harriets walks with hogg commonly conducted us to some fashionable bonnetshop  4th harriet hired a wetnurse  5th when an operation was being performed upon the baby harriet stood by narrowly observing all that was done but to the astonishment of the operator betraying not the smallest sign of emotion  6th eliza westbrook sisterinlaw was still of the household  the evidence against harriet shelley is all in there is no more upon these six counts she stands indicted of the crime of driving her husband into that sty at bracknell and this crime by these helps the biographical prosecuting attorney has set himself the task of proving upon her  does the biographer call himself the attorney for the prosecution no only to himself privately publicly he is the passionless disinterested impartial judge on the bench he holds up his judicial scales before the world that all may see and it all tries to look so fair that a blind person would sometimes fail to see him slip the false weights in  shelleys happiness in his home had been wounded and bruised almost to death first because harriet had persuaded him to set up a carriage i cannot discover that any evidence is offered that she asked him to set up a carriage still if she did was it a heavy offence was it unique other young wives had committed it before others have committed it since shelley had dearly loved her in those london days possibly he set up the carriage gladly to please her affectionate young husbands do such things when shelley ran away with another girl byandby this girl persuaded him to pour the price of many carriages and many horses down the bottomless well of her fathers debts but this impartial judge finds no fault with that once she appeals to shelley to raise moneynecessarily by borrowing there was no other wayto pay her fathers debts with at a time when shelley was in danger of being arrested and imprisoned for his own debts yet the good judge finds no fault with her even for this  first and last shelley emptied into that rapacious mendicants lap a sum which cost himfor he borrowed it at ruinous ratesfrom eighty to one hundred thousand dollars but it was mary godwins papa the supplications were often sent through mary the good judge is marys strenuous friend so mary gets no censures on the continent mary rode in her private carriage built as shelley boasts by one of the best makers in bond street yet the good judge makes not even a passing comment on this iniquity let us throw out count no 1 against harriet shelley as being farfetched and frivolous  shelleys happiness in his home had been wounded and bruised almost to death secondly because harriets studies had dwindled away to nothing bysshe had ceased to express any interest in them at what time was this it was when harriet had fully recovered from the fatigue of her first effort of maternity and was now in full force vigor and effect very well the baby was born two days before the close of june it took the mother a month to get back her full force vigor and effect this brings us to july 27th and the deadly cornelia if a wife of eighteen is studying with her husband and he gets smitten with another woman isnt he likely to lose interest in his wifes studies for that reason and is not his wifes interest in her studies likely to languish for the same reason would not the mere sight of those books of hers sharpen the pain that is in her heart this sudden breaking down of a mutual intellectual interest of two years standing is coincident with shelleys reencounter with cornelia and we are allowed to gather from that time forth for nearly two months he did all his studying in that persons society we feel at liberty to rule out count no 2 from the indictment against harriet  shelleys happiness in his home had been wounded and bruised almost to death thirdly because harriets walks with hogg commonly led to some fashionable bonnetshop i offer no palliation i only ask why the dispassionate impartial judge did not offer one himselfmerely i mean to offset his leniency in a similar case or two where the girl who ran away with harriets husband was the shopper there are several occasions where she interested herself with shoppingamong them being walks which ended at the bonnetshopyet in none of these cases does she get a word of blame from the good judge while in one of them he covers the deed with a justifying remark she doing the shopping that time to find easement for her mind her child having died  shelleys happiness in his home had been wounded and bruised almost to death fourthly by the introduction there of a wetnurse the wetnurse was introduced at the time of the edinburgh sojourn immediately after shelley had been enjoying the two months of study with cornelia which broke up his wifes studies and destroyed his personal interest in them why by this time nothing that shelleys wife could do would have been satisfactory to him for he was in love with another woman and was never going to be contented again until he got back to her if he had been still in love with his wife it is not easily conceivable that he would care much who nursed the baby provided the baby was well nursed harriets jealousy was assuredly voicing itself now shelleys conscience was assuredly nagging him pestering him persecuting him shelley needed excuses for his altered attitude toward his wife providence pitied him and sent the wetnurse if providence had sent him a cotton doughnut it would have answered just as well all he wanted was something to find fault with  shelleys happiness in his home had been wounded and bruised almost to death fifthly because harriet narrowly watched a surgical operation which was being performed upon her child and to the astonishment of the operator who was watching harriet instead of attending to his operation she betrayed not the smallest sign of emotion the author of this biography was not ashamed to set down that exultant slander he was apparently not aware that it was a small business to bring into his court a witness whose name he does not know and whose character and veracity there is none to vouch for and allow him to strike this blow at the motherheart of this friendless girl the biographer says we may not infer from this that harriet did not feelwhy put it in thenbut we learn that those about her could believe her to be hard and insensible who were those who were about her her husband he hated her now because he was in love elsewhere her sister of course that is not charged peacock peacock does not testify the wetnurse she does not testify if any others were there we have no mention of them those about her are reduced to one personher husband who reports the circumstance it is hogg perhaps he was therewe do not know but if he was he still got his information at secondhand as it was the operator who noticed harriets lack of emotion not himself hogg is not given to saying kind things when harriet is his subject he may have said them the time that he tried to tempt her to soil her honor but after that he mentions her usually with a sneer among those who were about her was one witness well equipped to silence all tongues abolish all doubts set our minds at rest one witness not called and not callable whose evidence if we could but get it would outweigh the oaths of whole battalions of hostile hoggs and nameless surgeonsthe baby i wish we had the babys testimony and yet if we had it it would not do us any gooda furtive conjecture a sly insinuation a pious if or two would be smuggled in here and there with a solemn air of judicial investigation and its positiveness would wilt into dubiety  the biographer says of harriet if words of tender affection and motherly pride proved the reality of love then undoubtedly she loved her firstborn child that is if mere empty words can prove it it stands provedand in this way without committing himself he gives the reader a chance to infer that there isnt any extant evidence but words and that he doesnt take much stock in them how seldom he shows his hand he is always lurking behind a noncommittal if or something of that kind always gliding and dodging around distributing colorless poison here and there and everywhere but always leaving himself in a position to say that his language will be found innocuous if taken to pieces and examined he clearly exhibits a steady and neverrelaxing purpose to make harriet the scapegoat for her husbands first great sinbut it is in the general view that this is revealed not in the details his insidious literature is like blue water you know what it is that makes it blue but you cannot produce and verify any detail of the cloud of microscopic dust in it that does it your adversary can dip up a glassful and show you that it is pure white and you cannot deny it and he can dip the lake dry glass by glass and show that every glassful is white and prove it to any ones eyeand yet that lake was blue and you can swear it this book is bluewith slander in solution  let the reader examine for example the paragraph of comment which immediately follows the letter containing shelleys selfexposure which we have been considering this is it one should inspect the individual sentences as they go by then pass them in procession and review the cakewalk as a whole            shelleys happiness in his home as is evident from this           pathetic letter had been fatally stricken it is evident           also that he knew where duty lay he felt that his part was to           take up his burden silently and sorrowfully and to bear it           henceforth with the quietness of despair  but we can perceive           that he scarcely possessed the strength and fortitude needful           for success in such an attempt  and clearly shelley himself           was aware how perilous it was to accept that respite of           blissful ease which he enjoyed in the boinville household for           gentle voices and dewy looks and words of sympathy could not           fail to remind him of an ideal of tranquillity or of joy which           could never be his and which he must henceforth sternly           exclude from his imagination  that paragraph commits the author in no way taken sentence by sentence it asserts nothing against anybody or in favor of anybody pleads for nobody accuses nobody taken detail by detail it is as innocent as moonshine and yet taken as a whole it is a design against the reader its intent is to remove the feeling which the letter must leave with him if let alone and put a different one in its placeto remove a feeling justified by the letter and substitute one not justified by it the letter itself gives you no uncertain pictureno lecturer is needed to stand by with a stick and point out its details and let on to explain what they mean the picture is the very clear and remorsefully faithful picture of a fallen and fettered angel who is ashamed of himself an angel who beats his soiled wings and cries who complains to the woman who enticed him that he could have borne his wayward lot he could have stood by his duty if it had not been for her beguilements an angel who rails at the boundless ocean of abhorred society and rages at his poor judicious sisterinlaw if there is any dignity about this spectacle it will escape most people  yet when the paragraph of comment is taken as a whole the picture is full of dignity and pathos we have before us a blameless and noble spirit stricken to the earth by malign powers but not conquered tempted but grandly putting the temptation away enmeshed by subtle coils but sternly resolved to rend them and march forth victorious at any peril of life or limb curtainslow music  was it the purpose of the paragraph to take the bad taste of shelleys letter out of the readers mouth if that was not it good ink was wasted without that it has no relevancythe multiplication table would have padded the space as rationally  we have inspected the six reasons which we are asked to believe drove a man of conspicuous patience honor justice fairness kindliness and iron firmness resolution and steadfastness from the wife whom he loved and who loved him to a refuge in the mephitic paradise of bracknell these are six infinitely little reasons but there were six colossal ones and these the counsel for the destruction of harriet shelley persists in not considering very important  moreover the colossal six preceded the little six and had done the mischief before they were born let us doublecolumn the twelve then we shall see at a glance that each little reason is in turn answered by a retorting reason of a size to overshadow it and make it insignificant       1  harriet sets up carriage      1  cornelia turner      2  harriet stops studying        2  cornelia turner      3  harriet goes to bonnetshop   3  cornelia turner      4  harriet takes a wetnurse     4  cornelia turner      5  harriet has too much nerve    5  cornelia turner      6  detested sisterinlaw         6  cornelia turner  as soon as we comprehend that cornelia turner and the italian lessons happened before the little six had been discovered to be grievances we understand why shelleys happiness in his home had been wounded and bruised almost to death and no one can persuade us into laying it on harriet shelley and cornelia are the responsible persons and we cannot in honor and decency allow the cruelties which they practised upon the unoffending wife to be pushed aside in order to give us a chance to waste time and tears over six sentimental justifications of an offence which the six cant justify nor even respectably assist in justifying  six there were seven but in charity to the biographer the seventh ought not to be exposed still he hung it out himself and not only hung it out but thought it was a good point in shelleys favor for two years shelley found sympathy and intellectual food and all that at home there was enough for spiritual and mental support but not enough for luxury and so at the end of the contented two years this latter detail justifies him in going bag and baggage over to cornelia turner and supplying the rest of his need in the way of surplus sympathy and intellectual pie unlawfully by the same reasoning a man in merely comfortable circumstances may rob a bank without sin     iii  it is 1814 it is the 16th of march shelley has written his letter he has been in the boinville paradise a month his deserted wife is in her husbandless home mischief had been wrought it is the biographer who concedes this we greatly need some light on harriets side of the case now we need to know how she enjoyed the month but there is no way to inform ourselves there seems to be a strange absence of documents and letters and diaries on that side shelley kept a diary the approaching mary godwin kept a diary her father kept one her halfsister by marriage adoption and the dispensation of god kept one and the entire tribe and all its friends wrote and received letters and the letters were kept and are producible when this biography needs them but there are only three or four scraps of harriets writing and no diary harriet wrote plenty of letters to her husbandnobody knows where they are i suppose she wrote plenty of letters to other peopleapparently they have disappeared too peacock says she wrote good letters but apparently interested people had sagacity enough to mislay them in time after all her industry she went down into her grave and lies silent theresilent when she has so much need to speak we can only wonder at this mystery not account for it  no there is no way of finding out what harriets state of feeling was during the month that shelley was disporting himself in the bracknell paradise we have to fall back upon conjecture as our fabulist does when he has nothing more substantial to work with then we easily conjecture that as the days dragged by harriets heart grew heavier and heavier under its two burdensshame and resentment the shame of being pointed at and gossiped about as a deserted wife and resentment against the woman who had beguiled her husband from her and now kept him in a disreputable captivity deserted wivesdeserted whether for cause or without causefind small charity among the virtuous and the discreet we conjecture that one after another the neighbors ceased to call that one after another they got to being engaged when harriet called that finally they one after the other cut her dead on the street that after that she stayed in the house daytimes and brooded over her sorrows and nighttimes did the same there being nothing else to do with the heavy hours and the silence and solitude and the dreary intervals which sleep should have charitably bridged but didnt  yes mischief had been wrought the biographer arrives at this conclusion and it is a most just one then just as you begin to half hope he is going to discover the cause of it and launch hot bolts of wrath at the guilty manufacturers of it you have to turn away disappointed you are disappointed and you sigh this is what he says the italics  are mine            however the mischief may have been wroughtand at this day           no one can wish to heap blame on any buried head  so it is poor harriet after all stern justice must take its coursejustice tempered with delicacy justice tempered with compassion justice that pities a forlorn dead girl and refuses to strike her except in the back will not be ignoble and say the harsh thing but only insinuate it stern justice knows about the carriage and the wetnurse and the bonnetshop and the other dark things that caused this sad mischief and may not must not blink them so it delivers judgment where judgment belongs but softens the blow by not seeming to deliver judgment at all to resumethe italics are mine            however the mischief may have been wroughtand at this day no           one can wish to heap blame on any buried headit is certain           that some cause or causes of deep division between shelley and           his wife were in operation during the early part of the year           1814  this shows penetration no deduction could be more accurate than this there were indeed some causes of deep division but next comes another disappointing sentence            to guess at the precise nature of these causes in the absence           of definite statement were useless  why he has already been guessing at them for several pages and we have been trying to outguess him and now all of a sudden he is tired of it and wont play any more it is not quite fair to us however he will get over this byandby when shelley commits his next indiscretion and has to be guessed out of it at harriets expense  we may rest content with shelleys own wordsin a chancery paper drawn up by him three years later they were these delicacy forbids me to say more than that we were disunited by incurable dissensions  as for me i do not quite see why we should rest content with anything of the sort it is not a very definite statement it does not necessarily mean anything more than that he did not wish to go into the tedious details of those family quarrels delicacy could quite properly excuse him from saying i was in love with cornelia all that time my wife kept crying and worrying about it and upbraiding me and begging me to cut myself free from a connection which was wronging her and disgracing us both and i being stung by these reproaches retorted with fierce and bitter speechesfor it is my nature to do that when i am stirred especially if the target of them is a person whom i had greatly loved and respected before as witness my various attitudes towards miss hitchener the gisbornes harriets sister and othersand finally i did not improve this state of things when i deserted my wife and spent a whole month with the woman who had infatuated me  no he could not go into those details and we excuse him but nevertheless we do not rest content with this bland proposition to puff away that whole long disreputable episode with a single mean meaningless remark of shelleys  we do admit that it is certain that some cause or causes of deep division were in operation we would admit it just the same if the grammar of the statement were as straight as a string for we drift into pretty indifferent grammar ourselves when we are absorbed in historical work but we have to decline to admit that we cannot guess those cause or causes  but guessing is not really necessary there is evidence attainableevidence from the batch discredited by the biographer and set out at the back door in his appendixbasket and yet a court of law would think twice before throwing it out whereas it would be a hardy person who would venture to offer in such a place a good part of the material which is placed before the readers of this book as evidence and so treated by this daring biographer among some letters in the appendixbasket from mrs godwin detailing the godwinian share in the shelleyan events of 1814 she tells how harriet shelley came to her and her husband agitated and weeping to implore them to forbid shelley the house and prevent his seeing mary godwin            she related that last november he had fallen in love with mrs           turner and paid her such marked attentions mr turner the           husband had carried off his wife to devonshire  the biographer finds a technical fault in this the shelleys were in edinburgh in november what of that the woman is recalling a conversation which is more than two months old besides she was probably more intent upon the central and important fact of it than upon its unimportant date harriets quoted statement has some sense in it for that reason if for no other it ought to have been put in the body of the book still that would not have answered even the biographers enemy could not be cruel enough to ask him to let this real grievance this compact and substantial and picturesque figure this rawheadandbloodybones come striding in there among those pale shams those rickety spectres labeled wetnurse bonnetshop and so onno the father of all malice could not ask the biographer to expose his pathetic goblins to a competition like that  the fabulist finds fault with the statement because it has a technical error in it and he does this at the moment that he is furnishing us an error himself and of a graver sort he says            if turner carried off his wife to devonshire he brought her           back and shelley was staying with her and her mother on terms           of cordial intimacy in march 1814  we accept the cordial intimacyit was the very thing harriet was complaining ofbut there is nothing to show that it was turner who brought his wife back the statement is thrown in as if it were not only true but was proof that turner was not uneasy turners movements are proof of nothing nothing but a statement from turners mouth would have any value here and he made none  six days after writing his letter shelley and his wife were together again for a momentto get remarried according to the rites of the english church  within three weeks the new husband and wife were apart again and the former was back in his odorous paradise this time it is the wife who does the deserting she finds cornelia too strong for her probably at any rate she goes away with her baby and sister and we have a playful fling at her from good mrs boinville the mysterious spinner maimuna she whose face was as a damsels face and yet her hair was gray she of whom the biographer has said shelley was indeed caught in an almost invisible thread spun around him but unconsciously by this subtle and benignant enchantress the subtle and benignant enchantress writes to hogg april 18 shelley is again a widower his beauteous half went to town on thursday  then shelley writes a poema chant of grief over the hard fate which obliges him now to leave his paradise and take up with his wife again it seems to intimate that the paradise is cooling toward him that he is warned off by acclamation that he must not even venture to tempt with one last tear his friend cornelias ungentle mood for her eye is glazed and cold and dares not entreat her lover to stay  exhibit e            pause not the time is past every voice cries away           tempt not with one last tear thy friends ungentle mood           thy lovers eye so glazed and cold dares not entreat thy           stay           duty and dereliction guide thee back to solitude  back to the solitude of his now empty home that is            away away to thy sad and silent home           pour bitter tears on its desolated hearth          but he will have rest in the grave byandby until that time comes the charms of bracknell will remain in his memory along with mrs boinvilles voice and cornelia turners smile       thou in the grave shalt restyet till the phantoms flee      which that house and hearth and garden made dear to thee ere while      thy remembrance and repentance and deep musings are not free      from the music of two voices and the light of one sweet smile  we cannot wonder that harriet could not stand it any of us would have left we would not even stay with a cat that was in this condition even the boinvilles could not endure it and so as we have seen they gave this one notice            early in may shelley was in london  he did not yet despair           of reconciliation with harriet nor had he ceased to love her  shelleys poems are a good deal of trouble to his biographer they are constantly inserted as evidence and they make much confusion as soon as one of them has proved one thing another one follows and proves quite a different thing the poem just quoted shows that he was in love with cornelia but a month later he is in love with harriet again and there is a poem to prove it            in this piteous appeal shelley declares that he has now no           grief but onethe grief of having known and lost his wifes           love  exhibit f                 thy look of love has power to calm                the stormiest passion of my soul   but without doubt she had been reserving her looks of love a good part of the time for ten months nowever since he began to lavish his own on cornelia turner at the end of the previous july he does really seem to have already forgotten cornelias merits in one brief month for he eulogizes harriet in a way which rules all competition out                 thou only virtuous gentle kind                amid a world of hate  he complains of her hardness and begs her to make the concession of a slight enduranceof his waywardness perhapsfor the sake of a fellowbeings lasting weal but the main force of his appeal is in his closing stanza and is strongly worded                 o trust for once no erring guide                bid the remorseless feeling flee                tis malice tis revenge tis pride                tis anything but thee                o deign a nobler pride to prove                and pity if thou canst not love  this is in mayapparently towards the end of it harriet and shelley were corresponding all the time harriet got the poema copy exists in her own handwriting she being the only gentle and kind person amid a world of hate according to shelleys own testimony in the poem we are permitted to think that the daily letters would presently have melted that kind and gentle heart and brought about the reconciliation if there had been time but there wasnt for in a very few daysin fact before the 8th of juneshelley was in love with another woman  and soperhaps while harriet was walking the floor nights trying to get her poem by hearther husband was doing a fresh onefor the other girlmary wollstonecraft godwinwith sentiments like these in it  exhibit g                 to spend years thus and be rewarded                as thou sweet love requited me                when none were near               thy lips did meet                mine tremblingly                 gentle and good and mild thou art                nor can i live if thou appear                aught but thyself   and so on before the close of june it was known and felt by mary and shelley that each was inexpressibly dear to the other yes shelley had found this child of sixteen to his liking and had wooed and won her in the graveyard but that is nothing it was better than wooing her in her nursery at any rate where it might have disturbed the other children  however she was a child in years only from the day that she set her masculine grip on shelley he was to frisk no more if she had occupied the only kind and gentle harriets place in march it would have been a thrilling spectacle to see her invade the boinville rookery and read the riot act that holiday of shelleys would have been of short duration and cornelias hair would have been as gray as her mothers when the services were over  hogg went to the godwin residence in skinner street with shelley on that 8th of june they passed through godwins little debtfactory of a bookshop and went upstairs hunting for the proprietor nobody there shelley strode about the room impatiently making its crazy floor quake under him then a door was partially and softly opened a thrilling voice called shelley a thrilling voice answered mary and he darted out of the room like an arrow from the bow of the farshooting king a very young female fair and fairhaired pale indeed and with a piercing look wearing a frock of tartan an unusual dress in london at that time had called him out of the room  this is mary godwin as described by hogg the thrill of the voices shows that the love of shelley and mary was already upward of a fortnight old therefore it had been born within the month of mayborn while harriet was still trying to get her poem by heart we think i must not be asked how i know so much about that thrill it is my secret the biographer and i have private ways of finding out things when it is necessary to find them out and the customary methods fail  shelley left london that day and was gone ten days the biographer conjectures that he spent this interval with harriet in bath it would be just like him to the end of his days he liked to be in love with two women at once he was more in love with miss hitchener when he married harriet than he was with harriet and told the lady so with simple and unostentatious candor he was more in love with cornelia than he was with harriet in the end of 1813 and the beginning of 1814 yet he supplied both of them with love poems of an equal temperature meantime he loved mary and harriet in june and while getting ready to run off with the one it is conjectured that he put in his odd time trying to get reconciled to the other byandby while still in love with mary he will make love to her halfsister by marriage adoption and the visitation of god through the medium of clandestine letters and she will answer with letters that are for no eye but his own  when shelley encountered mary godwin he was looking around for another paradise he had tastes of his own and there were features about the godwin establishment that strongly recommended it godwin was an advanced thinker and an able writer one of his romances is still read but his philosophical works once so esteemed are out of vogue now their authority was already declining when shelley made his acquaintance that is it was declining with the public but not with shelley they had been his moral and political bible and they were that yet shelley the infidel would himself have claimed to be less a work of god than a work of godwin godwins philosophies had formed his mind and interwoven themselves into it and become a part of its texture he regarded himself as godwins spiritual son godwin was not without selfappreciation indeed it may be conjectured that from his point of view the last syllable of his name was surplusage he lived serene in his lofty world of philosophy far above the mean interests that absorbed smaller men and only came down to the ground at intervals to pass the hat for alms to pay his debts with and insult the man that relieved him several of his principles were out of the ordinary for example he was opposed to marriage he was not aware that his preachings from this text were but theory and wind he supposed he was in earnest in imploring people to live together without marrying until shelley furnished him a working model of his scheme and a practical example to analyze by applying the principle in his own family the matter took a different and surprising aspect then the late matthew arnold said that the main defect in shelleys makeup was that he was destitute of the sense of humor this episode must have escaped mr arnolds attention  but we have said enough about the head of the new paradise mrs godwin is described as being in several ways a terror and even when her soul was in repose she wore green spectacles but i suspect that her main unattractiveness was born of the fact that she wrote the letters that are out in the appendixbasket in the back yardletters which are an outrage and wholly untrustworthy for they say some kind things about poor harriet and tell some disagreeable truths about her husband and these things make the fabulist grit his teeth a good deal  next we have fanny godwina godwin by courtesy only she was mrs godwins natural daughter by a former friend she was a sweet and winning girl but she presently wearied of the godwin paradise and poisoned herself  last in the list is jane or claire as she preferred to call herself clairmont daughter of mrs godwin by a former marriage she was very young and pretty and accommodating and always ready to do what she could to make things pleasant after shelley ran off with her partsister mary she became the guest of the pair and contributed a natural child to their nurseryallegra lord byron was the father  we have named the several members and advantages of the new paradise in skinner street with its crazy bookshop underneath shelley was all right now this was a better place than the other more variety anyway and more different kinds of fragrance one could turn out poetry here without any trouble at all  the way the new lovematch came about was this  shelley told mary all his aggravations and sorrows and griefs and about the wetnurse and the bonnetshop and the surgeon and the carriage and the sisterinlaw that blocked the london game and about cornelia and her mamma and how they had turned him out of the house after making so much of him and how he had deserted harriet and then harriet had deserted him and how the reconciliation was working along and harriet getting her poem by heart and still he was not happy and mary pitied him for she had had trouble herself but i am not satisfied with this it reads too much like statistics it lacks smoothness and grace and is too earthy and businesslike it has the sordid look of a tradesunion procession out on strike that is not the right form for it the book does it better we will fall back on the book and have a cakewalk            it was easy to divine that some restless grief possessed him           mary herself was not unlearned in the lore of pain  his           generous zeal in her fathers behalf his spiritual sonship to           godwin his reverence for her mothers memory were guarantees           with mary of his excellencewhat she was after was           guarantees of his excellence  that he stood ready to desert           his wife and child was one of them apparentlythe new           friends could not lack subjects of discourse and underneath           their words about marys mother and political justice and           rights of woman were two young hearts each feeling towards           the other each perhaps unaware trembling in the direction of           the other  the desire to assuage the suffering of one whose           happiness has grown precious to us may become a hunger of the           spirit as keen as any other and this hunger now possessed           marys heart when her eyes rested unseen on shelley it was           with a look full of the ardor of a soothing pity  yes that is better and has more composure that is just the way it happened he told her about the wetnurse she told him about political justice he told her about the deadly sisterinlaw she told him about her mother he told her about the bonnetshop she murmured back about the rights of woman then he assuaged her then she assuaged him then he assuaged her some more next she assuaged him some more then they both assuaged one another simultaneously and so they went on by the hour assuaging and assuaging and assuaging until at last what was the result they were in love it will happen so every time            he had married a woman who as he now persuaded himself had           never truly loved him who loved only his fortune and his rank           and who proved her selfishness by deserting him in his misery  i think that that is not quite fair to harriet we have no certainty that she knew cornelia had turned him out of the house he went back to cornelia and harriet may have supposed that he was as happy with her as ever still it was judicious to begin to lay on the whitewash for shelley is going to need many a coat of it now and the sooner the reader becomes used to the intrusion of the brush the sooner he will get reconciled to it and stop fretting about it  after shelleys conjectured visit to harriet at bath8th of june to 18thit seems to have been arranged that shelley should henceforth join the skinner street household each day at dinner  nothing could be handier than this things will swim along now            although now shelley was coming to believe that his wedded           union with harriet was a thing of the past he had not ceased           to regard her with affectionate consideration he wrote to her           frequently and kept her informed of his whereabouts  we must not get impatient over these curious inharmoniousnesses and irreconcilabilities in shelleys character you can see by the biographers attitude towards them that there is nothing objectionable about them shelley was doing his best to make two adoring young creatures happy he was regarding the one with affectionate consideration by mail and he was assuaging the other one at home            unhappy harriet residing at bath had perhaps never desired           that the breach between herself and her husband should be           irreparable and complete  i find no fault with that sentence except that the perhaps is not strictly warranted it should have been left out in supportor shall we say extenuationof this opinion i submit that there is not sufficient evidence to warrant the uncertainty which it implies the only evidence offered that harriet was hard and proud and standing out against a reconciliation is a poemthe poem in which shelley beseeches her to bid the remorseless feeling flee and pity if she cannot love we have just that as evidence and out of its meagre materials the biographer builds a cobhouse of conjectures as big as the coliseum conjectures which convince him the prosecuting attorney but ought to fall far short of convincing any fairminded jury  shelleys lovepoems may be very good evidence but we know well that they are good for this day and train only we are able to believe that they spoke the truth for that one day but we know by experience that they could not be depended on to speak it the next the very supplication for a rewarming of harriets chilled love was followed so suddenly by the poets plunge into an adoring passion for mary godwin that if it had been a check it would have lost its value before a lazy person could have gotten to the bank with it  hardness stubbornness pride vindictivenessthese may sometimes reside in a young wife and mother of nineteen but they are not charged against harriet shelley outside of that poem and one has no right to insert them into her character on such shadowy evidence as that peacock knew harriet well and she has a flexible and persuadable look as painted by him            her manners were good and her whole aspect and demeanor such           manifest emanations of pure and truthful nature that to be once           in her company was to know her thoroughly  she was fond of her           husband and accommodated herself in every way to his tastes           if they mixed in society she adorned it if they lived in           retirement she was satisfied if they travelled she enjoyed           the change of scene  perhaps she had never desired that the breach should be irreparable and complete the truth is we do not even know that there was any breach at all at this time we know that the husband and wife went before the altar and took a new oath on the 24th of march to love and cherish each other until deathand this may be regarded as a sort of reconciliation itself and a wiping out of the old grudges then harriet went away and the sisterinlaw removed herself from her society that was in april shelley wrote his appeal in may but the corresponding went right along afterwards we have a right to doubt that the subject of it was a reconciliation or that harriet had any suspicion that she needed to be reconciled and that her husband was trying to persuade her to itas the biographer has sought to make us believe with his coliseum of conjectures built out of a wastebasket of poetry for we have evidence nownot poetry and conjecture when shelley had been dining daily in the skinner street paradise fifteen days and continuing the lovematch which was already a fortnight old twentyfive days earlier he forgot to write harriet forgot it the next day and the next during four days harriet got no letter from him then her fright and anxiety rose to expressionheat and she wrote a letter to shelleys publisher which seems to reveal to us that shelleys letters to her had been the customary affectionate letters of husband to wife and had carried no appeals for reconciliation and had not needed to                                    bath postmark july 7 1814            my dear siryou will greatly oblige me by giving the           enclosed to mr  shelley  i would not trouble you but it is           now four days since i have heard from him which to me is an           age  will you write by return of post and tell me what has           become of him as i always fancy something dreadful has           happened if i do not hear from him  if you tell me that he is           well i shall not come to london but if i do not hear from you           or him i shall certainly come as i cannot endure this dreadful           state of suspense  you are his friend and you can feel for me                                i remain yours truly                                                    h s   even without peacocks testimony that her whole aspect and demeanor were manifest emanations of a pure and truthful nature we should hold this to be a truthful letter a sincere letter a loving letter it bears those marks i think it is also the letter of a person accustomed to receiving letters from her husband frequently and that they have been of a welcome and satisfactory sort too this long time backever since the solemn remarriage and reconciliation at the altar most likely  the biographer follows harriets letter with a conjecture he conjectures that she would now gladly have retraced her steps which means that it is proven that she had steps to retraceproven by the poem well if the poem is better evidence than the letter we must let it stand at that  then the biographer attacks harriet shelleys honorby authority of random and unverified gossip scavengered from a group of people whose very names make a person shudder mary godwin mistress to shelley her partsister discarded mistress of lord byron godwin the philosophical tramp who gathers his share of it from a shadowthat is to say from a person whom he shirks out of naming yet the biographer dignifies this sorry rubbish with the name of evidence  nothing remotely resembling a distinct charge from a named person professing to know is offered among this precious evidence  1 shelley believed so and so  2 byrons discarded mistress says that shelley told mary godwin so and so and mary told her  3 shelley said so and soand later admitted over and over again that he had been in error  4 the unspeakable godwin wrote to mr baxter that he knew so and so from unquestionable authorityname not furnished  how any man in his right mind could bring himself to defile the grave of a shamefully abused and defenceless girl with these baseless fabrications this manufactured filth is inconceivable how any man in his right mind or out of it could sit down and coldly try to persuade anybody to believe it or listen patiently to it or indeed do anything but scoff at it and deride it is astonishing  the charge insinuated by these odious slanders is one of the most difficult of all offences to prove it is also one which no man has a right to mention even in a whisper about any woman living or dead unless he knows it to be true and not even then unless he can also prove it to be true there is no justification for the abomination of putting this stuff in the book  against harriet shelleys good name there is not one scrap of tarnishing evidence and not even a scrap of evil gossip that comes from a source that entitles it to a hearing  on the credit side of the account we have strong opinions from the people who knew her best peacock says            i feel it due to the memory of harriet to state my most           decided conviction that her conduct as a wife was as pure as           true as absolutely faultless as that of any who for such           conduct are held most in honor  thornton hunt who had picked and published slight flaws in harriets character says as regards this alleged large one            there is not a trace of evidence or a whisper of scandal           against her before her voluntary departure from shelley  trelawney says            i was assured by the evidence of the few friends who knew both           shelley and his wifehookham hogg peacock and one of the           godwinsthat harriet was perfectly innocent of all offence  what excuse was there for raking up a parcel of foul rumors from malicious and discredited sources and flinging them at this dead girls head her very defenselessness should have been her protection the fact that all letters to her or about her with almost every scrap of her own writing had been diligently mislaid leaving her case destitute of a voice while every penstroke which could help her husbands side had been as diligently preserved should have excused her from being brought to trial her witnesses have all disappeared yet we see her summoned in her graveclothes to plead for the life of her character without the help of an advocate before a disqualified judge and a packed jury  harriet shelley wrote her distressed letter on the 7th of july on the 28th her husband ran away with mary godwin and her partsister claire to the continent he deserted his wife when her confinement was approaching she bore him a child at the end of november his mistress bore him another one something over two months later the truants were back in london before either of these events occurred  on one occasion presently shelley was so pressed for money to support his mistress with that he went to his wife and got some money of his that was in her handstwenty pounds yet the mistress was not moved to gratitude for later when the wife was troubled to meet her engagements the mistress makes this entry in her diary            harriet sends her creditors here nasty woman  now we shall           have to change our lodgings  the deserted wife bore the bitterness and obloquy of her situation two years and a quarter then she gave up and drowned herself a month afterwards the body was found in the water three weeks later shelley married his mistress  i must here be allowed to italicize a remark of the biographers concerning harriet shelley            that no act of shelleys during the two years which           immediately preceded her death tended to cause the rash act           which brought her life to its close seems certain  yet her husband had deserted her and her children and was living with a concubine all that time why should a person attempt to write biography when the simplest facts have no meaning to him this book is littered with as crass stupidities as that onedeductions by the page which bear no discoverable kinship to their premises  the biographer throws off that extraordinary remark without any perceptible disturbance to his serenity for he follows it with a sentimental justification of shelleys conduct which has not a pang of conscience in it but is silky and smooth and undulating and piousa cakewalk with all the colored brethren at their best there may be people who can read that page and keep their temper but it is doubtful shelleys life has the one indelible blot upon it but is otherwise worshipfully noble and beautiful it even stands out indestructibly gracious and lovely from the ruck of these disastrous pages in spite of the fact that they expose and establish his responsibility for his forsaken wifes pitiful fatea responsibility which he himself tacitly admits in a letter to eliza westbrook wherein he refers to his taking up with mary godwin as an act which eliza might excusably regard as the cause of her sisters ruin
