the desborough connections  salomy janes kiss  the man and the mountain  the passing of enriquez     stories in light and shadow     unser karl   the american consul for schlachtstadt had just turned out of the broad konigs allee into the little square that held his consulate its residences always seemed to him to wear that singularly uninhabited air peculiar to a street scene in a theatre the facades with their stiff striped wooden awnings over the windows were of the regularity color and pattern only seen on the stage and conversation carried on in the street below always seemed to be invested with that perfect confidence and security which surrounds the actor in his painted desert of urban perspective yet it was a peaceful change to the other byways and highways of schlachtstadt which were always filled with an equally unreal and mechanical soldiery who appeared to be daily taken out of their boxes of caserne or depot and loosely scattered all over the pretty lindenhaunted german town there were soldiers standing on street corners soldiers staring woodenly into shop windows soldiers halted suddenly into stone like lizards at the approach of offiziere offiziere lounging stiffly four abreast sweeping the pavement with their trailing sabres all at one angle there were cavalcades of red hussars cavalcades of blue hussars cavalcades of uhlans with glittering lances and pennonswith or without a bandformally parading there were straggling fatigues or details coming round the corners there were dusty businesslike columns of infantry going nowhere and to no purpose and they one and all seemed to be wound upfor that serviceand apparently always in the same place in the band of their capsinvariably of one patternwas a button in the centre of which was a square opening or keyhole the consul was always convinced that through this keyhole opening by means of a key the humblest caporal wound up his file the hauptmann controlled his lieutenants and noncommissioned officers and even the general himself wearing the same cap was subject through his cap to a higher moving power in the suburbs when the supply of soldiers gave out there were sentryboxes when these dropped off there were caissons or commissary wagons and lest the military idea should ever fail from out the schlachtstadts burghers mind there were police in uniform streetsweepers in uniform the tickettakers guards and sweepers at the bahnhof were in uniformbut all wearing the same kind of cap with the probability of having been wound up freshly each morning for their daily work even the postman delivered peaceful invoices to the consul with his sidearms and the air of bringing dispatches from the field of battle and the consul saluted and felt for a few moments the whole weight of his consular responsibility  yet in spite of this military precedence it did not seem in the least inconsistent with the decidedly peaceful character of the town and this again suggested its utter unreality wandering cows sometimes got mixed up with squadrons of cavalry and did not seem to mind it sheep passed singly between files of infantry or preceded them in a flock when on the march indeed nothing could be more delightful and innocent than to see a regiment of infantry in heavy marching order laden with every conceivable thing they could want for a week returning after a cheerful search for an invisible enemy in the suburbs to bivouac peacefully among the cabbages in the marketplace nobody was ever imposed upon for a moment by their tremendous energy and severe display drums might beat trumpets blow dragoons charge furiously all over the exercier platz or suddenly flash their naked swords in the streets to the guttural command of an officernobody seemed to mind it people glanced up to recognize rudolf or max doing their service nodded and went about their business and although the officers always wore their sidearms and at the most peaceful of social dinners only relinquished their swords in the hall apparently that they might be ready to buckle them on again and rush out to do battle for the fatherland between the courses the other guests only looked upon these weapons in the light of sticks and umbrellas and possessed their souls in peace and when added to this singular incongruity many of these warriors were spectacled studious men and despite their lethal weapons wore a slightly professional air and wereto a mandeeply sentimental and singularly simple their attitude in this eternal kriegspiel seemed to the consul more puzzling than ever  as he entered his consulate he was confronted with another aspect of schlachtstadt quite as wonderful yet already familiar to him for in spite of these alarums without which however never seem to penetrate beyond the town itself schlachtstadt and its suburbs were known all over the world for the manufactures of certain beautiful textile fabrics and many of the rank and file of those warriors had built up the fame and prosperity of the district over their peaceful looms in wayside cottages there were great depots and countinghouses larger than even the cavalry barracks where no other uniform but that of the postman was known hence it was that the consuls chief duty was to uphold the flag of his own country by the examination and certification of divers invoices sent to his office by the manufacturers but oddly enough these business messengers were chiefly womennot clerks but ordinary household servants and on busy days the consulate might have been mistaken for a female registry office so filled and possessed it was by waiting madchen here it was that gretchen lieschen and clarchen in the cleanest of blue gowns and stoutly but smartly shod brought their invoices in a piece of clean paper or folded in a blue handkerchief and laid them with fingers more or less worn and stubby from hard service before the consul for his signature once in the case of a very young madchen that signature was blotted by the sweep of a flaxen braid upon it as the child turned to go but generally there was a grave serious business instinct and sense of responsibility in these girls of ordinary peasant origin which equally with their sisters of france were unknown to the english or american woman of any class  that morning however there was a slight stir among those who with their knitting were waiting their turn in the outer office as the viceconsul ushered the police inspector into the consuls private office he was in uniform of course and it took him a moment to recover from his habitual stiff military salutea little stiffer than that of the actual soldier  it was a matter of importance a stranger had that morning been arrested in the town and identified as a military deserter he claimed to be an american citizen he was now in the outer office waiting the consuls interrogation  the consul knew however that the ominous accusation had only a mild significance here the term military deserter included any one who had in youth emigrated to a foreign country without first fulfilling his military duty to his fatherland his first experiences of these cases had been tedious and difficultinvolving a reference to his minister at berlin a correspondence with the american state department a condition of unpleasant tension and finally the prolonged detention of some innocent germannaturalizedamerican citizen who had forgotten to bring his papers with him in revisiting his own native country it so chanced however that the consul enjoyed the friendship and confidence of the general adlerkreutz who commanded the 20th division and it further chanced that the same adlerkreutz was as gallant a soldier as ever cried vorwarts at the head of his men as profound a military strategist and organizer as ever carried his own and his enemys plans in his iron head and spiked helmet and yet with as simple and unaffected a soul breathing under his gray mustache as ever issued from the lips of a child so this grim but gentle veteran had arranged with the consul that in cases where the presumption of nationality was strong although the evidence was not present he would take the consuls parole for the appearance of the deserter or his papers without the aid of prolonged diplomacy in this way the consul had saved to milwaukee a worthy but imprudent brewer and to new york an excellent sausage butcher and possible alderman but had returned to martial duty one or two tramps or journeymen who had never seen america except from the decks of the ships in which they were stowaways and on which they were returnedand thus the temper and peace of two great nations were preserved  he says said the inspector severely that he is an american citizen but has lost his naturalization papers yet he has made the damaging admission to others that he lived several years in rome and continued the inspector looking over his shoulder at the closed door as he placed his finger beside his nose he says he has relations living at palmyra whom he frequently visited ach observe this unheardofandnottobetrusted statement  the consul however smiled with a slight flash of intelligence let me see him he said  they passed into the outer office another policeman and a corporal of infantry saluted and rose in the centre of an admiring and sympathetic crowd of dienstmadchen sat the culprit the least concerned of the party a striplinga boyscarcely out of his teens indeed it was impossible to conceive of a more innocent bucolic and almost angelic looking derelict with a skin that had the peculiar white and rosiness of fresh pork he had blue eyes celestially wide open and staring and the thick flocculent yellow curls of the sun god he might have been an overgrown and badly dressed cupid who had innocently wandered from paphian shores he smiled as the consul entered and wiped from his full red lips with the back of his hand the traces of a sausage he was eating the consul recognized the flavor at oncehe had smelled it before in lieschens little handbasket  you say you lived at rome began the consul pleasantly did you take out your first declaration of your intention of becoming an american citizen there  the inspector cast an approving glance at the consul fixed a stern eye on the cherubic prisoner and leaned back in his chair to hear the reply to this terrible question  i dont remember said the culprit knitting his brows in infantine thought it was either there or at madrid or syracuse  the inspector was about to rise this was really trifling with the dignity of the municipality but the consul laid his hand on the officials sleeve and opening an american atlas to a map of the state of new york said to the prisoner as he placed the inspectors hand on the sheet i see you know the names of the towns on the erie and new york central railroad but  i can tell you the number of people in each town and what are the manufactures interrupted the young fellow with youthful vanity madrid has six thousand and there are over sixty thousand in  that will do said the consul as a murmur of wunderschon went round the group of listening servant girls while glances of admiration were shot at the beaming accused but you ought to remember the name of the town where your naturalization papers were afterwards sent  but i was a citizen from the moment i made my declaration said the stranger smiling and looking triumphantly at his admirers and i could vote  the inspector since he had come to grief over american geographical nomenclature was grimly taciturn the consul however was by no means certain of his victory his alleged fellow citizen was too encyclopaedic in his knowledge a clever youth might have crammed for this with a textbook but then he did not look at all clever indeed he had rather the stupidity of the mythological subject he represented leave him with me said the consul the inspector handed him a precis of the case the cherubs name was karl schwartz an orphan missing from schlachtstadt since the age of twelve relations not living or in emigration identity established by prisoners admission and record  now karl said the consul cheerfully as the door of his private office closed upon them what is your little game have you ever had any papers and if you were clever enough to study the map of new york state why werent you clever enough to see that it wouldnt stand you in place of your papers  dots joost it said karl in english but you see dot if i haf declairet mine intention of begomming a citizen its all the same dont it  by no means for you seem to have no evidence of the declaration no papers at all  zo said karl nevertheless he pushed his small rosy pickledpigsfeet of fingers through his fleecy curls and beamed pleasantly at the consul dots vots der matter he said as if taking a kindly interest in some private trouble of the consuls dots vere you vos eh  the consul looked steadily at him for a moment such stupidity was by no means phenomenal nor at all inconsistent with his appearance and continued the consul gravely i must tell you that unless you have other proofs than you have shown it will be my duty to give you up to the authorities  dot means i shall serve my time eh said karl with an unchanged smile  exactly so returned the consul  zo said karl dese towndose schlachtstadtis fine town eh fine vomens goot men und beer und sausage blenty to eat and drink eh und looking around the room you and te poys haf a gay times  yes said the consul shortly turning away but he presently faced round again on the unfettered karl who was evidently indulging in a gormandizing reverie  what on earth brought you here anyway  was it das  what brought you here from america or wherever you ran away from  to see der volks  but you are an orphan you know and you have no folks living here  but all shermany is mine volksde whole gountry dont it pet your poots hows dot eh  the consul turned back to his desk and wrote a short note to general adlerkreutz in his own american german he did not think it his duty in the present case to interfere with the authorities or to offer his parole for karl schwartz but he would claim that as the offender was evidently an innocent emigrant and still young any punishment or military degradation be omitted and he be allowed to take his place like any other recruit in the ranks if he might have the temerity to the undoubted farseeing military authority of suggestion making here he would suggest that karl was for the commissariat fitted of course he still retained the right on production of satisfactory proof his discharge to claim  the consul read this aloud to karl the cherubic youth smiled and said zo then extending his hand he added the word zshake  the consul shook his hand a little remorsefully and preceding him to the outer room resigned him with the note into the inspectors hands a universal sigh went up from the girls and glances of appeal sought the consul but he wisely concluded that it would be well for a while that karla helpless orphanshould be under some sort of discipline and the securer business of certifying invoices recommenced  late that afternoon he received a folded bit of blue paper from the waistbelt of an orderly which contained in english characters and as a single word alright followed by certain jagged penmarks which he recognized as adlerkreutzs signature but it was not until a week later that he learned anything definite he was returning one night to his lodgings in the residential part of the city and in opening the door with his passkey perceived in the rear of the hall his handmaiden trudschen attended by the usual blue or yellow or red shadow he was passing by them with the local n abend on his lips when the soldier turned his face and saluted the consul stopped it was the cherub karl in uniform  but it had not subdued a single one of his characteristics his hair had been cropped a little more closely under his cap but there was its color and woolliness still intact his plump figure was girt by belt and buttons but he only looked the more unreal and more like a combination of penwiper and pincushion until his puffy breast and shoulders seemed to offer a positive invitation to any one who had picked up a pin but wonderfulaccording to his brief storyhe had been so proficient in the goose step that he had been put in uniform already and allowed certain small privilegesamong them evidently the present one the consul smiled and passed on but it seemed strange to him that trudschen who was a tall strapping girl exceedingly popular with the military and who had never looked lower than a corporal at least should accept the attentions of an einjahriger like that later he interrogated her  ach it was only unser karl and the consul knew he was amerikanisch  indeed  yes it was such a tearful story  tell me what it is said the consul with a faint hope that karl had volunteered some communication of his past  ach gott there in america he was a man and could vote make laws and god willing become a town counciloror ober intendantand here he was nothing but a soldier for years and this america was a fine country wunderschon there were such big cities and one booflocould hold all schlachtstadt and had of people five hundred thousand  the consul sighed karl had evidently not yet got off the line of the new york central and erie roads but does he remember yet what he did with his papers said the consul persuasively  ach what does he want with papers when he could make the laws they were dumb stupid thingsthese papersto him  but his appetite remains good i hope suggested the consul  this closed the conversation although karl came on many other nights and his toy figure quite supplanted the tall corporal of hussars in the remote shadows of the hall one night however the consul returned home from a visit to a neighboring town a day earlier than he was expected as he neared his house he was a little surprised to find the windows of his sittingroom lit up and that there were no signs of trudschen in the lower hall or passages he made his way upstairs in the dark and pushed open the door of his apartment to his astonishment karl was sitting comfortably in his own chair his cap off before a studentlamp on the table deeply engaged in apparent study so profound was his abstraction that it was a moment before he looked up and the consul had a good look at his usually beaming and responsive face which however now struck him as wearing a singular air of thought and concentration when their eyes at last met he rose instantly and saluted and his beaming smile returned but either from his natural phlegm or extraordinary selfcontrol he betrayed neither embarrassment nor alarm  the explanation he gave was direct and simple trudschen had gone out with the corporal fritz for a short walk and had asked him to keep house during their absence he had no books no papers nothing to read in the barracks and no chance to improve his mind he thought the herr consul would not object to his looking at his books the consul was touched it was really a trivial indiscretion and as much trudschens fault as karls and if the poor fellow had any mind to improvehis recent attitude certainly suggested thought and reflectionthe consul were a brute to reprove him he smiled pleasantly as karl returned a stubby bit of pencil and some greasy memoranda to his breast pocket and glanced at the table but to his surprise it was a large map that karl had been studying and to his still greater surprise a map of the consuls own district  you seem to be fond of mapstudying said the consul pleasantly you are not thinking of emigrating again  ach no said karl simply it is my cousine vot haf lif near here i find her  but he left on trudschens return and the consul was surprised to see that while karls attitude towards her had not changed the girl exhibited less effusiveness than before believing it to be partly the effect of the return of the corporal the consul taxed her with faithlessness but trudschen looked grave  ah he has new friends this karl of ours he cares no more for poor girls like us when fine ladies like the old frau von wimpfel make much of him what will you  it appeared indeed from trudschens account that the widow of a wealthy shopkeeper had made a kind of protege of the young soldier and given him presents furthermore that the wife of his colonel had employed him to act as page or attendant at an afternoon gesellschaft and that since then the wives of other officers had sought him did not the herr consul think it was dreadful that this american who could vote and make laws should be subjected to such things  the consul did not know what to think it seemed to him however that karl was getting on and that he was not in need of his assistance it was in the expectation of hearing more about him however that he cheerfully accepted an invitation from adlerkreutz to dine at the caserne one evening with the staff here he found somewhat to his embarrassment that the dinner was partly in his own honor and at the close of five courses and the emptying of many bottles his health was proposed by the gallant veteran adlerkreutz in a neat address of many syllables containing all the parts of speech and a single verb it was to the effect that in his soulfriend the herr consul and himself was the nevertobesevered union of germania and columbia and in their perfect understanding was the wardefying alliance of two great nations and that in the consuls noble restoration of unser karl to the german army there was the astute diplomacy of a great mind he was satisfied that himself and the herr consul still united in the great future looking down upon a common brotherhoodthe great germanicamerican confederationwould feel satisfied with themselves and each other and their nevertobeforgotten earthlabors cries of hoch hoch resounded through the apartment with the grinding roll of heavybottomed beerglasses and the consul tremulous with emotion and a reserve verb in his pocket rose to reply fully embarked upon this perilous voyage and steering wide and clear of any treacherous shore of intelligence or fancied harbor of understanding and rest he kept boldly out at sea he said that while his loving adversary in this battle of compliment had disarmed him and left him no words to reply to his generous panegyric he could not but join with that gallant soldier in his heartfelt aspirations for the peaceful alliance of both countries but while he fully reciprocated all his hosts broader and higher sentiments he must point out to this gallant assembly this glorious brotherhood that even a greater tie of sympathy knitted him to the generalthe tie of kinship for while it was well known to the present company that their gallant commander had married an englishwoman he the consul although always an american would now for the first time confess to them that he himself was of dutch descent on his mothers side he would say no more but confidently leave them in possession of the tremendous significance of this untilthenunknown fact he sat down with the forgotten verb still in his pocket but the applause that followed this perfectly conclusive satisfying and logical climax convinced him of his success his hand was grasped eagerly by successive warriors the general turned and embraced him before the breathless assembly there were tears in the consuls eyes  as the festivities progressed however he found to his surprise that karl had not only become the fashion as a military page but that his naive stupidity and sublime simplicity was the wondering theme and inexhaustible delight of the whole barracks stories were told of his genius for blundering which rivaled handy andys old stories of fatuous ignorance were rearranged and fitted to our karl it was our karl who on receiving a tip of two marks from the hands of a young lady to whom he had brought the bouquet of a gallant lieutenant exhibited some hesitation and finally said yes but gnadiges fraulein that cost us nine marks it was our karl who interrupting the regrets of another lady that she was unable to accept his masters invitation said politely ah what matter gnadigste i have still a letter for fraulein kopp her rival and i was told that i must not invite you both it was our karl who astonished the hostess to whom he was sent at the last moment with apologies from an officer unexpectedly detained at barrack duty by suggesting that he should bring that unfortunate officer his dinner from the just served table nor were these charming infelicities confined to his social and domestic service although ready mechanical and invariably docile in the manual and physical duties of a soldierwhich endeared him to the german drillmasterhe was still invincibly ignorant as to its purport or even the meaning and structure of the military instruments he handled or vacantly looked upon it was our karl who suggested to his instructors that in fieldfiring it was quicker and easier to load his musket to the muzzle at once and get rid of its deathdealing contents at a single discharge than to load and fire consecutively it was our karl who nearly killed the instructor at sentry drill by adhering to the letter of his instructions when that instructor had forgotten the password it was the same karl who severely admonished for his recklessness the next time added to his challenge the precaution unless you instantly say fatherland ill fire yet his perfect good humor and childlike curiosity were unmistakable throughout and incited his comrades and his superiors to show him everything in the hope of getting some characteristic comment from him everything and everybody were open to karl and his goodhumored simplicity  that evening as the general accompanied the consul down to the gateway and the waiting carriage a figure in uniform ran spontaneously before them and shouted heraus to the sentries but the general promptly checked the turning out of the guard with a paternal shake of his finger to the overzealous soldier in whom the consul recognized karl he is my bursche now said the general explanatorily my wife has taken a fancy to him ach he is very popular with these women the consul was still more surprised the frau generalin adlerkreutz he knew to be a pronounced englishwomancarrying out her english ways proprieties and prejudices in the very heart of schlachtstadt uncompromisingly without fear and without reproach that she should follow a merely foreign society craze or alter her english household so as to admit the impossible karl struck him oddly  a month or two elapsed without further news of karl when one afternoon he suddenly turned up at the consulate he had again sought the consular quiet to write a few letters home he had no chance in the confinement of the barracks  but by this time you must be in the family of a fieldmarshal at least suggested the consul pleasantly  not today but next week said karl with sublime simplicity then i am going to serve with the governor commandant of rheinfestung  the consul smiled motioned him to a seat at a table in the outer office and left him undisturbed to his correspondence  returning later he found karl his letters finished gazing with childish curiosity and admiration at some thick official envelopes bearing the stamp of the consulate which were lying on the table he was evidently struck with the contrast between them and the thin flimsy affairs he was holding in his hand he appeared still more impressed when the consul told him what they were  are you writing to your friends continued the consul touched by his simplicity  ach ja said karl eagerly  would you like to put your letter in one of these envelopes continued the official  the beaming face and eyes of karl were a sufficient answer after all it was a small favor granted to this odd waif who seemed to still cling to the consular protection he handed him the envelope and left him addressing it in boyish pride  it was karls last visit to the consulate he appeared to have spoken truly and the consul presently learned that he had indeed been transferred through some high official manipulation to the personal service of the governor of rheinfestung there was weeping among the dienstmadchen of schlachtstadt and a distinct loss of originality and lightness in the gatherings of the gentler hausfrauen his memory still survived in the barracks through the later editions of his former delightful stupiditiesmany of them it is to be feared were inventionsand stories that were supposed to have come from rheinfestung were described in the slang of the offiziere as being colossal but the consul remembered rheinfestung and could not imagine it as a home for karl or in any way fostering his peculiar qualities for it was eminently a fortress of fortresses a magazine of magazines a depot of depots it was the key of the rhine the citadel of westphalia the clapham junction of german railways but defended fortified encompassed and controlled by the newest as well as the oldest devices of military strategy and science even in the pipingest time of peace whole railway trains went into it like a rat in a trap and might have never come out of it it stretched out an inviting hand and arm across the river that might in the twinkling of an eye be changed into a closed fist of menace you defiled into it commanded at every step by enfilading walls you debouched out of it as you thought and found yourself only before the walls you reentered it at every possible angle you did everything apparently but pass through it you thought yourself well out of it and were stopped by a bastion its circumvallations haunted you until you came to the next station it had pressed even the current of the river into its defensive service there were secrets of its foundations and mines that only the highest military despots knew and kept to themselves in a wordit was impregnable  that such a place could not be trifled with or misunderstood in its rightandacuteangled severities seemed plain to every one but set on by his companions who were showing him its defensive foundations or in his own idle curiosity karl managed to fall into the rhine and was fished out with difficulty the immersion may have chilled his military ardor or soured his good humor for later the consul heard that he had visited the american consular agent at an adjacent town with the old story of his american citizenship he seemed said the consuls colleague to be well posted about american railways and american towns but he had no papers he lounged around the office for a while and  wrote letters home suggested the consul with a flash of reminiscence  yes the poor chap had no privacy at the barracks and i reckon was overlooked or bedeviled  this was the last the consul heard of karl schwartz directly for a week or two later he again fell into the rhine this time so fatally and effectually that in spite of the efforts of his companions he was swept away by the rapid current and thus ended his service to his country his body was never recovered  a few months before the consul was transferred from schlachtstadt to another post his memory of the departed karl was revived by a visit from adlerkreutz the general looked grave  you remember unser karl he said  yes  do you think he was an impostor  as regards his american citizenship yes but i could not say more  so said the general a very singular thing has happened he added twirling his mustache the inspector of police has notified us of the arrival of a karl schwartz in this town it appears he is the real karl schwartz identified by his sister as the only one the other who was drowned was an impostor hein  then you have secured another recruit said the consul smilingly  no for this one has already served his time in elsass where he went when he left here as a boy but donnerwetter why should that dumb fool take his name  by chance i fancy then he stupidly stuck to it and had to take the responsibilities with it dont you see said the consul pleased with his own cleverness  zoo said the general slowly in his deepest voice but the german exclamation has a variety of significance according to the inflection and adlerkreutzs ejaculation seemed to contain them all    it was in paris where the consul had lingered on his way to his new post he was sitting in a wellknown cafe among whose habitues were several military officers of high rank a group of them were gathered round a table near him he was idly watching them with an odd recollection of schlachtstadt in his mind and as idly glancing from them to the more attractive boulevard without the consul was getting a little tired of soldiers  suddenly there was a slight stir in the gesticulating group and a cry of greeting the consul looked up mechanically and then his eyes remained fixed and staring at the newcomer for it was the dead karl karl surely karlhis plump figure belted in a french officers tunic his flaxen hair clipped a little closer but still its fleece showing under his kepi karl his cheeks more cherubic than everunchanged but for a tiny yellow toy mustache curling up over the corners of his full lips karl beaming at his companions in his old way but rattling off french vivacities without the faintest trace of accent could he be mistaken was it some phenomenal resemblance or had the soul of the german private been transmigrated to the french officer  the consul hurriedly called the garcon who is that officer who has just arrived  it is the captain christian of the intelligence bureau said the waiter with proud alacrity a famous officer brave as a rabbitun fier lapinand one of our best clients so drole too such a farceur and mimic msieur would be ravished to hear his imitations  but he looks like a german and his name  ah he is from alsace but not a german said the waiter absolutely whitening with indignation he was at belfort so was i mon dieu no a thousand times no  but has he been living here long said the consul  in paris a few months but his department msieur understands takes him everywhere everywhere where he can gain information  the consuls eyes were still on the captain christian presently the officer perhaps instinctively conscious of the scrutiny looked towards him their eyes met to the consuls surprise the cidevant karl beamed upon him and advanced with outstretched hand  but the consul stiffened slightly and remained so with his glass in his hand at which captain christian brought his own easily to a military salute and said politely  monsieur le consul has been promoted from his post permit me to congratulate him  you have heard then said the consul dryly  otherwise i should not presume for our department makes it a businessin monsieur le consuls case it becomes a pleasureto know everything  did your department know that the real karl schwartz has returned said the consul dryly  captain christian shrugged his shoulders then it appears that the sham karl died none too soon he said lightly and yethe bent his eyes with mischievous reproach upon the consul  yet what demanded the consul sternly  monsieur le consul might have saved the unfortunate man by accepting him as an american citizen and not helping to force him into the german service  the consul saw in a flash the full military significance of this logic and could not repress a smile at which captain christian dropped easily into a chair beside him and as easily into broken german english  und he went on dees towndees schlachtstadt is fine town eh fine womens goot men und peer and sausage blenty to eat and trink eh und you und te poys haf a gay times  the consul tried to recover his dignity the waiter behind him recognizing only the delightful mimicry of this adorable officer was in fits of laughter nevertheless the consul managed to say dryly  and the barracks the magazines the commissariat the details the reserves of schlachtstadt were very interesting  assuredly  and rheinfestungits plansits details even its dangerous foundations by the riverthey were to a soldier singularly instructive  you have reason to say so said captain christian curling his little mustache  and the fortressyou think  imprenable mais  the consul remembered general adlerkreutzs zoo and wondered     uncle jim and uncle billy   they were partners the avuncular title was bestowed on them by cedar camp possibly in recognition of a certain matured good humor quite distinct from the spasmodic exuberant spirits of its other members and possibly from what to its youthful sense seemed their advanced ageswhich must have been at least forty they had also set habits even in their improvidence lost incalculable and unpayable sums to each other over euchre regularly every evening and inspected their sluiceboxes punctually every saturday for repairswhich they never made they even got to resemble each other after the fashion of old married couples or rather as in matrimonial partnerships were subject to the domination of the stronger character although in their case it is to be feared that it was the feminine uncle billyenthusiastic imaginative and loquaciouswho swayed the masculine steadygoing and practical uncle jim they had lived in the camp since its foundation in 1849 there seemed to be no reason why they should not remain there until its inevitable evolution into a miningtown the younger members might leave through restless ambition or a desire for change or novelty they were subject to no such trifling mutation yet cedar camp was surprised one day to hear that uncle billy was going away  the rain was softly falling on the bark thatch of the cabin with a muffled murmur like a sound heard through sleep the southwest trades were warm even at that altitude as the open door testified although a fire of pine bark was flickering on the adobe hearth and striking out answering fires from the freshly scoured culinary utensils on the rude sideboard which uncle jim had cleaned that morning with his usual serious persistency their best clothes which were interchangeable and worn alternately by each other on festal occasions hung on the walls which were covered with a coarse sailcloth canvas instead of lathandplaster and were diversified by pictures from illustrated papers and stains from the exterior weather two bunks like ships berthsan upper and lower oneoccupied the gableend of this single apartment and on beds of coarse sacking filled with dry moss were carefully rolled their respective blankets and pillows they were the only articles not used in common and whose individuality was respected  uncle jim who had been sitting before the fire rose as the square bulk of his partner appeared at the doorway with an armful of wood for the evening stove by that sign he knew it was nine oclock for the last six years uncle billy had regularly brought in the wood at that hour and uncle jim had as regularly closed the door after him and set out their single table containing a greasy pack of cards taken from its drawer a bottle of whiskey and two tin drinkingcups to this was added a ragged memorandumbook and a stick of pencil the two men drew their stools to the table  hol on a minit said uncle billy  his partner laid down the cards as uncle billy extracted from his pocket a pillbox and opening it gravely took a pill this was clearly an innovation on their regular proceedings for uncle billy was always in perfect health  whats this for asked uncle jim half scornfully  agin ager  you aint got no ager said uncle jim with the assurance of intimate cognizance of his partners physical condition  but its a powful preventive quinine saw this box at rileys store and laid out a quarter on it we kin keep it here comfortable for evenings its mighty soothin arter a mans done a hard days work on the riverbar take one  uncle jim gravely took a pill and swallowed it and handed the box back to his partner  well leave it on the table sociable like in case any of the boys come in said uncle billy taking up the cards well how do we stand  uncle jim consulted the memorandumbook you were owin me sixtytwo thousand dollars on the last game and the limits seventyfive thousand  je whillikins ejaculated uncle billy let me see  he examined the book feebly attempted to challenge the additions but with no effect on the total we oughter hev made the limit a hundred thousand he said seriously seventyfive thousand is only triflin in a game like ours and youve set down my claim at angels he continued  i allowed you ten thousand dollars for that said uncle jim with equal gravity and its a fancy price too  the claim in question being an unprospected hillside ten miles distant which uncle jim had never seen and uncle billy had not visited for years the statement was probably true nevertheless uncle billy retorted  ye kin never tell how these things will pan out why only this mornin i was taking a turn round shot up hill that ye know is just rotten with quartz and gold and i couldnt help thinkin how much it was like my ole claim at angels i must take a day off to go on there and strike a pick in it if only for luck  suddenly he paused and said strange aint it you should speak of it tonight now i call that queer  he laid down his cards and gazed mysteriously at his companion uncle jim knew perfectly that uncle billy had regularly once a week for many years declared his final determination to go over to angels and prospect his claim yet nevertheless he half responded to his partners suggestion of mystery and a look of fatuous wonder crept into his eyes but he contented himself by saying cautiously you spoke of it first  thats the more singlar said uncle billy confidently and ive been thinking about it and kinder seeing myself thar all day its mighty queer he got up and began to rummage among some torn and coverless books in the corner  wheres that dream book gone to  the carson boys borrowed it replied uncle jim anyhow yours wasnt no dreamonly a kind o vision and the book dont take no stock in visions nevertheless he watched his partner with some sympathy and added that reminds me that i had a dream the other night of being in frisco at a small hotel with heaps o money and all the time being sort o scared and bewildered over it  no queried his partner eagerly yet reproachfully you never let on anything about it to me its mighty queer you havin these strange feelins for ive had em myself and only tonight comin up from the spring i saw two crows hopping in the trail and i says if i see another its luck sure and youll think im lyin but when i went to the woodpile just now there was the third one sittin up on a log as plain as i see you tell e what folks ken laughbut thats just what jim filgee saw the night before he made the big strike  they were both smiling yet with an underlying credulity and seriousness as singularly pathetic as it seemed incongruous to their years and intelligence small wonder however that in their occupation and environmentliving daily in an atmosphere of hope expectation and chance looking forward each morning to the blind stroke of a pick that might bring fortunethey should see signs in nature and hear mystic voices in the trackless woods that surrounded them still less strange that they were peculiarly susceptible to the more recognized diversions of chance and were gamblers on the turning of a card who trusted to the revelation of a shovelful of upturned earth  it was quite natural therefore that they should return from their abstract form of divination to the table and their cards but they were scarcely seated before they heard a crackling step in the brush outside and the free latch of their door was lifted a younger member of the camp entered he uttered a peevish halloo which might have passed for a greeting or might have been a slight protest at finding the door closed drew the stool from which uncle jim had just risen before the fire shook his wet clothes like a newfoundland dog and sat down yet he was by no means churlish nor coarselooking and this act was rather one of easygoing selfish youthful familiarity than of rudeness the cabin of uncles billy and jim was considered a public right or common of the camp conferences between individual miners were appointed there ill meet you at uncle billys was a common tryst added to this was a tacit claim upon the partners arbitrative powers or the equal right to request them to step outside if the interviews were of a private nature yet there was never any objection on the part of the partners and tonight there was not a shadow of resentment of this intrusion in the patient goodhumored tolerant eyes of uncles jim and billy as they gazed at their guest perhaps there was a slight gleam of relief in uncle jims when he found that the guest was unaccompanied by any one and that it was not a tryst it would have been unpleasant for the two partners to have stayed out in the rain while their guests were exchanging private confidences in their cabin while there might have been no limit to their good will there might have been some to their capacity for exposure  uncle jim drew a huge log from beside the hearth and sat on the driest end of it while their guest occupied the stool the young man without turning away from his discontented peevish brooding over the fire vaguely reached backward for the whiskeybottle and uncle billys tin cup to which he was assisted by the latters hospitable hand but on setting down the cup his eye caught sight of the pillbox  wots that he said with gloomy scorn rat poison  quinine pillsagin ager said uncle jim the newest thing out keeps out damp like injinrubber take one to follow yer whiskey me and uncle billy wouldnt think o settin down quiet like in the evening arter work without em take oneye r welcome we keep em out here for the boys  accustomed as the partners were to adopt and wear each others opinions before folks as they did each others clothing uncle billy was nevertheless astonished and delighted at uncle jims enthusiasm over his pills the guest took one and swallowed it  mighty bitter he said glancing at his hosts with the quick californian suspicion of some practical joke but the honest faces of the partners reassured him  that bitterness ye taste said uncle jim quickly is whar the things gittin in its work sorter sickenin the malariaand kinder waterproofin the insides all to onct and at the same lick dont yer see put another in yer vest pocket youll be cryin for em like a child afore ye get home thar well hows things agoin on your claim dick boomin eh  the guest raised his head and turned it sufficiently to fling his answer back over his shoulder at his hosts i dont know what youd call boomin he said gloomily i suppose you two men sitting here comfortably by the fire without caring whether school keeps or not would call two feet of backwater over ones claim boomin i reckon youd consider a hundred and fifty feet of sluicing carried away and drifting to thunder down the south fork something in the way of advertising to your old camp i suppose youd think it was an inducement to investors i shouldnt wonder he added still more gloomily as a sudden dash of rain down the widethroated chimney dropped in his tin cupand it would be just like you two chaps sittin there gormandizing over your quinineif yer said this rain thats lasted three weeks was something to be proud of  it was the cheerful and the satisfying custom of the rest of the camp for no reason whatever to hold uncle jim and uncle billy responsible for its present location its vicissitudes the weather or any convulsion of nature and it was equally the partners habit for no reason whatever to accept these animadversions and apologize  its a rain thats soft and mellowin said uncle billy gently and supplin to the sinews and muscles did ye ever notice jimostentatiously to his partnerdid ye ever notice that you get inter a kind o sweaty lather workin in it sorter openin to the pores  fetches em every time said uncle billy better nor fancy soap  their guest laughed bitterly well im going to leave it to you i reckon to cut the whole concern tomorrow and lite out for something new it cant be worse than this  the two partners looked grieved albeit they were accustomed to these outbursts everybody who thought of going away from cedar camp used it first as a threat to these patient men after the fashion of runaway nephews or made an exemplary scene of their going  better think twice afore ye go said uncle billy  ive seen worse weather afore ye came said uncle jim slowly water all over the bar the mud so deep ye couldnt get to angels for a sack o flour and we had to grub on pine nuts and jackassrabbits and yetwe stuck by the camp and here we are  the mild answer apparently goaded their guest to fury he rose from his seat threw back his long dripping hair from his handsome but querulous face and scattered a few drops on the partners yes thats just it thats what gets me here you stick and here you are and here youll stick and rust until you starve or drown here you aretwo men who ought to be out in the world playing your part as grown menstuck here like children playing house in the woods playing work in your wretched mudpie ditches and content two men not so old that you mightnt be taking your part in the fun of the world going to balls or theatres or paying attention to girls and yet old enough to have married and have your families around you content to stay in this godforsaken place old bachelors pigging together like poorhouse paupers thats what gets me say you like it say you expect by hanging on to make a strikeand what does that amount to what are your chances how many of us have made or are making more than grub wages say youre willing to share and share alike as you dohave you got enough for two arent you actually living off each other arent you grinding each other down choking each others struggles as you sink together deeper and deeper in the mud of this cussed camp and while youre doing this arent you by your age and position here holding out hopes to others that you know cannot be fulfilled  accustomed as they were to the halfquerulous halfhumorous but always extravagant criticism of the others there was something so new in this arraignment of themselves that the partners for a moment sat silent there was a slight flush on uncle billys cheek there was a slight paleness on uncle jims he was the first to reply but he did so with a certain dignity which neither his partner nor their guest had ever seen on his face before  as its our fire thats warmed ye up like this dick bullen he said slowly rising with his hand resting on uncle billys shoulder and as its our whiskey thats loosened your tongue i reckon we must put up with what ye r saying just as weve managed to put up with our own way o living and not quoll with ye under our own roof  the young fellow saw the change in uncle jims face and quickly extended his hand with an apologetic backward shake of his long hair hang it all old man he said with a laugh of mingled contrition and amusement you mustnt mind what i said just now ive been so worried thinking of things about myself and maybe a little about you that i quite forgot i hadnt a call to preach to anybodyleast of all to you so we part friends uncle jim and you too uncle billy and youll forget what i said in fact i dont know why i spoke at allonly i was passing your claim just now and wondering how much longer your old sluiceboxes would hold out and where in thunder youd get others when they caved in i reckon that sent me off thats all old chap  uncle billys face broke into a beaming smile of relief and it was his hand that first grasped his guests uncle jim quickly followed with as honest a pressure but with eyes that did not seem to be looking at bullen though all trace of resentment had died out of them he walked to the door with him again shook hands but remained looking out in the darkness some time after dick bullens tangled hair and broad shoulders had disappeared  meantime uncle billy had resumed his seat and was chuckling and reminiscent as he cleaned out his pipe  kinder reminds me of jo sharp when he was cleaned out at poker by his own partners in his own cabin comin up here and bedevilin us about it what was it you lint him  but uncle jim did not reply and uncle billy taking up the cards began to shuffle them smiling vaguely yet at the same time somewhat painfully arter all dick was mighty cut up about what he said and i felt kinder sorry for him and you know i rather cotton to a man that speaks his mind sorter clears him out you know of all the slumgullion thats in him its just like washin out a pan o prospecting you pour in the water and keep slushing it round and round and out comes first the mud and dirt and then the gravel and then the black sand and thenits all out and theres a speck o gold glistenin at the bottom  then you think there was suthin in what he said said uncle jim facing about slowly  an odd tone in his voice made uncle billy look up no he said quickly shying with the instinct of an easy pleasureloving nature from a possible grave situation no i dont think he ever got the color but wot are ye moonin about for aint ye goin to play its mor n half past nine now  thus adjured uncle jim moved up to the table and sat down while uncle billy dealt the cards turning up the jack or right bowerbut without that exclamation of delight which always accompanied his good fortune nor did uncle jim respond with the usual corresponding simulation of deep disgust such a circumstance had not occurred before in the history of their partnership they both played in silencea silence only interrupted by a larger splash of raindrops down the chimney  we orter put a couple of stones on the chimneytop edgewise like jack curtis does it keeps out the rain without interferin with the draft said uncle billy musingly  whats the use if  if what said uncle billy quietly  if we dont make it broader said uncle jim half wearily  they both stared at the chimney but uncle jims eye followed the wall around to the bunks there were many discolorations on the canvas and a picture of the goddess of liberty from an illustrated paper had broken out in a kind of damp measly eruption ill stick that funny handbill of the washin soda i got at the grocery store the other day right over the liberty gal its a mighty perty woman washin with short sleeves said uncle billy thats the comfort of them picters you kin always get somethin new and it adds thickness to the wall  uncle jim went back to the cards in silence after a moment he rose again and hung his overcoat against the door  winds comin in he said briefly  yes said uncle billy cheerfully but it wouldnt seem natral if there wasnt that crack in the door to let the sunlight in o mornins makes a kind o sundial you know when the streak o lights in that corner i says six oclock when its across the chimney i say seven and so tis  it certainly had grown chilly and the wind was rising the candle guttered and flickered the embers on the hearth brightened occasionally as if trying to dispel the gathering shadows but always ineffectually the game was frequently interrupted by the necessity of stirring the fire after an interval of gloom in which each partner successively drew the candle to his side to examine his cards uncle jim said  say  well responded uncle billy  are you sure you saw that third crow on the woodpile  sure as i see you nowand a darned sight plainer why  nothin i was just thinkin look here how do we stand now  uncle billy was still losing nevertheless he said cheerfully im owin you a matter of sixty thousand dollars  uncle jim examined the book abstractedly suppose he said slowly but without looking at his partner suppose as its gettin late now we play for my half share of the claim agin the limitseventy thousandto square up  your half share repeated uncle billy with amused incredulity  my half share of the claimof this yer house you knowone half of all that dick bullen calls our rotten starvation property reiterated uncle jim with a half smile  uncle billy laughed it was a novel idea it was of course all in the air like the rest of their game yet even then he had an odd feeling that he would have liked dick bullen to have known it wade in old pard he said im on it  uncle jim lit another candle to reinforce the fading light and the deal fell to uncle billy he turned up jack of clubs he also turned a little redder as he took up his cards looked at them and glanced hastily at his partner its no use playing he said look here he laid down his cards on the table they were the ace king and queen of clubs and jack of spadesor left bowerwhich with the turnedup jack of clubsor right bowercomprised all the winning cards  by jingo if wed been playin fourhanded say you an me agin some other ducks wed have made four in that deal and histed some moneyeh and his eyes sparkled uncle jim also had a slight tremulous light in his own  oh no i didnt see no three crows this afternoon added uncle billy gleefully as his partner in turn began to shuffle the cards with laborious and conscientious exactitude then dealing he turned up a heart for trumps uncle billy took up his cards one by one but when he had finished his face had become as pale as it had been red before whats the matter said uncle jim quickly his own face growing white  uncle billy slowly and with breathless awe laid down his cards face up on the table it was exactly the same sequence in hearts with the knave of diamonds added he could again take every trick  they stared at each other with vacant faces and a halfdrawn smile of fear they could hear the wind moaning in the trees beyond there was a sudden rattling at the door uncle billy started to his feet but uncle jim caught his arm dont leave the cards its only the wind sit down he said in a low awehushed voice its your deal you were two before and two now that makes your four youve only one point to make to win the game go on  they both poured out a cup of whiskey smiling vaguely yet with a certain terror in their eyes their hands were cold the cards slipped from uncle billys benumbed fingers when he had shuffled them he passed them to his partner to shuffle them also but did not speak when uncle jim had shuffled them methodically he handed them back fatefully to his partner uncle billy dealt them with a trembling hand he turned up a club if you are sure of these tricks you know youve won said uncle jim in a voice that was scarcely audible uncle billy did not reply but tremulously laid down the ace and right and left bowers  he had won  a feeling of relief came over each and they laughed hysterically and discordantly ridiculous and childish as their contest might have seemed to a lookeron to each the tension had been as great as that of the greatest gambler without the gamblers trained restraint coolness and composure uncle billy nervously took up the cards again  dont said uncle jim gravely its no usethe lucks gone now  just one more deal pleaded his partner  uncle jim looked at the fire uncle billy hastily dealt and threw the two hands face up on the table they were the ordinary average cards he dealt again with the same result i told you so said uncle jim without looking up  it certainly seemed a tame performance after their wonderful hands and after another trial uncle billy threw the cards aside and drew his stool before the fire mighty queer warnt it he said with reminiscent awe three times running do you know i felt a kind o creepy feelin down my back all the time criky what luck none of the boys would believe it if we told emleast of all that dick bullen who dont believe in luck anyway wonder what hed have said and lord how hed have looked wall what are you starin so for  uncle jim had faced around and was gazing at uncle billys goodhumored simple face nothin he said briefly and his eyes again sought the fire  then dont look as if you was seein suthinyou give me the creeps returned uncle billy a little petulantly lets turn in afore the fire goes out  the fateful cards were put back into the drawer the table shoved against the wall the operation of undressing was quickly got over the clothes they wore being put on top of their blankets uncle billy yawned i wonder what kind of a dream ill have tonightit oughter be suthin to explain that luck this was his goodnight to his partner in a few moments he was sound asleep  not so uncle jim he heard the wind gradually go down and in the oppressive silence that followed could detect the deep breathing of his companion and the faroff yelp of a coyote his eyesight becoming accustomed to the semidarkness broken only by the scintillation of the dying embers of their fire he could take in every detail of their sordid cabin and the rude environment in which they had lived so long the dismal patches on the bark roof the wretched makeshifts of each day the dreary prolongation of discomfort were all plain to him now without the sanguine hope that had made them bearable and when he shut his eyes upon them it was only to travel in fancy down the steep mountain side that he had trodden so often to the dreary claim on the overflowed river to the heaps of tailings that encumbered it like empty shells of the hollow profitless days spent there which they were always waiting for the stroke of good fortune to clear away he saw again the rotten sluicing through whose hopeless rifts and holes even their scant daily earnings had become scantier at last he arose and with infinite gentleness let himself down from his berth without disturbing his sleeping partner and wrapping himself in his blanket went to the door which he noiselessly opened from the position of a few stars that were glittering in the northern sky he knew that it was yet scarcely midnight there were still long restless hours before the day in the feverish state into which he had gradually worked himself it seemed to him impossible to wait the coming of the dawn  but he was mistaken for even as he stood there all nature seemed to invade his humble cabin with its free and fragrant breath and invest him with its great companionship he felt again in that breath that strange sense of freedom that mystic touch of partnership with the birds and beasts the shrubs and trees in this greater home before him it was this vague communion that had kept him there that still held these worldsick weary workers in their rude cabins on the slopes around him and he felt upon his brow that balm that had nightly lulled him and them to sleep and forgetfulness he closed the door turned away crept as noiselessly as before into his bunk again and presently fell into a profound slumber  but when uncle billy awoke the next morning he saw it was late for the sun piercing the crack of the closed door was sending a pencil of light across the cold hearth like a match to rekindle its dead embers his first thought was of his strange luck the night before and of disappointment that he had not had the dream of divination that he had looked for he sprang to the floor but as he stood upright his glance fell on uncle jims bunk it was empty not only that but his blanketsuncle jims own particular blanketswere gone  a sudden revelation of his partners manner the night before struck him now with the cruelty of a blow a sudden intelligence perhaps the very divination he had sought flashed upon him like lightning he glanced wildly around the cabin the table was drawn out from the wall a little ostentatiously as if to catch his eye on it was lying the stained chamoisskin purse in which they had kept the few grains of gold remaining from their last weeks clean up the grains had been carefully divided and half had been taken but near it lay the little memorandumbook open with the stick of pencil lying across it a deep line was drawn across the page on which was recorded their imaginary extravagant gains and losses even to the entry of uncle jims half share of the claim which he had risked and lost underneath were hurriedly scrawled the words  settled by your luck last night old pardjames foster   it was nearly a month before cedar camp was convinced that uncle billy and uncle jim had dissolved partnership pride had prevented uncle billy from revealing his suspicions of the truth or of relating the events that preceded uncle jims clandestine flight and dick bullen had gone to sacramento by stagecoach the same morning he briefly gave out that his partner had been called to san francisco on important business of their own that indeed might necessitate his own removal there later in this he was singularly assisted by a letter from the absent jim dated at san francisco begging him not to be anxious about his success as he had hopes of presently entering into a profitable business but with no further allusions to his precipitate departure nor any suggestion of a reason for it for two or three days uncle billy was staggered and bewildered in his profound simplicity he wondered if his extraordinary good fortune that night had made him deaf to some explanation of his partners or more terrible if he had shown some low and incredible intimation of taking his partners extravagant bet as real and binding in this distress he wrote to uncle jim an appealing and apologetic letter albeit somewhat incoherent and inaccurate and bristling with misspelling camp slang and old partnership jibes but to this elaborate epistle he received only uncle jims repeated assurances of his own bright prospects and his hopes that his old partner would be more fortunate singlehanded on the old claim for a whole week or two uncle billy sulked but his invincible optimism and good humor got the better of him and he thought only of his old partners good fortune he wrote him regularly but always to one addressa box at the san francisco postoffice which to the simpleminded uncle billy suggested a certain official importance to these letters uncle jim responded regularly but briefly  from a certain intuitive pride in his partner and his affection uncle billy did not show these letters openly to the camp although he spoke freely of his former partners promising future and even read them short extracts it is needless to say that the camp did not accept uncle billys story with unsuspecting confidence on the contrary a hundred surmises humorous or serious but always extravagant were afloat in cedar camp the partners had quarreled over their clothesuncle jim who was taller than uncle billy had refused to wear his partners trousers they had quarreled over cardsuncle jim had discovered that uncle billy was in possession of a cold deck or marked pack they had quarreled over uncle billys carelessness in grinding up half a box of bilious pills in the mornings coffee a gloomily imaginative muledriver had darkly suggested that as no one had really seen uncle jim leave the camp he was still there and his bones would yet be found in one of the ditches while a still more credulous miner averred that what he had thought was the cry of a screechowl the night previous to uncle jims disappearance might have been the agonized utterance of that murdered man it was highly characteristic of that campand indeed of others in californiathat nobody not even the ingenious theorists themselves believed their story and that no one took the slightest pains to verify or disprove it happily uncle billy never knew it and moved all unconsciously in this atmosphere of burlesque suspicion and then a singular change took place in the attitude of the camp towards him and the disrupted partnership hitherto for no reason whatever all had agreed to put the blame upon billypossibly because he was present to receive it as days passed that slight reticence and dejection in his manner which they had at first attributed to remorse and a guilty conscience now began to tell as absurdly in his favor here was poor uncle billy toiling though the ditches while his selfish partner was lolling in the lap of luxury in san francisco uncle billys glowing accounts of uncle jims success only contributed to the sympathy now fully given in his behalf and their execration of the absconding partner it was proposed at biggss store that a letter expressing the indignation of the camp over his heartless conduct to his late partner william fall should be forwarded to him condolences were offered to uncle billy and uncouth attempts were made to cheer his loneliness a procession of half a dozen men twice a week to his cabin carrying their own whiskey and winding up with a stag dance before the premises was sufficient to lighten his eclipsed gayety and remind him of a happier past surprise working parties visited his claim with spasmodic essays towards helping him and great good humor and hilarity prevailed it was not an unusual thing for an honest miner to arise from an idle gathering in some cabin and excuse himself with the remark that he reckoned hed put in an hours work in uncle billys tailings and yet as before it was very improbable if any of these reckless benefactors really believed in their own earnestness or in the gravity of the situation indeed a kind of hopeful cynicism ran through their performances like as not uncle billy is still in cahoots i e shares with his old pard and is just laughin at us as hes sendin him accounts of our tomfoolin  and so the winter passed and the rains and the days of cloudless skies and chill starlit nights began there were still freshets from the snow reservoirs piled high in the sierran passes and the bar was flooded but that passed too and only the sunshine remained monotonous as the seasons were there was a faint movement in the camp with the stirring of the sap in the pines and cedars and then one day there was a strange excitement on the bar men were seen running hither and thither but mainly gathering in a crowd on uncle billys claim that still retained the old partners names in the fall and foster to add to the excitement there was the quickly repeated report of a revolver to all appearance aimlessly exploded in the air by some one on the outskirts of the assemblage as the crowd opened uncle billy appeared pale hysterical breathless and staggering a little under the backslapping and handshaking of the whole camp for uncle billy had struck it richhad just discovered a pocket roughly estimated to be worth fifteen thousand dollars  although in that supreme moment he missed the face of his old partner he could not help seeing the unaffected delight and happiness shining in the eyes of all who surrounded him it was characteristic of that sanguine but uncertain life that success and good fortune brought no jealousy nor envy to the unfortunate but was rather a promise and prophecy of the fulfillment of their own hopes the gold was therenature but yielded up her secret there was no prescribed limit to her bounty so strong was this conviction that a longsuffering but still hopeful miner in the enthusiasm of the moment stooped down and patted a large boulder with the apostrophic good old gal  then followed a night of jubilee a next morning of hurried consultation with a mining expert and speculator lured to the camp by the good tidings and then the very next nightto the utter astonishment of cedar campuncle billy with a draft for twenty thousand dollars in his pocket started for san francisco and took leave of his claim and the camp forever    when uncle billy landed at the wharves of san francisco he was a little bewildered the golden gate beyond was obliterated by the incoming seafog which had also roofed in the whole city and lights already glittered along the gray streets that climbed the grayer sandhills as a western man brought up by inland rivers he was fascinated and thrilled by the tallmasted seagoing ships and he felt a strange sense of the remoter mysterious ocean which he had never seen but he was impressed and startled by smartly dressed men and women the passing of carriages and a sudden conviction that he was strange and foreign to what he saw it had been his cherished intention to call upon his old partner in his working clothes and then clap down on the table before him a draft for ten thousand dollars as his share of their old claim but in the face of these brilliant strangers a sudden and unexpected timidity came upon him he had heard of a cheap popular hotel much frequented by the returning goldminer who entered its hospitable doorswhich held an easy access to shopsand emerged in a few hours a gorgeous butterfly of fashion leaving his old chrysalis behind him thence he inquired his way hence he afterwards issued in garments glaringly new and ill fitting but he had not sacrificed his beard and there was still something fine and original in his handsome weak face that overcame the cheap convention of his clothes making his way to the postoffice he was again discomfited by the great size of the building and bewildered by the array of little square letterboxes behind glass which occupied one whole wall and an equal number of opaque and locked wooden ones legibly numbered his heart leaped he remembered the number and before him was a window with a clerk behind it uncle billy leaned forward  kin you tell me if the man that box 690 blongs to is in  the clerk stared made him repeat the question and then turned away but he returned almost instantly with two or three grinning heads besides his own apparently set behind his shoulders uncle billy was again asked to repeat his question he did so  why dont you go and see if 690 is in his box said the first clerk turning with affected asperity to one of the others  the clerk went away returned and said with singular gravity he was there a moment ago but hes gone out to stretch his legs its rather crampin at first and he cant stand it more than ten hours at a time you know  but simplicity has its limits uncle billy had already guessed his real error in believing his partner was officially connected with the building his cheek had flushed and then paled again the pupils of his blue eyes had contracted into suggestive black points ef youll let me in at that winder young fellers he said with equal gravity ill show yer how i kin make you small enough to go in a box without crampin but i only wanted to know where jim foster lived  at which the first clerk became perfunctory again but civil a letter left in his box would get you that information he said and heres paper and pencil to write it now  uncle billy took the paper and began to write just got here come and see me athe paused a brilliant idea had struck him he could impress both his old partner and the upstarts at the window he would put in the name of the latest swell hotel in san francisco said to be a fairy dream of opulence he added the oriental and without folding the paper shoved it in the window  dont you want an envelope asked the clerk  put a stamp on the corner of it responded uncle billy laying down a coin and shell go through the clerk smiled but affixed the stamp and uncle billy turned away  but it was a shortlived triumph the disappointment at finding uncle jims address conveyed no idea of his habitation seemed to remove him farther away and lose his identity in the great city besides he must now make good his own address and seek rooms at the oriental he went thither the furniture and decorations even in these early days of hotelbuilding in san francisco were extravagant and overstrained and uncle billy felt lost and lonely in his strange surroundings but he took a handsome suite of rooms paid for them in advance on the spot and then half frightened walked out of them to ramble vaguely through the city in the feverish hope of meeting his old partner at night his inquietude increased he could not face the long row of tables in the pillared diningroom filled with smartly dressed men and women he evaded his bedroom with its brocaded satin chairs and its gilt bedstead and fled to his modest lodgings at the good cheer house and appeased his hunger at its cheap restaurant in the company of retired miners and freshly arrived eastern emigrants two or three days passed thus in this quaint double existence three or four times a day he would enter the gorgeous oriental with affected ease and carelessness demand his key from the hotelclerk ask for the letter that did not come go to his room gaze vaguely from his window on the passing crowd below for the partner he could not find and then return to the good cheer house for rest and sustenance on the fourth day he received a short note from uncle jim it was couched in his usual sanguine but brief and businesslike style he was very sorry but important and profitable business took him out of town but he trusted to return soon and welcome his old partner he was also for the first time jocose and hoped that uncle billy would not see all the sights before he uncle jim returned disappointing as this procrastination was to uncle billy a gleam of hope irradiated it the letter had bridged over that gulf which seemed to yawn between them at the postoffice his old partner had accepted his visit to san francisco without question and had alluded to a renewal of their old intimacy for uncle billy with all his trustful simplicity had been tortured by two harrowing doubts one whether uncle jim in his newfledged smartness as a city mansuch as he saw in the streetswould care for his rough companionship the other whether he uncle billy ought not to tell him at once of his changed fortune but like all weak unreasoning men he clung desperately to a detailhe could not forego his old idea of astounding uncle jim by giving him his share of the strike as his first intimation of it and he doubted with more reason perhaps if jim would see him after he had heard of his good fortune for uncle billy had still a frightened recollection of uncle jims sudden stroke for independence and that rigid punctiliousness which had made him doggedly accept the responsibility of his extravagant stake at euchre  with a view of educating himself for uncle jims company he saw the sights of san franciscoas an overgrown and somewhat stupid child might have seen themwith great curiosity but little contamination or corruption but i think he was chiefly pleased with watching the arrival of the sacramento and stockton steamers at the wharves in the hope of discovering his old partner among the passengers on the gangplank here with his old superstitious tendency and gamblers instinct he would augur great success in his search that day if any one of the passengers bore the least resemblance to uncle jim if a man or woman stepped off first or if he met a single persons questioning eye indeed this got to be the real occupation of the day which he would on no account have omitted and to a certain extent revived each day in his mind the mornings work of their old partnership he would say to himself its time to go and look up jim and put off what he was pleased to think were his pleasures until this act of duty was accomplished  in this singleness of purpose he made very few and no entangling acquaintances nor did he impart to any one the secret of his fortune loyally reserving it for his partners first knowledge to a man of his natural frankness and simplicity this was a great trial and was perhaps a crucial test of his devotion when he gave up his rooms at the orientalas not necessary after his partners absencehe sent a letter with his humble address to the mysterious lockbox of his partner without fear or false shame he would explain it all when they met but he sometimes treated unlucky and returning miners to a dinner and a visit to the gallery of some theatre yet while he had an active sympathy with and understanding of the humblest uncle billy who for many years had done his own and his partners washing scrubbing mending and cooking and saw no degradation in it was somewhat inconsistently irritated by menial functions in men and although he gave extravagantly to waiters and threw a dollar to the crossingsweeper there was always a certain shy avoidance of them in his manner coming from the theatre one night uncle billy was however seriously concerned by one of these crossingsweepers turning hastily before them and being knocked down by a passing carriage the man rose and limped hurriedly away but uncle billy was amazed and still more irritated to hear from his companion that this kind of menial occupation was often profitable and that at some of the principal crossings the sweepers were already rich men  but a few days later brought a more notable event to uncle billy one afternoon in montgomery street he recognized in one of its smartly dressed frequenters a man who had a few years before been a member of cedar camp uncle billys childish delight at this meeting which seemed to bridge over his old partners absence was however only half responded to by the exminer and then somewhat satirically in the fullness of his emotion uncle billy confided to him that he was seeking his old partner jim foster and reticent of his own good fortune spoke glowingly of his partners brilliant expectations but deplored his inability to find him and just now he was away on important business i reckon hes got back said the man dryly i didnt know he had a lockbox at the postoffice but i can give you his other address he lives at the presidio at washerwomans bay he stopped and looked with a satirical smile at uncle billy but the latter familiar with californian miningcamp nomenclature saw nothing strange in it and merely repeated his companions words  youll find him there goodby so long sorry im in a hurry said the exminer and hurried away  uncle billy was too delighted with the prospect of a speedy meeting with uncle jim to resent his former associates supercilious haste or even to wonder why uncle jim had not informed him that he had returned it was not the first time that he had felt how wide was the gulf between himself and these others and the thought drew him closer to his old partner as well as his old idea as it was now possible to surprise him with the draft but as he was going to surprise him in his own boardinghouseprobably a handsome oneuncle billy reflected that he would do so in a certain style  he accordingly went to a livery stable and ordered a landau and pair with a negro coachman seated in it in his best and most illfitting clothes he asked the coachman to take him to the presidio and leaned back in the cushions as they drove through the streets with such an expression of beaming gratification on his goodhumored face that the passersby smiled at the equipage and its extravagant occupant to them it seemed the not unusual sight of the successful miner on a spree to the unsophisticated uncle billy their smiling seemed only a natural and kindly recognition of his happiness and he nodded and smiled back to them with unsuspecting candor and innocent playfulness these yer frisco fellers aint all slouches you bet he added to himself half aloud at the back of the grinning coachman  their way led through wellbuilt streets to the outskirts or rather to that portion of the city which seemed to have been overwhelmed by shifting sanddunes from which halfsubmerged fences and even low houses barely marked the line of highway the resistless tradewinds which had marked this change blew keenly in his face and slightly chilled his ardor at a turn in the road the sea came in sight and sloping towards it the great cemetery of lone mountain with white shafts and marbles that glittered in the sunlight like the sails of ships waiting to be launched down that slope into the eternal ocean uncle billy shuddered what if it had been his fate to seek uncle jim there  dars yar presidio said the negro coachman a few moments later pointing with his whip and dars yar washwomans bay  uncle billy stared a huge quadrangular fort of stone with a flag flying above its battlements stood at a little distance pressed against the rocks as if beating back the encroaching surges between him and the fort but farther inland was a lagoon with a number of dilapidated rudely patched cabins or cottages like stranded driftwood around its shore but there was no mansion no block of houses no street not another habitation or dwelling to be seen  uncle billys first shock of astonishment was succeeded by a feeling of relief he had secretly dreaded a meeting with his old partner in the haunts of fashion whatever was the cause that made uncle jim seek this obscure retirement affected him but slightly he even was thrilled with a vague memory of the old shiftless camp they had both abandoned a certain instincthe knew not why or less still that it might be one of delicacymade him alight before they reached the first house bidding the carriage wait uncle billy entered and was informed by a blowzy irish laundress at a tub that jim foster or arkansaw jim lived at the fourth shanty beyant he was at home for hed shprained his fut uncle billy hurried on stopped before the door of a shanty scarcely less rude than their old cabin and half timidly pushed it open a growling voice from within a figure that rose hurriedly leaning on a stick with an attempt to fly but in the same moment sank back in a chair with an hysterical laughand uncle billy stood in the presence of his old partner but as uncle billy darted forward uncle jim rose again and this time with outstretched hands uncle billy caught them and in one supreme pressure seemed to pour out and transfuse his whole simple soul into his partners there they swayed each other backwards and forwards and sideways by their still clasped hands until uncle billy with a glance at uncle jims bandaged ankle shoved him by sheer force down into his chair  uncle jim was first to speak caught b gosh i mighter known youd be as big a fool as me look you billy fall do you know what youve done youve druv me out er the streets whar i was makin an honest livin by day on three crossins yes he laughed forgivingly

foolishness and my own for it was getting away from you one night after the theatre that i got run into and run over  ye see he went on unconscious of uncle billys paling face and with a naivete though perhaps not a delicacy equal to uncle billys own i had to play roots on you with that lockbox business and these letters because i did not want you to know what i was up to for you mightnt like

gravely but with no suggestion of awkwardness or apology in his manner and thar aint much difference between sweepin a crossin with a broom and raking over tailing with a rake onlywot ye get with a broom you have handed to ye and ye dont have to pick it up and fish it out er the wet rocks and sluicegushin and its a heap less tiring to the back  certingly you bet said uncle billy enthusiastically yet with a certain nervous abstraction  im glad ye say so for yer see i didnt know at first how youd tumble to my doing it until id made my pile and ef i hadnt made it i wouldnt hev set eyes on ye

uncle billy he slipped out of the door and ran like a deer to the waiting carriage thrusting a twentydollar goldpiece into the coachmans hand he said hoarsely i aint wantin that kerridge just now ye ken drive around and hev a private jamboree all by yourself the rest of the afternoon and then come and wait for me at the top o the hill yonder  thus quit of his gorgeous equipage he hurried back to uncle jim grasping his tenthousand dollar draft in his pocket he was nervous he was frightened but he must get rid of the draft and his story and have it over but before he could speak he was unexpectedly stopped by uncle jim  now look yer billy boy said uncle jim i got suthin to say to yeand i might as well clear it off my mind at once and then we can start fair agin now he went on with a half laugh wasnt it enough for me to go on pretendin i was rich and doing a big business and gettin up that lockbox dodge so as ye couldnt find out whar i hung out and what i was doinwasnt it enough for me to go on with all this playactin but you you longlegged or nary cuss must get up and go to lyin and playactin too  me playactin me lyin gasped uncle billy  uncle jim leaned back in his chair and laughed do you think you could fool me do you think i didnt see through your little game o going to that swell oriental jest as if yed made a big strikeand all the while ye wasnt sleepin or eatin there but jest wrastlin yer hash and having a roll down at the good cheer do you think i didnt spy on ye and find that out oh you longeared jackassrabbit  he laughed until the tears came into his eyes and uncle billy laughed too albeit until the laugh on his face became quite fixed and he was fain to bury his head in his handkerchief  and yet said uncle jim with a deep breath gosh i was frightedjest for a minit i thought mebbe you had made a big strikewhen i got your first letterand i made up my mind what id do and then i remembered you was jest that kind of an open sluice that couldnt keep anythin to yourself and youd have been sure to have yelled it out to me the first thing so i waited and i found you out you old sinner he reached forward and dug uncle billy in the ribs  what would you hev done said uncle billy after an hysterical collapse  uncle jims face grew grave again id hevidhev clared out out er frisco out er californy out er ameriky i couldnt have stud it dont think i would hev begrudged ye yer luck no man would have been gladder than me he leaned forward again and laid his hand caressingly upon his partners armdont think id hev wanted to take a penny of itbut ithar i couldnt hev stood up under it to hev had you you that i left behind comin down here rollin in wealth and new partners and friends and arrive upon meand this shantyandhe threw towards the corner of the room a terrible gesture none the less terrible that it was illogical and inconsequent to all that had gone beforeandandthat broom  there was a dead silence in the room with it uncle billy seemed to feel himself again transported to the homely cabin at cedar camp and that fateful night with his partners strange determined face before him as then he even fancied that he heard the roaring of the pines without and did not know that it was the distant sea  but after a minute uncle jim resumed  of course youve made a little raise somehow or you wouldnt be here  yes said uncle billy eagerly yes ive gothe stopped and stammered ive gotafew hundreds  oh oh said uncle jim cheerfully he paused and then added earnestly i say you aint got left over and above your dd foolishness at the oriental as much as five hundred dollars  ive got said uncle billy blushing a little over his first deliberate and affected lie ive got at least five hundred and seventytwo dollars yes he added tentatively gazing anxiously at his partner ive got at least that  je whillikins said uncle jim with a laugh then eagerly look here pard then were on velvet ive got nine hundred put your five with that and i know a little ranch that we can get for twelve hundred thats what ive been savin up forthats my little game no more minin for me its got a shanty twice as big as our old cabin nigh on a hundred acres and two mustangs we can run it with two chinamen and jest make it howl wot yer sayeh he extended his hand  im in said uncle billy radiantly grasping uncle jims but his smile faded and his clear simple brow wrinkled in two lines  happily uncle jim did not notice it now then old pard he said brightly well have a gay old time tonightone of our jamborees ive got some whiskey here and a deck o cards and well have a little game you understand but not for keeps now no siree well play for beans  a sudden light illuminated uncle billys face again but he said with a grim desperation not tonight ive got to go into town that fren o mine expects me to go to the theayter dont ye see but ill be out tomorrow at sunup and well fix up this thing o the ranch  seems to me youre kinder stuck on this fren grunted uncle jim  uncle billys heart bounded at his partners jealousy nobut i must you know he returned with a faint laugh  i sayit aint a her is it said uncle jim  uncle billy achieved a diabolical wink and a creditable blush at his lie  billy  jim  and under cover of this festive gallantry uncle billy escaped he ran through the gathering darkness and toiled up the shifting sands to the top of the hill where he found the carriage waiting  wot said uncle billy in a low confidential tone to the coachman wot do you frisco fellers allow to be the best biggest and riskiest gamblinsaloon here suthin hightoned you know  the negro grinned it was the usual case of the extravagant spendthrift miner though perhaps he had expected a different question and order  dey is de polka de el dorado and de arcade saloon boss he said flicking his whip meditatively most gents from de mines prefer de polka for dey is dancing wid de gals frown in but de real prima facie place for gents who go for buckin agin de tiger and straightout gamblin is de arcade  drive there like thunder said uncle billy leaping into the carriage    true to his word uncle billy was at his partners shanty early the next morning he looked a little tired but happy and had brought a draft with him for five hundred and seventyfive dollars which he explained was the total of his capital uncle jim was overjoyed they would start for napa that very day and conclude the purchase of the ranch uncle jims sprained foot was a sufficient reason for his giving up his present vocation which he could also sell at a small profit his domestic arrangements were very simple there was nothing to take with himthere was everything to leave behind and that afternoon at sunset the two reunited partners were seated on the deck of the napa boat as she swung into the stream  uncle billy was gazing over the railing with a look of abstracted relief towards the golden gate where the sinking sun seemed to be drawing towards him in the ocean a golden stream that was forever pouring from the bay and the threehilled city beside it what uncle billy was thinking of or what the picture suggested to him did not transpire for uncle jim who emboldened by his holiday was luxuriating in an evening paper suddenly uttered a longdrawn whistle and moved closer to his abstracted partner look yer he said pointing to a paragraph he had evidently just read just you listen to this and see if we aint lucky you and me to be jest wot we airtrustin to our own hard workand not thinkin o strikes and fortins jest unbutton yer ears billy while i reel off this yer thing ive jest struck in the paper and see what dd fools some men kin make o themselves and that theer reporter wot wrote itmust hev seed it reely  uncle jim cleared his throat and holding the paper close to his eyes read aloud slowly  a scene of excitement that recalled the palmy days of 49 was witnessed last night at the arcade saloon a stranger who might have belonged to that reckless epoch and who bore every evidence of being a successful pike county miner out on a spree appeared at one of the tables with a negro coachman bearing two heavy bags of gold selecting a farobank as his base of operations he began to bet heavily and with apparent recklessness until his play excited the breathless attention of every one in a few moments he had won a sum variously estimated at from eighty to a hundred thousand dollars a rumor went round the room that it was a concerted attempt to break the bank rather than the drunken freak of a western miner dazzled by some successful strike to this theory the mans careless and indifferent bearing towards his extraordinary gains lent great credence the attempt if such it was however was unsuccessful after winning ten times in succession the luck turned and the unfortunate bucker was cleared out not only of his gains but of his original investment which may be placed roughly at twenty thousand dollars this extraordinary play was witnessed by a crowd of excited players who were less impressed by even the magnitude of the stakes than the perfect sangfroid and recklessness of the player who it is said at the close of the game tossed a twentydollar goldpiece to the banker and smilingly withdrew the man was not recognized by any of the habitues of the place  there said uncle jim as he hurriedly slurred over the french substantive at the close did ye ever see such godforsaken foolishness  uncle billy lifted his abstracted eyes from the current still pouring its unreturning gold into the sinking sun and said with a deprecatory smile never  nor even in the days of prosperity that visited the great wheat ranch of fall and foster did he ever tell his secret to his partner     see yup   i dont suppose that his progenitors ever gave him that name or indeed that it was a name at all but it was currently believed thatas pronounced see upit meant that lifting of the outer angle of the eye common to the mongolian on the other hand i had been told that there was an old chinese custom of affixing some motto or legend or even a sentence from confucius as a sign above their shops and that two or more words which might be merely equivalent to virtue is its own reward or riches are deceitful were believed by the simple californian miner to be the name of the occupant himself howbeit see yup accepted it with the smiling patience of his race and never went by any other if one of the tunnelmen always addressed him as brigadiergeneral judge or commodore it was understood to be only the american fondness for ironic title and was never used except in personal conversation in appearance he looked like any other chinaman wore the ordinary blue cotton blouse and white drawers of the sampan coolie and in spite of the apparent cleanliness and freshness of these garments always exhaled that singular medicated odorhalf opium half gingerwhich we recognized as the common chinese smell  our first interview was characteristic of his patient quality he had done my washing for several months but i had never yet seen him a meeting at last had become necessary to correct his impressions regarding buttonswhich he had seemed to consider as mere excrescences to be removed like superfluous dirt from soiled linen i had expected him to call at my lodgings but he had not yet made his appearance one day during the noontide recess of the little frontier school over which i presided i returned rather early two or three of the smaller boys who were loitering about the schoolyard disappeared with a certain guilty precipitation that i suspected for the moment but which i presently dismissed from my mind i passed through the empty schoolroom to my desk sat down and began to prepare the coming lessons presently i heard a faint sigh looking up to my intense concern i discovered a solitary chinaman whom i had overlooked sitting in a rigid attitude on a bench with his back to the window he caught my eye and smiled sadly but without moving  what are you doing here i asked sternly  me washee shilts me talkee buttons  oh youre see yup are you  allee same john  well come here  i continued my work but he did not move  come here hang it dont you understand  me shabbee comme yea but me no shabbee mellican boy who catchee me allee same you comme yeayou shabbee  indignant but believing that the unfortunate man was still in fear of persecution from the mischievous urchins whom i had evidently just interrupted i put down my pen and went over to him here i discovered to my surprise and mortification that his long pigtail was held hard and fast by the closed window behind him which the young rascals had shut down upon it after having first noiselessly fished it outside with a hook and line i apologized opened the window and released him he did not complain although he must have been fixed in that uncomfortable position for some minutes but plunged at once into the business that brought him there  but why didnt you come to my lodgings i asked  he smiled sadly but intelligently  mishtel bally mr barry my landlord he owce me five dollee fo washee washee he no payee me he say he knock hellee outee me allee time i come for payee so me no come housee me come schoolee shabbee mellican boy no good but not so big as mellican man no can hurtee chinaman so much shabbee  alas i knew that this was mainly true mr james barry was an irishman whose finer religious feelings revolted against paying money to a heathen i could not find it in my heart to say anything to see yup about the buttons indeed i spoke in complimentary terms about the gloss of my shirts and i think i meekly begged him to come again for my washing when i went home i expostulated with mr barry but succeeded only in extracting from him the conviction that i was one of thim black republican fellys that worshiped naygurs i had simply made an enemy of him but i did not know that at the same time i had made a friend of see yup  i became aware of this a few days later by the appearance on my desk of a small pot containing a specimen of camellia japonica in flower i knew the schoolchildren were in the habit of making presents to me in this furtive fashionleaving their own nosegays of wild flowers or perhaps a cluster of roses from their parents gardensbut i also knew that this exotic was too rare to come from them i remembered that see yup had a chinese taste for gardening and a friend another chinaman who kept a large nursery in the adjoining town but my doubts were set at rest by the discovery of a small roll of red ricepaper containing my washingbill fastened to the camellia stalk it was plain that this mingling of business and delicate gratitude was clearly see yups own idea as the finest flower was the topmost one i plucked it for wearing when i found to my astonishment that it was simply wired to the stalk this led me to look at the others which i found also wired more than that they seemed to be an inferior flower and exhaled that cold earthy odor peculiar to the camellia even as i thought to an excess a closer examination resulted in the discovery that with the exception of the first flower i had plucked they were one and all ingeniously constructed of thin slices of potato marvelously cut to imitate the vegetable waxiness and formality of the real flower the work showed an infinite and almost pathetic patience in detail yet strangely incommensurate with the result admirable as it was nevertheless this was also like see yup but whether he had tried to deceive me or whether he only wished me to admire his skill i could not say and as his persecution by my scholars had left a balance of consideration in his favor i sent him a warm note of thanks and said nothing of my discovery  as our acquaintance progressed i became frequently the recipient of other small presents from him a pot of preserves of a quality i could not purchase in shops and whose contents in their crafty gingery dissimulation so defied definition that i never knew whether they were animal vegetable or mineral two or three hideous chinese idols for luckee and a diabolical firework with an irregular spasmodic activity that would sometimes be prolonged until the next morning in return i gave him some apparently hopeless oral lessons in english and certain sentences to be copied which he did with marvelous precision i remember one instance when this peculiar faculty of imitation was disastrous in result in setting him a copy i had blurred a word which i promptly erased and then traced the letters more distinctly over the scratched surface to my surprise see yup triumphantly produced his copy with the erasion itself carefully imitated and in fact much more neatly done than mine  in our confidential intercourse i never seemed to really get nearer to him his sympathy and simplicity appeared like his flowersto be a goodhumored imitation of my own i am satisfied that his particularly soulless laugh was not derived from any amusement he actually felt yet i could not say it was forced in his accurate imitations i fancied he was only trying to evade any responsibility of his own that devolved upon his taskmaster in the attention he displayed when new ideas were presented to him there was a slight condescension as if he were looking down upon them from his three thousand years of history  dont you think the electric telegraph wonderful i asked one day  very good for mellican man he said with his aimless laugh plenty makee him jump  i never could tell whether he had confounded it with electrogalvanism or was only satirizing our american haste and feverishness he was capable of either for that matter we knew that the chinese themselves possessed some means of secretly and quickly communicating with one another any news of good or ill import to their race was quickly disseminated through the settlement before we knew anything about it an innocent basket of clothes from the wash sent up from the riverbank became in some way a library of information a single slip of ricepaper aimlessly fluttering in the dust of the road had the mysterious effect of diverging a whole gang of coolie tramps away from our settlement  when see yup was not subject to the persecutions of the more ignorant and brutal he was always a source of amusement to all and i cannot recall an instance when he was ever taken seriously the miners found diversions even in his alleged frauds and trickeries whether innocent or retaliatory and were fond of relating with great gusto his evasion of the foreign miners tax this was an oppressive measure aimed principally at the chinese who humbly worked the wornout tailings of their christian fellow miners it was stated that see yup knowing the difficultyalready alluded toof identifying any particular chinaman by name conceived the additional idea of confusing recognition by intensifying the monotonous facial expression having paid his tax himself to the collector he at once passed the receipt to his fellows so that the collector found himself confronted in different parts of the settlement with the receipt and the aimless laugh of apparently see yup himself although we all knew that there were a dozen chinamen or more at work at the mines the collector never was able to collect the tax from more than twosee yup and one see yinand so great was their facial resemblance that the unfortunate official for a long time hugged himself with the conviction that he had made see yup pay twice and withheld the money from the government it is very probable that the californians recognition of the sanctity of a joke and his belief that cheating the government was only cheating himself largely accounted for the sympathies of the rest of the miners  but these sympathies were not always unanimous  one evening i strolled into the barroom of the principal saloon which so far as mere upholstery and comfort went was also the principal house in the settlement the first rains had commenced the windows were open for the influence of the southwest trades penetrated even this faroff mountain mining settlement but oddly enough there was a fire in the large central stove around which the miners had collected with their steaming boots elevated on a projecting iron railing that encircled it they were not attracted by the warmth but the stove formed a social pivot for gossip and suggested that mystic circle dear to the gregarious instinct yet they were decidedly a despondent group for some moments the silence was only broken by a gasp a sigh a muttered oath or an impatient change of position there was nothing in the fortunes of the settlement nor in their own individual affairs to suggest this gloom the singular truth was that they were one and all suffering from the pangs of dyspepsia  incongruous as such a complaint might seem to their healthy environmenttheir outdoor life their daily exercise the healing balsam of the mountain air their enforced temperance in diet and the absence of all enervating pleasuresit was nevertheless the incontestable fact whether it was the result of the nervous excitable temperament which had brought them together in this feverish hunt for gold whether it was the quality of the tinned meats or halfcooked provisions they hastily bolted begrudging the time it took to prepare and to consume them whether they too often supplanted their meals by tobacco or whiskey the singular physiological truth remained that these young finely selected adventurers living the lives of the natural aboriginal man and looking the picture of health and strength actually suffered more from indigestion than the pampered dwellers of the cities the quantity of patent medicines bitters pills panaceas and lozenges sold in the settlement almost exceeded the amount of the regular provisions whose effects they were supposed to correct the sufferers eagerly scanned advertisements and placards there were occasional runs on new specifics and general conversation eventually turned into a discussion of their respective merits a certain childlike faith and trust in each new remedy was not the least distressing and pathetic of the symptoms of these grownup bearded men  well gentlemen said cyrus parker glancing around at his fellow sufferers ye kin talk of your patent medicines and ive tackled em all but only the other day i struck suthin that im goin to hang on to you bet  every eye was turned moodily to the speaker but no one said anything  and i didnt get it outer advertisements nor off of circulars i got it outer my head just by solid thinking continued parker  what was it cy said one unsophisticated and inexperienced sufferer  instead of replying parker like a true artist knowing he had the ear of his audience dramatically flashed a question upon them  did you ever hear of a chinaman having dyspepsy  never heard he had sabe enough to hev anything said a scorner  no but did ye insisted parker  well no chorused the group they were evidently struck with the fact  of course you didnt said parker triumphantly cos they aint well gentlemen it didnt seem to me the square thing that a pesky lot o yellowskinned heathens should be built different to a white man and never know the tortur that a christian feels and one day arter dinner when i was just alyin flat down on the bank squirmin and clutching the short grass to keep from yellin who should go by but that pizened see yup with a grin on his face  mellican man plenty playee to him joss after eatin sez he but chinaman smellee punk allee same and no hab got  i knew the slimy cuss was just purtendin he thought i was prayin to my joss but i was that weak i hadnt strenth boys to heave a rock at him yet it gave me an idea  what was it they asked eagerly  i went down to his shop the next day when he was alone and i was feeling mighty bad and i got hold of his pigtail and i allowed id stuff it down his throat if he didnt tell me what he meant then he took a piece of punk and lit it and put it under my nose and darn my skin gentlemen you mighnt believe me but in a minute i felt better and after a whiff or two i was all right  was it powful strong cy asked the inexperienced one  no said parker and thats just whats got me it was a sort o dreamy spicy smell like a hot night but as i couldnt go round mong you boys with a lighted piece o punk in my hand ez if i was settin off fourth of july firecrackers i asked him if he couldnt fix me up suthin in another shape that would be handier to use when i was took bad and id reckon to pay him for it like ez id pay for any other patent medicine so he fixed me up this  he put his hand in his pocket and drew out a small red paper which when opened disclosed a pink powder it was gravely passed around the group  why it smells and tastes like ginger said one  it is only ginger said another scornfully  mebbe it is and mebbe it isnt returned cy parker stoutly mebbe uts only my fancy but if its the sort o stuff to bring on that fancy and that fancy cures me its all the same ive got about two dollars worth o that fancy or that ginger and im going to stick to it you hear me and he carefully put it back in his pocket  at which criticisms and gibes broke forth if he cy parker a white man was going to demean himself by consulting a chinese quack hed better buy up a lot o idols and stand em up around his cabin if he had that sort o confidences with see yup he ought to go to work with him on his cheap tailings and be fumigated all at the same time if hed been smoking an opium pipe instead of smelling punk he ought to be man enough to confess it yet it was noticeable that they were all very anxious to examine the packet again but cy parker was alike indifferent to demand or entreaty  a few days later i saw abe wynford one of the party coming out of see yups washhouse he muttered something in passing about the infamous delay in sending home his washing but did not linger long in conversation the next day i met another miner at the washhouse but he lingered so long on some trifling details that i finally left him there alone with see yup when i called upon poker jack of shasta there was a singular smell of incense in his cabin which he attributed to the very resinous quality of the fir logs he was burning i did not attempt to probe these mysteries by any direct appeal to see yup himself i respected his reticence indeed if i had not i was quite satisfied that he would have lied to me enough that his washhouse was well patronized and he was decidedly getting on  it might have been a month afterwards that dr duchesne was setting a broken bone in the settlement and after the operation was over had strolled into the palmetto saloon he was an old army surgeon much respected and loved in the district although perhaps a little feared for the honest roughness and military precision of his speech after he had exchanged salutations with the miners in his usual hearty fashion and accepted their invitation to drink cy parker with a certain affected carelessness which did not however conceal a singular hesitation in his speech began  ive been wantin to ask ye a question doca sort o darned fool question ye knownothing in the way of consultation dont you see though its kin er in the way o your purfeshun sabe  go on cy said the doctor goodhumoredly this is my dispensary hour  oh it aint anything about symptoms doc and there aint anything the matter with me its only just to ask ye if ye happened to know anything about the medical practice of these yer chinamen  i dont know said the doctor bluntly and i dont know anybody who does  there was a sudden silence in the bar and the doctor putting down his glass continued with slight professional precision  you see the chinese know nothing of anatomy from personal observation autopsies and dissection are against their superstitions which declare the human body sacred and are consequently never practiced  there was a slight movement of inquiring interest among the party and cy parker after a meaning glance at the others went on half aggressively half apologetically  in course they aint surgeons like you doc but that dont keep them from having their own little medicines just as dogs eat grass you know now i want to put it to you as a farminded man if you mean ter say that jest because those old women who sarve out yarbs and spring medicines in families dont know anything of anatomy they aint fit to give us their simple and natral medicines  but the chinese medicines are not simple or natural said the doctor coolly  not simple echoed the party closing round him  i dont mean to say continued the doctor glancing around at their eager excited faces with an appearance of wonder that they are positively noxious unless taken in large quantities for they are not drugs at all but i certainly should not call them simple do you know what they principally are  well no said parker cautiously perhaps not exactly  come a little closer and ill tell you  not only parkers head but the others were bent over the counter dr duchesne uttered a few words in a tone inaudible to the rest of the company there was a profound silence broken at last by abe wynfords voice  ye kin pour me out about three fingers o whiskey barkeep ill take it straight  same to me said the others  the men gulped down their liquor two of them quietly passed out the doctor wiped his lips buttoned his coat and began to draw on his ridinggloves  ive heerd said poker jack of shasta with a faint smile on his white face as he toyed with the last drops of liquor in his glass that the darned fools sometimes smell punk as a medicine eh  yes thats comparatively decent said the doctor reflectively its only sawdust mixed with a little gum and formic acid  formic acid wots that  a very peculiar acid secreted by ants it is supposed to be used by them offensively in warfarejust as the skunk eh  but poker jack of shasta had hurriedly declared that he wanted to speak to a man who was passing and had disappeared the doctor walked to the door mounted his horse and rode away i noticed however that there was a slight smile on his bronzed impassive face this led me to wonder if he was entirely ignorant of the purpose for which he had been questioned and the effect of his information i was confirmed in the belief by the remarkable circumstances that nothing more was said of it the incident seemed to have terminated there and the victims made no attempt to revenge themselves on see yup that they had one and all secretly and unknown to one another patronized him there was no doubt but at the same time as they evidently were not sure that dr duchesne had not hoaxed them in regard to the quality of see yups medicines they knew that an attack on the unfortunate chinaman would in either case reveal their secret and expose them to the ridicule of their brother miners so the matter dropped and see yup remained master of the situation  meantime he was prospering the coolie gang he worked on the river when not engaged in washing clothes were picking over the tailings or refuse of gravel left on abandoned claims by successful miners as there was no more expense attending this than in stonebreaking or ragpicking and the feeding of the coolies which was ridiculously cheap there was no doubt that see yup was reaping a fair weekly return from it but as he sent his receipts to san francisco through coolie managers after the chinese custom and did not use the regular express company there was no way of ascertaining the amount again neither see yup nor his fellow countrymen ever appeared to have any money about them in ruder times and more reckless camps raids were often made by ruffians on their cabins or their traveling gangs but never with any pecuniary result this condition however it seemed was destined to change  one saturday see yup walked into wells fargo  cos express office with a package of golddust which when duly weighed was valued at five hundred dollars it was consigned to a chinese company in san francisco when the clerk handed see yup a receipt he remarked casually  washing seems to pay see yup  washee velly good pay you wantee washee john said see yup eagerly  no no said the clerk with a laugh i was only thinking five hundred dollars would represent the washing of a good many shirts  no leplesent washee shirts at all catchee golddust when washee tailings shabbee  the clerk did shabbee and lifted his eyebrows the next saturday see yup appeared with another package worth about four hundred dollars directed to the same consignee  didnt pan out quite so rich this week eh said the clerk engagingly  no returned see yup impassively next time he payee more  when the third saturday came with the appearance of see yup and four hundred and fifty dollars worth of golddust the clerk felt he was no longer bound to keep the secret he communicated it to others and in twentyfour hours the whole settlement knew that see yups coolie company were taking out an average of four hundred dollars per week from the refuse and tailings of the old abandoned palmetto claim  the astonishment of the settlement was profound in earlier days jealousy and indignation at the success of these degraded heathens might have taken a more active and aggressive shape and it would have fared ill with see yup and his companions but the settlement had become more prosperous and lawabiding there were one or two eastern families and some foreign capital already there and its jealousy and indignation were restricted to severe investigation and legal criticism fortunately for see yup it was an oldestablished mining law that an abandoned claim and its tailings became the property of whoever chose to work it but it was alleged that see yups company had in reality struck a leaddiscovered a hitherto unknown vein or original deposit of gold not worked by the previous company and having failed legally to declare it by preemption and public registry in their foolish desire for secrecy had thus forfeited their right to the property a surveillance of their working however did not establish this theory the gold that see yup had sent away was of the kind that might have been found in the tailings overlooked by the late palmetto owners yet it was a very large yield for mere refuse  them palmetto boys were mighty keerless after theyd made their big strike and got to work on the vein and i reckon they threw a lot of gold away said cy parker who remembered their largehanded recklessness in the flush days ony that we didnt think it was white mans work to rake over another mans leavins we might hev had what them derned chinamen hev dropped into tell ye what boys weve been a little too high and mighty and well hev to climb down  at last the excitement reached its climax and diplomacy was employed to effect what neither intimidation nor espionage could secure under the pretense of desiring to buy out see yups company a select committee of the miners was permitted to examine the property and its workings they found the great bank of stones and gravel representing the castout debris of the old claim occupied by see yup and four or five plodding automatic coolies at the end of two hours the committee returned to the saloon bursting with excitement they spoke under their breath but enough was gathered to satisfy the curious crowd that see yups pile of tailings was rich beyond their expectations the committee had seen with their own eyes gold taken out of the sand and gravel to the amount of twenty dollars in the two short hours of their examination and the work had been performed in the stupidest clumsiest yet patient chinese way what might not white men do with better appointed machinery a syndicate was at once formed see yup was offered twenty thousand dollars if he would sell out and put the syndicate in possession of the claim in twentyfour hours the chinaman received the offer stolidly as he seemed inclined to hesitate i am grieved to say that it was intimated to him that if he declined he might be subject to embarrassing and expensive legal proceedings to prove his property and that companies would be formed to prospect the ground on either side of his heap of tailings see yup at last consented with the proviso that the money should be paid in gold into the hands of a chinese agent in san francisco on the day of the delivery of the claim the syndicate made no opposition to this characteristic precaution of the chinaman it was like them not to travel with money and the implied uncomplimentary suspicion of danger from the community was overlooked see yup departed the day that the syndicate took possession he came to see me before he went i congratulated him upon his good fortune at the same time i was embarrassed by the conviction that he was unfairly forced into a sale of his property at a figure far below its real value  i think differently now  at the end of the week it was said that the new company cleared up about three hundred dollars this was not so much as the community had expected but the syndicate was apparently satisfied and the new machinery was put up at the end of the next week the syndicate were silent as to their returns one of them made a hurried visit to san francisco it was said that he was unable to see either see yup or the agent to whom the money was paid it was also noticed that there was no chinaman remaining in the settlement then the fatal secret was out  the heap of tailings had probably never yielded the see yup company more than twenty dollars a week the ordinary wage of such a company see yup had conceived the brilliant idea of booming it on a borrowed capital of five hundred dollars in golddust which he openly transmitted by express to his confederate and creditor in san francisco who in turn secretly sent it back to see yup by coolie messengers to be again openly transmitted to san francisco the package of golddust was thus passed backwards and forwards between debtor and creditor to the grave edification of the express company and the fatal curiosity of the settlement when the syndicate had gorged the bait thus thrown out see yup on the day the selfinvited committee inspected the claim promptly salted the tailings by conscientiously distributing the golddust over it so deftly that it appeared to be its natural composition and yield  i have only to bid farewell to see yup and close this reminiscence of a misunderstood man by adding the opinion of an eminent jurist in san francisco to whom the facts were submitted so clever was this alleged fraud that it is extremely doubtful if an action would lie against see yup in the premises there being no legal evidence of the salting and none whatever of his actual allegation that the golddust was the ordinary yield of the tailings that implication resting entirely with the committee who examined it under false pretense and who subsequently forced the sale by intimidation     the desborough connections   then it isnt a question of property or next of kin said the consul  lord no said the lady vivaciously why goodness me i reckon old desborough could at any time before he died have bought up or bought out the whole lot of his relatives on this side of the big pond no matter what they were worth no its only a matter of curiosity and just sociableness  the american consul at st kentigorn felt much relieved he had feared it was only the old story of delusive quests for imaginary estates and impossible inheritances which he had confronted so often in nervous waneyed enthusiasts and obstreperous claimants from his own land certainly there was no suggestion of this in the richly dressed and bediamonded matron before him nor in her pretty daughter charming in a paris frock alive with the consciousness of beauty and admiration and yet a little ennuye from gratified indulgence he knew the mother to be the wealthy widow of a new york millionaire that she was traveling for pleasure in europe and a chance meeting with her at dinner a few nights before had led to this halfcapricious halfconfidential appointment at the consulate  no continued mrs desborough mr desborough came to america when a small boy with an uncle who died some years ago mr desborough never seemed to hanker much after his english relatives as long as i knew him but now that i and sadie are over here why we guessed we might look em up and sort of sample em desborough s rather a good name added the lady with a complacency that however had a suggestion of query in it  yes said the consul from the french i fancy  mr desborough was englishvery english corrected the lady  i mean it may be an old norman name said the consul  normans good enough for me said the daughter reflecting well just settle it as norman i never thought about that des  only you may find it called debborough here and spelt so said the consul smiling  miss desborough lifted her pretty shoulders and made a charming grimace then we wont acknowledge em no debborough for me  you might put an advertisement in the papers like the next of kin notice intimating in the regular way that they would hear of something to their advantageas they certainly would continued the consul with a bow it would be such a refreshing change to the kind of thing im accustomed to dont you knowthis idea of one of my countrywomen coming over just to benefit english relatives by jove i wouldnt mind undertaking the whole thing for youits such a novelty he was quite carried away with the idea  but the two ladies were far from participating in this joyous outlook no said mrs desborough promptly that wouldnt do you see she went on with superb frankness that would be just giving ourselves away and saying who we were before we found out what they were like mr desborough was all right in his way but we dont know anything about his folks we aint here on a mission to improve the desboroughs nor to gather in any lost tribes  it was evident that in spite of the humor of the situation and the levity of the ladies there was a characteristic national practicalness about them and the consul with a sigh at last gave the address of one or two responsible experts in genealogical inquiry as he had often done before he felt it was impossible to offer any advice to ladies as thoroughly capable of managing their own affairs as his fair countrywomen yet he was not without some curiosity to know the result of their practical sentimental quest that he should ever hear of them again he doubted he knew that after their first loneliness had worn off in their gregarious gathering at a london hotel they were not likely to consort with their own country people who indeed were apt to fight shy of one another and even to indulge in invidious criticism of one another when admitted in that society to which they were all equally strangers so he took leave of them on their way back to london with the belief that their acquaintance terminated with that brief incident but he was mistaken  in the year following he was spending his autumn vacation at a country house it was an historic house and had always struck him as beingeven in that country of historic seatsa singular example of the vicissitudes of english manorial estates and the mutations of its lords his host in his prime had been recalled from foreign service to unexpectedly succeed to an uncles title and estate that estate however had come into the possession of the uncle only through his marriage with the daughter of an old family whose portraits still looked down from the walls upon the youngest and alien branch there were likenesses effigies memorials and reminiscences of still older families who had occupied it through forfeiture by war or the favoritism of kings and in its stately cloisters and ruined chapel was still felt the dead hand of its evicted religious founders which could not be shaken off  it was this strange individuality that affected all who saw it for however changed were those within its walls whoever were its inheritors or inhabiters scrooby priory never changed nor altered its own character however incongruous or illassorted the portraits that looked from its wallsso ill met that they might have flown at one anothers throats in the long nights when the family were awaythe great house itself was independent of them all the bewigged belaced and befurbelowed of one days gathering the roundheaded steelfronted and primkerchiefed congregation of another day and even the blackcoated barearmed and bareshouldered assemblage of today had no effect on the austerities of the priory modern houses might show the tastes and prepossessions of their dwellers might have caught some passing trick of the hour or have recorded the augmented fortunes or luxuriousness of the owner but scrooby priory never no one had dared even to disturb its outer rigid integrity the breaches of time and siege were left untouched it held its calm indifferent sway over all who passed its lowarched portals and the consul was fain to believe that hea foreign visitorwas no more alien to the house than its present owner  im expecting a very charming compatriot of yours tomorrow said lord beverdale as they drove from the station together you must tell me what to show her  i should think any countrywoman of mine would be quite satisfied with the priory said the consul glancing thoughtfully towards the pile dimly seen through the park  i shouldnt like her to be bored here continued beverdale algy met her at rome where she was occupying a palace with her mothertheyre very rich you know he found she was staying with lady minever at hedham towers and i went over and invited her with a little party shes a miss desborough  the consul gave a slight start and was aware that beverdale was looking at him  perhaps you know her said beverdale  just enough to agree with you that she is charming said the consul i dined with them and saw them at the consulate  oh yes i always forget you are a consul then of course you know all about them i suppose theyre very rich and in society over there said beverdale in a voice that was quite animated  it was on the consuls lips to say that the late mr desborough was an englishman and even to speak playfully of their proposed quest but a sudden instinct withheld him after all perhaps it was only a caprice or idea they had forgottenperhaps who knowsthat they were already ashamed of they had evidently got on in english society if that was their real intent and doubtless miss desborough by this time was quite as content with the chance of becoming related to the earl of beverdale through his son and heir algernon as if they had found a real lord desborough among their own relatives the consul knew that lord beverdale was not a rich man that like most men of old family he was not a slave to class prejudice indeed the consul had seen very few noblemen off the stage or out of the pages of a novel who were so he said with a slight affectation of authority that there was as little doubt of the young ladys wealth as there was of her personal attractions  they were nearing the house through a long avenue of chestnuts whose variegated leaves were already beginning to strew the ground beneath and they could see the vista open upon the mullioned windows of the priory lighted up by the yellow october sunshine in that sunshine stood a tall cleanlimbed young fellow dressed in a shootingsuit whom the consul recognized at once as lord algernon the son of his companion as if to accent the graces of this vision of youth and vigor near him in the shadow an old man had halted hat in hand still holding the rake with which he had been gathering the dead leaves in the avenue his back bent partly with years partly with the obeisance of a servitor there was something so marked in this contrast in this old man standing in the shadow of the fading year himself as dried and withered as the leaves he was raking yet pausing to make his reverence to this passing sunshine of youth and prosperity in the presence of his coming master that the consul as they swept by looked after him with a stirring of pain  rather an old man to be still at work said the consul  beverdale laughed you must not let him hear you say so he considers himself quite as fit as any younger man in the place and by jove though hes nearly eighty im inclined to believe it hes not one of our people however he comes from the village and is taken on at odd times partly to please himself his great aim is to be independent of his childrenhe has a granddaughter who is one of the maids at the prioryand to keep himself out of the workhouse he does not come from these partssomewhere farther north i fancy but hes a tough lot and has a deal of work in him yet  seems to be going a bit stale lately said lord algernon and i think is getting a little queer in his head he has a trick of stopping and staring straight ahead at times when he seems to go off for a minute or two there continued the young man with a light laugh i say hes doing it now they both turned quickly and gazed at the bent figurenot fifty yards awaystanding in exactly the same attitude as before but even as they gazed he slowly lifted his rake and began his monotonous work again  at scrooby priory the consul found that the fame of his fair countrywoman had indeed preceded her and that the other guests were quite as anxious to see miss desborough as he was one of them had already met her in london another knew her as one of the house party at the duke of northforelands where she had been a central figure some of her naive sallies and frank criticisms were repeated with great unction by the gentlemen and with some slight trepidation and a fearful joy by the ladies he was more than ever convinced that mother and daughter had forgotten their lineal desboroughs and he resolved to leave any allusion to it to the young lady herself  she however availed herself of that privilege the evening after her arrival whod have thought of meeting you here she said sweeping her skirts away to make room for him on a sofa its a coons age since i saw younot since you gave us that letter to those genealogical gentlemen in london  the consul hoped that it had proved successful  yes but maw guessed we didnt care to go back to hengist and horsa and when they let loose a lot of debboroughs and daybrooks upon us maw kicked weve got a drawing ten yards long that looks like a sour apple tree with lots of desboroughs hanging up on the branches like last years pippins and i guess about as wormeaten we took that well enough but when it came to giving us a map of straight lines and dashes with names written under them like an old morse telegraph slip struck by lightning then maw and i guessed that it made us tired  you know she went on opening her clear gray eyes on the consul with a characteristic flash of shrewd good sense through her quaint humor we never reckoned where this thing would land us and we found we were paying a hundred pounds not only for the desboroughs but all the people theyd married and their children and childrens children and there were a lot of outsiders wed never heard of nor wanted to hear of maw once thought shed got on the trail of a plantagenet and followed it keen until she found she had been reading the dreadful thing upside down then we concluded we wouldnt take any more stock in the family until it had risen  during this speech the consul could not help noticing that although her attitude was playfully confidential to him her voice really was pitched high enough to reach the ears of smaller groups around her who were not only following her with the intensest admiration but had shamelessly abandoned their own conversation and had even faced towards her was she really posing in her naivete there was a certain mischievous even aggressive consciousness in her pretty eyelids then she suddenly dropped both eyes and voice and said to the consul in a genuine aside i like this sort of thing much better  the consul looked puzzled what sort of thing  why all these swell people dont you see those pictures on the walls this elegant room everything that has come down from the past all ready and settled for you you knowages ago something you havent to pick up for yourself and worry over  but here the consul pointed out that the place itself was not ancestral as regarded the present earl and that even the original title of his predecessors had passed away from it in fact it came into the family by one of those outsiders you deprecate but i dare say youd find the place quite as comfortable with lord beverdale for a host as you would if you had found out he were a cousin he added  better said the young lady frankly  i suppose your mother participates in these preferences said the consul with a smile  no said miss desborough with the same frankness i think maws rather cut up at not finding a desborough she was invited down here but shes rather independent you know so she allowed i could take care of myself while she went off to stay with the old dowager lady mistowe who thinks maw a very proper womanly person i made maw mad by telling her thats just what old lady mistowe would say of her cookfor i cant stand these peoples patronage however i shouldnt wonder if i was invited here as a most original person  but here lord algernon came up to implore her to sing them one of those plantation songs and miss desborough with scarcely a change of voice or manner allowed herself to be led to the piano the consul had little chance to speak with her again but he saw enough that evening to convince him not only that lord algernon was very much in love with her but that the fact had been equally and complacently accepted by the family and guests that her present visit was only an opportunity for a formal engagement was clear to every woman in the housenot excepting i fear even the fair subject of gossip herself yet she seemed so unconcerned and selfcontained that the consul wondered if she really cared for lord algernon and having thus wondered he came to the conclusion that it didnt much matter for the happiness of so practically organized a young lady if she loved him or not  it is highly probable that miss sadie desborough had not even gone so far as to ask herself that question she awoke the next morning with a sense of easy victory and calm satisfaction that had however none of the transports of affection her taste was satisfied by the love of a handsome young fellowa typical englishmanwho if not exactly original or ideal was she felt of an universally accepted hallmarked standard the legitimate outcome of a highly ordered carefully guarded civilization whose repose was the absence of struggle or ambition a man whose regular features were not yet differentiated from the rest of his class by any of those disturbing lines which people call character everything was made ready for her without care or preparation she had not even an ideal to realize or to modify she could slip without any jar or dislocation into this life which was just saved from selfindulgence and sybaritic luxury by certain conventional rules of activity and the occupation of amusement which as obligations of her position even appeared to suggest the novel aspect of a duty she could accept all this without the sense of being an intruder in an unbroken lineagethanks to the consuls account of the beverdales inheritance she already pictured herself as the mistress of this fair domain the custodian of its treasures and traditions and the dispenser of its hospitalities butas she conscientiously believedwithout pride or vanity in her position only an intense and thoughtful appreciation of it nor did she dream of ever displaying it ostentatiously before her less fortunate fellow countrywomen on the contrary she looked forward to their possible criticism of her casting off all transatlantic ties with an uneasy consciousness that was perhaps her nearest approach to patriotism yet again she reasoned that as her father was an englishman she was only returning to her old home as to her mother she had already comforted herself by noticing certain discrepancies in that ladys temperament which led her to believe that she herself alone inherited her fathers naturefor her mother was of course distinctly american so little conscious was she of any possible snobbishness in this belief that in her superb naivete she would have argued the point with the consul and employed a wit and dialect that were purely american  she had slipped out of the priory early that morning that she might enjoy alone unattended and unciceroned the aspect of that vast estate which might be hers for the mere accepting perhaps there was some instinct of delicacy in her avoiding lord algernon that morning not wishing as she herself might have frankly put it to take stock of his inheritance in his presence as she passed into the garden through the low postern door she turned to look along the stretching facade of the main building with the high stained windows of its banquetinghall and the state chamber where a king had slept even in that crisp october air and with the green of its ivied battlements against the gold of the distant wood it seemed to lie in the languid repose of an eternal summer she hurried on down the other terrace into the italian garden a quaint survival of past grandeur passed the great orangery and numerous conservatories making a crystal hamlet in themselvesseeing everywhere the same luxury but it was a luxury that she fancied was redeemed from the vulgarity of ostentation by the long custom of years and generations so unlike the millionaire palaces of her own land and in her enthusiasm she even fancied it was further sanctified by the grim monastic founders who had once been content with bread and pulse in the crumbling and dismantled refectory in the plenitude of her feelings she felt a slight recognition of some beneficent being who had rolled this golden apple at her feet and felt as if she really should like to do good in her sphere  it so chanced that passing through a small gate in the park she saw walking a little ahead of her a young girl whom she at once recognized as a miss amelyn one of the guests of the evening before miss desborough remembered that she played the accompaniment of one or two songs upon the piano and had even executed a long solo during the general conversation without attention from the others and apparently with little irritation to herself subsiding afterwards into an armchair quite on the fringe of other peoples conversation she had been called my dear by one or two dowagers and by her christian name by the earl and had a way of impalpably melting out of sight at times these trifles led miss desborough to conclude that she was some kind of dependent or poor relation here was an opportunity to begin her work of doing good she quickened her pace and overtook miss amelyn  let me walk with you she said graciously  the young english girl smiled assent but looked her surprise at seeing the cynosure of last nights eyes unattended  oh said sadie answering the mute query i didnt want to be shown round by anybody and im not going to bore you with asking to see sights either well just walk together wherever youre going is good enough for me  im going as far as the village said miss amelyn looking down doubtfully at sadies smart french shoesif you care to walk so far  sadie noticed that her companion was more solidly booted and that her straight short skirts although less stylish than her own had a certain character better fitted to the freer outdoor life of the country but she only said however the village will do and gayly took her companions arm  but im afraid youll find it very uninteresting for i am going to visit some poor cottages persisted miss amelyn with a certain timid ingenuousness of manner which however was as distinct as miss desboroughs bolder frankness i promised the rectors daughter to take her place today  and i feel as if i was ready to pour oil and wine to any extent said miss desborough so come along  miss amelyn laughed and yet glanced around her timidly as if she thought that miss desborough ought to have a larger and more important audience then she continued more confidentially and boldly but it isnt at all like slumming you know these poor people here are not very bad and are not at all extraordinary  never mind said sadie hurrying her along after a pause she went on you know the priory very well i guess  i lived there when i was a little girl with my aunt the dowager lady beverdale said miss amelyn when my cousin fred who was the young heir died and the present lord beverdale succeededhe never expected it you know for there were two lives his two elder brothers besides poor freds between but they both diedwe went to live in the dower house  the dower house repeated sadie  yes lady beverdales separate property  but i thought all this propertythe priorycame into the family through her  it didthis was the amelyns place but the oldest son or nearest male heir always succeeds to the property and title  do you mean to say that the present lord beverdale turned that old lady out  miss amelyn looked shocked i mean to say she said gravely lady beverdale would have had to go when her own son became of age had he lived she paused and then said timidly isnt it that way in america  dear no miss desborough had a faint recollection that there was something in the constitution or the declaration of independence against primogeniture no the men havent it all their own way therenot much  miss amelyn looked as if she did not care to discuss this problem after a few moments sadie continued you and lord algernon are pretty old friends i guess  no replied miss amelyn he came once or twice to the priory for the holidays when he was quite a boy at marlboroughfor the family werent very well off and his father was in india he was a very shy boy and of course no one ever thought of him succeeding  miss desborough felt half inclined to be pleased with this and yet half inclined to resent this possible snubbing of her future husband but they were nearing the village and miss amelyn turned the conversation to the object of her visit it was a new villagean unhandsome village for all that it stood near one of the gates of the park it had been given over to some mines that were still worked in its vicinity and to the railway which the uncle of the present earl had resisted but the railway had triumphed and the station for scrooby priory was there there was a grim church of a blackened or weatherbeaten stone on the hill with a few grim amelyns reposing crosslegged in the chancel but the character of the village was as different from the priory as if it were in another county they stopped at the rectory where miss amelyn provided herself with certain doles and gifts which the american girl would have augmented with a fivepound note but for miss amelyns horrified concern as many shillings would do and they would be as grateful she said more they wouldnt understand  then keep it and dole it out as you like said sadie quickly  but i dont think thatthat lord beverdale would quite approve hesitated miss amelyn  the pretty brow of her companion knit and her gray eyes flashed vivaciously what has he to do with it she said pertly besides you say these are not his poor take that fivepound noteorill double it get it changed into sovereigns at the station and hand em round to every man woman and child  miss amelyn hesitated the american girl looked capable of doing what she said perhaps it was a national way of almsgiving she took the note with the mental reservation of making a full confession to the rector and lord beverdale  she was right in saying that the poor of scrooby village were not interesting there was very little squalor or degradation their poverty seemed not a descent but a condition to which they had been born the faces which sadie saw were dulled and apathetic rather than sullen or rebellious they stood up when miss amelyn entered paying her the deference but taking little note of the pretty butterfly who was with her or rather submitting to her frank curiosity with that dull consent of the poor as if they had lost even the sense of privacy or a right to respect it seemed to the american girl that their poverty was more indicated by what they were satisfied with than what she thought they missed it is to be feared that this did not add to sadies sympathy all the beggars she had seen in america wanted all they could get and she felt as if she were confronted with an inferior animal  theres a wonderful old man lives here said miss amelyn as they halted before a stone and thatch cottage quite on the outskirts of the village we cant call him one of our poor for he still works although over eighty and its his pride to keep out of the poorhouse and as he calls it off the hands of his granddaughters but we manage to do something for them and we hope he profits by it one of them is at the priory theyre trying to make a maid of her but her queer accenttheyre from the northis against her with the servants i am afraid we wont see old debs for hes at work again today though the doctor has warned him  debs what a funny name  yes but as many of these people cannot read or write the name is carried by the ear and not always correctly some of the railway navvies who come from the north as he does call him debbers  they were obliged to descend into the cottage which was so low that it seemed to have sunk into the earth until its drooping eaves of thatch mingled with the straw heap beside it debs was not at home but his granddaughter was there who after a preliminary bob continued the stirring of the pot before the fire in tentative silence  i am sorry to find that your grandfather has gone to work again in spite of the doctors orders said miss amelyn  the girl continued to stir the pot and then said without looking up but as if also continuing a train of aggressive thoughts with her occupation eay but es so set oop in issen ee doant take orders from nobbutleastways doctor moinds em now moor nor a floy says ee knaws there nowt wrong wi is eart mout be roighthowsiver sarten sewer is eads a in a muddle toims ee goes off stamrin and starin at nowt as if ee ant a naporth o sense howsiver i be doing my duty by emand eres is porritch when a coomsgin a be sick or maad  what the american understood of the girls speech and manner struck her as having very little sympathy with either her aged relative or her present visitor and there was a certain dogged selfish independence about her that miss desborough half liked and half resented however miss amelyn did not seem to notice it and after leaving a bottle of port for the grandfather she took her leave and led sadie away as they passed into the village a carriage returning to the priory filled with their fellow guests dashed by but was instantly pulled up at a word from lord algernon who leaped from the vehicle hat in hand and implored the fair truant and her companion to join them  were just making a tour around windover hill and back to luncheon he said with a rising color we missed you awfully if we had known you were so keen on good works and so early at it by jove wed have got up a slummin party and all joined  and you havent seen half said lord beverdale from the box miss amelyns too partial to the village theres an old drunken retired poacher somewhere in a hut in crawley woods whom its death to approach except with a large party theres malignant diphtheria over at the south farm eight down with measles at the keepers and an old woman who has been bedridden for years  but miss desborough was adamant though sparkling she thanked him but said she had just seen an old woman who had been lying in bed for twenty years and hadnt spoken the truth once she proposed going outside of lord beverdales own preserves of grainfed poor and starting up her own game she would return in time for luncheonif she could if not she should annex the gruel of the first kind incapable she met  yet actually she was far from displeased at being accidentally discovered by these people while following out her capricious whim of the morning one or two elder ladies who had fought shy of her frocks and her frankness the evening before were quite touched now by this butterfly who was willing to forego the sunlight of society and soil her pretty wings on the haunts of the impoverished with only a single companionof her own sexand smiled approvingly and in her present state of mind remembering her companions timid attitude towards lord beverdales opinions she was not above administering this slight snub to him in her presence  when they had driven away with many regrets miss amelyn was deeply concerned i am afraid she said with timid conscientiousness i have kept you from going with them and you must be bored with what you have seen i know i dont believe you really care one bit for itand you are only doing it to please me  trot out the rest of your show said sadie promptly and well wind up by lunching with the rector  hed be too delighted said miss amelyn with disaster written all over her girlish truthful face butbutyou knowit really wouldnt be quite right to lord beverdale youre his principal guestyou know andtheyd think i had taken you off  well said miss desborough impetuously whats the matter with that innthe red lion we can get a sandwich there i guess im not very hungry  miss amelyn looked horrified for a moment and then laughed but immediately became concerned again no listen to me really now let me finish my round alone youll have ample time if you go now to reach the priory for luncheon do please it would be ever so much better for everybody i feel quite guilty as it is and i suppose i am already in lord beverdales black books  the trouble in the young girls face was unmistakable and as it suited miss desboroughs purpose just as well to show her independence by returning as she had set out alone she consented to go miss amelyn showed her a short cut across the park and they separatedto meet at dinner in this brief fellowship the american girl had kept a certain supremacy and halffascination over the english girl even while she was conscious of an invincible character in miss amelyn entirely different from and superior to her own certainly there was a difference in the two peoples why else this inherited conscientious reverence for lord beverdales position shown by miss amelyn which she an american alive to its practical benefits could not understand would miss amelyn and lord algernon have made a better match the thought irritated her even while she knew that she herself possessed the young mans affections the power to marry him and as she believed kept her own independence in the matter  as she entered the iron gates at the lower end of the park and glanced at the interwoven cipher and crest of the amelyns still above she was conscious that the wind was blowing more chill and that a few clouds had gathered as she walked on down the long winding avenue the sky became overcast and in one of those strange contrasts of the english climate the glory of the whole day went out with the sunshine the woods suddenly became wrinkled and gray the distant hills sombre the very english turf beneath her feet grew brown a mile and a half away through the opening of the trees the west part of the priory looked a crumbling ivyeaten ruin a few drops of rain fell she hurried on suddenly she remembered that the avenue made a long circuit before approaching the house and that its lower end where she was walking was but a fringe of the park consequently there must be a short cut across some fields and farm buildings to the back of the park and the priory she at once diverged to the right presently found a low fence which she clambered over and again found a footpath which led to a stile crossing that she could see the footpath now led directly to the priorynow a grim and austere looking pile in the suddenly dejected landscapeand that it was probably used only by the servants and farmers a gust of wind brought some swift needles of rain to her cheek she could see the sad hills beyond the priory already veiling their faces she gathered her skirts and ran the next field was a long one but beside the further stile was a small clump of trees the only ones between her and the park hurrying on to that shelter she saw that the stile was already occupied by a tall but bent figure holding a long stick in his hand which gave him the appearance against the horizon of the figure of time leaning on his scythe as she came nearer she saw it was indeed an old man half resting on his rake he was very rugged and weatherbeaten and although near the shelter of the trees apparently unmindful of the rain that was falling on his bald head and the limp cap he was holding uselessly in one hand he was staring at her yet apparently unconscious of her presence a sudden instinct came upon herit was debs  she went directly up to him and with that frank common sense which ordinarily distinguished her took his cap from his hand and put it on his head grasped his arm firmly and led him to the shelter of the tree then she wiped the raindrops from his face with her handkerchief shook out her own dress and her wet parasol and propping her companion against the tree said  there mr debs ive heard of people who didnt know enough to come in when it rained but i never met one before  the old man started lifted his hairy sinewy arm bared to the elbow and wiped his bare throat with the dry side of it then a look of intelligencealbeit half aggressivecame into his face wheer beest tha going he asked  something in his voice struck sadie like a vague echo perhaps it was only the queer dialector some resemblance to his granddaughters voice she looked at him a little more closely as she said  to the priory  whaat  she pointed with her parasol to the gray pile in the distance it was possible that this demented peasant didnt even understand english  the hall oh ay suddenly his brows knit ominously as he faced her an wassist tha doin drest oop in this foinery wheer gettist thee that goawn thissen or thy maester nowt even a napron fit for thy wark as maaid at serviss an parson a gettin tha plaace at hall so thoult be high and moity will tha thoult not walk wi maaids but traipse by thissen like a slut in the toondang tha  although it was plain to sadie that the old man in his wandering perception had mistaken her for his granddaughter in service at the priory there was still enough rudeness in his speech for her to have resented it but strange to say there was a kind of authority in it that touched her with an uneasiness and repulsion that was stronger than any other feeling i think you have mistaken me for some one else she said hurriedly yet wondering why she had admitted it and even irritated at the admission i am a stranger here a visitor at the priory i called with miss amelyn at your cottage and saw your other granddaughter thats how i knew your name  the old mans face changed a sad senile smile of hopeless bewilderment crept into his hard mouth he plucked his limp cap from his head and let it hang submissively in his fingers as if it were his sole apology then he tried to straighten himself and said naw offins miss naw offins if tha knaws mea thall knaw im grandfeyther to two galls as moight be tha owern age thall tell ee that old debs

liggen aloane in parsons choorchyard  it was part of her uneasiness that scarcely understanding or indeed feeling any interest in these maundering details she still seemed to have an odd comprehension of his character and some reminiscent knowledge of him as if she were going through the repetition of some unpleasant dream even his wrinkled face was becoming familiar to her some weird attraction was holding her she wanted to get away from it as much as she wanted to analyze it she glanced ostentatiously at the sky prepared to open her parasol and began to edge cautiously away  then tha beant from these pearts he said suddenly  no no she said quickly and emphaticallyno im an american  the old man started and moved towards her eagerly his keen eyes breaking through the film that at times obscured them merrikan tha baist merrikan then tha knaws ma son john ee war nowt but a bairn when brether dick took un to merriky naw now that wor fifty years senniver wroate to his old feytherniver coomed back ee wor tallloike an thea said e feavored mea he stopped threw up his head and with his skinny fingers drew back his long straggling locks from his sunken cheeks and stared in her face the

and burst out madly  let me go how dare you i dont know you or yours im nothing to you or your kin my name is desboroughdo you understanddo you hear me mr debsdesborough  at the word the old mans fingers stiffened like steel around her wrists as he turned upon her a hard invincible face  so thoult call thissen desborough wilt tha let me tell tha then that debs debban debbrook and desborough

ass for all tha bean johns bairn an ass thats what tha beast  with flashing eyes and burning cheeks she made one more supreme effort lifting her arms freeing her wrists and throwing the old man staggering from her then she leaped the stile turned and fled through the rain but before she reached the end of the field she stopped she had freed herselfshe was stronger than hewhat had she to fear he was crazy yes he must be crazy and he had insulted her but he was an old manand god knows what her heart was beating rapidly her breath was hurried but she ran back to the stile  he was not there the field sloped away on either side of it but she could distinguish nothing in the pouring rain above the windswept meadow he must have gone home relieved for a moment she turned and hurried on towards the priory  but at every step she was followed not by the old mans presence but by what he had said to her which she could not shake off as she had shaken off his detaining fingers was it the ravings of insanity or had she stumbled unwittingly upon some secretwas it after all a secret perhaps it was something they all knew or would know later and she had come down here for this for back of her indignation back even of her disbelief in his insanity there was an awful sense of truth the names he had flung out of debs debban and debbrook now flashed upon her as something she had seen before but had not understood until she satisfied herself of this she felt she could not live or breathe she loathed the priory with its austere exclusiveness as it rose before her she wished she had never entered it but it contained that which she must know and know at once she entered the nearest door and ran up the grand staircase her flushed face and disordered appearance were easily accounted for by her exposure to the sudden storm she went to her bedroom sent her maid to another room to prepare a change of dress and sinking down before her travelingdesk groped for a document ah there it wasthe expensive toy that she had played with she hastily ran over its leaves to the page she already remembered and there among the dashes and perpendicular lines she had jested over last night on which she had thought was a collateral branch of the line stood her fathers name and that of richard his uncle with the bracketed note in red ink see debbrook daybrook debbers and debs yes this gaunt halfcrazy overworked peasant content to rake the dead leaves before the rolling chariots of the beverdales was her grandfather that poorly clad girl in the cottage and even the menial in the scullery of this very house that might be hers were her cousins she burst into a laugh and then refolded the document and put it away  at luncheon she was radiant and sparkling her drenched clothes were an excuse for a new and ravishing toilette she had never looked so beautiful before and significant glances were exchanged between some of the guests who believed that the expected proposal had already come but those who were of the carriage party knew otherwise and of lord algernons disappointment lord beverdale contented himself with rallying his fair guest on the becomingness of good works but he continued youre offering a dreadful example to these ladies miss desborough and i know i shall never hereafter be able to content them with any frivolous morning amusement at the priory for myself when i am grown gouty and hideous i know i shall bloom again as a district visitor  yet under this surface sparkle and nervous exaltation sadie never lost consciousness of the gravity of the situation if her sense of humor enabled her to see one side of its grim irony if she experienced a wicked satisfaction in accepting the admiration and easy confidence of the highborn guests knowing that her cousin had assisted in preparing the meal they were eating she had never lost sight of the practical effect of the discovery she had made and she had come to a final resolution she should leave the priory at once and abandon all idea of a matrimonial alliance with its heir inconsistent as this might seem to her selfish worldly nature it was nevertheless in keeping with a certain pride and independence that was in her blood she did not love lord algernon neither did she love her grandfather she was equally willing to sacrifice either or both she knew that neither lord algernon nor his father would make her connections an objection however they might wish to keep the fact a secret or otherwise dispose of them by pensions or emigration but she could not bear to know it herself she never could be happy as the mistress of scrooby priory with that knowledge she did not idealize it as a principle carefully weighing it by her own practical common sense she said to herself that it wouldnt pay the highest independence is often akin to the lowest selfishness she did not dream that the same pride which kept her grandfather from the workhouse and support by his daughters and had even kept him from communicating with his own son now kept her from acknowledging them even for the gift of a title and domain there was only one question before her should she stay long enough to receive the proposal of lord algernon and then decline it why should she not snatch that single feminine joy out of the ashes of her burntup illusion she knew that an opportunity would be offered that afternoon the party were to take tea at broxby hall and lord algernon was to drive her there in his dogcart miss desborough had gone up to her bedroom to put on a warmer cloak and had rung twice or thrice impatiently for her maid  when the girl made her appearance apologetic voluble and excited miss desborough scarcely listened to her excuses until a single word suddenly arrested her attention it was old debs  what are you talking about said sadie pausing in the adjustment of her hat on her brown hair  old debs missthats what they call him an old parkkeeper just found dead in a pool of water in the fields the grandfather of one of the servants here and theres such an excitement in the servants hall the gentlemen all knew it too for i heard lord algernon say that he was looking very queer lately and might have had a fit and lord beverdale has sent word to the coroner and only think the people here are such fools that they darent touch or move the poor man and him lyin there in the rain all the time until the coroner comes  miss desborough had been steadily regarding herself in the glass to see if she had turned pale she had she set her teeth together until the color partly returned but she kept her face away from the maid thatll do she said quietly you can tell me all later i have some important news myself and i may not go out after all i want you to take a note for me she went to her table wrote a line in pencil folded it scribbled an address upon it handed it to the girl and gently pushed her from the room    the consul was lingering on the terrace beside one of the carriages at a little distance a groom was holding the nervous thoroughbred of lord algernons dogcart suddenly he felt a touch on his shoulder and miss desboroughs maid put a note in his hand it contained only a line   please come and see me in the library but without making any fuss about itat once s d   the consul glanced around him no one had apparently noticed the incident he slipped back into the house and made his way to the library it was a long gallery at the further end miss desborough stood cloaked veiled and coquettishly hatted she was looking very beautiful and animated i want you to please do me a great favor she said with an adorable smile as your own countrywoman you knowfor the sake of fourth of july and pumpkin pie and the old flag i dont want to go to this circus today i am going to leave here tonight i am honest injin i want you to manage it i want you to say that as consul youve received important news for me the death of some relative if you like or better something affecting my property you know with a little satirical laugh i guess that would fetch em so go at once  but really miss desborough do let us talk this over before you decide implored the bewildered consul think what a disappointment to your host and these ladies lord algernon expects to drive you there he is already waiting the party was got up for you miss desborough made a slight grimace i mean you ought to sacrifice somethingbut i trust there is really nothing seriousto them  if you do not speak to them i will said miss desborough firmly if you say what i tell you it will come the more plausibly from you come my mind is made up one of us must break the news shall it be you or i she drew her cloak over her shoulders and made a step forwards  the consul saw she was determined then wait here till i return but keep yourself out of sight he said and hurried away between the library and the terrace he conceived a plan his perplexity lent him a seriousness which befitted the gravity of the news he had to disclose i am sorry to have to tell you he said taking lord beverdale aside that i was the unlucky bearer of some sad news to miss desborough this morning through my consular letterssome matter concerning the death of a relation of hers and some wearisome question of property i thought that it was of little importance and that she would not take it seriously but i find i was mistaken it may even oblige her to catch the london train tonight i promised to make her excuses to you for the present and im afraid i must add my own to them as she wishes me to stay and advise her in this matter which requires some prompt action  miss desborough was right the magic word property changed the slight annoyance on the earls face to a sympathetic concern dear me i trust it is nothing really serious he said of course you will advise her and by the way if my solicitor withers wholl be here tomorrow can do anything you know call him in i hope shell be able to see me later it could not be a near relation who died i fancy she has no brothers or sisters i understand  a cousin i think an old friend said the consul hastily he heard lord beverdale say a few words to his companions saw with a tinge of remorse a cloud settle upon lord algernons fresh face as he appealed in a whisper to old lady mesthyn who leaned forward from the carriage and said if the dear child thought i could be of any service i should only be too glad to stay with her  i knew she would appreciate lady mesthyns sympathy said the ingenious consul quickly but i really think the question is more a business oneand  ah yes said the old lady shaking her head its dreadful of course but we must all think of that  as the carriage drove away the consul hurried back a little viciously to his fair countrywoman there he said i have done it if i have managed to convey either the idea that you are a penniless orphan or that i have official information that you are suspected of a dynamite conspiracy dont blame me and now he said as i have excused myself on the ground that i must devote myself to this dreadful business of yours perhaps youll tell me what it really is  not a word more said miss desborough except she addedchecking her smile with a weary gestureexcept that i want to leave this dreadful place at once there dont ask me any more  there could be no doubt of the girls sincerity nor was it the extravagant caprice of a petted idol what had happened he might have believed in a lovers quarrel but he knew that she and lord algernon could have had no private interview that evening he must perforce accept her silence yet he could not help saying  you seemed to like the place so much last night i say you havent seen the priory ghost have you  the priory ghost she said quickly whats that  the old monk who passes through the cloisters with the sacred oil the bell and the smell of incense whenever any one is to die here by jove it would have been a good story to tell instead of this cockandbull one about your property and there was a death here today youd have added the sibyls gifts to your other charms  tell me about that old man she said looking past him out of the window i was at his cottage this morning but no first let us go out you can take me for a walk if you like you see i am all ready and im just stifling here  they descended to the terrace together where would you like to go he asked  to the village i may want to telegraph you know  they turned into the avenue but miss desborough stopped  is there not a shorter cut across the fields she asked over there  there is said the consul  they both turned into the footpath which led to the farm and stile after a pause she said did you ever talk with that poor old man  no  then you dont know if he really was crazy as they think  no but they may have thought an old mans forgetfulness of present things and his habit of communing with the past was insanity for all that he was a plucky independent old fellow with a grim purpose that was certainly rational  i suppose in his independence he would not have taken favors from these people or anybody  i should think not  dont you think it was just horridtheir leaving him alone in the rain when he might have been only in a fit  the doctor says he died suddenly of heart disease said the consul it might have happened at any moment and without warning  ah that was the coroners verdict then said miss desborough quickly  the coroner did not think it necessary to have any inquest after lord beverdales statement it wouldnt have been very joyous for the priory party and i dare say he thought it might not be very cheerful for you  how very kind said the young girl with a quick laugh but do you know that its about the only thing human original and striking that has happened in this place since ive been here and so unexpected considering how comfortably everything is ordered here beforehand  yet you seemed to like that kind of thing very well last evening said the consul mischievously  that was last night retorted miss desborough and you know the line colors seen by candlelight do not look the same by day but im going to be very consistent today for i intend to go over to that poor mans cottage again and see if i can be of any service will you go with me  certainly said the consul mystified by his companions extraordinary conduct yet apparent coolness of purpose and hoping for some further explanation was she only an inexperienced flirt who had found herself on the point of a serious entanglement she had not contemplated yet even then he knew she was clever enough to extricate herself in some other way than this abrupt and brutal tearing through the meshes or was it possible that she really had any intelligence affecting her property he reflected that he knew very little of the desboroughs but on the other hand he knew that beverdale knew them much better and was a prudent man he had no right to demand her confidence as a reward for his secrecy he must wait her pleasure perhaps she would still explain women seldom could resist the triumph of telling the secret that puzzled others  when they reached the village she halted before the low roof of debss cottage i had better go in first she said you can come in later and in the meantime you might go to the station for me and find out the exact time that the express train leaves for the north  but said the astonished consul i thought you were going to london  no said miss desborough quietly i am going to join some friends at harrogate  but that train goes much earlier than the train south andand im afraid lord beverdale will not have returned so soon  how sad said miss desborough with a faint smile but we must bear up under it andill write him i will be here until you return  she turned away and entered the cottage the granddaughter she had already seen and her sister the servant at the priory were both chatting comfortably but ceased as she entered and both rose with awkward respect there was little to suggest that the body of their grandfather already in a rough oak shell was lying upon trestles beside them  you have carried out my orders i see said miss desborough laying down her parasol  ay miss but it was main haard gettin et dooan so soon and et cooast  never mind the cost ive given you money enough i think and if i havent i guess i can give you more  ay miss abbut the pason ead gi un a funeral for nowt  but i understood you to say said miss desborough with an impatient flash of eye that your grandfather wished to be buried with his kindred in the north  ay miss said the girl apologetically an naw ees savit th munny abbut ed bean tickled ad ee knowed it dear dear ee niver thowt et ud be gien by stranger an not es ownt fammaly  for all that you neednt tell anybody it was given by me said miss desborough and youll be sure to be ready to take the train this afternoonwithout delay there was a certain peremptoriness in her voice very unlike miss amelyns yet apparently much more effective with the granddaughter  ay miss then if thall excoose mea ill go streight to oory oop sexten  she bustled away now said miss desborough turning to the other girl i shall take the same train and will probably see you on the platform at york to give my final directions thats all go and see if the gentleman who came with me has returned from the station  the girl obeyed left entirely alone miss desborough glanced around the room and then went quietly up to the unlidded coffin the repose of death had softened the hard lines of the old mans mouth and brow into a resemblance she now more than ever understood she had stood thus only a few years before looking at the same face in a gorgeously inlaid mahogany casket smothered amidst costly flowers and surrounded by friends attired in all the luxurious trappings of woe yet it was the same face that was now rigidly upturned to the bare thatch and rafters of that crumbling cottage herself its only companion she lifted her delicate veil with both hands and stooping down kissed the hard cold forehead without a tremor then she dropped her veil again over her dry eyes readjusted it in the little cheap blackframed mirror that hung against the wall and opened the door as the granddaughter returned the gentleman was just coming from the station  remember to look out for me at york said miss desborough extending her gloved hand goodby till then the young girl respectfully touched the ends of miss desboroughs fingers dropped a curtsy and miss desborough rejoined the consul  you have barely time to return to the priory and see to your luggage said the consul if you must go but let me hope that you have changed your mind  i have not changed my mind said miss desborough quietly and my baggage is already packed after a pause she said thoughtfully ive been wondering  what said the consul eagerly  ive been wondering if people brought up to speak in a certain dialect where certain words have their own significance and color and are part of their own lives and experienceif even when they understand another dialect they really feel any sympathy with it or the person who speaks it  apropos ofasked the consul  these people ive just left i dont think i quite felt with them and i guess they didnt feel with me  but said the consul laughingly you know that we americans speak with a decided dialect of our own and attach the same occult meaning to it yet upon my word i think that lord beverdaleor shall i say lord algernonwould not only understand that american word guess as you mean it but would perfectly sympathize with you  miss desboroughs eyes sparkled even through her veil as she glanced at her companion and said i guess not  as the tea party had not yet returned it fell to the consul to accompany miss desborough and her maid to the station but here he was startled to find a collection of villagers upon the platform gathered round two young women in mourning and an ominouslooking box he mingled for a moment with the crowd and then returned to miss desboroughs side  really he said with a concern that was scarcely assumed i ought not to let you go the omens are most disastrous you came here to a death you are going away with a funeral  then its high time i took myself off said the lady lightly  unless like the ghostly monk you came here on a mission and have fulfilled it  perhaps i have goodby    in spite of the bright and characteristic letter which miss desborough left for her hosta letter which mingled her peculiar shrewd sense with her humorous extravagance of expressionthe consul spent a somewhat uneasy evening under the fire of questions that assailed him in reference to the fair deserter but he kept loyal faith with her adhering even to the letter of her instructions and only once was goaded into more active mendacity the conversation had turned upon debs and the consul had remarked on the singularity of the name a guest from the north observed however that the name was undoubtedly a contraction possibly it might have been debborough or even the same name as our fair friend  but didnt miss desborough tell you last night that she had been hunting up her people with a family tree or something like that said lord algernon eagerly i just caught a word here and there for you were both laughing  the consul smiled blandly you may well say so for it was all the most delightful piece of pure invention and utter extravagance it would have amused her still more if she had thought you were listening and took it seriously  of course i see said the young fellow with a laugh and a slight rise of color i knew she was taking some kind of a rise out of you and that remark reminded me of it  nevertheless within a year lord algernon was happily married to the daughter of a south african millionaire whose bridal offerings alone touched the sum of half a million it was also said that the mother was impossible and the father unspeakable the relations inextinguishable but the wedding was an occasion and in the succeeding year of festivity it is presumed that the names of debs and desborough were alike forgotten  but they existed still in a little hamlet near the edge of a bleak northern moor where they were singularly exalted on a soaring shaft of pure marble above the submerged and mossgrown tombstones of a simple country churchyard so great was the contrast between the modern and pretentious monument and the graves of the humbler forefathers of the village that even the americans who chanced to visit it were shocked at what they believed was the ostentatious and vulgar pride of one of their own countrywomen for on its pedestal was inscribed                         sacred to the memory                                of                        john debs desborough                      formerly of this parish              who departed this life october 20th 1892                         at scrooby priory                    at the age of eightytwo years            this monument was erected as a loving testimony                        by his granddaughter                sadie desborough of new york u s a                     and evening brings us home     salomy janes kiss   only one shot had been fired it had gone wide of its markthe ringleader of the vigilantesand had left red pete who had fired it covered by their rifles and at their mercy for his hand had been cramped by hard riding and his eye distracted by their sudden onset and so the inevitable end had come he submitted sullenly to his captors his companion fugitive and horsethief gave up the protracted struggle with a feeling not unlike relief even the hot and revengeful victors were content they had taken their men alive at any time during the long chase they could have brought them down by a rifle shot but it would have been unsportsmanlike and have ended in a free fight instead of an example and for the matter of that their doom was already sealed their end by a rope and a tree although not sanctified by law would have at least the deliberation of justice it was the tribute paid by the vigilantes to that order which they had themselves disregarded in the pursuit and capture yet this strange logic of the frontier sufficed them and gave a certain dignity to the climax  ef youve got anything to say to your folks say it now and say it quick said the ringleader  red pete glanced around him he had been run to earth at his own cabin in the clearing whence a few relations and friends mostly women and children noncombatants had outflowed gazing vacantly at the twenty vigilantes who surrounded them all were accustomed to scenes of violence bloodfeud chase and hardship it was only the suddenness of the onset and its quick result that had surprised them they looked on with dazed curiosity and some disappointment there had been no fight to speak ofno spectacle a boy nephew of red pete got upon the rainbarrel to view the proceedings more comfortably a tall handsome lazy kentucky girl a visiting neighbor leaned against the doorpost

captors  the ringleader repeated his challenge red pete gave a reckless laugh and looked at his wife  at which mrs red pete came forward it seemed that she had much to say incoherently furiously vindictively to the ringleader his soul would roast in hell for that days work he called himself a man skunkin in the open and afraid to show himself except with a crowd of other kiyis around a house of women and children heaping insult upon insult inveighing against his low blood his ancestors his dubious origin she at last flung out a wild taunt of his invalid wife the insult of a woman to a woman until his white face grew rigid and only that westernamerican fetich of the sanctity of sex kept his twitching fingers from the lock of his rifle even her husband noticed it and with a halfauthoritative let up on that old gal and a pat of his freed left hand on her back took his last parting the ringleader still white under the lash of the womans tongue turned abruptly to the second captive and if youve got anybody to say goodby to nows your chance  the man looked up nobody stirred or spoke he was a stranger there being a chance confederate picked up by red pete and known to no one still young but an outlaw from his abandoned boyhood of which father and mother were only a forgotten dream he loved horses and stole them fully accepting the frontier penalty of life for the interference with that animal on which a mans life so often depended but he understood the good points of a horse as was shown by the ones he bestrodeuntil a few days before the property of judge boompointer this was his sole distinction  the unexpected question stirred him for a moment out of the attitude of reckless indifference for attitude it was and a part of his profession but it may have touched him that at that moment he was less than his companion and his virago wife however he only shook his head as he did so his eye casually fell on the handsome girl by the doorpost who was looking at him the ringleader too may have been touched by his complete loneliness for he hesitated at the same moment he saw that the girl was looking at his friendless captive  a grotesque idea struck him  salomy jane ye might do worse than come yere and say goodby to a dying man and him a stranger he said  there seemed to be a subtle stroke of poetry and irony in this that equally struck the apathetic crowd it was well known that salomy jane clay thought no small potatoes of herself and always held off the local swain with a lazy nymphlike scorn nevertheless she slowly disengaged herself from the doorpost and to everybodys astonishment lounged with languid grace and outstretched hand towards the prisoner the color came into the gray reckless mask which the doomed man wore as her right hand grasped his left just loosed by his captors then she paused her shy fawnlike eyes grew bold and fixed themselves upon him she took the chewinggum from her mouth wiped her red lips with the back of her hand by a sudden lithe spring placed her foot on his stirrup and bounding to the saddle threw her arms about his neck and pressed a kiss upon his lips  they remained thus for a hushed momentthe man on the threshold of death the young woman in the fullness of youth and beautylinked together then the crowd laughed in the audacious effrontery of the girls act the ultimate fate of the two men was forgotten she slipped languidly to the ground she was the focus of all eyesshe only the ringleader saw it and his opportunity he shouted times upforward urged his horse beside his captives and the next moment the whole cavalcade was sweeping over the clearing into the darkening woods  their destination was sawyers crossing the headquarters of the committee where the council was still sitting and where both culprits were to expiate the offense of which that council had already found them guilty they rode in great and breathless hastea haste in which strangely enough even the captives seemed to join that haste possibly prevented them from noticing the singular change which had taken place in the second captive since the episode of the kiss his high color remained as if it had burned through his mask of indifference his eyes were quick alert and keen his mouth half open as if the girls kiss still lingered there and that haste had made them careless for the horse of the man who led him slipped in a gopherhole rolled over unseated his rider and even dragged the bound and helpless second captive from judge boompointers favorite mare in an instant they were all on their feet again but in that supreme moment the second captive felt the cords which bound his arms had slipped to his wrists by keeping his elbows to his sides and obliging the others to help him mount it escaped their notice by riding close to his captors and keeping in the crush of the throng he further concealed the accident slowly working his hands downwards out of his bonds  their way lay through a sylvan wilderness midleg deep in ferns whose tall fronds brushed their horses sides in their furious gallop and concealed the flapping of the captives loosened cords the peaceful vista more suggestive of the offerings of nymph and shepherd than of human sacrifice was in a strange contrast to this whirlwind rush of stern armed men the westering sun pierced the subdued light and the tremor of leaves with yellow lances birds started into song on blue and dovelike wings and on either side of the trail of this vengeful storm could be heard the murmur of hidden and tranquil waters in a few moments they would be on the open ridge whence sloped the common turnpike to sawyers a mile away it was the custom of returning cavalcades to take this hill at headlong speed with shouts and cries that heralded their coming they withheld the latter that day as inconsistent with their dignity but emerging from the wood swept silently like an avalanche down the slope they were well under way looking only to their horses when the second captive slipped his right arm from the bonds and succeeded in grasping the reins that lay trailing on the horses neck a sudden vaquero jerk which the welltrained animal understood threw him on his haunches with his forelegs firmly planted on the slope the rest of the cavalcade swept on the man who was leading the captives horse by the riata thinking only of another accident dropped the line to save himself from being dragged backwards from his horse the captive wheeled and the next moment was galloping furiously up the slope  it was the work of a moment a trained horse and an experienced hand the cavalcade had covered nearly fifty yards before they could pull up the freed captive had covered half that distance uphill the road was so narrow that only two shots could be fired and these broke dust two yards ahead of the fugitive they had not dared to fire low the horse was the more valuable animal the fugitive knew this in his extremity also and would have gladly taken a shot in his own leg to spare that of his horse five men were detached to recapture or kill him the latter seemed inevitable but he had calculated his chances before they could reload he had reached the woods again winding in and out between the pillared tree trunks he offered no mark they knew his horse was superior to their own at the end of two hours they returned for he had disappeared without track or trail the end was briefly told in the sierra record  red pete the notorious horsethief who had so long eluded justice was captured and hung by the sawyers crossing vigilantes last week his confederate unfortunately escaped on a valuable horse belonging to judge boompointer the judge had refused one thousand dollars for the horse only a week before as the thief who is still at large would find it difficult to dispose of so valuable an animal without detection the chances are against either of them turning up again    salomy jane watched the cavalcade until it had disappeared then she became aware that her brief popularity had passed mrs red pete in stormy hysterics had included her in a sweeping denunciation of the whole universe possibly for simulating an emotion in which she herself was deficient the other women hated her for her momentary exaltation above them only the children still admired her as one who had undoubtedly canoodled with a man agoing to be hunga daring flight beyond their wildest ambition salomy jane accepted the change with charming unconcern she put on her yellow nankeen sunbonneta hideous affair that would have ruined any other woman but which only enhanced the piquancy of her fresh brunette skintied the strings letting the blueblack braids escape below its frilled curtain behind jumped on her mustang with a casual display of agile ankles in shapely white stockings whistled to the hound and waving her hand with a so long sonny to the lately bereft but admiring nephew flapped and fluttered away in her short brown holland gown  her fathers house was four miles distant contrasted with the cabin she had just quitted it was a superior dwelling with a long leanto at the rear which brought the eaves almost to the ground and made it look like a low triangle it had a long barn and cattle sheds for madison clay was a great stockraiser and the owner of a quarter section it had a sittingroom and a parlor organ whose transportation thither had been a marvel of packing these things were supposed to give salomy jane an undue importance but the girls reserve and inaccessibility to local advances were rather the result of a cool lazy temperament and the preoccupation of a large protecting admiration for her father for some years a widower for mr madison clays life had been threatened in one or two feudsit was said not without causeand it is possible that the pathetic spectacle of her father doing his visiting with a shotgun may have touched her closely and somewhat prejudiced her against the neighboring masculinity the thought that cattle horses and quarter section would one day be hers did not disturb her calm as for mr clay he accepted her as housewifely though somewhat interfering and being one of his own womankind therefore not without some degree of merit  wots this yer im hearin of your doins over at red petes honeyfoglin with a horsethief eh said mr clay two days later at breakfast  i reckon you heard about the straight thing then said salomy jane unconcernedly without looking round  what do you kalkilate rube will say to it what are you goin to tell him said mr clay sarcastically  rube or reuben waters was a swain supposed to be favored particularly by mr clay salomy jane looked up  ill tell him that when hes on his way to be hung ill kiss himnot till then said the young lady brightly  this delightful witticism suited the paternal humor and mr clay smiled but nevertheless he frowned a moment afterwards  but this yer hossthief got away arter all and thats a hoss of a different color he said grimly  salomy jane put down her knife and fork this was certainly a new and different phase of the situation she had never thought of it before and strangely enough for the first time she became interested in the man got away she repeated did they let him off  not much said her father briefly slipped his cords and going down the grade pulled up short just like a vaquero agin a lassoed bull almost draggin the man leadin him off his hoss and then skyuted up the grade for that matter on that hoss o judge boompointers he mout have dragged the whole posse of em down on their knees ef he liked sarved em right too instead of stringin him up afore the door or shootin him on sight they must allow to take him down afore the hull committee for an example example be blowed ther s example enough when some stranger comes unbeknownst slap onter a man hanged to a tree and plugged full of holes thats an example and he knows what it means wot more do ye want but then those vigilantes is allus clingin and hangin onter some mere scrap o the law theyre pretendin to despise it makes me sick why when jake myers shot your ole aunt vineys second husband and i laid in wait for jake afterwards in the butternut hollow did i tie him to his hoss and fetch him down to your aunt vineys cabin for an example before i plugged him no in deep disgust no why i just meandered through the wood carelesslike till he comes out and i just rode up to him and i said  but salomy jane had heard her fathers story before even ones dearest relatives are apt to become tiresome in narration i know dad she interrupted but this yer manthis hossthiefdid he get clean away without gettin hurt at all  he did and unless hes fool enough to sell the hoss he kin keep away too so ye see ye cant ladle out purp stuff about a dyin stranger to rube he wont swaller it  all the same dad returned the girl cheerfully i reckon to say it and say more ill tell him that ef he manages to get away too ill marry himthere but ye dont ketch rube takin any such risks in gettin ketched or in gettin away arter  madison clay smiled grimly pushed back his chair rose dropped a perfunctory kiss on his daughters hair and taking his shotgun from the corner departed on a peaceful samaritan mission to a cow who had dropped a calf in the far pasture inclined as he was to reubens wooing from his eligibility as to property he was conscious that he was sadly deficient in certain qualities inherent in the clay family it certainly would be a kind of mesalliance  left to herself salomy jane stared a long while at the coffeepot and then called the two squaws who assisted her in her household duties to clear away the things while she went up to her own room to make her bed here she was confronted with a possible prospect of that proverbial bed she might be making in her willfulness and on which she must lie in the photograph of a somewhat serious young man of refined featuresreuben watersstuck in her windowframe salomy jane smiled over her last witticism regarding him and enjoyed it like your true humorist and then catching sight of her own handsome face in the little mirror smiled again but wasnt it funny about that horsethief getting off after all good lordy fancy reuben hearing he was alive and going round with that kiss of hers set on his lips she laughed again a little more abstractedly and he had returned it like a man holding her tight and almost breathless and he going to be hung the next minute salomy jane had been kissed at other times by force chance or stratagem in a certain ingenuous forfeit game of the locality known as im apinin many had pined for a sweet kiss from salomy jane which she had yielded in a sense of honor and fair play she had never been kissed like this beforeshe would never again and yet the man was alive and behold she could see in the mirror that she was blushing  she should hardly know him again a young man with very bright eyes a flushed and sunburnt cheek a kind of fixed look in the face and no beard no none that she could feel yet he was not at all like reuben not a bit she took reubens picture from the window and laid it on her workbox and to think she did not even know this young mans name that was queer to be kissed by a man whom she might never know of course he knew hers she wondered if he remembered it and her but of course he was so glad to get off with his life that he never thought of anything else yet she did not give more than four or five minutes to these speculations and like a sensible girl thought of something else once again however in opening the closet she found the brown holland gown she had worn on the day before thought it very unbecoming and regretted that she had not worn her best gown on her visit to red petes cottage on such an occasion she really might have been more impressive  when her father came home that night she asked him the news no they had not captured the second horsethief who was still at large judge boompointer talked of invoking the aid of the despised law it remained then to see whether the horsethief was fool enough to try to get rid of the animal red petes body had been delivered to his widow perhaps it would only be neighborly for salomy jane to ride over to the funeral but salomy jane did not take to the suggestion kindly nor yet did she explain to her father that as the other man was still living she did not care to undergo a second disciplining at the widows hands nevertheless she contrasted her situation with that of the widow with a new and singular satisfaction it might have been red pete who had escaped but he had not the grit of the nameless one she had already settled his heroic quality  ye aint harkenin to me salomy  salomy jane started  here im askin ye if yeve see that hound phil larrabee sneaking by yer today  salomy jane had not but she became interested and selfreproachful for she knew that phil larrabee was one of her fathers enemies he wouldnt dare to go by here unless he knew you were out she said quickly  thats what gets me he said scratching his grizzled head ive been kind o thinkin o him all day and one of them chinamen said he saw him at sawyers crossing he was a kind of friend o petes wife thats why i thought yer might find out ef hed been there salomy jane grew more selfreproachful at her fathers selfinterest in her neighborliness but that aint all continued mr clay thar was tracks over the far pasture that warnt mine i followed them and they went round and round the house two or three times ez ef they mout hev bin prowlin and then i lost em in the woods again its just like that sneakin hound larrabee to hev bin lyin in wait for me and afraid to meet a man fair and square in the open  you just lie low dad for a day or two more and let me do a little prowlin said the girl with sympathetic indignation in her dark eyes ef its that skunk ill spot him soon enough and let you know whar hes hiding  youll just stay where ye are salomy said her father decisively this aint no womans workthough i aint sayin you havent got more head for it than some men i know  nevertheless that night after her father had gone to bed salomy jane sat by the open window of the sittingroom in an apparent attitude of languid contemplation but alert and intent of eye and ear it was a fine moonlit night two pines near the door solitary pickets of the serried ranks of distant forest cast long shadows like paths to the cottage and sighed their spiced breath in the windows for there was no frivolity of vine or flower round salomy janes bower the clearing was too recent the life too practical for vanities like these but the moon added a vague elusiveness to everything softened the rigid outlines of the sheds gave shadows to the lidless windows and touched with merciful indirectness the hideous debris of refuse gravel and the gaunt scars of burnt vegetation before the door even salomy jane was affected by it and exhaled something between a sigh and a yawn with the breath of the pines then she suddenly sat upright  her quick ear had caught a faint click click in the direction of the wood her quicker instinct and rustic training enabled her to determine that it was the ring of a horses shoe on flinty ground her knowledge of the locality told her it came from the spot where the trail passed over an outcrop of flint scarcely a quarter of a mile from where she sat and within the clearing it was no errant stock for the foot was shod with iron it was a mounted trespasser by night and boded no good to a man like clay  she rose threw her shawl over her head more for disguise than shelter and passed out of the door a sudden impulse made her seize her fathers shotgun from the corner where it stoodnot that she feared any danger to herself but that it was an excuse she made directly for the wood keeping in the shadow of the pines as long as she could at the fringe she halted whoever was there must pass her before reaching the house  then there seemed to be a suspense of all nature everything was deadly stilleven the moonbeams appeared no longer tremulous soon there was a rustle as of some stealthy animal among the ferns and then a dismounted man stepped into the moonlight it was the horsethiefthe man she had kissed  for a wild moment a strange fancy seized her usually sane intellect and stirred her temperate blood the news they had told her was not true he had been hung and this was his ghost he looked as white and spiritlike in the moonlight dressed in the same clothes as when she saw him last he had evidently seen her approaching and moved quickly to meet her but in his haste he stumbled slightly she reflected suddenly that ghosts did not stumble and a feeling of relief came over her and it was no assassin of her father that had been prowling aroundonly this unhappy fugitive a momentary color came into her cheek her coolness and hardihood returned it was with a tinge of sauciness in her voice that she said  i reckoned you were a ghost  i mout have been he said looking at her fixedly but i reckon id have come back here all the same  its a little riskier comin back alive she said with a levity that died on her lips for a singular nervousness half fear and half expectation was beginning to take the place of her relief of a moment ago then it was you who was prowlin round and makin tracks in the far pasture  yes i came straight here when i got away  she felt his eyes were burning her but did not dare to raise her own why she began hesitated and ended vaguely how did you get here  you helped me  i  yes that kiss you gave me put life into megave me strength to get away i swore to myself id come back and thank you alive or dead  every word he said she could have anticipated so plain the situation seemed to her now and every word he said she knew was the truth yet her cool common sense struggled against it  whats the use of your escaping ef youre comin back here to be ketched again she said pertly  he drew a little nearer to her but seemed to her the more awkward as she resumed her selfpossession his voice too was broken as if by exhaustion as he said catching his breath at intervals  ill tell you you did more for me than you think you made another man o me i never had a man woman or child do to me what you did i never had a friendonly a pal like red pete who picked me up on shares i want to quit this yerwhat im doin i want to begin by doin the square thing to youhe stopped breathed hard and then said brokenly my hoss is over thar staked out i want to give him to you judge boompointer will give you a thousand dollars for him i aint lyin its gods truth i saw it on the handbill agin a tree take him and ill get away afoot take him its the only thing i can do for you and i know it dont half pay for what you did take it your father can get a reward for you if you cant  such were the ethics of this strange locality that neither the man who made the offer nor the girl to whom it was made was struck by anything that seemed illogical or indelicate or at all inconsistent with justice or the horsethiefs real conversion salomy jane nevertheless dissented from another and weaker reason  i dont want your hoss though i reckon dad might but youre just starvin ill get suthin she turned towards the house  say youll take the hoss first he said grasping her hand at the touch she felt herself coloring and struggled expecting perhaps another kiss but he dropped her hand she turned again with a saucy gesture said hol on ill come right back and slipped away the mere shadow of a coy and flying nymph in the moonlight until she reached the house  here she not only procured food and whiskey but added a long dustcoat and hat of her fathers to her burden they would serve as a disguise for him and hide that heroic figure which she thought everybody must now know as she did then she rejoined him breathlessly but he put the food and whiskey aside  listen he said ive turned the hoss into your corral youll find him there in the morning and no one will know but that he got lost and joined the other hosses  then she burst out but youyouwhat will become of you youll be ketched  ill manage to get away he said in a low voice efef  ef what she said tremblingly ef youll put the heart in me againas you did he gasped  she tried to laughto move away she could do neither suddenly he caught her in his arms with a long kiss which she returned again and again then they stood embraced as they had embraced two days before but no longer the same for the cool lazy salomy jane had been transformed into another womana passionate clinging savage perhaps something of her fathers blood had surged within her at that supreme moment the man stood erect and determined  wots your name she whispered quickly it was a womans quickest way of defining her feelings  dart  yer first name  jack  let me go now jack lie low in the woods till tomorrow sunup ill come again  he released her yet she lingered a moment put on those things she said with a sudden happy flash of eyes and teeth and lie close till i come and then she sped away home  but midway up the distance she felt her feet going slower and something at her heartstrings seemed to be pulling her back she stopped turned and glanced to where he had been standing had she seen him then she might have returned but he had disappeared she gave her first sigh and then ran quickly again it must be nearly ten oclock it was not very long to morning  she was within a few steps of her own door when the sleeping woods and silent air appeared to suddenly awake with a sharp crack  she stopped paralyzed another crack followed that echoed over to the far corral she recalled herself instantly and dashed off wildly to the woods again  as she ran she thought of one thing only he had been dogged by one of his old pursuers and attacked but there were two shots and he was unarmed suddenly she remembered that she had left her fathers gun standing against the tree where they were talking thank god she may again have saved him she ran to the tree the gun was gone she ran hither and thither dreading at every step to fall upon his lifeless body a new thought struck her she ran to the corral the horse was not there he must have been able to regain it and escaped after the shots had been fired she drew a long breath of relief but it was caught up in an apprehension of alarm her father awakened from his sleep by the shots was hurriedly approaching her  whats up now salomy jane he demanded excitedly  nothin said the girl with an effort nothin at least that i can find she was usually truthful because fearless and a lie stuck in her throat but she was no longer fearless thinking of him i wasnt abed so i ran out as soon as i heard the shots fired she answered in return to his curious gaze  and youve hid my gun somewhere where it cant be found he said reproachfully ef it was that sneak larrabee and he fired them shots to lure me out he might have potted me without a show a dozen times in the last five minutes  she had not thought since of her fathers enemy it might indeed have been he who had attacked jack but she made a quick point of the suggestion run in dad run in and find the gun youve got no show out here without it she seized him by the shoulders from behind shielding him from the woods and hurried him half expostulating half struggling to the house  but there no gun was to be found it was strange it must have been mislaid in some corner was he sure he had not left it in the barn but no matter now the danger was over the larrabee trick had failed he must go to bed now and in the morning they would make a search together at the same time she had inwardly resolved to rise before him and make another search of the wood and perhapsfearful joy as she recalled her promisefind jack alive and well awaiting her  salomy jane slept little that night nor did her father but towards morning he fell into a tired mans slumber until the sun was well up the horizon far different was it with his daughter she lay with her face to the window her head half lifted to catch every sound from the creaking of the sunwarped shingles above her head to the faroff moan of the rising wind in the pine trees sometimes she fell into a breathless halfecstatic trance living over every moment of the stolen interview feeling the fugitives arm still around her his kisses on her lips hearing his whispered voice in her earsthe birth of her new life this was followed again by a period of agonizing dreadthat he might even then be lying his life ebbing away in the woods with her name on his lips and she resting here inactive until she half started from her bed to go to his succor and this went on until a pale opal glow came into the sky followed by a still paler pink on the summit of the white sierras when she rose and hurriedly began to dress still so sanguine was her hope of meeting him that she lingered yet a moment to select the brown holland skirt and yellow sunbonnet she had worn when she first saw him and she had only seen him twice only twice it would be cruel too cruel not to see him again  she crept softly down the stairs listening to the longdrawn breathing of her father in his bedroom and then by the light of a guttering candle scrawled a note to him begging him not to trust himself out of the house until she returned from her search and leaving the note open on the table swiftly ran out into the growing day  three hours afterwards mr madison clay awoke to the sound of loud knocking at first this forced itself upon his consciousness as his daughters regular morning summons and was responded to by a grunt of recognition and a nestling closer in the blankets then he awoke with a start and a muttered oath remembering the events of last night and his intention to get up early and rolled out of bed becoming aware by this time that the knocking was at the outer door and hearing the shout of a familiar voice he hastily pulled on his boots his jean trousers and fastening a single suspender over his shoulder as he clattered downstairs stood in the lower room the door was open and waiting upon the threshold was his kinsman an old ally in many a bloodfeudbreckenridge clay  you are a cool one mad said the latter in halfadmiring indignation  whats up said the bewildered madison  you ought to be and scootin out o this said breckenridge grimly its all very well to know nothin but here phil larrabees friends hev just picked him up drilled through with slugs and deader nor a crow and now theyre lettin loose larrabees two halfbrothers on you and you must go like a derned fool and leave these yer things behind you in the bresh he went on querulously lifting madison clays dustcoat hat and shotgun from his horse which stood saddled at the door luckily i picked them up in the woods comin here ye aint got more than time to get over the state line and among your folks thar afore theyll be down on you hustle old man what are you gawkin and starin at  madison clay had stared amazed and bewilderedhorrorstricken the incidents of the past night for the first time flashed upon him clearlyhopelessly the shot his finding salomy jane alone in the woods her confusion and anxiety to rid herself of him the disappearance of the shotgun and now this new discovery of the taking of his hat and coat for a disguise she had killed phil larrabee in that disguise after provoking his first harmless shot she his own child salomy jane had disgraced herself by a mans crime had disgraced him by usurping his right and taking a mean advantage by deceit of a foe  gimme that gun he said hoarsely  breckenridge handed him the gun in wonder and slowly gathering suspicion madison examined nipple and muzzle one barrel had been discharged it was true the gun dropped from his hand  look here old man said breckenridge with a darkening face theres bin no foul play here thars bin no hiring of men no deputy to do this job you did it fair and squareyourself  yes by god burst out madison clay in a hoarse voice who says i didnt  reassured yet believing that madison clay had nerved himself for the act by an overdraught of whiskey which had affected his memory breckenridge said curtly then wake up and lite out ef ye want me to stand by you  go to the corral and pick me out a hoss said madison slowly yet not without a certain dignity of manner ive suthin to say to salomy jane afore i go he was holding her scribbled note which he had just discovered in his shaking hand  struck by his kinsmans manner and knowing the dependent relations of father and daughter breckenridge nodded and hurried away left to himself madison clay ran his fingers through his hair and straightened out the paper on which salomy jane had scrawled her note turned it over and wrote on the back   you might have told me you did it and not leave your ole father to find it out how you disgraced yourself and him too by a lowdown underhanded womans trick ive said i done it and took the blame myself and all the sneakiness of it that folks suspect if i get away aliveand i dont care much whichyou neednt foller the house and stock are yours but you aint any longer the daughter of your disgraced father  madison clay   he had scarcely finished the note when with a clatter of hoofs and a led horse breckenridge reappeared at the door elate and triumphant youre in nigger luck mad i found that stole hoss of judge boompointers had got away and strayed among your stock in the corral take him and youre safe he cant be outrun this side of the state line  i aint no hossthief said madison grimly  nobody sez ye are but youd be wussa foolef you didnt take him im testimony that you found him among your hosses ill tell judge boompointer youve got him and ye kin send him back when youre safe the judge will be mighty glad to get him back and call it quits so ef youve writ to salomy jane come  madison clay no longer hesitated salomy jane might return at any momentit would be part of her fool womanishnessand he was in no mood to see her before a third party he laid the note on the table gave a hurried glance around the house which he grimly believed he was leaving forever and striding to the door leaped on the stolen horse and swept away with his kinsman  but that note lay for a week undisturbed on the table in full view of the open door the house was invaded by leaves pine cones birds and squirrels during the hot silent empty days and at night by shy stealthy creatures but never again day or night by any of the clay family it was known in the district that clay had flown across the state line his daughter was believed to have joined him the next day and the house was supposed to be locked up it lay off the main road and few passed that way the starving cattle in the corral at last broke bounds and spread over the woods and one night a stronger blast than usual swept through the house carried the note from the table to the floor where whirled into a crack in the flooring it slowly rotted  but though the sting of her fathers reproach was spared her salomy jane had no need of the letter to know what had happened for as she entered the woods in the dim light of that morning she saw the figure of dart gliding from the shadow of a pine towards her the unaffected cry of joy that rose from her lips died there as she caught sight of his face in the open light  you are hurt she said clutching his arm passionately  no he said but i wouldnt mind that if  youre thinkin i was afeard to come back last night when i heard the shootin but i did come she went on feverishly i ran back here when i heard the two shots but you were gone i went to the corral but your hoss wasnt there and i thought youd got away  i did get away said dart gloomily i killed the man thinkin he was huntin me and forgettin i was disguised he thought i was your father  yes said the girl joyfully he was after dad and youyou killed him she again caught his hand admiringly  but he did not respond possibly there were points of honor which this horsethief felt vaguely with her father listen he said grimly others think it was your father killed him when i did itfor he fired at me firsti ran to the corral again and took my hoss thinkin i might be follered i made a clear circuit of the house and when i found he was the only one and no one was follerin i come back here and took off my disguise then i heard his friends find him in the wood and i know they suspected your father and then another man come through the woods while i was hidin and found the clothes and took them away he stopped and stared at her gloomily  but all this was unintelligible to the girl dad would have got the better of him ef you hadnt she said eagerly so whats the difference  all the same he said gloomily i must take his place  she did not understand but turned her head to her master then youll go back with me and tell him all she said obediently  yes he said  she put her hand in his and they crept out of the wood together she foresaw a thousand difficulties but chiefest of all that he did not love as she did she would not have taken these risks against their happiness  but alas for ethics and heroism as they were issuing from the wood they heard the sound of galloping hoofs and had barely time to hide themselves before madison clay on the stolen horse of judge boompointer swept past them with his kinsman  salomy jane turned to her lover    and here i might as a moral romancer pause leaving the guilty passionate girl eloped with her disreputable lover destined to lifelong shame and misery misunderstood to the last by a criminal fastidious parent but i am confronted by certain facts on which this romance is based a month later a handbill was posted on one of the sentinel pines announcing that the property would be sold by auction to the highest bidder by mrs john dart daughter of madison clay esq and it was sold accordingly still laterby ten yearsthe chronicler of these pages visited a certain stock or breeding farm in the blue grass country famous for the popular racers it has produced he was told that the owner was the best judge of horseflesh in the country small wonder added his informant for they say as a young man out in california he was a horsethief and only saved himself by eloping with some rich farmers daughter but hes a straightout and respectable man now whose word about horses cant be bought and as for his wife shes a beauty to see her at the springs rigged out in the latest fashion youd never think she had ever lived out of new york or wasnt the wife of one of its millionaires     the man and the mountain   he was such a large strong man that when he first set foot in the little parallelogram i called my garden it seemed to shrink to half its size and become preposterous but i noticed at the same time that he was holding in the open palm of his huge hand the roots of a violet with such infinite tenderness and delicacy that i would have engaged him as my gardener on the spot but this could not be as he was already the proud proprietor of a marketgarden and nursery on the outskirts of the suburban californian town where i lived he would however come for two days in the week stock and look after my garden and impart to my urban intellect such horticultural hints as were necessary his name was rutli which i presumed to be german but which my neighbors rendered as rootleigh possibly from some vague connection with his occupation his own knowledge of english was oral and phonetic i have a delightful recollection of a bill of his in which i was charged for fioletz with the vague addition of maine cains subsequent explanation proved it to be many kinds  nevertheless my little garden bourgeoned and blossomed under his large protecting hand i became accustomed to walk around his feet respectfully when they blocked the tiny paths and to expect the total eclipse of that gardenbed on which he worked by his huge bulk for the tiniest and most reluctant rootlet seemed to respond to his caressing paternal touch it was a pretty sight to see his huge fingers tying up some slender stalk to its stick with the smallest thread and he had a reverent way of laying a bulb or seed in the ground and then gently shaping and smoothing a small mound over it which made the little inscription on the stick above more like an affecting epitaph than ever much of this gentleness may have been that apology for his great strength common with large men but his face was distinctly amiable and his very light blue eyes were at times wistful and doglike in their kindliness i was soon to learn however that placability was not entirely his nature  the garden was part of a fifty vara lot of land on which i was simultaneously erecting a house but the garden was finished before the house was through certain circumstances very characteristic of that epoch and civilization i had purchased the spanish title the only legal one to the land which however had been in possession of a squatter but he had been unable to hold that possession against a jumperanother kind of squatter who had entered upon it covertly fenced it in and marked it out in building sites neither having legal rights they could not invoke the law the last man held possession there was no doubt that in due course of litigation and time both these ingenuous gentlemen would have been dispossessed in favor of the real ownermyselfbut that course would be a protracted one following the usual custom of the locality i paid a certain sum to the jumper to yield up peaceably his possession of the land and began to build upon it it might be reasonably supposed that the question was settled but it was not the house was nearly finished when one morning i was called out of my editorial sanctum by a pallid painter looking even more whiteleaded than usual who informed me that my house was in the possession of five armed men the entry had been made peaceably during the painters absence to dinner under a wayside tree when they returned they had found their pots and brushes in the road and an intimation from the windows that their reentrance would be forcibly resisted as a trespass  i honestly believe that rutli was more concerned than myself over this dispossession while he loyally believed that i would get back my property he was dreadfully grieved over the inevitable damage that would be done to the garden during this interval of neglect and carelessness i even think he would have made a truce with my enemies if they would only have let him look after his beloved plants as it was he kept a passing but melancholy surveillance of them and was indeed a better spy of the actions of the intruders than any i could have employed one day to my astonishment he brought me a mossrose bud from a bush which had been trained against a column of the veranda it appeared that he had called from over the fence the attention of one of the men to the neglected condition of the plant and had obtained permission to come in and tie it up the men being merely hirelings of the chief squatter had no personal feeling and i was not therefore surprised to hear that they presently allowed rutli to come in occasionally and look after his precious slips if they had any suspicions of his great strength it was probably offset by his peaceful avocation and his bland childlike face meantime i had begun the usual useless legal proceeding but had also engaged a few rascals of my own to be ready to take advantage of any want of vigilance on the part of my adversaries i never thought of rutli in that connection any more than they had  a few sundays later i was sitting in the little teaarbor of rutlis nursery peacefully smoking with him presently he took his long chinabowled pipe from his mouth and looking at me blandly over his yellow mustache said  you vonts sometimes to go in dot house eh  i said decidedly  mit a revolver and keep dot house dose men out  yes  vell i put you in dot housetoday  sunday  shoost so it is a goot day on der suntay dree men vill out go to valk mit demselluffs and visky trinken two holding up two gigantic fingers apparently only a shade or two smaller than his destined victims stay dere dose i lift de fence over  i hastened to inform him that any violence attempted against the parties while in possession although that possession was illegal would by a fatuity of the law land him in the county jail i said i would not hear of it  but suppose dere vos no fiolence suppose dose men vos villin eh how vos dot for high  i dont understand  so you shall not understand dot is better go away now and dell your men to coom dot house arount at halluff past dree but you coom mit yourselluff alone shoost as if you vos spazieren gehen for a valk by dat fence at dree ven you shall dot front door vide open see go in and dere you vos you vill der rest leef to me  it was in vain that i begged rutli to divulge his plan and pointed out again the danger of his technically breaking the law but he was firm assuring me that i myself would be a witness that no assault would be made i looked into his clear goodhumored eyes and assented i had a burning desire to right my wrongs but i think i also had considerable curiosity  i passed a miserable quarter of an hour after i had warned my partisans and then walked alone slowly down the broad leafy street towards the scene of contest i have a very vivid recollection of my conflicting emotions i did not believe that i would be killed i had no distinct intention of killing any of my adversaries but i had some considerable concern for my loyal friend rutli whom i foresaw might be in some peril from the revolver in my unpracticed hand if i could only avoid shooting him i would be satisfied i remember that the bells were ringing for churcha church of which my enemy the chief squatter was a deacon in good standingand i felt guiltily conscious of my revolver in my hippocket as two or three churchgoers passed me with their hymnbooks in their hands i walked leisurely so as not to attract attention and to appear at the exact time a not very easy task in my youthful excitement at last i reached the front gate with a beating heart there was no one on the high veranda which occupied three sides of the low onestoried house nor in the garden before it but the front door was open i softly passed through the gate darted up the veranda and into the house a single glance around the hall and bare deserted rooms still smelling of paint showed me it was empty and with my pistol in one hand and the other on the lock of the door i stood inside ready to bolt it against any one but rutli but where was he  the sound of laughter and a noise like skylarking came from the rear of the house and the back yard then i suddenly heard rutlis heavy tread on the veranda but it was slow deliberate and so exaggerated in its weight that the whole house seemed to shake with it then from the window i beheld an extraordinary sight it was rutli swaying from side to side but steadily carrying with outstretched arms two of the squatter party his hands tightly grasping their collars yet i believe his touch was as gentle as with the violets his face was preternaturally grave theirs to my intense astonishment while they hung passive from his arms wore that fatuous imbecile smile seen on the faces of those who lend themselves to tricks of acrobats and strong men in the arena he slowly traversed the whole length of one side of the house walked down the steps to the gate and then gravely deposited them outside i heard him say dot vins der pet aint it and immediately after the sharp click of the gatelatch  without understanding a thing that had happened i rightly conceived this was the cue for my appearance with my revolver at the front door as i opened it i still heard the sound of laughter which however instantly stopped at a sentence from rutli which i could not hear there was an oath the momentary apparition of two furious and indignant faces over the fence but these however seemed to be instantly extinguished and put down by the enormous palms of rutli clapped upon their heads there was a pause and then rutli turned around and quietly joined me in the doorway but the gate was not again opened until the arrival of my partisans when the house was clearly in my possession  safe inside with the door bolted i turned eagerly to rutli for an explanation it then appeared that during his occasional visits to the garden he had often been an object of amusement and criticism to the men on account of his size which seemed to them ridiculously inconsistent with his great good humor gentleness and delicacy of touch they had doubted his strength and challenged his powers he had responded once or twice before lifting weights or even carrying one of his critics at arms length for a few steps but he had reserved his final feat for this day and this purpose it was for a bet which they had eagerly accepted secure in their belief in his simplicity the sincerity of his motives in coming there and glad of the opportunity of a little sunday diversion in their security they had not locked the door when they came out and had not noticed that he had opened it this was his simple story his only comment i haf von der pet but i dinks i shall nod gollect der money the two men did not return that afternoon nor did their comrades whether they wisely conceived that a man who was so powerful in play might be terrible in earnest whether they knew that his act in which they had been willing performers had been witnessed by passing citizens who supposed it was skylarking or whether their employer got tired of his expensive occupation i never knew the public believed the latter rutli myself and the two men he had evicted alone kept our secret  from that time rutli and i became firm friends and long after i had no further need of his services in the recaptured house i often found myself in the little teaarbor of his prosperous nursery he was frugal sober and industrious small wonder that in that growing town he waxed rich and presently opened a restaurant in the main street connected with his marketgarden which became famous his relations to me never changed with his changed fortunes he was always the simple marketgardener and florist who had aided my first housekeeping and stood by me in an hour of need of all things regarding himself he was singularly reticent i do not think he had any confidants or intimates even among his own countrymen whom i believed to be german but one day he quite accidentally admitted he was a swiss as a youthful admirer of the race i was delighted and told him so with the enthusiastic addition that i could now quite understand his independence with his devoted adherence to anothers cause he smiled sadly and astonished me by saying that he had not heard from switzerland since he left six years ago he did not want to hear anything he even avoided his countrymen lest he should i was confounded  but i said surely you have a longing to return to your country all swiss have you will go back some day just to breathe the air of your native mountains  i shall go back some days said rutli after i have made mooch mooch money but not for dot air  what for then  for revengeto get efen  surprised and for a moment dismayed as i was i could not help laughing rutli and revenge impossible and to make it the more absurd he was still smoking gently and regarding me with soft complacent eyes so unchanged was his face and manner that he might have told me he was going back to be married  you do not oonderstand he said forgivingly some days i shall dell to you id id is a story you shall make it yourselluff for dose babers dot you write it is not bretty berhaps aint it but it is droo and de endt is not yet  only that rutli never joked except in a ponderous fashion with many involved sentences i should have thought he was taking a goodhumored rise out of me but it was not funny i am afraid i dismissed it from my mind as a revelation of something weak and puerile quite inconsistent with his practical common sense and strong simplicity and wished he had not alluded to it i never asked him to tell me the story it was a year later and only when he had invited me to come to the opening of a new hotel erected by him at a mountain spa of great resort that he himself alluded to it  the hotel was a wonderful affair even for those days and rutlis outlay of capital convinced me that by this time he must have made the mooch money he coveted something of this was in my mind when we sat by the window of his handsomely furnished private office overlooking the pines of a californian canyon i asked him if the scenery was like switzerland  ach no he replied but i vill puild a hotel shoost like dis dare  is that a part of your revenge i asked with a laugh  ah so a bart  i felt relieved a revenge so practical did not seem very malicious or idiotic after a pause he puffed contemplatively at his pipe and then said i dell you somedings of dot story now  he began i should like to tell it in his own particular english mixed with american slang but it would not convey the simplicity of the narrator he was the son of a large family who had lived for centuries in one of the highest villages in the bernese oberland he attained his size and strength early but with a singular distaste to use them in the rough regular work on the farm although he was a great climber and mountaineer and what was at first overlooked as mere boyish fancy had an insatiable love and curious knowledge of plants and flowers he knew the haunts of edelweiss alpine rose and blue gentian and had brought home rare and unknown blossoms from under the icy lips of glaciers but as he did this when his time was supposed to be occupied in looking after the cows in the higher pastures and making cheeses there was trouble in that hardworking practical family a giant with the tastes and disposition of a schoolgirl was an anomaly in a swiss village unfortunately again he was not studious his record in the village school had been on a par with his manual work and the family had not even the consolation of believing that they were fostering a genius in a community where practical industry was the highest virtue it was not strange perhaps that he was called lazy and shiftless no one knew the long climbs and tireless vigils he had undergone in remote solitudes in quest of his favorites or knowing forgave him for it abstemious frugal and patient as he was even the crusts of his fathers table were given him grudgingly he often went hungry rather than ask the bread he had failed to earn how his great frame was nurtured in those days he never knew perhaps the giant mountains recognized some kin in him and fed and strengthened him after their own fashion even his gentleness was confounded with cowardice dot vos de hardtest he said simply it is not goot to be opligit to half crush your brudder ven he would make a laugh of you to your sweetheart the end came sooner than he expected and oddly enough through this sweetheart gottlieb she said to him one day the english fremde who stayed here last night met me when i was carrying some of those beautiful flowers you gave me he asked me where they were to be found and i told him only you knew he wants to see you go to him it may be luck to you rutli went the stranger an english alpine climber of scientific tastes talked with him for an hour at the end of that time to everybodys astonishment he engaged this hopeless idler as his personal guide for three months at the sum of five francs a day it was inconceivable it was unheard of the englander was as mad as gottlieb whose intellect had always been under suspicion the schoolmaster pursed up his lips the pastor shook his head no good could come of it the family looked upon it as another freak of gottliebs but there was one big mouth less to feed and more room in the kitchen and they let him go they parted from him as ungraciously as they had endured his presence  then followed two months of sunshine in rutlis lifeassociation with his beloved plants and the intelligent sympathy and direction of a cultivated man even in altitudes so dangerous that they had to take other and more experienced guides rutli was always at his masters side that savants collection of alpine flora excelled all previous ones he talked freely with rutli of further work in the future and relaxed his english reserve so far as to confide to him that the outcome of their collection and observation might be a book he gave a flower a latin name in which even the ignorant and delighted rutli could distinguish some likeness to his own but the book was never compiled in one of their later and more difficult ascents they and their two additional guides were overtaken by a sudden storm swept from their feet down an icebound slope rutli alone of the ropedtogether party kept a foothold on the treacherous incline here this young titan with bleeding fingers clenched in a rock cleft sustained the struggles and held up the lives of his companions by that precious thread for more than an hour perhaps he might have saved them but in their desperate efforts to regain their footing the rope slipped upon a jagged edge of outcrop and parted as if cut by a knife the two guides passed without an outcry into obscurity and death rutli with a last despairing exertion dragged to his own level his unconscious master crippled by a broken leg  your true hero is apt to tell his tale simply rutli did not dwell upon these details nor need i left alone upon a treacherous ice slope in benumbing cold with a helpless man eight hours afterwards he staggered half blind incoherent and inarticulate into a shelter hut with the dead body of his master in his stiffened arms the shelterkeepers turned their attention to rutli who needed it most blind and delirious with scarce a chance for life he was sent the next day to a hospital where he lay for three months helpless imbecile and unknown the dead body of the englishman was identified and sent home the bodies of the guides were recovered by their friends but no one knew aught of rutli even his name while the event was still fresh in the minds of those who saw him enter the hut with the body of his master a paragraph appeared in a berne journal recording the heroism of this nameless man but it could not be corroborated nor explained by the demented hero and was presently forgotten six months from the day he had left his home he was discharged cured he had not a kreutzer in his pocket he had never drawn his wages from his employer he had preferred to have it in a lump sum that he might astonish his family on his return his eyes were still weak his memory feeble only his great physical strength remained through his long illness a few sympathizing travelers furnished him the means to reach his native village many miles away he found his family had heard of the loss of the englishman and the guides and had believed he was one of them already he was forgotten  ven you vos once peliefed to be

revenge that is what you really intend to do i said half laughing yet with an uneasy recollection of his illness and enfeebled mind  yes look here i show you somedings he opened a drawer of his desk and took out what appeared to be some diagrams plans and a small watercolored map like a surveyors tracing look he said laying his finger on the latter dat is a map from my fillage i hef myselluff made it out from my memory dot pointing to a blank space is der mountain side high up so far it is no goot until i vill a tunnel make or der grade lefel dere vas mine faders house dere vos der church der schoolhouse dot vos de burgomasters house he went on pointing to the respective plots in this old curving parallelogram of the mountain shelf so was the fillage when i leave him on the 5th of march eighteen hundred and feefty now you shall see him shoost as i vill make him ven i go back he took up another plan beautifully drawn and colored and evidently done by a professional hand it was a practical yet almost fairylike transformation of the same spot the narrow mountain shelf was widened by excavation and a boulevard stretched on either side a great hotel not unlike the one in which we sat stood in an open terrace with gardens and fountainsthe site of his fathers house blocks of pretty dwellings shops and cafes filled the intermediate space i laid down the paper  how long have you

see i vill infite you dere first now coom and look der house around    i did not make some moneys but i did go to europe three years after this last interview with rutli i was coming from interlaken to berne by rail i had not heard from him and i had forgotten the name of his village but as i looked up from the paper i was reading i suddenly recognized him in the further end of the same compartment i occupied his recognition of me was evidently as sudden and unexpected after our first handgrasp and greeting i said  and how about our new village  dere is no fillage  what you have given up the idea  yes there is no fillage olt or new  i dont understand  he looked at me a moment you have not heard  no  he gently picked up a little local guidebook that lay in my lap and turning its leaves pointed to a page and read as follows  5 m beyond the train passes a curve r where a fine view of the lake may be seen a little to the r rises the steep slopes of the  the scene of a terrible disaster at three oclock on march 5 1850 the little village of  lying midway of the slope with its population of 950 souls was completely destroyed by a landslip from the top of the mountain so sudden was the catastrophe that not a single escape is recorded a large portion of the mountain crest as will be observed when it is seen in profile descended to the valley burying the unfortunate village to a depth variously estimated at from 1000 ft to 1800 ft the geological causes which produced this extraordinary displacement have been fully discussed but the greater evidence points to the theory of subterranean glaciers 5 m beyond  the train crosses the r bridge  i laid down the guidebook in breathless astonishment  and you never heard of this in all these years  nefer i asked no questions i read no pooks i have no ledders from home  and yet youi stopped i could not call him a fool neither could i in the face of his perfect composure and undisturbed eyes exhibit a concern greater than his own an uneasy recollection of what he confessed had been his mental condition immediately after his accident came over me had he been the victim of a strange hallucination regarding his house and family all these years were these dreams of revenge this fancy of creating a new village only an outcome of some shock arising out of the disaster itself which he had long since forgotten  he was looking from the window coom he said ve are near der blace i vill show id to you he rose and passed out to the rear platform we were in the rear car and a new panorama of the lake and mountains flashed upon us at every curve of the line i followed him presently he pointed to what appeared to be a sheer wall of rock and stunted vegetation towering two or three thousand feet above us which started out of a gorge we were passing dere it vos he said i saw the vast stretch of rock face rising upward and onward but nothing else no debris no ruins nor even a swelling or rounding of the mountain flank over that awful tomb yet stay as we dashed across the gorge and the face of the mountain shifted high up the skyline was slightly broken as if a few inches a mere handful of the crest was crumbled away and thenboth gorge and mountain vanished  i was still embarrassed and uneasy and knew not what to say to this man at my side whose hopes and ambition had been as quickly overthrown and buried and whose lifedream had as quickly vanished but he himself taking his pipe from his lips broke the silence  it vos a narrow esgabe  what was  vy dis dings if i had stayed in my faders house i vould haf been det for goot and perried too somedimes dose dings cooms oudt apout right dont id  unvanquished philosopher as we stood there looking at the flying landscape and sinking lesser hills one by one the great snow peaks slowly arose behind them lifting themselves as if to take a last wondering look at the man they had triumphed over but had not subdued     the passing of enriquez   when enriquez saltillo ran away with miss mannersley as already recorded in these chronicles her relatives and friends found it much easier to forgive that illassorted union than to understand it for after all enriquez was the scion of an old spanishcalifornian family and in due time would have his share of his fathers three square leagues whatever incongruity there was between his lively latin extravagance and miss mannersleys puritan precision and intellectual superiority they had gone to mexico mrs saltillo as was known having an interest in aztec antiquities and he being utterly submissive to her wishes for myself from my knowledge of enriquezs nature i had grave doubts of his entire subjugation although i knew the prevailing opinion was that mrs saltillos superiority would speedily tame him since his brief and characteristic note apprising me of his marriage i had not heard from him it was therefore with some surprise a good deal of reminiscent affection and a slight twinge of reproach that two years after i looked up from some proofs in the sanctum of the daily excelsior to recognize his handwriting on a note that was handed to me by a yellow mexican boy        see the devotion of enriquez in selected stories by      bret harte gutenberg 1312  a single glance at its contents showed me that mrs saltillos correct bostonian speech had not yet subdued enriquezs peculiar spanishamerican slang  here we are againright side up with careat 1110 dupont street telegraph hill second floor from top ring and push no book agents need apply hows your royal nibs i kiss your hand come at sixthe band shall play at sevenand regard your friend mees boston who will tell you about the little old nigger boys and your old uncle ennery  two things struck me enriquez had not changed mrs saltillo had certainly yielded up some of her peculiar prejudices for the address given far from being a fashionable district was known as the spanish quarter which while it still held some old spanish families was chiefly given over to halfcastes and obscurer foreigners even poverty could not have driven mrs saltillo to such a refuge against her will nevertheless a good deal of concern for enriquezs fortune mingled with my curiosity as i impatiently waited for six oclock to satisfy it  it was a breezy climb to 1110 dupont street and although the street had been graded the houses retained their airy elevation and were accessible only by successive flights of wooden steps to the front door which still gave perilously upon the street sixty feet below i now painfully appreciated enriquezs adaptation of the timehonored joke about the second floor an invincible smell of garlic almost took my remaining breath away as the door was opened to me by a swarthy mexican woman whose loose camisa seemed to be slipping from her unstable bust and was held on only by the mantualike shawl which supplemented it gripped by one brown hand dizzy from my ascent to that narrow perch which looked upon nothing but the distant bay and shores of contra costa i felt as apologetic as if i had landed from a balloon but the woman greeted me with a languid spanish smile and a lazy display of white teeth as if my arrival was quite natural don enriquez of a fact was not himself in the casa but was expected on the instant donna urania was at home  donna urania for an instant i had forgotten that mrs saltillos first name was urania so pleasantly and spontaneously did it fall from the spanish lips nor was i displeased at this chance of learning something of don enriquezs fortunes and the saltillo menage before confronting my old friend the servant preceded me to the next floor and opening a door ushered me into the ladys presence  i had carried with me on that upward climb a lively recollection of miss mannersley as i had known her two years before i remembered her upright almost stiff slight figure the graceful precision of her poses the faultless symmetry and taste of her dress and the atmosphere of a fastidious and wholesome cleanliness which exhaled from her in the lady i saw before me half reclining in a rockingchair there was none of the stiffness and nicety habited in a loose gown of some easy flexible but rich material worn with that peculiarly indolent slouch of the mexican woman mrs saltillo had parted with half her individuality even her arched feet and thin ankles the closefitting boots or small slippers of which were wont to accent their delicacy were now lost in a short lowquartered kid shoe of the spanish type in which they moved loosely her hair which she had always worn with a certain greek simplicity was parted at one side yet her face with its regularity of feature and small thin redlipped mouth was quite unchanged and her velvety brown eyes were as beautiful and inscrutable as ever  with the same glance i had taken in her surroundings quite as incongruous to her former habits the furniture though of old and heavy mahogany had suffered from careless alien hands and was interspersed with modern and unmatchable makeshifts yet preserving the distinctly scant and formal attitude of furnished lodgings it was certainly unlike the artistic trifles and delicate refinements of her uncles drawingroom which we all knew her taste had dictated and ruled the black and white engravings the outlined heads of minerva and diana were excluded from the walls for two cheap colored catholic printsa soulless virgin and the mystery of the bleeding heart against the wall in one corner hung the only object which seemed a memento of their travelsa singularlooking upright indian papoosecase or cradle glaringly decorated with beads and paint probably an aztec relic on a round table the velvet cover of which showed marks of usage and abusage there were scattered books and writing materials and my editorial instinct suddenly recognized with a thrill of apprehension the loose leaves of an undoubted manuscript this circumstance taken with the fact of donna uranias hair being parted on one side and the general negligee of her appearance was a disturbing revelation  my wandering eye apparently struck her for after the first greeting she pointed to the manuscript with a smile  yes that is the manuscript i suppose enriquez told you all about it he said he had written  i was dumfounded i certainly had not understood all of enriquezs slang it was always so decidedly his own and peculiar yet i could not recall any allusion to this  he told me something of it but very vaguely i ventured to say deprecatingly but i am afraid that i thought more of seeing my old friend again than of anything else  during our stay in mexico continued mrs saltillo with something of her old precision i made some researches into aztec history a subject always deeply interesting to me and i thought i would utilize the result by throwing it on paper of course it is better fitted for a volume of reference than for a newspaper but enriquez thought you might want to use it for your journal  i knew that enriquez had no taste for literature and had even rather depreciated it in the old days with his usual extravagance but i managed to say very pleasantly that i was delighted with his suggestion and should be glad to read the manuscript after all it was not improbable that mrs saltillo who was educated and intelligent should write well if not popularly then enriquez does not begrudge you the time that your work takes from him i added laughingly you seem to have occupied your honeymoon practically  we quite comprehend our respective duties said mrs saltillo dryly and have from the first we have our own lives to live independent of my uncle and enriquezs father we have not only accepted the responsibility of our own actions but we both feel the higher privilege of creating our own conditions without extraneous aid from our relatives  it struck me that this somewhat exalted statement was decidedly a pose or a return of urania mannersleys old ironical style i looked quietly into her brown nearsighted eyes but as once before my glance seemed to slip from their moist surface without penetrating the inner thought beneath and what does enriquez do for his part i asked smilingly  i fully expected to hear that the energetic enriquez was utilizing his peculiar tastes and experiences by horsebreaking stockraising professional bullfighting or even horseracing but was quite astonished when she answered quietly  enriquez is giving himself up to geology and practical metallurgy with a view to scientific purely scientific mining  enriquez and geology in that instant all i could remember of it were his gibes at the geologian as he was wont to term professor dobbs a former admirer of miss mannersleys to add to my confusion mrs saltillo at the same moment absolutely voiced my thought  you may remember professor dobbs she went on calmly one of the most eminent scientists over here and a very old boston friend he has taken enriquez in hand his progress is most satisfactory we have the greatest hopes of him  and how soon do you both hope to have some practical results of his study i could not help asking a little mischievously for i somehow resented the plural pronoun in her last sentence  very soon said mrs saltillo ignoring everything but the question you know enriquezs sanguine temperament perhaps he is already given to evolving theories without a sufficient basis of fact still he has the daring of a discoverer his ideas of the oolitic formation are not without originality and professor dobbs says that in his conception of the silurian beach there are gleams that are distinctly precious  i looked at mrs saltillo who had reinforced her eyes with her old piquant pincenez but could detect no irony in them she was prettily imperturbable that was all there was an awkward silence then it was broken by a bounding step on the stairs a wideopen fling of the door and enriquez pirouetted into the room enriquez as of old unchanged from the crown of his smooth coalblack hair to the tips of his small narrow arabian feet enriquez with his thin curling mustache his dancing eyes set in his immovable face just as i had always known him  he affected to lapse against the door for a minute as if staggered by a resplendent vision then he said  what do i regard is it a dream or have i again got themthees jimjams my best friend and my besti mean my onlywife embrace me  he gave me an enthusiastic embrace and a wink like sheetlightning passed quickly to his wife before whom he dropped on one knee raised the toe of her slipper to his lips and then sank on the sofa in simulated collapse murmuring thees is too mooch of white stone for one day  through all this i saw his wife regarding him with exactly the same critically amused expression with which she had looked upon him in the days of their strange courtship she evidently had not tired of his extravagance and yet i feel as puzzled by her manner as then she rose and said i suppose you have a good deal to say to each other and i will leave you by yourselves turning to her husband she added i have already spoken about the aztec manuscript  the word brought enriquez to his feet again ah the little old niggeryou have read i began to understand my wife my best friend and the little old nigger all in one day eet is perfect nevertheless in spite of this ecstatic and overpowering combination he hurried to take his wifes hand kissing it he led her to a door opening into another room made her a low bow to the ground as she passed out and then rejoined me  so these are the little old niggers you spoke of in your note i said pointing to the manuscript deuce take me if i understood you  ah my leetle brother it is you who have changed said enriquez dolorously is it that you no more understand american or have the big head of the editor regard me of these aztecs my wife have made study she have pursued the little nigger to his cave his grotto where he is dead a thousand year i have myself assist though i like it not because thees mummy look you pancho is not lively and the mummy who is not dead believe me even the young lady mummy you shall not take to your heart but my wifehe stopped and kissed his hand toward the door whence she had flittedah she is wonderful she has made the story of them the peecture of them from the life and on the instant you shall take them my leetle brother for your journal you shall announce in the big letter mooch importance the aztec he is found how he look and lif the everlasting nigger you shall sell many paper and urania shall have scoop in much spondulics and rocks hoopla foryou comprehendmy wife and i have settled that she shall forgif her oncle i shall forgif my father but from them we take no cent not a red not a scad we are independent of ourselves we make a fourth of july united we stand divided we shall fall over there you are bueno  it was impossible to resist his wild yet perfectly sincere extravagance his dancing black eyes and occasional flash of white teeth in his otherwise immovable and serious countenance nevertheless i managed to say  but how about yourself enriquez and this geology you know  his eyes twinkled ah you shall hear but first you shall take a drink i have the very old bourbon he is not so old as the aztec but believe me he is very much liflier attend hol on he was already rummaging on a shelf but apparently without success then he explored a buffet with no better results and finally attacked a large drawer throwing out on the floor with his old impetuosity a number of geological specimens carefully labeled i picked up one that had rolled near me it was labeled conglomerate sandstone i picked up another it had the same label  then you are really collecting i said with astonishment  ciertamente responded enriquezwhat other fool shall i look i shall relate of this geology when i shall have found this beast of a bottle ah here he have hide he extracted from a drawer a bottle nearly full of spiritstippling was not one of enriquezs vices you shall say when eres to our noble selfs  when he had drunk i picked up another fragment of his collection it had the same label you are very rich in conglomerate sandstone i said where do you find it  in the street said enriquez with great calmness  in the street i echoed  yes my friend he ees call the cobblestone also the poudingstone when he ees at his home in the country he ees also a small boulder i pick him up i crack him he made three separate piece of conglomerate sandstone i bring him home to my wife in my pocket she rejoice we are happy when comes the efening i sit down and make him a label while my wife she sit down and write of the aztec ah my friend you shall say of the geology it ees a fine a beautiful study but the study of the wife and what shall please her believe me ees much finer believe your old uncle ennery every time on thees question he gets there he gets left nevarre  but professor dobbs your geologian what does he say to this frequent recurrence of the conglomerate sandstone period in your study i asked quickly  he say nothing you comprehend he ees a profound geologian but he also has the admiration excessif for my wife urania he stopped to kiss his hand again toward the door and lighted a cigarette the geologian would not that he should break up the happy efening of his friends by thees small detail he put aside his headso he say a leetle freestone a leetle granite now and then for variety they are building in montgomery street i take the hint like a wink to the horse that has gone blind i attach to myself part of the edifice that is erecting himself in montgomery street i crack him i bring him home i sit again at the feet of my beautiful urania and i label him freestone granite but i do not say from parrotts bankeet is not necessary for our happiness  and you do this sort of thing only because you think it pleases your wife i asked bluntly  my friend rejoined enriquez perching himself on the back of the sofa and caressing his knees as he puffed his cigarette meditatively you have ask a conundrum gif to me an easier one it is of truth that i make much of these thing to please urania but i shall confess all behold i appear to you my leetle brother in my camisamy shirt i blow on myself i gif myself away  he rose gravely from the sofa and drew a small box from one of the drawers of the wardrobe opening it he discovered several specimens of goldbearing quartz and one or two scales of gold thees he said friend pancho is my own geology for thees i am what you see but i say nothing to urania for she have much disgust of mere goldof what she calls vulgar miningand believe me a fear of the effect of speculation upon my temperamentoyou comprehend my complexion my brother reflect upon it pancho i who am the filosofo if that i am anything he looked at me with great levity of eye and supernatural gravity of demeanor but eet ees the jealous affection of the wife my friend for which i make play to her with the humble leetle poudingstone rather than the gold quartz that affrights  but what do you want with them if you have no shares in anything and do not speculate i asked  pardon that ees where you slip up my leetle friend he took from the same drawer a clasped portfolio and unlocked it producing half a dozen prospectuses and certificates of mining shares i stood aghast as i recognized the names of one or two extravagant failures of the last ten yearsplayedout mines that had been galvanized into deceptive life in london paris and new york to the grief of shareholders abroad and the laughter of the initiated at home i could scarcely keep my equanimity you do not mean to say that you have any belief or interest in this rubbish i said quickly  what you call rubbish my good pancho ees the rubbish that the american speculator have dump himself upon them in the shaft the rubbish of the advertisement of the extravagant expense of the salary of the assessment of the freezeout for thees look you is the old mexican mine my grandfather and hees father have both seen them work before you were born and the american knew not there was gold in california  i knew he spoke truly one or two were original silver mines in the south worked by peons and indian slaves a rope windlass and a venerable donkey  but those were silver mines i said suspiciously and these are gold specimens  they are from the same mother said the imperturbable enriquezthe same mine the old peons worked him for silver the precious dollar that buy everything that he send in the galleon to the philippines for the silk and spice that is good enough for him for the gold he made nothing even as my leetle wife urania and regard me here there ees a proverb of my fathers which say that it shall take a gold mine to work a silver mine so mooch more he cost you work him you are lost naturalmente if you turn him round if it take you only a silver mine to work a gold mine you are gain thees ees logic  the intense gravity of his face at this extraordinary deduction upset my own but as i was never certain that enriquez was not purposely mystifying me with some ulterior object i could not help saying a little wickedly  yes i understand all that but how about this geologian will he not tell your wife you know he was a great admirer of hers  that shall show the great intelligence of him my pancho he will have the four ss especially the secreto  there could be no serious discussion in his present mood i gathered up the pages of his wifes manuscript said lightly that as she had the first claim upon my time i should examine the aztec material and report in a day or two as i knew i had little chance in the hands of these two incomprehensibles together i begged him not to call his wife but to convey my adieus to her and in spite of his embraces and protestations i managed to get out of the room but i had scarcely reached the front door when i heard enriquezs voice and his bounding step on the stairs in another moment his arm was round my neck  you must return on the instant mother of god i haf forget she haf forget we all haf forget but you have not seen him  seen whom  el nino the baby you comprehend pig the criaturica the leetle child of ourselfs  the baby i said confusedly is thereis there a baby  you hear him said enriquez sending an appealing voice upward you hear him urania you comprehend this beast of a leetle brother demands if there ees one  i beg your pardon i said hurriedly reascending the stairs on the landing i met mrs saltillo but as calm composed and precise as her husband was extravagant and vehement it was an oversight of enriquezs she said quietly reentering the room with us and was all the more strange as the child was in the room with you all the time  she pointed to the corner of the wall where hung what i had believed to be an old indian relic to my consternation it was a bark papoosecase occupied by a living child swathed and bandaged after the approved indian fashion it was asleep i believe but it opened a pair of bright huckleberry eyes set in the smallest of features that were like those of a carved ivory idol and uttered a coo at the sound of its mothers voice she stood on one side with unruffled composure while enriquez threw himself into an attitude before it with clasped hands as if it had been an image of the holy child for myself i was too astounded to speak luckily my confusion was attributed to the inexperience of a bachelor  i have adopted said mrs saltillo with the faintest touch of maternal pride in her manner what i am convinced is the only natural and hygienic mode of treating the human child it may be said to be a reversion to the aborigine but i have yet to learn that it is not superior to our civilized custom by these bandages the limbs of the infant are kept in proper position until they are strong enough to support the body and such a thing as malformation is unknown it is protected by its cradle which takes the place of its incubatingshell from external injury the injudicious coddling of nurses the socalled dancings and pernicious rockings the supine position as in the adult is imposed only at night by the aid of this strap it may be carried on long journeys either by myself or by enriquez who thus shares with me as he fully recognizes its equal responsibility and burden  itcertainly does notcry i stammered  crying said mrs saltillo with a curve of her pretty red lip is the protest of the child against insanitary and artificial treatment in its upright unostentatious cradle it is protected against that injudicious fondling and dangerous promiscuous osculation to which as an infant in human arms it is so often subjected above all it is kept from that shameless and mortifying publicity so unjust to the weak and unformed animal the child repays this consideration by a gratifying silence it cannot be expected to understand our thoughts speech or actions it cannot participate in our pleasures why should it be forced into premature contact with them merely to feed our vanity or selfishness why should we assume our particular parental accident as superior to the common lot if we do not give our offspring that prominence before our visitors so common to the young wife and husband it is for that reason solely and this may account for what seemed the forgetfulness of enriquez in speaking of it or pointing it out to you and i think his action in calling you back to see it was somewhat precipitate as one does not usually introduce an unknown and inferior stranger without some previous introduction he might have asked you if you wished to see the baby before he recalled you  i looked from uranias unfathomable eyes to enriquezs impenetrable countenance i might have been equal to either of them alone but together they were invincible i looked hopelessly at the baby with its sharp little eyes and composed face it certainly was a marvelous miniature of enriquez i said so  it would be singular if it was not said mrs saltillo dryly and as i believe it is by no means an uncommon fact in human nature it seems to me strange that people should insist upon it as a discovery it is an inheritance however that in due time progress and science will no doubt interrupt to the advancement of the human race i need not say that both enriquez and myself look forward to it with confident tranquillity  there was clearly nothing for me to do now but to shake hands again and take my leave yet i was so much impressed with the unreality of the whole scene that when i reached the front door i had a strong impulse to return suddenly and fall in upon them in their relaxed and natural attitudes they could not keep up this pose between themselves and i half expected to see their laughing faces at the window as i glanced up before wending my perilous way to the street  i found mrs saltillos manuscript well written and in the narrative parts even graphic and sparkling i suppressed some general remarks on the universe and some correlative theories of existence as not appertaining particularly to the aztecs and as not meeting any unquenchable thirst for information on the part of the readers of the daily excelsior i even promoted my fair contributor to the position of having been commissioned at great expense to make the mexican journey especially for the excelsior this with mrs saltillos somewhat precise preraphaelite drawings and watercolors vilely reproduced by woodcuts gave quite a sensational air to her production which divided into parts for two or three days filled a whole page of the paper i am not aware of any particular service that it did to ethnology but as i pointed out in the editorial column it showed that the people of california were not given over by material greed to the exclusion of intellectual research and as it was attacked instantly in long communications from one or two scientific men it thus produced more copy  briefly it was a boom for the author and the daily excelsior i should add however that a rival newspaper intimated that it was also a boom for mrs saitillos husband and called attention to the fact that a deserted mexican mine known as el bolero was described graphically in the aztec article among the news and again appeared in the advertising columns of the same paper i turned somewhat indignantly to the file of the excelsior and singularly enough found in the elaborate prospectus of a new goldmining company the description of the el bolero mine as a quotation from the aztec article with extraordinary inducements for the investment of capital in the projected working of an old mine if i had had any difficulty in recognizing in the extravagant style the flamboyant hand of enriquez in english writing i might have read his name plainly enough displayed as president of the company it was evidently the prospectus of one of the ventures he had shown me i was more amused than indignant at the little trick he had played upon my editorial astuteness after all if i had thus benefited the young couple i was satisfied i had not seen them since my first visit as i was very busymy communications with mrs saltillo had been carried on by letters and proofsand when i did finally call at their house it was only to find that they were visiting at san jose i wondered whether the baby was still hanging on the wall or if he was taken with them who carried him  a week later the stock of el bolero was quoted at par more than that an incomprehensible activity had been given to all the deserted mexican mines and people began to look up scrip hitherto thrown aside as worthless whether it was one of those extraordinary fevers which attacked californian speculation in the early days or whether enriquez saltillo had infected the stockmarket with his own extravagance i never knew but plans as wild inventions as fantastic and arguments as illogical as ever emanated from his own brain were set forth on change with a gravity equal to his own the most reasonable hypothesis was that it was the effect of the wellknown fact that the spanish californian hitherto had not been a mining speculator nor connected in any way with the gold production on his native soil deeming it inconsistent with his patriarchal life and landed dignity and that when a son of one of the oldest spanish families identified with the land and its peculiar character for centuries lent himself to its mineral exploitationsi beg to say that i am quoting from the advertisement in the excelsiorit was a guerdon of success this was so far true that in a week enriquez saltillo was rich and in a fair way to become a millionaire   it was a hot afternoon when i alighted from the stifling wingdam coach and stood upon the cool deep veranda of the carquinez springs hotel after i had shaken off the dust which had lazily followed us in our descent of the mountain road like a red smoke occasionally overflowing the coach windows i went up to the room i had engaged for my brief holiday i knew the place well although i could see that the hotel itself had lately been redecorated and enlarged to meet the increasing requirements of fashion i knew the forest of enormous redwoods where one might lose ones self in a five minutes walk from the veranda i knew the rocky trail that climbed the mountain to the springs twisting between giant boulders i knew the arid garden deep in the wayside dust with its hurriedly planted tropical plants already withering in the dry autumn sunshine and washed into fictitious freshness night and morning by the hydraulic irrigatinghose i knew too the cool reposeful night winds that swept down from invisible snowcrests beyond with the hanging out of monstrous stars that too often failed to bring repose to the feverish guests for the overstrained neurotic workers who fled hither from the baking plains of sacramento or from the chill seafogs of san francisco never lost the fierce unrest that had driven them here unaccustomed to leisure their enforced idleness impelled them to seek excitement in the wildest gayeties the bracing mountain air only reinvigorated them to pursue pleasure as they had pursued the occupations they had left behind their sole recreations were furious drives over breakneck roads mad scampering cavalcades through the sedate woods gambling parties in private rooms where large sums were lost by capitalists on leave champagne suppers and impromptu balls that lasted through the calm reposeful night to the first rays of light on the distant snowline unimaginative men in their temporary sojourn they more often outraged or dispossessed nature in her own fastnesses than courted her for sympathy or solitude there were playingcards left lying behind boulders and empty champagne bottles forgotten in forest depths  i remembered all this when refreshed by a bath i leaned from the balcony of my room and watched the pulling up of a brake drawn by six dusty foambespattered horses driven by a noted capitalist as its hot perspiring closely veiled yet burningfaced fair occupants descended in all the dazzling glory of summer toilets and i saw the gentlemen consult their watches with satisfaction and congratulate their triumphant driver i knew the characteristic excitement they had enjoyed from a record run probably for a bet over a mountain road in a burning sun  not bad eh fortyfour minutes from the summit  the voice seemed at my elbow i turned quickly to recognize an acquaintance a young san francisco broker leaning from the next balcony to mine but my attention was just then preoccupied by the face and figure which seemed familiar to me of a woman who was alighting from the brake  who is that i asked the straight slim woman in gray with the white veil twisted round her felt hat  mrs saltillo he answered wife of el bolero saltillo dont you know mighty pretty woman if she is a little stiffish and set up  then i had not been mistaken is enriquezis her husbandhere i asked quickly  the man laughed i reckon not this is the place for other peoples husbands dont you know  alas i did know and as there flashed upon me all the miserable scandals and gossip connected with this reckless frivolous caravansary i felt like resenting his suggestion but my companions next words were more significant  besides if what they say is true saltillo wouldnt be very popular here  i dont understand i said quickly  why after all that row he had with the el bolero company  i never heard of any row i said in astonishment  the broker laughed incredulously come and you a newspaper man well maybe they did try to hush it up and keep it out of the papers on account of the stock but it seems he got up a reglar shindy with the board one day called em thieves and swindlers and allowed he was disgracing himself as a spanish hidalgo by having anything to do with em talked they say about charles v of spain or some other royal galoot giving his ancestors the land in trust clean off his head i reckon then shunted himself off the company and sold out you can guess he wouldnt be very popular around here with jim bestley there pointing to the capitalist who had driven the brake who used to be on the board with him no sir he was either lying low for something or was off his head think of his throwing up a place like that  nonsense i said indignantly he is mercurial and has the quick impulsiveness of his race but i believe him as sane as any who sat with him on the board there must be some mistake or you havent got the whole story nevertheless i did not care to discuss an old friend with a mere acquaintance and i felt secretly puzzled to account for his conduct in the face of his previous cleverness in manipulating the el bolero and the undoubted fascination he had previously exercised over the stockholders the story had of course been garbled in repetition i had never before imagined what might be the effect of enriquezs peculiar eccentricities upon matteroffact peoplei had found them only amusingand the brokers suggestion annoyed me however mrs saltillo was here in the hotel and i should of course meet her would she be as frank with me  i was disappointed at not finding her in the drawingroom or on the veranda and the heat being still unusually oppressive i strolled out toward the redwoods hesitating for a moment in the shade before i ran the fiery gauntlet of the garden to my surprise i had scarcely passed the giant sentinels on its outskirts before i found that from some unusual condition of the atmosphere the cold undercurrent of air which generally drew through these pillared aisles was withheld that afternoon it was absolutely hotter than in the open and the wood was charged throughout with the acrid spices of the pine i turned back to the hotel reascended to my bedroom and threw myself in an armchair by the open window my room was near the end of a wing the corner room at the end was next to mine on the same landing its closed door at right angles to my open one gave upon the staircase but was plainly visible from where i sat i remembered being glad that it was shut as it enabled me without offense to keep my own door open  the house was very quiet the leaves of a catalpa across the roadway hung motionless somebody yawned on the veranda below i threw away my halffinished cigar and closed my eyes i think i had not lost consciousness for more than a few seconds before i was awakened by the shaking and thrilling of the whole building as i staggered to my feet i saw the four pictures hanging against the wall swing outwardly from it on their cords and my door swing back against the wall at the same moment acted upon by the same potential impulse the door of the end room in the hall opposite the stairs also swung open in that brief moment i had a glimpse of the interior of the room of two figures a man and a woman the latter clinging to her companion in abject terror it was only for an instant for a second thrill passed through the house the pictures clattered back against the wall the door of the end room closed violently on its strange revelation and my own door swung back also apprehensive of what might happen i sprang toward it but only to arrest it an inch or two before it should shut when as my experience had taught me it might stick by the subsidence of the walls but it did stick ajar and remained firmly fixed in that position from the clattering of the knob of the other door and the sound of hurried voices behind it i knew that the same thing had happened there when that door had fully closed  i was familiar enough with earthquakes to know that with the second shock or subsidence of the earth the immediate danger was passed and so i was able to note more clearly what else was passing there was the usual sudden stampede of hurrying feet the solitary oath and scream the halfhysterical laughter and silence then the tumult was reawakened to the sound of high voices talking all together or the impatient calling of absentees in halls and corridors then i heard the quick swish of female skirts on the staircase and one of the fair guests knocked impatiently at the door of the end room still immovably fixed at the first knock there was a sudden cessation of the hurried whisperings and turning of the doorknob  mrs saltillo are you there are you frightened she called  mrs saltillo it was she then who was in the room i drew nearer my door which was still fixed ajar presently a voicemrs saltillos voicewith a constrained laugh in it came from behind the door not a bit ill come down in a minute  do persisted the wouldbe intruder its all over now but were all going out into the garden its safer  all right answered mrs saltillo dont wait dear ill follow run away now  the visitor who was evidently still nervous was glad to hurry away and i heard her retreating step on the staircase the rattling of the door began again and at last it seemed to yield to a stronger pull and opened sufficiently to allow mrs saltillo to squeeze through i withdrew behind my door i fancied that it creaked as she passed as if noticing it ajar she had laid an inquiring hand upon it i waited but she was not followed by any one i wondered if i had been mistaken i was going to the bellrope to summon assistance to move my own door when a sudden instinct withheld me if there was any one still in that room he might come from it just as the servant answered my call and a public discovery would be unavoidable i was right in another instant the figure of a man whose face i could not discern slipped out of the room passed my door and went stealthily down the staircase  convinced of this i resolved not to call public attention to my being in my own room at the time of the incident so i did not summon any one but redoubling my efforts i at last opened the door sufficiently to pass out and at once joined the other guests in the garden already with characteristic recklessness and audacity the earthquake was made light of the only dictate of prudence had resolved itself into a hilarious proposal to camp out in the woods all night and have a torchlight picnic even then preparations were being made for carrying tents blankets and pillows to the adjacent redwoods dinner and supper cooked at campfires were to be served there on stumps of trees and fallen logs the convulsion of nature had been used as an excuse for one of the wildest freaks of extravagance that carquinez springs had ever known perhaps that quick sense of humor which dominates the american male in exigencies of this kind kept the extravagances from being merely bizarre and grotesque and it was presently known that the hotel and its menage were to be appropriately burlesqued by some of the guests who attired as indians would personate the staff from the oracular hotel proprietor himself down to the smart hotel clerk  during these arrangements i had a chance of drawing near mrs saltillo i fancied she gave a slight start as she recognized me but her greetings were given with her usual precision have you been here long she asked  i have only just come i replied laughingly in time for the shock  ah you felt it then i was telling these ladies that our eminent geologist professor dobbs assured me that these seismic disturbances in california have a very remote centre and are seldom serious  it must be very satisfactory to have the support of geology at such a moment i could not help saying though i had not the slightest idea whose the figure was that i had seen nor indeed had i recognized it among the guests she did not seem to detect any significance in my speech and i added and where is enriquez he would enjoy this proposed picnic tonight  enriquez is at salvatierra rancho which he lately bought from his cousin  and the baby surely here is a chance for you to hang him up on a redwood tonight in his cradle  the boy said mrs saltillo quickly is no longer in his cradle he has passed the pupa state and is now free to develop his own perfected limbs he is with his father i do not approve of children being submitted to the indiscriminate attentions of a hotel i am here myself only for that supply of ozone indicated for brain exhaustion  she looked so pretty and prim in her gray dress so like her old correct self that i could not think of anything but her mental attitude which did not by the way seem much like mental depression yet i was aware that i was getting no information of enriquezs condition or affairs unless the whole story told by the broker was an exaggeration i did not however dare to ask more particularly  you remember professor dobbs she asked abruptly  this recalled a suspicion awakened by my vision so suddenly that i felt myself blushing she did not seem to notice it and was perfectly composed  i do remember him is he here  he is that is what makes it so particularly unfortunate for me you see after that affair of the board and enriquezs withdrawal although enriquez may have been a little precipitate in his energetic way i naturally took my husbands part in public for although we preserve our own independence inviolable we believe in absolute confederation as against society  but what has professor dobbs to do with the board i interrupted  the professor was scientific and geological adviser to the board and it was upon some report or suggestion of his that enriquez took issue against the sentiment of the board it was a principle affecting enriquezs spanish sense of honor  do tell me all about it i said eagerly i am very anxious to know the truth  as i was not present at the time said mrs saltillo rebuking my eagerness with a gentle frigidity i am unable to do so anything else would be mere hearsay and more or less ex parte i do not approve of gossip  but what did enriquez tell you you surely know that  that being purely confidential as between husband and wifeperhaps i should say partner and partnerof course you do not expect me to disclose enough that i was satisfied with it i should not have spoken to you about it at all but that through myself and enriquez you are an acquaintance of the professors and i might save you the awkwardness of presenting yourself with him otherwise although you are a friend of enriquez it need not affect your acquaintance with the professor  hang the professor i ejaculated i dont care a rap for him  then i differ with you said mrs saltillo with precision he is distinctly an able man and one cannot but miss the contact of his original mind and his liberal teachings  here she was joined by one of the ladies and i lounged away i dare say it was very mean and very illogical but the unsatisfactory character of this interview made me revert again to the singular revelation i had seen a few hours before i looked anxiously for professor dobbs but when i did meet him with an indifferent nod of recognition i found i could by no means identify him with the figure of her mysterious companion and why should i suspect him at all in the face of mrs saltillos confessed avoidance of him who then could it have been i had seen them but an instant in the opening and the shutting of a door it was merely the shadowy bulk of a man that flitted past my door after all could i have imagined the whole thing were my perceptive facultiesjust aroused from slumber too insufficiently clear to be relied upon would i not have laughed had urania or even enriquez himself told me such a story  as i reentered the hotel the clerk handed me a telegram theres been a pretty big shake all over the country he said eagerly everybody is getting news and inquiries from their friends anything fresh he paused interrogatively as i tore open the envelope the dispatch had been redirected from the office of the daily excelsior it was dated salvatierra rancho and contained a single line come and see your old uncle ennery  there was nothing in the wording of the message that was unlike enriquezs usual lighthearted levity but the fact that he should have telegraphed it to me struck me uneasily that i should have received it at the hotel where his wife and professor dobbs were both staying and where i had had such a singular experience seemed to me more than a mere coincidence an instinct that the message was something personal to enriquez and myself kept me from imparting it to mrs saltillo after worrying half the night in our bizarre camp in the redwoods in the midst of a restless festivity which was scarcely the repose i had been seeking at carquinez springs i resolved to leave the next day for salvatierra rancho i remembered the ranchoa low goldenbrown adobewalled quadrangle sleeping like some monstrous ruminant in a hollow of the contra costa range i recalled in the midst of this noisy picnic the slumberous coolness of its long corridors and soundless courtyard and hailed it as a relief the telegram was a sufficient excuse for my abrupt departure in the morning i left but without again seeing either mrs saltillo or the professor  it was late the next afternoon when i rode through the canada that led to the rancho i confess my thoughts were somewhat gloomy in spite of my escape from the noisy hotel but this was due to the sombre scenery through which i had just ridden and the monotonous russet of the leagues of wild oats as i approached the rancho i saw that enriquez had made no attempt to modernize the old casa and that even the garden was left in its lawless native luxuriance while the rude tiled sheds near the walled corral contained the old farming implements unchanged for a century even to the oxcarts the wheels of which were made of a single block of wood a few peons in striped shirts and velvet jackets were sunning themselves against a wall and near them hung a halfdrained pellejo or goatskin waterbag the air of absolute shiftlessness must have been repellent to mrs saltillos orderly precision and for a moment i pitied her but it was equally inconsistent with enriquezs enthusiastic ideas of american progress and the extravagant designs he had often imparted to me of the improvements he would make when he had a fortune i was feeling uneasy again when i suddenly heard the rapid clack of unshod hoofs on a rocky trail that joined my own at the same instant a horseman dashed past me at full speed i had barely time to swerve my own horse aside to avoid a collision yet in that brief moment i recognized the figure of enriquez but his face i should have scarcely known it was hard and fixed his upper lip and thin penciled mustache were drawn up over his teeth which were like a white gash in his dark face he turned into the courtyard of the rancho i put spurs to my horse and followed in nervous expectation he turned in his saddle as i entered but the next moment he bounded from his horse and before i could dismount flew to my side and absolutely lifted me from the saddle to embrace me it was the old enriquez again his face seemed to have utterly changed in that brief moment  this is all very well old chap i said but do you know that you nearly ran me down just now with that infernal halfbroken mustang do you usually charge the casa at that speed  pardon my leetle brother but here you shall slip up the mustang is not halfbroken he is not broke at all look at his hoofnever have a shoe been there for myselfattend me when i ride alone i think mooch when i think mooch i think fast my idea he go like a cannonball consequent if i ride not thees horse like the cannonball my thought he arrive first and where are you you get left believe me that i fly thees horse thees old mexican plug and your de uncle ennery and his leetle old idea arrive all the same time and on the instant  it was the old enriquez i perfectly understood his extravagant speech and illustration and yet for the first time i wondered if others did  takadrink he said all in one word you shall possess the old bourbon or the rhum from the santa cruz name your poison gentlemen  he had already dragged me up the steps from the patio to the veranda and seated me before a small round table still covered with the chocolate equipage of the morning a little driedup old indian woman took it away and brought the spirits and glasses  mirar the leetle old one said enriquez with unflinching gravity consider her pancho to the bloosh she is not truly an aztec but she is of years one hundred and one and lifs possibly she haf not the beauty which ravishes which devastates but she shall attent you to the hot water to the bath thus shall you be protect my leetle brother from scandal  enriquez i burst out suddenly tell me about yourself why did you leave the el bolero board what was the row about  enriquezs eyes for a moment glittered then they danced as before  ah he said you have heard  something but i want to know the truth from you  he lighted a cigarette lifted himself backward into a grass hammock on which he sat swinging his feet then pointing to another hammock he said tranquillize yourself there i will relate but truly it ees nothing  he took a long pull at his cigarette and for a few moments seemed quietly to exude smoke from his eyes ears nose even his fingerendseverywhere in fact but his mouth that and his mustache remained fixed then he said slowly flicking away the ashes with his little finger  first you understand friend pancho that i make no row the other themself make the row the shindig they make the dance the howl the snap of the finger the oath the helen blazes the wot the devil the that be dd the bad language they themselves finger the revolver advance the bowieknife throw off the coat square off and say come on i remain as you see me now little brothertranquil he lighted another cigarette made his position more comfortable in the hammock and resumed the professor dobbs who is the geologian of the company made a report for which he got two thousand dollar but thees reportlook you friend panchohe is not good for the mine for in the hole in the ground the professor dobbs have found a hoss  a what i asked  a hoss repeated enriquez with infinite gravity but not leetle pancho the hoss that run the hoss that buckjump but what the miner call a hoss a something that rear up in the vein and stop him you pick around the hoss you pick under him sometimes you find the vein sometimes you do not the hoss rear up and remain eet ees not good for the mine the board say d the hoss get rid of the hoss chuck out the hoss then they talk together and one say to the professor dobbs eef you cannot thees hoss remove from the mine you can take him out of the report he look to me thees professor i see nothing i remain tranquil then the board say thees report with the hoss in him is worth two thousand dollar but without the hoss he is worth five thousand dollar for the stockholder is frighted of the rearing hoss it is of a necessity that the stockholder should remain tranquil without the hoss the report is good the stock shall errise the director shall sell out and leave the stockholder the hoss to play with the professor he say alright he scratch out the hoss sign his name and get a check for three thousand dollar  then i erriseso he got up from the hammock suiting the action to the word and during the rest of his narrative i honestly believe assumed the same attitude and deliberate intonation he had exhibited at the board i could even fancy i saw the reckless cynical faces of his brother directors turned upon his grim impassive features i am tranquil i smoke my cigarette i say that for three hundred year my family have held the land of thees mine that it pass from father to son and from son to son it pass by gift it pass by grant but that nevarre there pass a lie with it i say it was a gift by a spanish christian king to a christian hidalgo for the spread of the gospel and not for the cheat and the swindle i say that this mine was worked by the slave and by the mule by the ass but never by the cheat and swindler i say that if they have struck the hoss in the mine they have struck a hoss in the land a spanish hoss a hoss that have no bridle worth five thousand dollar in his mouth but a hoss to rear and a hoss that cannot be struck out by a yankee geologian and that hoss is enriquez saltillo  he paused and laid aside his cigarette  then they say dry up and sell out and the great bankers say name your own price for your stock and resign and i say there is not enough gold in your bank in your san francisco in the mines of california that shall buy a spanish gentleman when i leave i leave the stock at my back i shall take it nevarre then the banker he say and you will go and blab i suppose and then pancho i smile i pick up my mustacheso and i say pardon senor you haf mistake the saltillo haf for three hundred year no stain no blot upon him eet is not nowthe last of the racewho shall confess that he haf sit at a board of disgrace and dishonor and then it is that the band begin to play and the animals stand on their hind leg and waltz and behold the row he haf begin  i ran over to him and fairly hugged him but he put me aside with a gentle and philosophical calm ah eet is nothing pancho it is believe me all the same a hundred years to come and where are you then the earth he turn round and then come el temblor the earthquake and there you are bah eet is not of the board that i have asked you to come it is something else i would tell you go and wash yourself of thees journey my leetle brother as i havelooking at his narrow brown wellbred handswash myself of the board be very careful of the leetle old woman pancho do not wink to her of the eye consider my leetle brother for one hundred and one year he haf been as a nun a saint disturb not her tranquillity  yes it was the old enriquez but he seemed graverif i could use that word of one of such persistent gravity only his gravity heretofore had suggested a certain irony rather than a melancholy which i now fancied i detected and what was this something else he was to tell me later did it refer to mrs saltillo i had purposely waited for him to speak of her before i should say anything of my visit to carquinez springs i hurried through my ablutions in the hot water brought in a bronze jar on the head of the centenarian handmaid and even while i was smiling over enriquezs caution regarding this aged ruth i felt i was getting nervous to hear his news  i found him in his sittingroom or studya long low apartment with small deep windows like embrasures in the outer adobe wall but glazed in lightly upon the veranda he was sitting quite abstractedly with a pen in his hand before a table on which a number of sealed envelopes were lying he looked so formal and methodical for enriquez  you like the old casa pancho he said in reply to my praise of its studious and monastic gloom well my leetle brother some day that is fairwho knowsit may be at your disposicion not of our politeness but of a truth friend pancho for if i leave it to my wifeit was the first time he had spoken of herfor my leetle child he added quickly i shall put in a bond an obligacion that my friend pancho shall come and go as he will  the saltillos are a longlived race i laughed i shall be a grayhaired man with a house and family of my own by that time but i did not like the way he had spoken  quien sabe he only said dismissing the question with the national gesture after a moment he added i shall tell you something that is strrange so strrange that you shall say like the banker say thees enriquez he ees off his head he ees a crank a lunatico but it ees a fact believe me i have said  he rose and going to the end of the room opened a door it showed a pretty little room femininely arranged in mrs saltillos refined taste eet is pretty eet is the room of my wife bueno attend me now he closed the door and walked back to the table i have sit here and write when the earthquake arrive i have feel the shock the grind of the walls on themselves the tremor the stagger andthatdoorhe swing open  the door i said with a smile that i felt was ghastly  comprehend me he said quickly it ees not that which ees strrange the wall lift the lock slip the door he fell open it is frequent it comes so ever when the earthquake come but eet is not my wifes room i see it is another room a room i know not my wife urania she stand there of a fear of a tremble she grasp she cling to someone the earth shake again the door shut i jump from my table i shake and tumble to the door i fling him open maravilloso it is the room of my wife again she is not there it is empty it is nothing  i felt myself turning hot and cold by turns i was horrified andand i blundered and who was the other figure i gasped  who repeated enriquez with a pause a fixed look at me and a sublime gesture who should it be but myself enriquez saltillo  a terrible premonition that this was a chivalrous lie that it was not himself he had seen but that our two visions were identical came upon me after all i said with a fixed smile if you could imagine you saw your wife you could easily imagine you saw yourself too in the shock of the moment you thought of her naturally for then she would as naturally seek your protection you have written for news of her  no said enriquez quietly  no i repeated amazedly  you understand pancho eef it was the trick of my eyes why should i affright her for the thing that is not if it is the truth and it arrive to me as a warning why shall i affright her before it come  before what comes what is it a warning of i asked impetuously  that we shall be separated that i go and she do not  to my surprise his dancing eyes had a slight film over them i dont understand you i said awkwardly  your head is not of a level my pancho thees earthquake he remain for only ten seconds and he fling open the door if he remain for twenty seconds he fling open the wall the hoose toomble and your friend enriquez is feenish  nonsense i said professori mean the geologistssay that the centre of disturbance of these californian earthquakes is some faraway point in the pacific and there never will be any serious convulsions here  ah the geologist said enriquez gravely understand the hoss that rear in the mine and the five thousand dollar believe me no more he haf lif here three year my family haf lif here three hundred my grandfather saw the earth swallow the church of san juan baptista  i laughed until looking up i was shocked to see for the first time that his dancing eyes were moist and shining but almost instantly he jumped up and declared that i had not seen the garden and the corral and linking his arm in mine swept me like a whirlwind into the patio for an hour or two he was in his old invincible spirits i was glad i had said nothing of my visit to carquinez springs and of seeing his wife i determined to avoid it as long as possible and as he did not again refer to her except in the past it was not difficult at last he infected me with his extravagance and for a while i forgot even the strangeness of his conduct and his confidences we walked and talked together as of old i understood and enjoyed him perfectly and it was not strange that in the end i began to believe that this strange revelation was a bit of his extravagant acting got up to amuse me the coincidence of his story with my own experience was not after all such a wonderful thing considering what must have been the nervous and mental disturbance produced by the earthquake we dined together attended only by pedro an old halfcaste bodyservant it was easy to see that the household was carried on economically and from a word or two casually dropped by enriquez it appeared that the rancho and a small sum of money were all that he retained from his former fortune when he left the el bolero the stock he kept intact refusing to take the dividend upon it until that collapse of the company should occur which he confidently predicted when he would make good the swindled stockholders i had no reason to doubt his perfect faith in this  the next morning we were up early for a breezy gallop over the three square miles of enriquezs estate i was astounded when i descended to the patio to find enriquez already mounted and carrying before him astride of the horn of his saddle a small childthe identical papoose of my memorable first visit but the boy was no longer swathed and bandaged although for security his plump little body was engirt by the same sash that encircled his fathers own waist i felt a stirring of selfreproach i had forgotten all about him to my suggestion that the exercise might be fatiguing to him enriquez shrugged his shoulders  believe me no he is ever with me when i go on the pasear he is not too yonge for he shall learn to rride to shoot and to speak the truth even as the persian chile eet ees all i can gif to him  nevertheless i think the boy enjoyed it and i knew he was safe with such an accomplished horseman as his father indeed it was a fine sight to see them both careering over the broad plain enriquez with jingling spurs and whirling riata and the boy with a face as composed as his fathers and his tiny hand grasping the end of the flapping rein with a touch scarcely lighter than the skillful riders own it was a lovely morning though warm and still there was a faint hazea rare thing in that climateon the distant range the sunbaked soil arid and thirsty from the long summer drought and cracked into long fissures broke into puffs of dust with a slight detonation like a pistolshot at each stroke of our pounding hoofs suddenly my horse swerved in full gallop almost lost his footing broke and halted with braced fore feet trembling in every limb i heard a shout from enriquez at the same instant and saw that he too had halted about a hundred paces from me with his hand uplifted in warning and between us a long chasm in the dry earth extending across the whole field but the trembling of the horse continued until it communicated itself to me i was shaking too and looking about for the cause when i beheld the most weird and remarkable spectacle i had ever witnessed the whole llano or plain stretching to the horizonline was distinctly undulating the faint haze of the hills was repeated over its surface as if a dust had arisen from some grinding displacement of the soil i threw myself from my horse but the next moment was fain to cling to him as i felt the thrill under my very feet then there was a pause and i lifted my head to look for enriquez he was nowhere to be seen with a terrible recollection of the fissure that had yawned between us i sprang to the saddle again and spurred the frightened beast toward that point but it was gone too i rode backward and forward repeatedly along the line where i had seen it only a moment before the plain lay compact and uninterrupted without a crack or fissure the dusty haze that had arisen had passed as mysteriously away the clear outline of the valley returned the great field was empty  presently i was aware of the sound of galloping hoofs i remembered thenwhat i had at first forgottenthat a few moments before we had crossed an arroyo or dried bed of a stream depressed below the level of the field how foolish that i had not remembered he had evidently sought that refuge there were his returning hoofs i galloped toward it but only to meet a frightened vaquero who had taken that avenue of escape to the rancho  did you see don enriquez i asked impatiently  i saw that the mans terror was extreme and his eyes were staring in their sockets he hastily crossed himself  ah god yes  where is he i demanded  gone  where  he looked at me with staring vacant eyes and pointing to the ground said in spanish he has returned to the land of his fathers  we searched for him that day and the next when the country was aroused and his neighbors joined in a quest that proved useless neither he nor his innocent burden was ever seen again of men whether he had been engulfed by mischance in some unsuspected yawning chasm in that brief moment or had fulfilled his own prophecy by deliberately erasing himself for some purpose known only to himself no one ever knew his countrypeople shook their heads and said it was like a saltillo and the few among his retainers who knew him and loved him whispered still more ominously he will yet return to his land to confound the americanos  yet the widow of enriquez did not marry professor dobbs but she too disappeared from california and years afterward i was told that she was well known to the ingenuous parisians as the usual wealthy widow from south america
