provocation      ix   mary garland      x    the cavaliere      xi   mrs hudson      xii  the princess casamassima      xiii switzerland     chapter i rowland  mallet had made his arrangements to sail for europe on the first of september and having in the interval a fortnight to spare he determined to spend it with his cousin cecilia the widow of a nephew of his father he was urged by the reflection that an affectionate farewell might help to exonerate him from the charge of neglect frequently preferred by this lady it was not that the young man disliked her on the contrary he regarded her with a tender admiration and he had not forgotten how when his cousin had brought her home on her marriage he had seemed to feel the upward sweep of the empty bough from which the golden fruit had been plucked and had then and there accepted the prospect of bachelorhood the truth was that as it will be part of the entertainment of this narrative to exhibit rowland mallet had an uncomfortably sensitive conscience and that in spite of the seeming paradox his visits to cecilia were rare because she and her misfortunes were often uppermost in it her misfortunes were three in number first she had lost her husband second she had lost her money or the greater part of it and third she lived at northampton massachusetts mallets compassion was really wasted because cecilia was a very clever woman and a most skillful counterplotter to adversity she had made herself a charming home her economies were not obtrusive and there was always a cheerful flutter in the folds of her crape it was the consciousness of all this that puzzled mallet whenever he felt tempted to put in his oar he had money and he had time but he never could decide just how to place these gifts gracefully at cecilias service he no longer felt like marrying her in these eight years that fancy had died a natural death and yet her extreme cleverness seemed somehow to make charity difficult and patronage impossible he would rather chop off his hand than offer her a check a piece of useful furniture or a black silk dress and yet there was some sadness in seeing such a bright proud woman living in such a small dull way cecilia had moreover a turn for sarcasm and her smile which was her pretty feature was never so pretty as when her sprightly phrase had a lurking scratch in it rowland remembered that for him she was all smiles and suspected awkwardly that he ministered not a little to her sense of the irony of things and in truth with his means his leisure and his opportunities what had he done he had an unaffected suspicion of his uselessness cecilia meanwhile cut out her own dresses and was personally giving her little girl the education of a princess  this time however he presented himself bravely enough for in the way of activity it was something definite at least to be going to europe and to be meaning to spend the winter in rome cecilia met him in the early dusk at the gate of her little garden amid a studied combination of floral perfumes a rosy widow of twentyeight half cousin half hostess doing the honors of an odorous cottage on a midsummer evening was a phenomenon to which the young mans imagination was able to do ample justice cecilia was always gracious but this evening she was almost joyous she was in a happy mood and mallet imagined there was a private reason for ita reason quite distinct from her pleasure in receiving her honored kinsman the next day he flattered himself he was on the way to discover it  for the present after tea as they sat on the roseframed porch while rowland held his younger cousin between his knees and she enjoying her situation listened timorously for the stroke of bedtime cecilia insisted on talking more about her visitor than about herself  what is it you mean to do in europe she asked lightly giving a turn to the frill of her sleevejust such a turn as seemed to mallet to bring out all the latent difficulties of the question  why very much what i do here he answered no great harm  is it true cecilia asked that here you do no great harm is not a man like you doing harm when he is not doing positive good  your compliment is ambiguous said rowland  no answered the widow you know what i think of you you have a particular aptitude for beneficence you have it in the first place in your character you are a benevolent person ask bessie if you dont hold her more gently and comfortably than any of her other admirers  he holds me more comfortably than mr hudson bessie declared roundly  rowland not knowing mr hudson could but half appreciate the eulogy and cecilia went on to develop her idea your circumstances in the second place suggest the idea of social usefulness you are intelligent you are wellinformed and your charity if one may call it charity would be discriminating you are rich and unoccupied so that it might be abundant therefore i say you are a person to do something on a large scale bestir yourself dear rowland or we may be taught to think that virtue herself is setting a bad example  heaven forbid cried rowland that i should set the examples of virtue i am quite willing to follow them however and if i dont do something on the grand scale it is that my genius is altogether imitative and that i have not recently encountered any very striking models of grandeur pray what shall i do found an orphan asylum or build a dormitory for harvard college i am not rich enough to do either in an ideally handsome way and i confess that yet awhile i feel too young to strike my grand coup i am holding myself ready for inspiration i am waiting till something takes my fancy irresistibly if inspiration comes at forty it will be a hundred pities to have tied up my moneybag at thirty  well i give you till forty said cecilia it s only a word to the wise a notification that you are expected not to run your course without having done something handsome for your fellowmen  nine oclock sounded and bessie with each stroke courted a closer embrace but a single winged word from her mother overleaped her successive intrenchments she turned and kissed her cousin and deposited an irrepressible tear on his moustache then she went and said her prayers to her mother it was evident she was being admirably brought up rowland with the permission of his hostess lighted a cigar and puffed it awhile in silence cecilias interest in his career seemed very agreeable that mallet was without vanity i by no means intend to affirm but there had been times when seeing him accept hardly less deferentially advice even more peremptory than the widows you might have asked yourself what had become of his vanity now in the sweetsmelling starlight he felt gently wooed to egotism there was a project connected with his going abroad which it was on his tongues end to communicate it had no relation to hospitals or dormitories and yet it would have sounded very generous but it was not because it would have sounded generous that poor mallet at last puffed it away in the fumes of his cigar useful though it might be it expressed most imperfectly the young mans own personal conception of usefulness he was extremely fond of all the arts and he had an almost passionate enjoyment of pictures he had seen many and he judged them sagaciously it had occurred to him some time before that it would be the work of a good citizen to go abroad and with all expedition and secrecy purchase certain valuable specimens of the dutch and italian schools as to which he had received private proposals and then present his treasures out of hand to an american city not unknown to aesthetic fame in which at that time there prevailed a good deal of fruitless aspiration toward an artmuseum he had seen himself in imagination more than once in some mouldy old saloon of a florentine palace turning toward the deep embrasure of the window some scarcelyfaded ghirlandaio or botticelli while a host in reduced circumstances pointed out the lovely drawing of a hand but he imparted none of these visions to cecilia and he suddenly swept them away with the declaration that he was of course an idle useless creature and that he would probably be even more so in europe than at home the only thing is he said that there i shall seem to be doing something i shall be better entertained and shall be therefore i suppose in a better humor with life you may say that that is just the humor a useless man should keep out of he should cultivate discontentment i did a good many things when i was in europe before but i did not spend a winter in rome every one assures me that this is a peculiar refinement of bliss most people talk about rome in the same way it is evidently only a sort of idealized form of loafing a passive life in rome thanks to the number and the quality of ones impressions takes on a very respectable likeness to activity it is still lotuseating only you sit down at table and the lotuses are served up on rococo china it s all very well but i have a distinct prevision of thisthat if roman life does nt do something substantial to make you happier it increases tenfold your liability to moral misery it seems to me a rash thing for a sensitive soul deliberately to cultivate its sensibilities by rambling too often among the ruins of the palatine or riding too often in the shadow of the aqueducts in such recreations the chords of feeling grow tense and afterlife to spare your intellectual nerves must play upon them with a touch as dainty as the tread of mignon when she danced her eggdance  i should have said my dear rowland said cecilia with a laugh that your nerves were tough that your eggs were hard  that being stupid you mean i might be happy upon my word i am not i am clever enough to want more than i ve got i am tired of myself my own thoughts my own affairs my own eternal company true happiness we are told consists in getting out of ones self but the point is not only to get outyou must stay out and to stay out you must have some absorbing errand unfortunately i ve got no errand and nobody will trust me with one i want to care for something or for some one and i want to care with a certain ardor even if you can believe it with a certain passion i cant just now feel ardent and passionate about a hospital or a dormitory do you know i sometimes think that i m a man of genius half finished the genius has been left out the faculty of expression is wanting but the need for expression remains and i spend my days groping for the latch of a closed door  what an immense number of words said cecilia after a pause to say you want to fall in love i ve no doubt you have as good a genius for that as any one if you would only trust it  of course i ve thought of that and i assure you i hold myself ready but evidently i m not inflammable is there in northampton some perfect epitome of the graces  of the graces said cecilia raising her eyebrows and suppressing too distinct a consciousness of being herself a rosy embodiment of several the household virtues are better represented there are some excellent girls and there are two or three very pretty ones i will have them here one by one to tea if you like  i should particularly like it especially as i should give you a chance to see by the profundity of my attention that if i am not happy it s not for want of taking pains  cecilia was silent a moment and then on the whole she resumed i dont think there are any worth asking there are none so very pretty none so very pleasing  are you very sure asked the young man rising and throwing away his cigarend  upon my word cried cecilia one would suppose i wished to keep you for myself of course i am sure but as the penalty of your insinuations i shall invite the plainest and prosiest damsel that can be found and leave you alone with her  rowland smiled even against her he said i should be sorry to conclude until i had given her my respectful attention  this little profession of ideal chivalry which closed the conversation was not quite so fanciful on mallets lips as it would have been on those of many another man as a rapid glance at his antecedents may help to make the reader perceive his life had been a singular mixture of the rough and the smooth he had sprung from a rigid puritan stock and had been brought up to think much more intently of the duties of this life than of its privileges and pleasures his progenitors had submitted in the matter of dogmatic theology to the relaxing influences of recent years but if rowlands youthful consciousness was not chilled by the menace of long punishment for brief transgression he had at least been made to feel that there ran through all things a strain of right and of wrong as different after all in their complexions as the texture to the spiritual sense of sundays and weekdays his father was a chip of the primal puritan block a man with an icy smile and a stony frown he had always bestowed on his son on principle more frowns than smiles and if the lad had not been turned to stone himself it was because nature had blessed him inwardly with a well of vivifying waters mrs mallet had been a miss rowland the daughter of a retired seacaptain once famous on the ships that sailed from salem and newburyport he had brought to port many a cargo which crowned the edifice of fortunes already almost colossal but he had also done a little sagacious trading on his own account and he was able to retire prematurely for so seaworthy a maritime organism upon a pension of his own providing he was to be seen for a year on the salem wharves smoking the best tobacco and eying the seaward horizon with an inveteracy which superficial minds interpreted as a sign of repentance at last one evening he disappeared beneath it as he had often done before this time however not as a commissioned navigator but simply as an amateur of an observing turn likely to prove oppressive to the officer in command of the vessel five months later his place at home knew him again and made the acquaintance also of a handsome blonde young woman of redundant contours speaking a foreign tongue the foreign tongue proved after much conflicting research to be the idiom of amsterdam and the young woman which was stranger still to be captain rowlands wife why he had gone forth so suddenly across the seas to marry her what had happened between them before and whetherthough it was of questionable propriety for a good citizen to espouse a young person of mysterious origin who did her hair in fantastically elaborate plaits and in whose appearance figure enjoyed such striking predominancehe would not have had a heavy weight on his conscience if he had remained an irresponsible bachelor these questions and many others bearing with varying degrees of immediacy on the subject were much propounded but scantily answered and this history need not be charged with resolving them mrs rowland for so handsome a woman proved a tranquil neighbor and an excellent housewife her extremely fresh complexion however was always suffused with an air of apathetic homesickness and she played her part in american society chiefly by having the little squares of brick pavement in front of her dwelling scoured and polished as nearly as possible into the likeness of dutch tiles rowland mallet remembered having seen her as a childan immensely stout whitefaced lady wearing a high cap of very stiff tulle speaking english with a formidable accent and suffering from dropsy captain rowland was a little bronzed and wizened man with eccentric opinions he advocated the creation of a public promenade along the sea with arbors and little green tables for the consumption of beer and a platform surrounded by chinese lanterns for dancing he especially desired the town library to be opened on sundays though as he never entered it on weekdays it was easy to turn the proposition into ridicule if therefore mrs mallet was a woman of an exquisite moral tone it was not that she had inherited her temper from an ancestry with a turn for casuistry jonas mallet at the time of his marriage was conducting with silent shrewdness a small unpromising business both his shrewdness and his silence increased with his years and at the close of his life he was an extremely welldressed wellbrushed gentleman with a frigid gray eye who said little to anybody but of whom everybody said that he had a very handsome fortune he was not a sentimental father and the roughness i just now spoke of in rowlands life dated from his early boyhood mr mallet whenever he looked at his son felt extreme compunction at having made a fortune he remembered that the fruit had not dropped ripe from the tree into his own mouth and determined it should be no fault of his if the boy was corrupted by luxury rowland therefore except for a good deal of expensive instruction in foreign tongues and abstruse sciences received the education of a poor mans son his fare was plain his temper familiar with the discipline of patched trousers and his habits marked by an exaggerated simplicity which it really cost a good deal of money to preserve unbroken he was kept in the country for months together in the midst of servants who had strict injunctions to see that he suffered no serious harm but were as strictly forbidden to wait upon him as no school could be found conducted on principles sufficiently rigorous he was attended at home by a master who set a high price on the understanding that he was to illustrate the beauty of abstinence not only by precept but by example rowland passed for a child of ordinary parts and certainly during his younger years was an excellent imitation of a boy who had inherited nothing whatever that was to make life easy he was passive pliable frank extremely slow at his books and inordinately fond of troutfishing his hair a memento of his dutch ancestry was of the fairest shade of yellow his complexion absurdly rosy and his measurement around the waist when he was about ten years old quite alarmingly large this however was but an episode in his growth he became afterwards a freshcolored yellowbearded man but he was never accused of anything worse than a tendency to corpulence he emerged from childhood a simple wholesome roundeyed lad with no suspicion that a less roundabout course might have been taken to make him happy but with a vague sense that his young experience was not a fair sample of human freedom and that he was to make a great many discoveries when he was about fifteen he achieved a momentous one he ascertained that his mother was a saint she had always been a very distinct presence in his life but so ineffably gentle a one that his sense was fully opened to it only by the danger of losing her she had an illness which for many months was liable at any moment to terminate fatally and during her longarrested convalescence she removed the mask which she had worn for years by her husbands order rowland spent his days at her side and felt before long as if he had made a new friend all his impressions at this period were commented and interpreted at leisure in the future and it was only then that he understood that his mother had been for fifteen years a perfectly unhappy woman her marriage had been an immitigable error which she had spent her life in trying to look straight in the face she found nothing to oppose to her husbands will of steel but the appearance of absolute compliance her spirit sank and she lived for a while in a sort of helpless moral torpor but at last as her child emerged from babyhood she began to feel a certain charm in patience to discover the uses of ingenuity and to learn that somehow or other one can always arrange ones life she cultivated from this time forward a little private plot of sentiment and it was of this secluded precinct that before her death she gave her son the key rowlands allowance at college was barely sufficient to maintain him decently and as soon as he graduated he was taken into his fathers countinghouse to do small drudgery on a proportionate salary for three years he earned his living as regularly as the obscure functionary in fustian who swept the office mr mallet was consistent but the perfection of his consistency was known only on his death he left but a third of his property to his son and devoted the remainder to various public institutions and local charities rowlands third was an easy competence and he never felt a moments jealousy of his fellowpensioners but when one of the establishments which had figured most advantageously in his fathers will bethought itself to affirm the existence of a later instrument in which it had been still more handsomely treated the young man felt a sudden passionate need to repel the claim by process of law there was a lively tussle but he gained his case immediately after which he made in another quarter a donation of the contested sum he cared nothing for the money but he had felt an angry desire to protest against a destiny which seemed determined to be exclusively salutary it seemed to him that he would bear a little spoiling and yet he treated himself to a very modest quantity and submitted without reserve to the great national discipline which began in 1861 when the civil war broke out he immediately obtained a commission and did his duty for three long years as a citizen soldier his duty was obscure but he never lost a certain private satisfaction in remembering that on two or three occasions it had been performed with something of an ideal precision he had disentangled himself from business and after the war he felt a profound disinclination to tie the knot again he had no desire to make money he had money enough and although he knew and was frequently reminded that a young man is the better for a fixed occupation he could discover no moral advantage in driving a lucrative trade yet few young men of means and leisure ever made less of a parade of idleness and indeed idleness in any degree could hardly be laid at the door of a young man who took life in the serious attentive reasoning fashion of our friend it often seemed to mallet that he wholly lacked the prime requisite of a graceful flaneurthe simple sensuous confident relish of pleasure he had frequent fits of extreme melancholy in which he declared that he was neither fish nor flesh nor good red herring he was neither an irresponsibly contemplative nature nor a sturdily practical one and he was forever looking in vain for the uses of the things that please and the charm of the things that sustain he was an awkward mixture of strong moral impulse and restless aesthetic curiosity and yet he would have made a most ineffective reformer and a very indifferent artist it seemed to him that the glow of happiness must be found either in action of some immensely solid kind on behalf of an idea or in producing a masterpiece in one of the arts oftenest perhaps he wished he were a vigorous young man of genius without a penny as it was he could only buy pictures and not paint them and in the way of action he had to content himself with making a rule to render scrupulous moral justice to handsome examples of it in others on the whole he had an incorruptible modesty with his blooming complexion and his serene gray eye he felt the friction of existence more than was suspected but he asked no allowance on grounds of temper he assumed that fate had treated him inordinately well and that he had no excuse for taking an illnatured view of life and he undertook constantly to believe that all women were fair all men were brave and the world was a delightful place of sojourn until the contrary had been distinctly proved  cecilias blooming garden and shady porch had seemed so friendly to repose and a cigar that she reproached him the next morning with indifference to her little parlor not less in its way a monument to her ingenious taste and by the way she added as he followed her in if i refused last night to show you a pretty girl i can at least show you a pretty boy  she threw open a window and pointed to a statuette which occupied the place of honor among the ornaments of the room rowland looked at it a moment and then turned to her with an exclamation of surprise she gave him a rapid glance perceived that her statuette was of altogether exceptional merit and then smiled knowingly as if this had long been an agreeable certainty  who did it where did you get it rowland demanded  oh said cecilia adjusting the light it s a little thing of mr hudsons  and who the deuce is mr hudson asked rowland but he was absorbed he lost her immediate reply the statuette in bronze something less than two feet high represented a naked youth drinking from a gourd the attitude was perfectly simple the lad was squarely planted on his feet with his legs a little apart his back was slightly hollowed his head thrown back and both hands raised to support the rustic cup there was a loosened fillet of wild flowers about his head and his eyes under their drooped lids looked straight into the cup on the base was scratched the greek word Δἱψα thirst the figure might have been some beautiful youth of ancient fablehylas or narcissus paris or endymion its beauty was the beauty of natural movement nothing had been sought to be represented but the perfection of an attitude this had been most attentively studied and it was exquisitely rendered rowland demanded more light dropped his head on this side and that uttered vague exclamations he said to himself as he had said more than once in the louvre and the vatican we ugly mortals what beautiful creatures we are nothing in a long time had given him so much pleasure hudsonhudson he asked again who is hudson  a young man of this place said cecilia  a young man how old  i suppose he is three or four and twenty  of this place you sayof northampton massachusetts  he lives here but he comes from virginia  is he a sculptor by profession  he s a lawstudent  rowland burst out laughing he has found something in blackstone that i never did he makes statues then simply for his pleasure  cecilia with a smile gave a little toss of her head for mine  i congratulate you said rowland i wonder whether he could be induced to do anything for me  this was a matter of friendship i saw the figure when he had modeled it in clay and of course greatly admired it he said nothing at the time but a week ago on my birthday he arrived in a buggy with this he had had it cast at the foundry at chicopee i believe it s a beautiful piece of bronze he begged me to accept  upon my word said mallet he does things handsomely and he fell to admiring the statue again  so then said cecilia it s very remarkable  why my dear cousin rowland answered mr hudson of virginia is an extraordinary then suddenly stopping is he a great friend of yours he asked  a great friend and cecilia hesitated i regard him as a child  well said rowland he s a very clever child tell me something about him i should like to see him  cecilia was obliged to go to her daughters musiclesson but she assured rowland that she would arrange for him a meeting with the young sculptor he was a frequent visitor and as he had not called for some days it was likely he would come that evening rowland left alone examined the statuette at his leisure and returned more than once during the day to take another look at it he discovered its weak points but it wore well it had the stamp of genius rowland envied the happy youth who in a new england village without aid or encouragement without models or resources had found it so easy to produce a lovely work  in the evening as he was smoking his cigar on the veranda a light quick step pressed the gravel of the garden path and in a moment a young man made his bow to cecilia it was rather a nod than a bow and indicated either that he was an old friend or that he was scantily versed in the usual social forms cecilia who was sitting near the steps pointed to a neighboring chair but the young man seated himself abruptly on the floor at her feet began to fan himself vigorously with his hat and broke out into a lively objurgation upon the hot weather i m dripping wet he said without ceremony  you walk too fast said cecilia you do everything too fast  i know it i know it he cried passing his hand through his abundant dark hair and making it stand out in a picturesque shock i cant be slow if i try there s something inside of me that drives me a restless fiend  cecilia gave a light laugh and rowland leaned forward in his hammock he had placed himself in it at bessies request and was playing that he was her baby and that she was rocking him to sleep she sat beside him swinging the hammock to and fro and singing a lullaby when he raised himself she pushed him back and said that the baby must finish its nap but i want to see the gentleman with the fiend inside of him said rowland  what is a fiend bessie demanded it s only mr hudson  very well i want to see him  oh never mind him said bessie with the brevity of contempt  you speak as if you did nt like him  i dont bessie affirmed and put rowland to bed again  the hammock was swung at the end of the veranda in the thickest shade of the vines and this fragment of dialogue had passed unnoticed rowland submitted a while longer to be cradled and contented himself with listening to mr hudsons voice it was a soft and not altogether masculine organ and was pitched on this occasion in a somewhat plaintive and pettish key the young mans mood seemed fretful he complained of the heat of the dust of a shoe that hurt him of having gone on an errand a mile to the other side of the town and found the person he was in search of had left northampton an hour before  wont you have a cup of tea cecilia asked perhaps that will restore your equanimity  aye by keeping me awake all night said hudson at the best it s hard enough to go down to the office with my nerves set on edge by a sleepless night i should perforce stay at home and be brutal to my poor mother  your mother is well i hope  oh she s as usual  and miss garland  she s as usual too every one everything is as usual nothing ever happens in this benighted town  i beg your pardon things do happen sometimes said cecilia here is a dear cousin of mine arrived on purpose to congratulate you on your statuette and she called to rowland to come and be introduced to mr hudson the young man sprang up with alacrity and rowland coming forward to shake hands had a good look at him in the light projected from the parlor window something seemed to shine out of hudsons face as a warning against a compliment of the idle unpondered sort  your statuette seems to me very good rowland said gravely it has given me extreme pleasure  and my cousin knows what is good said cecilia he s a connoisseur  hudson smiled and stared a connoisseur he cried laughing he s the first i ve ever seen let me see what they look like and he drew rowland nearer to the light have they all such good heads as that i should like to model yours  pray do said cecilia it will keep him a while he is running off to europe  ah to europe hudson exclaimed with a melancholy cadence as they sat down happy man  but the note seemed to rowland to be struck rather at random for he perceived no echo of it in the boyish garrulity of his later talk hudson was a tall slender young fellow with a singularly mobile and intelligent face rowland was struck at first only with its responsive vivacity but in a short time he perceived it was remarkably handsome the features were admirably chiseled and finished and a frank smile played over them as gracefully as a breeze among flowers the fault of the young mans whole structure was an excessive want of breadth the forehead though it was high and rounded was narrow the jaw and the shoulders were narrow and the result was an air of insufficient physical substance but mallet afterwards learned that this fair slim youth could draw indefinitely upon a mysterious fund of nervous force which outlasted and outwearied the endurance of many a sturdier temperament and certainly there was life enough in his eye to furnish an immortality it was a generous dark gray eye in which there came and went a sort of kindling glow which would have made a ruder visage striking and which gave at times to hudsons harmonious face an altogether extraordinary beauty there was to rowlands sympathetic sense a slightly pitiful disparity between the young sculptors delicate countenance and the shabby gentility of his costume he was dressed for a visita visit to a pretty woman he was clad from head to foot in a white linen suit which had never been remarkable for the felicity of its cut and had now quite lost that crispness which garments of this complexion can as ill spare as the backscene of a theatre the radiance of the footlights he wore a vivid blue cravat passed through a ring altogether too splendid to be valuable he pulled and twisted as he sat a pair of yellow kid gloves he emphasized his conversation with great dashes and flourishes of a light silvertipped walkingstick and he kept constantly taking off and putting on one of those slouched sombreros which are the traditional property of the virginian or carolinian of romance when this was on he was very picturesque in spite of his mock elegance and when it was off and he sat nursing it and turning it about and not knowing what to do with it he could hardly be said to be awkward he evidently had a natural relish for brilliant accessories and appropriated what came to his hand this was visible in his talk which abounded in the florid and sonorous he liked words with color in them  rowland who was but a moderate talker sat by in silence while cecilia who had told him that she desired his opinion upon her friend used a good deal of characteristic finesse in leading the young man to expose himself she perfectly succeeded and hudson rattled away for an hour with a volubility in which boyish unconsciousness and manly shrewdness were singularly combined he gave his opinion on twenty topics he opened up an endless budget of local gossip he described his repulsive routine at the office of messrs striker and spooner counselors at law and he gave with great felicity and gusto an account of the annual boatrace between harvard and yale which he had lately witnessed at worcester he had looked at the straining oarsmen and the swaying crowd with the eye of the sculptor rowland was a good deal amused and not a little interested whenever hudson uttered some peculiarly striking piece of youthful grandiloquence cecilia broke into a long light familiar laugh  what are you laughing at the young man then demanded have i said anything so ridiculous  go on go on cecilia replied you are too delicious show mr mallet how mr striker read the declaration of independence  hudson like most men with a turn for the plastic arts was an excellent mimic and he represented with a great deal of humor the accent and attitude of a pompous country lawyer sustaining the burden of this customary episode of our national festival the sonorous twang the seesaw gestures the odd pronunciation were vividly depicted but cecilias manner and the young mans quick response ruffled a little poor rowlands paternal conscience he wondered whether his cousin was not sacrificing the faculty of reverence in her clever protege to her need for amusement hudson made no serious rejoinder to rowlands compliment on his statuette until he rose to go rowland wondered whether he had forgotten it and supposed that the oversight was a sign of the natural selfsufficiency of genius but hudson stood a moment before he said good night twirled his sombrero and hesitated for the first time he gave rowland a clear penetrating glance and then with a wonderfully frank appealing smile you really meant he asked what you said a while ago about that thing of mine it is goodessentially good  i really meant it said rowland laying a kindly hand on his shoulder it is very good indeed it is as you say essentially good that is the beauty of it  hudsons eyes glowed and expanded he looked at rowland for some time in silence i have a notion you really know he said at last but if you dont it does nt much matter  my cousin asked me today said cecilia whether i supposed you knew yourself how good it is  hudson stared blushing a little perhaps not he cried  very likely said mallet i read in a book the other day that great talent in actionin fact the book said geniusis a kind of somnambulism the artist performs great feats in a dream we must not wake him up lest he should lose his balance  oh when he s back in bed again hudson answered with a laugh yes call it a dream it was a very happy one  tell me this said rowland did you mean anything by your young waterdrinker does he represent an idea is he a symbol  hudson raised his eyebrows and gently scratched his head why he s youth you know he s innocence he s health he s strength he s curiosity yes he s a good many things  and is the cup also a symbol  the cup is knowledge pleasure experience anything of that kind  well he s guzzling in earnest said rowland  hudson gave a vigorous nod aye poor fellow he s thirsty and on this he cried good night and bounded down the garden path  well what do you make of him asked cecilia returning a short time afterwards from a visit of investigation as to the sufficiency of bessies bedclothes  i confess i like him said rowland he s very immaturebut there s stuff in him  he s a strange being said cecilia musingly  who are his people what has been his education rowland asked  he has had no education beyond what he has picked up with little trouble for himself his mother is a widow of a massachusetts country family a little timid tremulous woman who is always on pins and needles about her son she had some property herself and married a virginian gentleman of good estates he turned out i believe a very licentious personage and made great havoc in their fortune everything or almost everything melted away including mr hudson himself this is literally true for he drank himself to death ten years ago his wife was left a widow with scanty means and a couple of growing boys she paid her husbands debts as best she could and came to establish herself here where by the death of a charitable relative she had inherited an oldfashioned ruinous house roderick our friend was her pride and joy but stephen the elder was her comfort and support i remember him later he was an ugly sturdy practical lad very different from his brother and in his way i imagine a very fine fellow when the war broke out he found that the new england blood ran thicker in his veins than the virginian and immediately obtained a commission he fell in some western battle and left his mother inconsolable roderick however has given her plenty to think about and she has induced him by some mysterious art to abide nominally at least in a profession that he abhors and for which he is about as fit i should say as i am to drive a locomotive he grew up a la grace de dieu and was horribly spoiled three or four years ago he graduated at a small college in this neighborhood where i am afraid he had given a good deal more attention to novels and billiards than to mathematics and greek since then he has been reading law at the rate of a page a day if he is ever admitted to practice i m afraid my friendship wont avail to make me give him my business good bad or indifferent the boy is essentially an artistan artist to his fingers ends  why then asked rowland does nt he deliberately take up the chisel  for several reasons in the first place i dont think he more than half suspects his talent the flame is smouldering but it is never fanned by the breath of criticism he sees nothing hears nothing to help him to selfknowledge he s hopelessly discontented but he does nt know where to look for help then his mother as she one day confessed to me has a holy horror of a profession which consists exclusively as she supposes in making figures of people without their clothes on sculpture to her mind is an insidious form of immorality and for a young man of a passionate disposition she considers the law a much safer investment her father was a judge she has two brothers at the bar and her elder son had made a very promising beginning in the same line she wishes the tradition to be perpetuated i m pretty sure the law wont make rodericks fortune and i m afraid it will in the long run spoil his temper  what sort of a temper is it  one to be trusted on the whole it is quick but it is generous i have known it to breathe flame and fury at ten oclock in the evening and soft sweet music early on the morrow it s a very entertaining temper to observe i fortunately can do so dispassionately for i m the only person in the place he has not quarreled with  has he then no society who is miss garland whom you asked about  a young girl staying with his mother a sort of faraway cousin a good plain girl but not a person to delight a sculptors eye roderick has a goodly share of the old southern arrogance he has the aristocratic temperament he will have nothing to do with the small townspeople he says they re ignoble he cannot endure his mothers friendsthe old ladies and the ministers and the teaparty people they bore him to death so he comes and lounges here and rails at everything and every one  this graceful young scoffer reappeared a couple of evenings later and confirmed the friendly feeling he had provoked on rowlands part he was in an easier mood than before he chattered less extravagantly and asked rowland a number of rather naif questions about the condition of the fine arts in new york and boston cecilia when he had gone said that this was the wholesome effect of rowlands praise of his statuette roderick was acutely sensitive and rowlands tranquil commendation had stilled his restless pulses he was ruminating the fullflavored verdict of culture rowland felt an irresistible kindness for him a mingled sense of his personal charm and his artistic capacity he had an indefinable attractionthe something divine of unspotted exuberant confident youth the next day was sunday and rowland proposed that they should take a long walk and that roderick should show him the country the young man assented gleefully and in the morning as rowland at the garden gate was giving his hostess godspeed on her way to church he came striding along the grassy margin of the road and outwhistling the music of the church bells it was one of those lovely days of august when you feel the complete exuberance of summer just warned and checked by autumn remember the day and take care you rob no orchards said cecilia as they separated  the young men walked away at a steady pace over hill and dale through woods and fields and at last found themselves on a grassy elevation studded with mossy rocks and red cedars just beneath them in a great shining curve flowed the goodly connecticut they flung themselves on the grass and tossed stones into the river they talked like old friends rowland lit a cigar and roderick refused one with a grimace of extravagant disgust he thought them vile things he did nt see how decent people could tolerate them rowland was amused and wondered what it was that made this illmannered speech seem perfectly inoffensive on rodericks lips he belonged to the race of mortals to be pitied or envied according as we view the matter who are not held to a strict account for their aggressions looking at him as he lay stretched in the shade rowland vaguely likened him to some beautiful supple restless brighteyed animal whose motions should have no deeper warrant than the tremulous delicacy of its structure and be graceful even when they were most inconvenient rowland watched the shadows on mount holyoke listened to the gurgle of the river and sniffed the balsam of the pines a gentle breeze had begun to tickle their summits and brought the smell of the mown grass across from the elmdotted river meadows he sat up beside his companion and looked away at the farspreading view it seemed to him beautiful and suddenly a strange feeling of prospective regret took possession of him something seemed to tell him that later in a foreign land he would remember it lovingly and penitently  it s a wretched business he said this practical quarrel of ours with our own country this everlasting impatience to get out of it is ones only safety then in flight this is an american day an american landscape an american atmosphere it certainly has its merits and some day when i am shivering with ague in classic italy i shall accuse myself of having slighted them  roderick kindled with a sympathetic glow and declared that america was good enough for him and that he had always thought it the duty of an honest citizen to stand by his own country and help it along he had evidently thought nothing whatever about it and was launching his doctrine on the inspiration of the moment the doctrine expanded with the occasion and he declared that he was above all an advocate for american art he did nt see why we should nt produce the greatest works in the world we were the biggest people and we ought to have the biggest conceptions the biggest conceptions of course would bring forth in time the biggest performances we had only to be true to ourselves to pitch in and not be afraid to fling imitation overboard and fix our eyes upon our national individuality i declare he cried there s a career for a man and i ve twenty minds to decide on the spot to embrace itto be the consummate typical original national american artist it s inspiring  rowland burst out laughing and told him that he liked his practice better than his theory and that a saner impulse than this had inspired his little waterdrinker roderick took no offense and three minutes afterwards was talking volubly of some humbler theme but half heeded by his companion who had returned to his cogitations at last rowland delivered himself of the upshot of these how would you like he suddenly demanded to go to rome  hudson stared and with a hungry laugh which speedily consigned our national individuality to perdition responded that he would like it reasonably well and i should like by the same token he added to go to athens to constantinople to damascus to the holy city of benares where there is a golden statue of brahma twenty feet tall  nay said rowland soberly if you were to go to rome you should settle down and work athens might help you but for the present i should nt recommend benares  it will be time to arrange details when i pack my trunk said hudson  if you mean to turn sculptor the sooner you pack your trunk the better  oh but i m a practical man what is the smallest sum per annum on which one can keep alive the sacred fire in rome  what is the largest sum at your disposal  roderick stroked his light moustache gave it a twist and then announced with mock pomposity three hundred dollars  the money question could be arranged said rowland there are ways of raising money  i should like to know a few i never yet discovered one  one consists said rowland in having a friend with a good deal more than he wants and not being too proud to accept a part of it  roderick stared a moment and his face flushed do you meando you mean he stammered he was greatly excited  rowland got up blushing a little and roderick sprang to his feet in three words if you are to be a sculptor you ought to go to rome and study the antique to go to rome you need money i m fond of fine statues but unfortunately i cant make them myself i have to order them i order a dozen from you to be executed at your convenience to help you i pay you in advance  roderick pushed off his hat and wiped his forehead still gazing at his companion you believe in me he cried at last  allow me to explain said rowland i believe in you if you are prepared to work and to wait and to struggle and to exercise a great many virtues and then i m afraid to say it lest i should disturb you more than i should help you you must decide for yourself i simply offer you an opportunity  hudson stood for some time profoundly meditative you have not seen my other things he said suddenly come and look at them  now  yes we ll walk home we ll settle the question  he passed his hand through rowlands arm and they retraced their steps they reached the town and made their way along a broad country street dusky with the shade of magnificent elms rowland felt his companions arm trembling in his own they stopped at a large white house flanked with melancholy hemlocks and passed through a little front garden paved with mosscoated bricks and ornamented with parterres bordered with high box hedges the mansion had an air of antiquated dignity but it had seen its best days and evidently sheltered a shrunken household mrs hudson rowland was sure might be seen in the garden of a morning in a white apron and a pair of old gloves engaged in frugal horticulture rodericks studio was behind in the basement a large empty room with the paper peeling off the walls this represented in the fashion of fifty years ago a series of small fantastic landscapes of a hideous pattern and the young sculptor had presumably torn it away in great scraps in moments of aesthetic exasperation on a board in a corner was a heap of clay and on the floor against the wall stood some dozen medallions busts and figures in various stages of completion to exhibit them roderick had to place them one by one on the end of a long packingbox which served as a pedestal he did so silently making no explanations and looking at them himself with a strange air of quickened curiosity most of the things were portraits and the three at which he looked longest were finished busts one was a colossal head of a negro tossed back defiant with distended nostrils one was the portrait of a young man whom rowland immediately perceived by the resemblance to be his deceased brother the last represented a gentleman with a pointed nose a long shaved upper lip and a tuft on the end of his chin this was a face peculiarly unadapted to sculpture but as a piece of modeling it was the best and it was admirable it reminded rowland in its homely veracity its artless artfulness of the works of the early italian renaissance on the pedestal was cut the namebarnaby striker esq rowland remembered that this was the appellation of the legal luminary from whom his companion had undertaken to borrow a reflected ray and although in the bust there was naught flagrantly set down in malice it betrayed comically to one who could relish the secret that the features of the original had often been scanned with an irritated eye besides these there were several rough studies of the nude and two or three figures of a fanciful kind the most noticeable and it had singular beauty was a small modeled design for a sepulchral monument that evidently of stephen hudson the young soldier lay sleeping eternally with his hand on his sword like an old crusader in a gothic cathedral  rowland made no haste to pronounce too much depended on his judgment upon my word cried hudson at last they seem to me very good  and in truth as rowland looked he saw they were good they were youthful awkward and ignorant the effort often was more apparent than the success but the effort was signally powerful and intelligent it seemed to rowland that it needed only to let itself go to compass great things here and there too success when grasped had something masterly rowland turned to his companion who stood with his hands in his pockets and his hair very much crumpled looking at him askance the light of admiration was in rowlands eyes and it speedily kindled a wonderful illumination on hudsons handsome brow rowland said at last gravely you have only to work  i think i know what that means roderick answered he turned away threw himself on a rickety chair and sat for some moments with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands workwork he said at last looking up ah if i could only begin he glanced round the room a moment and his eye encountered on the mantelshelf the vivid physiognomy of mr barnaby striker his smile vanished and he stared at it with an air of concentrated enmity i want to begin he cried and i cant make a better beginning than this goodby mr striker he strode across the room seized a mallet that lay at hand and before rowland could interfere in the interest of art if not of morals dealt a merciless blow upon mr strikers skull the bust cracked into a dozen pieces which toppled with a great crash upon the floor rowland relished neither the destruction of the image nor his companions look in working it but as he was about to express his displeasure the door opened and gave passage to a young girl she came in with a rapid step and startled face as if she had been summoned by the noise seeing the heap of shattered clay and the mallet in rodericks hand she gave a cry of horror her voice died away when she perceived that rowland was a stranger but she murmured reproachfully why roderick what have you done  roderick gave a joyous kick to the shapeless fragments i ve driven the moneychangers out of the temple he cried  the traces retained shape enough to be recognized and she gave a little moan of pity she seemed not to understand the young mans allegory but yet to feel that it pointed to some great purpose which must be an evil one from being expressed in such a lawless fashion and to perceive that rowland was in some way accountable for it she looked at him with a sharp frank mistrust and turned away through the open door rowland looked after her with extraordinary interest      chapter ii roderick  early on the morrow rowland received a visit from his new friend roderick was in a state of extreme exhilaration tempered however by a certain amount of righteous wrath he had had a domestic struggle but he had remained master of the situation he had shaken the dust of mr strikers office from his feet  i had it out last night with my mother he said i dreaded the scene for she takes things terribly hard she does nt scold nor storm and she does nt argue nor insist she sits with her eyes full of tears that never fall and looks at me when i displease her as if i were a perfect monster of depravity and the trouble is that i was born to displease her she does nt trust me she never has and she never will i dont know what i have done to set her against me but ever since i can remember i have been looked at with tears the trouble is he went on giving a twist to his moustache i ve been too absurdly docile i ve been sprawling all my days by the maternal fireside and my dear mother has grown used to bullying me i ve made myself cheap if i m not in my bed by eleven oclock the girl is sent out to explore with a lantern when i think of it i fairly despise my amiability it s rather a hard fate to live like a saint and to pass for a sinner i should like for six months to lead mrs hudson the life some fellows lead their mothers  allow me to believe said rowland that you would like nothing of the sort if you have been a good boy dont spoil it by pretending you dont like it you have been very happy i suspect in spite of your virtues and there are worse fates in the world than being loved too well i have not had the pleasure of seeing your mother but i would lay you a wager that that is the trouble she is passionately fond of you and her hopes like all intense hopes keep trembling into fears rowland as he spoke had an instinctive vision of how such a beautiful young fellow must be loved by his female relatives  roderick frowned and with an impatient gesture i do her justice he cried may she never do me less then after a moments hesitation i ll tell you the perfect truth he went on i have to fill a double place i have to be my brother as well as myself it s a good deal to ask of a man especially when he has so little talent as i for being what he is not when we were both young together i was the curled darling i had the silver mug and the biggest piece of pudding and i stayed indoors to be kissed by the ladies while he made mudpies in the garden and was never missed of course really he was worth fifty of me when he was brought home from vicksburg with a piece of shell in his skull my poor mother began to think she had nt loved him enough i remember as she hung round my neck sobbing before his coffin she told me that i must be to her everything that he would have been i swore in tears and in perfect good faith that i would but naturally i have not kept my promise i have been utterly different i have been idle restless egotistical discontented i have done no harm i believe but i have done no good my brother if he had lived would have made fifty thousand dollars and put gas and water into the house my mother brooding night and day on her bereavement has come to fix her ideal in offices of that sort judged by that standard i m nowhere  rowland was at loss how to receive this account of his friends domestic circumstances it was plaintive and yet the manner seemed to him overtrenchant you must lose no time in making a masterpiece he answered then with the proceeds you can give her gas from golden burners  so i have told her but she only half believes either in masterpiece or in proceeds she can see no good in my making statues they seem to her a snare of the enemy she would fain see me all my life tethered to the law like a browsing goat to a stake in that way i m in sight it s a more regular occupation that s all i can get out of her a more regular damnation is it a fact that artists in general are such wicked men i never had the pleasure of knowing one so i could nt confute her with an example she had the advantage of me because she formerly knew a portraitpainter at richmond who did her miniature in black lace mittens you may see it on the parlor table who used to drink raw brandy and beat his wife i promised her that whatever i might do to my wife i would never beat my mother and that as for brandy raw or diluted i detested it she sat silently crying for an hour during which i expended treasures of eloquence it s a good thing to have to reckon up ones intentions and i assure you as i pleaded my cause i was most agreeably impressed with the elevated character of my own i kissed her solemnly at last and told her that i had said everything and that she must make the best of it this morning she has dried her eyes but i warrant you it is nt a cheerful house i long to be out of it  i m extremely sorry said rowland to have been the prime cause of so much suffering i owe your mother some amends will it be possible for me to see her  if you ll see her it will smooth matters vastly though to tell the truth she ll need all her courage to face you for she considers you an agent of the foul fiend she does nt see why you should have come here and set me by the ears you are made to ruin ingenuous youths and desolate doting mothers i leave it to you personally to answer these charges you see what she cant forgivewhat she ll not really ever forgiveis your taking me off to rome rome is an evil word in my mothers vocabulary to be said in a whisper as you d say damnation northampton is in the centre of the earth and rome far away in outlying dusk into which it can do no christian any good to penetrate and there was i but yesterday a doomed habitue of that repository of every virtue mr strikers office  and does mr striker know of your decision asked rowland  to a certainty mr striker you must know is not simply a goodnatured attorney who lets me dogsear his lawbooks hes a particular friend and general adviser he looks after my mothers property and kindly consents to regard me as part of it our opinions have always been painfully divergent but i freely forgive him his zealous attempts to unscrew my headpiece and set it on hind part before he never understood me and it was useless to try to make him we speak a different languagewe re made of a different clay i had a fit of rage yesterday when i smashed his bust at the thought of all the bad blood he had stirred up in me it did me good and it s all over now i dont hate him any more i m rather sorry for him see how you ve improved me i must have seemed to him wilfully wickedly stupid and i m sure he only tolerated me on account of his great regard for my mother this morning i grasped the bull by the horns i took an armful of lawbooks that have been gathering the dust in my room for the last year and a half and presented myself at the office allow me to put these back in their places i said i shall never have need for them morenever more never more never more so you ve learned everything they contain asked striker leering over his spectacles better late than never i ve learned nothing that you can teach me i cried but i shall tax your patience no longer i m going to be a sculptor i m going to rome i wont bid you goodby just yet i shall see you again but i bid goodby here with rapture to these four detested wallsto this living tomb i did nt know till now how i hated it my compliments to mr spooner and my thanks for all you have not made of me  i m glad to know you are to see mr striker again rowland answered correcting a primary inclination to smile you certainly owe him a respectful farewell even if he has not understood you i confess you rather puzzle me there is another person he presently added whose opinion as to your new career i should like to know what does miss garland think  hudson looked at him keenly with a slight blush then with a conscious smile what makes you suppose she thinks anything he asked  because though i saw her but for a moment yesterday she struck me as a very intelligent person and i am sure she has opinions  the smile on rodericks mobile face passed rapidly into a frown oh she thinks what i think he answered  before the two young men separated rowland attempted to give as harmonious a shape as possible to his companions scheme i have launched you as i may say he said and i feel as if i ought to see you into port i am older than you and know the world better and it seems well that we should voyage a while together it s on my conscience that i ought to take you to rome walk you through the vatican and then lock you up with a heap of clay i sail on the fifth of september can you make your preparations to start with me  roderick assented to all this with an air of candid confidence in his friends wisdom that outshone the virtue of pledges i have no preparations to make he said with a smile raising his arms and letting them fall as if to indicate his unencumbered condition what i am to take with me i carry here and he tapped his forehead  happy man murmured rowland with a sigh thinking of the light stowage in his own organism in the region indicated by roderick and of the heavy one in deposit at his bankers of bags and boxes  when his companion had left him he went in search of cecilia she was sitting at work at a shady window and welcomed him to a low chintzcovered chair he sat some time thoughtfully snipping tape with her scissors he expected criticism and he was preparing a rejoinder at last he told her of rodericks decision and of his own influence in it cecilia besides an extreme surprise exhibited a certain fine displeasure at his not having asked her advice  what would you have said if i had he demanded  i would have said in the first place oh for pitys sake dont carry off the person in all northampton who amuses me most i would have said in the second place nonsense the boy is doing very well let well alone  that in the first five minutes what would you have said later  that for a man who is generally averse to meddling you were suddenly rather officious  rowlands countenance fell he frowned in silence cecilia looked at him askance gradually the spark of irritation faded from her eye  excuse my sharpness she resumed at last but i am literally in despair at losing roderick hudson his visits in the evening for the past year have kept me alive they have given a silver tip to leaden days i dont say he is of a more useful metal than other people but he is of a different one of course however that i shall miss him sadly is not a reason for his not going to seek his fortune men must work and women must weep  decidedly not said rowland with a good deal of emphasis he had suspected from the first hour of his stay that cecilia had treated herself to a private social luxury he had then discovered that she found it in hudsons lounging visits and boyish chatter and he had felt himself wondering at last whether judiciously viewed her gain in the matter was not the young mans loss it was evident that cecilia was not judicious and that her good sense habitually rigid under the demands of domestic economy indulged itself with a certain agreeable laxity on this particular point she liked her young friend just as he was she humored him flattered him laughed at him caressed himdid everything but advise him it was a flirtation without the benefits of a flirtation she was too old to let him fall in love with her which might have done him good and her inclination was to keep him young so that the nonsense he talked might never transgress a certain line it was quite conceivable that poor cecilia should relish a pastime but if one had philanthropically embraced the idea that something considerable might be made of roderick it was impossible not to see that her friendship was not what might be called tonic so rowland reflected in the glow of his newborn sympathy there was a later time when he would have been grateful if hudsons susceptibility to the relaxing influence of lovely women might have been limited to such inexpensive tribute as he rendered the excellent cecilia  i only desire to remind you she pursued that you are likely to have your hands full  i ve thought of that and i rather like the idea liking as i do the man i told you the other day you know that i longed to have something on my hands when it first occurred to me that i might start our young friend on the path of glory i felt as if i had an unimpeachable inspiration then i remembered there were dangers and difficulties and asked myself whether i had a right to step in between him and his obscurity my sense of his really having the divine flame answered the question he is made to do the things that humanity is the happier for i cant do such things myself but when i see a young man of genius standing helpless and hopeless for want of capital i feeland it s no affectation of humility i assure youas if it would give at least a reflected usefulness to my own life to offer him his opportunity  in the name of humanity i suppose i ought to thank you but i want first of all to be happy myself you guarantee us at any rate i hope the masterpieces  a masterpiece a year said rowland smiling for the next quarter of a century  it seems to me that we have a right to ask more to demand that you guarantee us not only the development of the artist but the security of the man  rowland became grave again his security  his moral his sentimental security here you see it s perfect we are all under a tacit compact to preserve it perhaps you believe in the necessary turbulence of genius and you intend to enjoin upon your protege the importance of cultivating his passions  on the contrary i believe that a man of genius owes as much deference to his passions as any other man but not a particle more and i confess i have a strong conviction that the artist is better for leading a quiet life that is what i shall preach to my protege as you call him by example as well as by precept you evidently believe he added in a moment that he will lead me a dance  nay i prophesy nothing i only think that circumstances with our young man have a great influence as is proved by the fact that although he has been fuming and fretting here for the last five years he has nevertheless managed to make the best of it and found it easy on the whole to vegetate transplanted to rome i fancy he ll put forth a denser leafage i should like vastly to see the change you must write me about it from stage to stage i hope with all my heart that the fruit will be proportionate to the foliage dont think me a bird of ill omen only remember that you will be held to a strict account  a man should make the most of himself and be helped if he needs help rowland answered after a long pause of course when a body begins to expand there comes in the possibility of bursting but i nevertheless approve of a certain tension of ones being it s what a man is meant for and then i believe in the essential salubrity of geniustrue genius  very good said cecilia with an air of resignation which made rowland for the moment seem to himself culpably eager we ll drink then today at dinner to the health of our friend      having it much at heart to convince mrs hudson of the purity of his intentions rowland waited upon her that evening he was ushered into a large parlor which by the light of a couple of candles he perceived to be very meagrely furnished and very tenderly and sparingly used the windows were open to the air of the summer night and a circle of three persons was temporarily awed into silence by his appearance one of these was mrs hudson who was sitting at one of the windows emptyhanded save for the pockethandkerchief in her lap which was held with an air of familiarity with its sadder uses near her on the sofa half sitting half lounging in the attitude of a visitor outstaying ceremony with one long leg flung over the other and a large foot in a clumsy boot swinging to and fro continually was a lean sandyhaired gentleman whom rowland recognized as the original of the portrait of mr barnaby striker at the table near the candles busy with a substantial piece of needlework sat the young girl of whom he had had a moments quickened glimpse in rodericks studio and whom he had learned to be miss garland his companions kinswoman this young ladys limpid penetrating gaze was the most effective greeting he received mrs hudson rose with a soft vague sound of distress and stood looking at him shrinkingly and waveringly as if she were sorely tempted to retreat through the open window mr striker swung his long leg a trifle defiantly no one evidently was used to offering hollow welcomes or telling polite fibs rowland introduced himself he had come he might say upon business  yes said mrs hudson tremulously i knowmy son has told me i suppose it is better i should see you perhaps you will take a seat  with this invitation rowland prepared to comply and turning grasped the first chair that offered itself  not that one said a full grave voice whereupon he perceived that a quantity of sewingsilk had been suspended and entangled over the back preparatory to being wound on reels he felt the least bit irritated at the curtness of the warning coming as it did from a young woman whose countenance he had mentally pronounced interesting and with regard to whom he was conscious of the germ of the inevitable desire to produce a responsive interest and then he thought it would break the ice to say something playfully urbane  oh you should let me take the chair he answered and have the pleasure of holding the skeins myself  for all reply to this sally he received a stare of undisguised amazement from miss garland who then looked across at mrs hudson with a glance which plainly said you see he s quite the insidious personage we feared the elder lady however sat with her eyes fixed on the ground and her two hands tightly clasped but touching her rowland felt much more compassion than resentment her attitude was not coldness it was a kind of dread almost a terror she was a small eager woman with a pale troubled face which added to her apparent age after looking at her for some minutes rowland saw that she was still young and that she must have been a very girlish bride she had been a pretty one too though she probably had looked terribly frightened at the altar she was very delicately made and roderick had come honestly by his physical slimness and elegance she wore no cap and her flaxen hair which was of extraordinary fineness was smoothed and confined with puritanic precision she was excessively shy and evidently very humbleminded it was singular to see a woman to whom the experience of life had conveyed so little reassurance as to her own resources or the chances of things turning out well rowland began immediately to like her and to feel impatient to persuade her that there was no harm in him and that twenty to one her son would make her a wellpleased woman yet he foresaw that she would be easy to persuade and that a benevolent conversational tone would probably make her pass fluttering from distrust into an oppressive extreme of confidence but he had an indefinable sense that the person who was testing that strong young eyesight of hers in the dim candlelight was less readily beguiled from her mysterious feminine preconceptions miss garland according to cecilias judgment as rowland remembered had not a countenance to inspire a sculptor but it seemed to rowland that her countenance might fairly inspire a man who was far from being a sculptor she was not pretty as the eye of habit judges prettiness but when you made the observation you somehow failed to set it down against her for you had already passed from measuring contours to tracing meanings in mary garlands face there were many possible ones and they gave you the more to think about that it was notlike roderick hudsons for instancea quick and mobile face over which expression flickered like a candle in a wind they followed each other slowly distinctly gravely sincerely and you might almost have fancied that as they came and went they gave her a sort of pain she was tall and slender and had an air of maidenly strength and decision she had a broad forehead and dark eyebrows a trifle thicker than those of classic beauties her gray eye was clear but not brilliant and her features were perfectly irregular her mouth was large fortunately for the principal grace of her physiognomy was her smile which displayed itself with magnificent amplitude rowland indeed had not yet seen her smile but something assured him that her rigid gravity had a radiant counterpart she wore a scanty white dress and had a nameless rustic air which would have led one to speak of her less as a young lady than as a young woman she was evidently a girl of a great personal force but she lacked pliancy she was hemming a kitchen towel with the aid of a large steel thimble she bent her serious eyes at last on her work again and let rowland explain himself  i have become suddenly so very intimate with your son he said at last addressing himself to mrs hudson that it seems just i should make your acquaintance  very just murmured the poor lady and after a moments hesitation was on the point of adding something more but mr striker here interposed after a prefatory clearance of the throat  i should like to take the liberty he said of addressing you a simple question for how long a period of time have you been acquainted with our young friend he continued to kick the air but his head was thrown back and his eyes fixed on the opposite wall as if in aversion to the spectacle of rowlands inevitable confusion  a very short time i confess hardly three days  and yet you call yourself intimate eh i have been seeing mr roderick daily these three years and yet it was only this morning that i felt as if i had at last the right to say that i knew him we had a few moments conversation in my office which supplied the missing links in the evidence so that now i do venture to say i m acquainted with mr roderick but wait three years sir like me and mr striker laughed with a closed mouth and a noiseless shake of all his long person  mrs hudson smiled confusedly at hazard miss garland kept her eyes on her stitches but it seemed to rowland that the latter colored a little oh in three years of course he said we shall know each other better before many years are over madam he pursued i expect the world to know him i expect him to be a great man  mrs hudson looked at first as if this could be but an insidious device for increasing her distress by the assistance of irony then reassured little by little by rowlands benevolent visage she gave him an appealing glance and a timorous really  but before rowland could respond mr striker again intervened do i fully apprehend your expression he asked our young friend is to become a great man  a great artist i hope said rowland  this is a new and interesting view said mr striker with an assumption of judicial calmness we have had hopes for mr roderick but i confess if i have rightly understood them they stopped short of greatness we should nt have taken the responsibility of claiming it for him what do you say ladies we all feel about him herehis mother miss garland and myselfas if his merits were rather in the line of theand mr striker waved his hand with a series of fantastic flourishes in the airof the light ornamental mr striker bore his recalcitrant pupil a grudge but he was evidently trying both to be fair and to respect the susceptibilities of his companions but he was unversed in the mysterious processes of feminine emotion ten minutes before there had been a general harmony of sombre views but on hearing rodericks limitations thus distinctly formulated to a stranger the two ladies mutely protested mrs hudson uttered a short faint sigh and miss garland raised her eyes toward their advocate and visited him with a short cold glance  i m afraid mrs hudson rowland pursued evading the discussion of rodericks possible greatness that you dont at all thank me for stirring up your sons ambition on a line which leads him so far from home i suspect i have made you my enemy  mrs hudson covered her mouth with her fingertips and looked painfully perplexed between the desire to confess the truth and the fear of being impolite my cousin is no ones enemy miss garland hereupon declared gently but with that same fine deliberateness with which she had made rowland relax his grasp of the chair  does she leave that to you rowland ventured to ask with a smile  we are inspired with none but christian sentiments said mr striker miss garland perhaps most of all miss garland and mr striker waved his hand again as if to perform an introduction which had been regrettably omitted is the daughter of a minister the granddaughter of a minister the sister of a minister rowland bowed deferentially and the young girl went on with her sewing with nothing apparently either of embarrassment or elation at the promulgation of these facts mr striker continued mrs hudson i see is too deeply agitated to converse with you freely she will allow me to address you a few questions would you kindly inform her as exactly as possible just what you propose to do with her son  the poor lady fixed her eyes appealingly on rowlands face and seemed to say that mr striker had spoken her desire though she herself would have expressed it less defiantly but rowland saw in mr strikers manywrinkled light blue eye shrewd at once and goodnatured that he had no intention of defiance and that he was simply pompous and conceited and sarcastically compassionate of any view of things in which roderick hudson was regarded in a serious light  do my dear madam demanded rowland i dont propose to do anything he must do for himself i simply offer him the chance he s to study to workhard i hope  not too hard please murmured mrs hudson pleadingly wheeling about from recent visions of dangerous leisure he s not very strong and i m afraid the climate of europe is very relaxing  ah study repeated mr striker to what line of study is he to direct his attention then suddenly with an impulse of disinterested curiosity on his own account how do you study sculpture anyhow  by looking at models and imitating them  at models eh to what kind of models do you refer  to the antique in the first place  ah the antique repeated mr striker with a jocose intonation do you hear madam roderick is going off to europe to learn to imitate the antique  i suppose it s all right said mrs hudson twisting herself in a sort of delicate anguish  an antique as i understand it the lawyer continued is an image of a pagan deity with considerable dirt sticking to it and no arms no nose and no clothing a precious model certainly  that s a very good description of many said rowland with a laugh  mercy truly asked mrs hudson borrowing courage from his urbanity  but a sculptors studies you intimate are not confined to the antique mr striker resumed after he has been looking three or four years at the objects i describe  he studies the living model said rowland  does it take three or four years asked mrs hudson imploringly  that depends upon the artists aptitude after twenty years a real artist is still studying  oh my poor boy moaned mrs hudson finding the prospect under every light still terrible  now this study of the living model mr striker pursued inform mrs hudson about that  oh dear no cried mrs hudson shrinkingly  that too said rowland is one of the reasons for studying in rome it s a handsome race you know and you find very wellmade people  i suppose they re no better made than a good tough yankee objected mr striker transposing his interminable legs the same god made us  surely sighed mrs hudson but with a questioning glance at her visitor which showed that she had already begun to concede much weight to his opinion rowland hastened to express his assent to mr strikers proposition  miss garland looked up and after a moments hesitation are the roman women very beautiful she asked  rowland too in answering hesitated he was looking straight at the young girl on the whole i prefer ours he said  she had dropped her work in her lap her hands were crossed upon it her head thrown a little back she had evidently expected a more impersonal answer and she was dissatisfied for an instant she seemed inclined to make a rejoinder but she slowly picked up her work in silence and drew her stitches again  rowland had for the second time the feeling that she judged him to be a person of a disagreeably sophisticated tone he noticed too that the kitchen towel she was hemming was terribly coarse and yet his answer had a resonant inward echo and he repeated to himself yes on the whole i prefer ours  well these models began mr striker you put them into an attitude i suppose  an attitude exactly  and then you sit down and look at them  you must not sit too long you must go at your clay and try to build up something that looks like them  well there you are with your model in an attitude on one side yourself in an attitude too i suppose on the other and your pile of clay in the middle building up as you say so you pass the morning after that i hope you go out and take a walk and rest from your exertions  unquestionably but to a sculptor who loves his work there is no time lost everything he looks at teaches or suggests something  that s a tempting doctrine to young men with a taste for sitting by the hour with the page unturned watching the flies buzz or the frost melt on the windowpane our young friend in this way must have laid up stores of information which i never suspected  very likely said rowland with an unresentful smile he will prove some day the completer artist for some of those lazy reveries  this theory was apparently very grateful to mrs hudson who had never had the case put for her son with such ingenious hopefulness and found herself disrelishing the singular situation of seeming to side against her own flesh and blood with a lawyer whose conversational tone betrayed the habit of crossquestioning  my son then she ventured to ask my son has greatwhat you would call great powers  to my sense very great powers  poor mrs hudson actually smiled broadly gleefully and glanced at miss garland as if to invite her to do likewise but the young girls face remained serious like the eastern sky when the opposite sunset is too feeble to make it glow do you really know she asked looking at rowland  one cannot know in such a matter save after proof and proof takes time but one can believe  and you believe  i believe  but even then miss garland vouchsafed no smile her face became graver than ever  well well said mrs hudson we must hope that it is all for the best  mr striker eyed his old friend for a moment with a look of some displeasure he saw that this was but a cunning feminine imitation of resignation and that through some untraceable process of transition she was now taking more comfort in the opinions of this insinuating stranger than in his own tough dogmas he rose to his feet without pulling down his waistcoat but with a wrinkled grin at the inconsistency of women well sir mr rodericks powers are nothing to me he said nor no use he makes of them good or bad he s no son of mine but in a friendly way i m glad to hear so fine an account of him i m glad madam you re so satisfied with the prospect affection sir you see must have its guarantees he paused a moment stroking his beard with his head inclined and one eye halfclosed looking at rowland the look was grotesque but it was significant and it puzzled rowland more than it amused him i suppose you re a very brilliant young man he went on very enlightened very cultivated quite up to the mark in the fine arts and all that sort of thing i m a plain practical old boy content to follow an honorable profession in a free country i did nt go off to the old world to learn my business no one took me by the hand i had to grease my wheels myself and such as i am i m a selfmade man every inch of me well if our young friend is booked for fame and fortune i dont suppose his going to rome will stop him but mind you it wont help him such a long way either if you have undertaken to put him through there s a thing or two you d better remember the crop we gather depends upon the seed we sow he may be the biggest genius of the age his potatoes wont come up without his hoeing them if he takes things so almighty easy aswell as one or two young fellows of genius i ve had under my eyehis produce will never gain the prize take the word for it of a man who has made his way inch by inch and does nt believe that we ll wake up to find our work done because we ve lain all night adreaming of it anything worth doing is devilish hard to do if your young protajay finds things easy and has a good time and says he likes the life it s a sign thatas i may sayyou had better step round to the office and look at the books that s all i desire to remark no offense intended i hope you ll have a firstrate time  rowland could honestly reply that this seemed pregnant sense and he offered mr striker a friendly handshake as the latter withdrew but mr strikers rather grim view of matters cast a momentary shadow on his companions and mrs hudson seemed to feel that it necessitated between them some little friendly agreement not to be overawed  rowland sat for some time longer partly because he wished to please the two women and partly because he was strangely pleased himself there was something touching in their unworldly fears and diffident hopes something almost terrible in the way poor little mrs hudson seemed to flutter and quiver with intense maternal passion she put forth one timid conversational venture after another and asked rowland a number of questions about himself his age his family his occupations his tastes his religious opinions rowland had an odd feeling at last that she had begun to consider him very exemplary and that she might make later some perturbing discovery he tried therefore to invent something that would prepare her to find him fallible but he could think of nothing it only seemed to him that miss garland secretly mistrusted him and that he must leave her to render him the service after he had gone of making him the object of a little firm derogation mrs hudson talked with lowvoiced eagerness about her son  he s very lovable sir i assure you when you come to know him you ll find him very lovable he s a little spoiled of course he has always done with me as he pleased but he s a good boy i m sure he s a good boy and every one thinks him very attractive i m sure he d be noticed anywhere dont you think he s very handsome sir he features his poor father i had anotherperhaps you ve been told he was killed and the poor little lady bravely smiled for fear of doing worse he was a very fine boy but very different from roderick roderick is a little strange he has never been an easy boy sometimes i feel like the goosewas nt it a goose dear and startled by the audacity of her comparison she appealed to miss garlandthe goose or the hen who hatched a swans egg i have never been able to give him what he needs i have always thought that in morein more brilliant circumstances he might find his place and be happy but at the same time i was afraid of the world for him it was so large and dangerous and dreadful no doubt i know very little about it i never suspected i confess that it contained persons of such liberality as yours  rowland replied that evidently she had done the world but scanty justice no objected miss garland after a pause it is like something in a fairy tale  what pray  your coming here all unknown so rich and so polite and carrying off my cousin in a golden cloud  if this was badinage miss garland had the best of it for rowland almost fell amusing silently over the question whether there was a possibility of irony in that transparent gaze before he withdrew mrs hudson made him tell her again that rodericks powers were extraordinary he had inspired her with a clinging caressing faith in his wisdom he will really do great things she asked the very greatest  i see no reason in his talent itself why he should not  well we ll think of that as we sit here alone she rejoined mary and i will sit here and talk about it so i give him up she went on as he was going i m sure you ll be the best of friends to him but if you should ever forget him or grow tired of him or lose your interest in him and he should come to any harm or any trouble please sir rememberand she paused with a tremulous voice  remember my dear madam  that he is all i havethat he is everythingand that it would be very terrible  in so far as i can help him he shall succeed was all rowland could say he turned to miss garland to bid her good night and she rose and put out her hand she was very straightforward but he could see that if she was too modest to be bold she was much too simple to be shy have you no charge to lay upon me he askedto ask her something  she looked at him a moment and then although she was not shy she blushed make him do his best she said  rowland noted the soft intensity with which the words were uttered do you take a great interest in him he demanded  certainly  then if he will not do his best for you he will not do it for me she turned away with another blush and rowland took his leave  he walked homeward thinking of many things the great northampton elms interarched far above in the darkness but the moon had risen and through scattered apertures was hanging the dusky vault with silver lamps there seemed to rowland something intensely serious in the scene in which he had just taken part he had laughed and talked and braved it out in selfdefense but when he reflected that he was really meddling with the simple stillness of this little new england home and that he had ventured to disturb so much living security in the interest of a faraway fantastic hypothesis he paused amazed at his temerity it was true as cecilia had said that for an unofficious man it was a singular position there stirred in his mind an odd feeling of annoyance with roderick for having thus peremptorily enlisted his sympathies as he looked up and down the long vista and saw the clear white houses glancing here and there in the broken moonshine he could almost have believed that the happiest lot for any man was to make the most of life in some such tranquil spot as that here were kindness comfort safety the warning voice of duty the perfect hush of temptation and as rowland looked along the arch of silvered shadow and out into the lucid air of the american night which seemed so doubly vast somehow and strange and nocturnal he felt like declaring that here was beauty toobeauty sufficient for an artist not to starve upon it as he stood lost in the darkness he presently heard a rapid tread on the other side of the road accompanied by a loud jubilant whistle and in a moment a figure emerged into an open gap of moonshine he had no difficulty in recognizing hudson who was presumably returning from a visit to cecilia roderick stopped suddenly and stared up at the moon with his face vividly illumined he broke out into a snatch of song  the splendor falls on castle walls and snowy summits old in story  and with a great musical roll of his voice he went swinging off into the darkness again as if his thoughts had lent him wings he was dreaming of the inspiration of foreign landsof castled crags and historic landscapes what a pity after all thought rowland as he went his own way that he should nt have a taste of it  it had been a very just remark of cecilias that roderick would change with a change in his circumstances rowland had telegraphed to new york for another berth on his steamer and from the hour the answer came hudsons spirits rose to incalculable heights he was radiant with goodhumor and his kindly jollity seemed the pledge of a brilliant future he had forgiven his old enemies and forgotten his old grievances and seemed every way reconciled to a world in which he was going to count as an active force he was inexhaustibly loquacious and fantastic and as cecilia said he had suddenly become so good that it was only to be feared he was going to start not for europe but for heaven he took long walks with rowland who felt more and more the fascination of what he would have called his giftedness rowland returned several times to mrs hudsons and found the two ladies doing their best to be happy in their companions happiness miss garland he thought was succeeding better than her demeanor on his first visit had promised he tried to have some especial talk with her but her extreme reserve forced him to content himself with such response to his rather urgent overtures as might be extracted from a keenly attentive smile it must be confessed however that if the response was vague the satisfaction was great and that rowland after his second visit kept seeing a lurking reflection of this smile in the most unexpected places it seemed strange that she should please him so well at so slender a cost but please him she did prodigiously and his pleasure had a quality altogether new to him it made him restless and a trifle melancholy he walked about absently wondering and wishing he wondered among other things why fate should have condemned him to make the acquaintance of a girl whom he would make a sacrifice to know better just as he was leaving the country for years it seemed to him that he was turning his back on a chance of happinesshappiness of a sort of which the slenderest germ should be cultivated he asked himself whether feeling as he did if he had only himself to please he would give up his journey andwait he had roderick to please now for whom disappointment would be cruel but he said to himself that certainly if there were no roderick in the case the ship should sail without him he asked hudson several questions about his cousin but roderick confidential on most points seemed to have reasons of his own for being reticent on this one his measured answers quickened rowlands curiosity for miss garland with her own irritating halfsuggestions had only to be a subject of guarded allusion in others to become intolerably interesting he learned from roderick that she was the daughter of a country minister a faraway cousin of his mother settled in another part of the state that she was one of a halfadozen daughters that the family was very poor and that she had come a couple of months before to pay his mother a long visit it is to be a very long one now he said for it is settled that she is to remain while i am away  the fermentation of contentment in rodericks soul reached its climax a few days before the young men were to make their farewells he had been sitting with his friends on cecilias veranda but for half an hour past he had said nothing lounging back against a vinewreathed column and gazing idly at the stars he kept caroling softly to himself with that indifference to ceremony for which he always found allowance and which in him had a sort of pleading grace at last springing up i want to strike out hard he exclaimed i want to do something violent to let off steam  i ll tell you what to do this lovely weather said cecilia give a picnic it can be as violent as you please and it will have the merit of leading off our emotion into a safe channel as well as yours  roderick laughed uproariously at cecilias very practical remedy for his sentimental need but a couple of days later nevertheless the picnic was given it was to be a family party but roderick in his magnanimous geniality insisted on inviting mr striker a decision which rowland mentally applauded and we ll have mrs striker too he said if she ll come to keep my mother in countenance and at any rate we ll have miss strikerthe divine petronilla the young lady thus denominated formed with mrs hudson miss garland and cecilia the feminine half of the company mr striker presented himself sacrificing a mornings work with a magnanimity greater even than rodericks and foreign support was further secured in the person of mr whitefoot the young orthodox minister roderick had chosen the feastingplace he knew it well and had passed many a summer afternoon there lying at his length on the grass and gazing at the blue undulations of the horizon it was a meadow on the edge of a wood with mossy rocks protruding through the grass and a little lake on the other side it was a cloudless august day rowland always remembered it and the scene and everything that was said and done with extraordinary distinctness roderick surpassed himself in friendly jollity and at one moment when exhilaration was at the highest was seen in mr strikers high white hat drinking champagne from a broken teacup to mr strikers health miss striker had her fathers pale blue eye she was dressed as if she were going to sit for her photograph and remained for a long time with roderick on a little promontory overhanging the lake mrs hudson sat all day with a little meek apprehensive smile she was afraid of an accident though unless miss striker who indeed was a little of a romp should push roderick into the lake it was hard to see what accident could occur mrs hudson was as neat and crisp and uncrumpled at the end of the festival as at the beginning mr whitefoot who but a twelvemonth later became a convert to episcopacy and was already cultivating a certain conversational sonority devoted himself to cecilia he had a little book in his pocket out of which he read to her at intervals lying stretched at her feet and it was a lasting joke with cecilia afterwards that she would never tell what mr whitefoots little book had been rowland had placed himself near miss garland while the feasting went forward on the grass she wore a socalled gypsy hata little straw hat tied down over her ears so as to cast her eyes into shadow by a ribbon passing outside of it when the company dispersed after lunch he proposed to her to take a stroll in the wood she hesitated a moment and looked toward mrs hudson as if for permission to leave her but mrs hudson was listening to mr striker who sat gossiping to her with relaxed magniloquence his waistcoat unbuttoned and his hat on his nose  you can give your cousin your society at any time said rowland but me perhaps you ll never see again  why then should we wish to be friends if nothing is to come of it she asked with homely logic but by this time she had consented and they were treading the fallen pineneedles  oh one must take all one can get said rowland if we can be friends for half an hour it s so much gained  do you expect never to come back to northampton again  never is a good deal to say but i go to europe for a long stay  do you prefer it so much to your own country  i will not say that but i have the misfortune to be a rather idle man and in europe the burden of idleness is less heavy than here  she was silent for a few minutes then at last in that then we are better than europe she said to a certain point rowland agreed with her but he demurred to make her say more  would nt it be better she asked to work to get reconciled to america than to go to europe to get reconciled to idleness  doubtless but you know work is hard to find  i come from a little place where every one has plenty said miss garland we all work every one i know works and really she added presently i look at you with curiosity you are the first unoccupied man i ever saw  dont look at me too hard said rowland smiling i shall sink into the earth what is the name of your little place  west nazareth said miss garland with her usual sobriety it is not so very little though it s smaller than northampton  i wonder whether i could find any work at west nazareth rowland said  you would not like it miss garland declared reflectively though there are far finer woods there than this we have miles and miles of woods  i might chop down trees said rowland that is if you allow it  allow it why where should we get our firewood then noticing that he had spoken jestingly she glanced at him askance though with no visible diminution of her gravity dont you know how to do anything have you no profession  rowland shook his head absolutely none  what do you do all day  nothing worth relating that s why i am going to europe there at least if i do nothing i shall see a great deal and if i m not a producer i shall at any rate be an observer  cant we observe everywhere  certainly and i really think that in that way i make the most of my opportunities though i confess he continued that i often remember there are things to be seen here to which i probably have nt done justice i should like for instance to see west nazareth  she looked round at him openeyed not apparently that she exactly supposed he was jesting for the expression of such a desire was not necessarily facetious but as if he must have spoken with an ulterior motive in fact he had spoken from the simplest of motives the girl beside him pleased him unspeakably and suspecting that her charm was essentially her own and not reflected from social circumstance he wished to give himself the satisfaction of contrasting her with the meagre influences of her education miss garlands second movement was to take him at his word since you are free to do as you please why dont you go there  i am not free to do as i please now i have offered your cousin to bear him company to europe he has accepted with enthusiasm and i cannot retract  are you going to europe simply for his sake  rowland hesitated a moment i think i may almost say so  miss garland walked along in silence do you mean to do a great deal for him she asked at last  what i can but my power of helping him is very small beside his power of helping himself  for a moment she was silent again you are very generous she said almost solemnly  no i am simply very shrewd roderick will repay me it s an investment at first i think he added shortly afterwards you would not have paid me that compliment you distrusted me  she made no attempt to deny it i did nt see why you should wish to make roderick discontented i thought you were rather frivolous  you did me injustice i dont think i m that  it was because you are unlike other menthose at least whom i have seen  in what way  why as you describe yourself you have no duties no profession no home you live for your pleasure  that s all very true and yet i maintain i m not frivolous  i hope not said miss garland simply they had reached a point where the woodpath forked and put forth two divergent tracks which lost themselves in a verdurous tangle miss garland seemed to think that the difficulty of choice between them was a reason for giving them up and turning back rowland thought otherwise and detected agreeable grounds for preference in the lefthand path as a compromise they sat down on a fallen log looking about him rowland espied a curious wild shrub with a spotted crimson leaf he went and plucked a spray of it and brought it to miss garland he had never observed it before but she immediately called it by its name she expressed surprise at his not knowing it it was extremely common he presently brought her a specimen of another delicate plant with a little bluestreaked flower i suppose that s common too he said but i have never seen itor noticed it at least she answered that this one was rare and meditated a moment before she could remember its name at last she recalled it and expressed surprise at his having found the plant in the woods she supposed it grew only in open marshes rowland complimented her on her fund of useful information  it s not especially useful she answered but i like to know the names of plants as i do those of my acquaintances when we walk in the woods at homewhich we do so muchit seems as unnatural not to know what to call the flowers as it would be to see some one in the town with whom we were not on speaking terms  apropos of frivolity rowland said i m sure you have very little of it unless at west nazareth it is considered frivolous to walk in the woods and nod to the nodding flowers do kindly tell me a little about yourself and to compel her to begin i know you come of a race of theologians he went on  no she replied deliberating they are not theologians though they are ministers we dont take a very firm stand upon doctrine we are practical rather we write sermons and preach them but we do a great deal of hard work beside  and of this hard work what has your share been  the hardest part doing nothing  what do you call nothing  i taught school a while i must make the most of that but i confess i did nt like it otherwise i have only done little things at home as they turned up  what kind of things  oh every kind if you had seen my home you would understand  rowland would have liked to make her specify but he felt a more urgent need to respect her simplicity than he had ever felt to defer to the complex circumstance of certain other women to be happy i imagine he contented himself with saying you need to be occupied you need to have something to expend yourself upon  that is not so true as it once was now that i am older i am sure i am less impatient of leisure certainly these two months that i have been with mrs hudson i have had a terrible amount of it and yet i have liked it and now that i am probably to be with her all the while that her son is away i look forward to more with a resignation that i dont quite know what to make of  it is settled then that you are to remain with your cousin  it depends upon their writing from home that i may stay but that is probable only i must not forget she said rising that the ground for my doing so is that she be not left alone  i am glad to know said rowland that i shall probably often hear about you i assure you i shall often think about you these words were half impulsive half deliberate they were the simple truth and he had asked himself why he should not tell her the truth and yet they were not all of it her hearing the rest would depend upon the way she received this she received it not only as rowland foresaw without a shadow of coquetry of any apparent thought of listening to it gracefully but with a slight movement of nervous deprecation which seemed to betray itself in the quickening of her step evidently if rowland was to take pleasure in hearing about her it would have to be a highly disinterested pleasure she answered nothing and rowland too as he walked beside her was silent but as he looked along the shadowwoven woodpath what he was really facing was a level three years of disinterestedness he ushered them in by talking composed civility until he had brought miss garland back to her companions  he saw her but once again he was obliged to be in new york a couple of days before sailing and it was arranged that roderick should overtake him at the last moment the evening before he left northampton he went to say farewell to mrs hudson the ceremony was brief rowland soon perceived that the poor little lady was in the melting mood and as he dreaded her tears he compressed a multitude of solemn promises into a silent handshake and took his leave miss garland she had told him was in the backgarden with roderick he might go out to them he did so and as he drew near he heard rodericks highpitched voice ringing behind the shrubbery in a moment emerging he found miss garland leaning against a tree with her cousin before her talking with great emphasis he asked pardon for interrupting them and said he wished only to bid her goodby she gave him her hand and he made her his bow in silence dont forget he said to roderick as he turned away and dont in this company repent of your bargain  i shall not let him said miss garland with something very like gayety i shall see that he is punctual he must go i owe you an apology for having doubted that he ought to and in spite of the dusk rowland could see that she had an even finer smile than he had supposed  roderick was punctual eagerly punctual and they went rowland for several days was occupied with material cares and lost sight of his sentimental perplexities but they only slumbered and they were sharply awakened the weather was fine and the two young men always sat together upon deck late into the evening one night toward the last they were at the stern of the great ship watching her grind the solid blackness of the ocean into phosphorescent foam they talked on these occasions of everything conceivable and had the air of having no secrets from each other but it was on rodericks conscience that this air belied him and he was too frank by nature moreover for permanent reticence on any point  i must tell you something he said at last i should like you to know it and you will be so glad to know it besides it s only a question of time three months hence probably you would have guessed it i am engaged to mary garland  rowland sat staring though the sea was calm it seemed to him that the ship gave a great dizzying lurch but in a moment he contrived to answer coherently engaged to miss garland i never supposedi never imagined  that i was in love with her roderick interrupted neither did i until this last fortnight but you came and put me into such ridiculous goodhumor that i felt an extraordinary desire to tell some woman that i adored her miss garland is a magnificent girl you know her too little to do her justice i have been quietly learning to know her these past three months and have been falling in love with her without being conscious of it it appeared when i spoke to her that she had a kindness for me so the thing was settled i must of course make some money before we can marry it s rather droll certainly to engage ones self to a girl whom one is going to leave the next day for years we shall be condemned for some time to come to do a terrible deal of abstract thinking about each other but i wanted her blessing on my career and i could not help asking for it unless a man is unnaturally selfish he needs to work for some one else than himself and i am sure i shall run a smoother and swifter course for knowing that that fine creature is waiting at northampton for news of my greatness if ever i am a dull companion and overaddicted to moping remember in justice to me that i am in love and that my sweetheart is five thousand miles away  rowland listened to all this with a sort of feeling that fortune had played him an elaboratelydevised trick it had lured him out into midocean and smoothed the sea and stilled the winds and given him a singularly sympathetic comrade and then it had turned and delivered him a thumping blow in midchest yes he said after an attempt at the usual formal congratulation you certainly ought to do betterwith miss garland waiting for you at northampton  roderick now that he had broken ground was eloquent and rung a hundred changes on the assurance that he was a very happy man then at last suddenly his climax was a yawn and he declared that he must go to bed rowland let him go alone and sat there late between sea and sky      chapter iii rome  one warm still day late in the roman autumn our two young men were sitting beneath one of the highstemmed pines of the villa ludovisi they had been spending an hour in the mouldy little gardenhouse where the colossal mask of the famous juno looks out with blank eyes from that dusky corner which must seem to her the last possible stage of a lapse from olympus then they had wandered out into the gardens and were lounging away the morning under the spell of their magical picturesqueness roderick declared that he would go nowhere else that after the juno it was a profanation to look at anything but sky and trees there was a fresco of guercino to which rowland though he had seen it on his former visit to rome went dutifully to pay his respects but roderick though he had never seen it declared that it could nt be worth a fig and that he did nt care to look at ugly things he remained stretched on his overcoat which he had spread on the grass while rowland went off envying the intellectual comfort of genius which can arrive at serene conclusions without disagreeable processes when the latter came back his friend was sitting with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands rowland in the geniality of a mood attuned to the mellow charm of a roman villa found a good word to say for the guercino but he chiefly talked of the view from the little belvedere on the roof of the casino and how it looked like the prospect from a castle turret in a fairy tale  very likely said roderick throwing himself back with a yawn but i must let it pass i have seen enough for the present i have reached the top of the hill i have an indigestion of impressions i must work them off before i go in for any more i dont want to look at any more of other peoples works for a monthnot even at natures own i want to look at roderick hudsons the result of it all is that i m not afraid i can but try as well as the rest of them the fellow who did that gazing goddess yonder only made an experiment the other day when i was looking at michael angelos moses i was seized with a kind of defiancea reaction against all this mere passive enjoyment of grandeur it was a rousing great success certainly that rose there before me but somehow it was not an inscrutable mystery and it seemed to me not perhaps that i should some day do as well but that at least i might  as you say you can but try said rowland success is only passionate effort  well the passion is blazing we have been piling on fuel handsomely it came over me just now that it is exactly three months to a day since i left northampton i cant believe it  it certainly seems more  it seems like ten years what an exquisite ass i was  do you feel so wise now  verily dont i look so surely i have nt the same face have nt i a different eye a different expression a different voice  i can hardly say because i have seen the transition but it s very likely you are in the literal sense of the word more civilized i dare say added rowland that miss garland would think so  that s not what she would call it she would say i was corrupted  rowland asked few questions about miss garland but he always listened narrowly to his companions voluntary observations  are you very sure he replied  why she s a stern moralist and she would infer from my appearance that i had become a cynical sybarite roderick had in fact a venetian watchchain round his neck and a magnificent roman intaglio on the third finger of his left hand  will you think i take a liberty asked rowland if i say you judge her superficially  for heavens sake cried roderick laughing dont tell me she s not a moralist it was for that i fell in love with her and with rigid virtue in her person  she is a moralist but not as you imply a narrow one that s more than a difference in degree it s a difference in kind i dont know whether i ever mentioned it but i admire her extremely there is nothing narrow about her but her experience everything else is large my impression of her is of a person of great capacity as yet wholly unmeasured and untested some day or other i m sure she will judge fairly and wisely of everything  stay a bit cried roderick you re a better catholic than the pope i shall be content if she judges fairly of meof my merits that is the rest she must not judge at all she s a grimly devoted little creature may she always remain so changed as i am i adore her none the less what becomes of all our emotions our impressions he went on after a long pause all the material of thought that life pours into us at such a rate during such a memorable three months as these there are twenty moments a weeka day for that matter some daysthat seem supreme twenty impressions that seem ultimate that appear to form an intellectual era but others come treading on their heels and sweeping them along and they all melt like water into water and settle the question of precedence among themselves the curious thing is that the more the mind takes in the more it has space for and that all ones ideas are like the irish people at home who live in the different corners of a room and take boarders  i fancy it is our peculiar good luck that we dont see the limits of our minds said rowland we are young compared with what we may one day be that belongs to youth it is perhaps the best part of it they say that old people do find themselves at last face to face with a solid blank wall and stand thumping against it in vain it resounds it seems to have something beyond it but it wont move that s only a reason for living with open doors as long as we can  open doors murmured roderick yes let us close no doors that open upon rome for this for the mind is eternal summer but though my doors may stand open today he presently added i shall see no visitors i want to pause and breathe i want to dream of a statue i have been working hard for three months i have earned a right to a reverie  rowland on his side was not without provision for reflection and they lingered on in broken desultory talk rowland felt the need for intellectual rest for a truce to present care for churches statues and pictures on even better grounds than his companion inasmuch as he had really been living rodericks intellectual life the past three months as well as his own as he looked back on these fullflavored weeks he drew a long breath of satisfaction almost of relief roderick thus far had justified his confidence and flattered his perspicacity he was rapidly unfolding into an ideal brilliancy he was changed even more than he himself suspected he had stepped without faltering into his birthright and was spending money intellectually as lavishly as a young heir who has just won an obstructive lawsuit rodericks glance and voice were the same doubtless as when they enlivened the summer dusk on cecilias veranda but in his person generally there was an indefinable expression of experience rapidly and easily assimilated rowland had been struck at the outset with the instinctive quickness of his observation and his free appropriation of whatever might serve his purpose he had not been for instance half an hour on english soil before he perceived that he was dressed like a rustic and he had immediately reformed his toilet with the most unerring tact his appetite for novelty was insatiable and for everything characteristically foreign as it presented itself he had an extravagant greeting but in half an hour the novelty had faded he had guessed the secret he had plucked out the heart of the mystery and was clamoring for a keener sensation at the end of a month he presented mentally a puzzling spectacle to his companion he had caught instinctively the keynote of the old world he observed and enjoyed he criticised and rhapsodized but though all things interested him and many delighted him none surprised him he had divined their logic and measured their proportions and referred them infallibly to their categories witnessing the rate at which he did intellectual execution on the general spectacle of european life rowland at moments felt vaguely uneasy for the future the boy was living too fast he would have said and giving alarming pledges to ennui in his later years but we must live as our pulses are timed and rodericks struck the hour very often he was by imagination though he never became in manner a natural man of the world he had intuitively as an artist what one may call the historic consciousness he had a relish for social subtleties and mysteries and in perception when occasion offered him an inch he never failed to take an ell a single glimpse of a social situation of the elder type enabled him to construct the whole with all its complex chiaroscuro and rowland more than once assured him that he made him believe in the metempsychosis and that he must have lived in european society in the last century as a gentleman in a cocked hat and brocaded waistcoat hudson asked rowland questions which poor rowland was quite unable to answer and of which he was equally unable to conceive where he had picked up the data roderick ended by answering them himself tolerably to his satisfaction and in a short time he had almost turned the tables and become in their walks and talks the accredited source of information rowland told him that when he turned sculptor a capital novelist was spoiled and that to match his eye for social detail one would have to go to honore de balzac in all this rowland took a generous pleasure he felt an especial kindness for his comrades radiant youthfulness of temperament he was so much younger than he himself had ever been and surely youth and genius hand in hand were the most beautiful sight in the world roderick added to this the charm of his more immediately personal qualities the vivacity of his perceptions the audacity of his imagination the picturesqueness of his phrase when he was pleasedand even more when he was displeasedhis abounding goodhumor his candor his unclouded frankness his unfailing impulse to share every emotion and impression with his friend all this made comradeship a pure felicity and interfused with a deeper amenity their long evening talks at cafe doors in italian towns  they had gone almost immediately to paris and had spent their days at the louvre and their evenings at the theatre roderick was divided in mind as to whether titian or mademoiselle delaporte was the greater artist they had come down through france to genoa and milan had spent a fortnight in venice and another in florence and had now been a month in rome roderick had said that he meant to spend three months in simply looking absorbing and reflecting without putting pencil to paper he looked indefatigably and certainly saw great thingsthings greater doubtless at times than the intentions of the artist and yet he made few false steps and wasted little time in theories of what he ought to like and to dislike he judged instinctively and passionately but never vulgarly at venice for a couple of days he had half a fit of melancholy over the pretended discovery that he had missed his way and that the only proper vestment of plastic conceptions was the coloring of titian and paul veronese then one morning the two young men had themselves rowed out to torcello and roderick lay back for a couple of hours watching a brownbreasted gondolier making superb muscular movements in high relief against the sky of the adriatic and at the end jerked himself up with a violence that nearly swamped the gondola and declared that the only thing worth living for was to make a colossal bronze and set it aloft in the light of a public square in rome his first care was for the vatican he went there again and again but the old imperial and papal city altogether delighted him only there he really found what he had been looking for from the firstthe complete antipodes of northampton and indeed rome is the natural home of those spirits with which we just now claimed fellowship for roderickthe spirits with a deep relish for the artificial element in life and the infinite superpositions of history it is the immemorial city of convention the stagnant roman air is charged with convention it colors the yellow light and deepens the chilly shadows and in that still recent day the most impressive convention in all history was visible to mens eyes in the roman streets erect in a gilded coach drawn by four black horses rodericks first fortnight was a high aesthetic revel he declared that rome made him feel and understand more things than he could express he was sure that life must have there for all ones senses an incomparable fineness that more interesting things must happen to one than anywhere else and he gave rowland to understand that he meant to live freely and largely and be as interested as occasion demanded rowland saw no reason to regard this as a menace of dissipation because in the first place there was in all dissipation refine it as one might a grossness which would disqualify it for rodericks favor and because in the second the young sculptor was a man to regard all things in the light of his art to hand over his passions to his genius to be dealt with and to find that he could live largely enough without exceeding the circle of wholesome curiosity rowland took immense satisfaction in his companions deep impatience to make something of all his impressions some of these indeed found their way into a channel which did not lead to statues but it was none the less a safe one he wrote frequent long letters to miss garland when rowland went with him to post them he thought wistfully of the fortune of the great looselywritten missives which cost roderick unconscionable sums in postage he received punctual answers of a more frugal form written in a clear minute hand on paper vexatiously thin if rowland was present when they came he turned away and thought of other thingsor tried to these were the only moments when his sympathy halted and they were brief for the rest he let the days go by unprotestingly and enjoyed rodericks serene efflorescence as he would have done a beautiful summer sunrise rome for the past month had been delicious the annual descent of the goths had not yet begun and sunny leisure seemed to brood over the city  roderick had taken out a notebook and was roughly sketching a memento of the great juno suddenly there was a noise on the gravel and the young men looking up saw three persons advancing one was a woman of middle age with a rather grand air and a great many furbelows she looked very hard at our friends as she passed and glanced back over her shoulder as if to hasten the step of a young girl who slowly followed her she had such an expansive majesty of mien that rowland supposed she must have some proprietary right in the villa and was not just then in a hospitable mood beside her walked a little elderly man tightly buttoned in a shabby black coat but with a flower in his lappet and a pair of soiled light gloves he was a grotesquelooking personage and might have passed for a gentleman of the old school reduced by adversity to playing cicerone to foreigners of distinction he had a little black eye which glittered like a diamond and rolled about like a ball of quicksilver and a white moustache cut short and stiff like a wornout brush he was smiling with extreme urbanity and talking in a low mellifluous voice to the lady who evidently was not listening to him at a considerable distance behind this couple strolled a young girl apparently of about twenty she was tall and slender and dressed with extreme elegance she led by a cord a large poodle of the most fantastic aspect he was combed and decked like a ram for sacrifice his trunk and haunches were of the most transparent pink his fleecy head and shoulders as white as jewelers cotton and his tail and ears ornamented with long blue ribbons he stepped along stiffly and solemnly beside his mistress with an air of conscious elegance there was something at first slightly ridiculous in the sight of a young lady gravely appended to an animal of these incongruous attributes and roderick with his customary frankness greeted the spectacle with a confident smile the young girl perceived it and turned her face full upon him with a gaze intended apparently to enforce greater deference it was not deference however her face provoked but startled submissive admiration rodericks smile fell dead and he sat eagerly staring a pair of extraordinary dark blue eyes a mass of dusky hair over a low forehead a blooming oval of perfect purity a flexible lip just touched with disdain the step and carriage of a tired princessthese were the general features of his vision the young lady was walking slowly and letting her long dress rustle over the gravel the young men had time to see her distinctly before she averted her face and went her way she left a vague sweet perfume behind her as she passed  immortal powers cried roderick what a vision in the name of transcendent perfection who is she he sprang up and stood looking after her until she rounded a turn in the avenue what a movement what a manner what a poise of the head i wonder if she would sit to me  you had better go and ask her said rowland laughing she is certainly most beautiful  beautiful she s beauty itselfshe s a revelation i dont believe she is livingshe s a phantasm a vapor an illusion  the poodle said rowland is certainly alive  nay he too may be a grotesque phantom like the black dog in faust  i hope at least that the young lady has nothing in common with mephistopheles she looked dangerous  if beauty is immoral as people think at northampton said roderick she is the incarnation of evil the mamma and the queer old gentleman moreover are a pledge of her reality who are they all  the prince and princess ludovisi and the principessina suggested rowland  there are no such people said roderick besides the little old man is not the papa rowland smiled wondering how he had ascertained these facts and the young sculptor went on the old man is a roman a hangeron of the mamma a useful personage who now and then gets asked to dinner the ladies are foreigners from some northern country i wont say which  perhaps from the state of maine said rowland  no she s not an american i ll lay a wager on that she s a daughter of this elder world we shall see her again i pray my stars but if we dont i shall have done something i never expected toi shall have had a glimpse of ideal beauty he sat down again and went on with his sketch of the juno scrawled away for ten minutes and then handed the result in silence to rowland rowland uttered an exclamation of surprise and applause the drawing represented the juno as to the position of the head the brow and the broad fillet across the hair but the eyes the mouth the physiognomy were a vivid portrait of the young girl with the poodle i have been wanting a subject said roderick there s one made to my hand and now for work  they saw no more of the young girl though roderick looked hopefully for some days into the carriages on the pincian she had evidently been but passing through rome naples or florence now happily possessed her and she was guiding her fleecy companion through the villa reale or the boboli gardens with the same superb defiance of irony roderick went to work and spent a month shut up in his studio he had an idea and he was not to rest till he had embodied it he had established himself in the basement of a huge dusky dilapidated old house in that long tortuous and preeminently roman street which leads from the corso to the bridge of st angelo the black archway which admitted you might have served as the portal of the augean stables but you emerged presently upon a mouldy little court of which the fourth side was formed by a narrow terrace overhanging the tiber here along the parapet were stationed half a dozen shapeless fragments of sculpture with a couple of meagre orangetrees in terracotta tubs and an oleander that never flowered the unclean historic river swept beneath behind were dusky reeking walls spotted here and there with hanging rags and flowerpots in windows opposite at a distance were the bare brown banks of the stream the huge rotunda of st angelo tipped with its seraphic statue the dome of st peters and the broadtopped pines of the villa doria the place was crumbling and shabby and melancholy but the river was delightful the rent was a trifle and everything was picturesque roderick was in the best humor with his quarters from the first and was certain that the working mood there would be intenser in an hour than in twenty years of northampton his studio was a huge empty room with a vaulted ceiling covered with vague dark traces of an old fresco which rowland when he spent an hour with his friend used to stare at vainly for some surviving coherence of floating draperies and clasping arms roderick had lodged himself economically in the same quarter he occupied a fifth floor on the ripetta but he was only at home to sleep for when he was not at work he was either lounging in rowlands more luxurious rooms or strolling through streets and churches and gardens  rowland had found a convenient corner in a stately old palace not far from the fountain of trevi and made himself a home to which books and pictures and prints and odds and ends of curious furniture gave an air of leisurely permanence he had the tastes of a collector he spent half his afternoons ransacking the dusty magazines of the curiositymongers and often made his way in quest of a prize into the heart of impecunious roman households which had been prevailed upon to listenwith closed doors and an impenetrably wary smileto proposals for an hereditary antique in the evening often under the lamp amid dropped curtains and the scattered gleam of firelight upon polished carvings and mellow paintings the two friends sat with their heads together criticising intaglios and etchings watercolor drawings and illuminated missals rodericks quick appreciation of every form of artistic beauty reminded his companion of the flexible temperament of those italian artists of the sixteenth century who were indifferently painters and sculptors sonneteers and engravers at times when he saw how the young sculptors day passed in a single sustained pulsation while his own was broken into a dozen conscious devices for disposing of the hours and intermingled with sighs half suppressed some of them for conscience sake over what he failed of in action and missed in possessionhe felt a pang of something akin to envy but rowland had two substantial aids for giving patience the air of contentment he was an inquisitive reader and a passionate rider he plunged into bulky german octavos on italian history and he spent long afternoons in the saddle ranging over the grassy desolation of the campagna as the season went on and the social groups began to constitute themselves he found that he knew a great many people and that he had easy opportunity for knowing others he enjoyed a quiet corner of a drawingroom beside an agreeable woman and although the machinery of what calls itself society seemed to him to have many superfluous wheels he accepted invitations and made visits punctiliously from the conviction that the only way not to be overcome by the ridiculous side of most of such observances is to take them with exaggerated gravity he introduced roderick right and left and suffered him to make his way himselfan enterprise for which roderick very soon displayed an allsufficient capacity wherever he went he made not exactly what is called a favorable impression but what from a practical point of view is bettera puzzling one he took to evening parties as a duck to water and before the winter was half over was the most freely and frequently discussed young man in the heterogeneous foreign colony rowlands theory of his own duty was to let him run his course and play his cards only holding himself ready to point out shoals and pitfalls and administer a friendly propulsion through tight places rodericks manners on the precincts of the pincian were quite the same as his manners on cecilias veranda that is they were no manners at all but it remained as true as before that it would have been impossible on the whole to violate ceremony with less of lasting offense he interrupted he contradicted he spoke to people he had never seen and left his social creditors without the smallest conversational interest on their loans he lounged and yawned he talked loud when he should have talked low and low when he should have talked loud many people in consequence thought him insufferably conceited and declared that he ought to wait till he had something to show for his powers before he assumed the airs of a spoiled celebrity but to rowland and to most friendly observers this judgment was quite beside the mark and the young mans undiluted naturalness was its own justification he was impulsive spontaneous sincere there were so many people at dinnertables and in studios who were not that it seemed worth while to allow this rare specimen all possible freedom of action if roderick took the words out of your mouth when you were just prepared to deliver them with the most effective accent he did it with a perfect good conscience and with no pretension of a better right to being heard but simply because he was full to overflowing of his own momentary thought and it sprang from his lips without asking leave there were persons who waited on your periods much more deferentially who were a hundred times more capable than roderick of a reflective impertinence roderick received from various sources chiefly feminine enough finelyadjusted advice to have established him in life as an embodiment of the proprieties and he received it as he afterwards listened to criticisms on his statues with unfaltering candor and goodhumor here and there doubtless as he went he took in a reef in his sail but he was too adventurous a spirit to be successfully tamed and he remained at most points the florid rather strident young virginian whose serene inflexibility had been the despair of mr striker all this was what friendly commentators still chiefly feminine alluded to when they spoke of his delightful freshness and critics of harsher sensibilities of the other sex when they denounced his damned impertinence his appearance enforced these impressionshis handsome face his radiant unaverted eyes his childish unmodulated voice afterwards when those who loved him were in tears there was something in all this unspotted comeliness that seemed to lend a mockery to the causes of their sorrow  certainly among the young men of genius who for so many ages have gone up to rome to test their powers none ever made a fairer beginning than roderick he rode his two horses at once with extraordinary good fortune he established the happiest modus vivendi betwixt work and play he wrestled all day with a mountain of clay in his studio and chattered half the night away in roman drawingrooms it all seemed part of a kind of divine facility he was passionately interested he was feeling his powers now that they had thoroughly kindled in the glowing aesthetic atmosphere of rome the ardent young fellow should be pardoned for believing that he never was to see the end of them he enjoyed immeasurably after the chronic obstruction of home the downright act of production he kept models in his studio till they dropped with fatigue he drew on other days at the capitol and the vatican till his own head swam with his eagerness and his limbs stiffened with the cold he had promptly set up a lifesized figure which he called an adam and was pushing it rapidly toward completion there were naturally a great many wiseheads who smiled at his precipitancy and cited him as one more example of yankee crudity a capital recruit to the great army of those who wish to dance before they can walk they were right but roderick was right too for the success of his statue was not to have been foreseen it partook really of the miraculous he never surpassed it afterwards and a good judge here and there has been known to pronounce it the finest piece of sculpture of our modern era to rowland it seemed to justify superbly his highest hopes of his friend and he said to himself that if he had invested his happiness in fostering a genius he ought now to be in possession of a boundless complacency there was something especially confident and masterly in the artists negligence of all such small picturesque accessories as might serve to label his figure to a vulgar apprehension if it represented the father of the human race and the primal embodiment of human sensation it did so in virtue of its look of balanced physical perfection and deeply eagerly sentient vitality rowland in fraternal zeal traveled up to carrara and selected at the quarries the most magnificent block of marble he could find and when it came down to rome the two young men had a celebration they drove out to albano breakfasted boisterously in their respective measure at the inn and lounged away the day in the sun on the top of monte cavo rodericks head was full of ideas for other works which he described with infinite spirit and eloquence as vividly as if they were ranged on their pedestals before him he had an indefatigable fancy things he saw in the streets in the country things he heard and read effects he saw just missed or halfexpressed in the works of others acted upon his mind as a kind of challenge and he was terribly restless until in some form or other he had taken up the glove and set his lance in rest  the adam was put into marble and all the world came to see it of the criticisms passed upon it this history undertakes to offer no record over many of them the two young men had a daily laugh for a month and certain of the formulas of the connoisseurs restrictive or indulgent furnished roderick with a permanent supply of humorous catchwords but people enough spoke flattering goodsense to make roderick feel as if he were already half famous the statue passed formally into rowlands possession and was paid for as if an illustrious name had been chiseled on the pedestal poor roderick owed every franc of the money it was not for this however but because he was so gloriously in the mood that denying himself all breathingtime on the same day he had given the last touch to the adam he began to shape the rough contour of an eve this went forward with equal rapidity and success roderick lost his temper time and again with his models who offered but a gross degenerate image of his splendid ideal but his ideal as he assured rowland became gradually such a fixed vivid presence that he had only to shut his eyes to behold a creature far more to his purpose than the poor girl who stood posturing at forty sous an hour the eve was finished in a month and the feat was extraordinary as well as the statue which represented an admirably beautiful woman when the spring began to muffle the rugged old city with its clambering festoons it seemed to him that he had done a handsome winters work and had fairly earned a holiday he took a liberal one and lounged away the lovely roman may doing nothing he looked very contented with himself perhaps at times a trifle too obviously but who could have said without good reason he was flushed with triumph this classic phrase portrayed him to rowlands sense he would lose himself in long reveries and emerge from them with a quickened smile and a heightened color rowland grudged him none of his smiles and took an extreme satisfaction in his two statues he had the adam and the eve transported to his own apartment and one warm evening in may he gave a little dinner in honor of the artist it was small but rowland had meant it should be very agreeably composed he thought over his friends and chose four they were all persons with whom he lived in a certain intimacy  one of them was an american sculptor of french extraction or remotely perhaps of italian for he rejoiced in the somewhat fervid name of gloriani he was a man of forty he had been living for years in paris and in rome and he now drove a very pretty trade in sculpture of the ornamental and fantastic sort in his youth he had had money but he had spent it recklessly much of it scandalously and at twentysix had found himself obliged to make capital of his talent this was quite inimitable and fifteen years of indefatigable exercise had brought it to perfection rowland admitted its power though it gave him very little pleasure what he relished in the man was the extraordinary vivacity and frankness not to call it the impudence of his ideas he had a definite practical scheme of art and he knew at least what he meant in this sense he was solid and complete there were so many of the aesthetic fraternity who were floundering in unknown seas without a notion of which way their noses were turned that gloriani conscious and compact unlimitedly intelligent and consummately clever dogmatic only as to his own duties and at once gracefully deferential and profoundly indifferent to those of others had for rowland a certain intellectual refreshment quite independent of the character of his works these were considered by most people to belong to a very corrupt and by many to a positively indecent school others thought them tremendously knowing and paid enormous prices for them and indeed to be able to point to one of glorianis figures in a shady corner of your library was tolerable proof that you were not a fool corrupt things they certainly were in the line of sculpture they were quite the latest fruit of time it was the artists opinion that there is no essential difference between beauty and ugliness that they overlap and intermingle in a quite inextricable manner that there is no saying where one begins and the other ends that hideousness grimaces at you suddenly from out of the very bosom of loveliness and beauty blooms before your eyes in the lap of vileness that it is a waste of wit to nurse metaphysical distinctions and a sadly meagre entertainment to caress imaginary lines that the thing to aim at is the expressive and the way to reach it is by ingenuity that for this purpose everything may serve and that a consummate work is a sort of hotchpotch of the pure and the impure the graceful and the grotesque its prime duty is to amuse to puzzle to fascinate to savor of a complex imagination glorianis statues were florid and meretricious they looked like magnified goldsmiths work they were extremely elegant but they had no charm for rowland he never bought one but gloriani was such an honest fellow and withal was so deluged with orders that this made no difference in their friendship the artist might have passed for a frenchman he was a great talker and a very picturesque one he was almost bald he had a small bright eye a broken nose and a moustache with waxed ends when sometimes he received you at his lodging he introduced you to a lady with a plain face whom he called madame glorianiwhich she was not  rowlands second guest was also an artist but of a very different type his friends called him sam singleton he was an american and he had been in rome a couple of years he painted small landscapes chiefly in watercolors rowland had seen one of them in a shop window had liked it extremely and ascertaining his address had gone to see him and found him established in a very humble studio near the piazza barberini where apparently fame and fortune had not yet found him out rowland took a fancy to him and bought several of his pictures singleton made few speeches but was grateful rowland heard afterwards that when he first came to rome he painted worthless daubs and gave no promise of talent improvement had come however hand in hand with patient industry and his talent though of a slender and delicate order was now incontestable it was as yet but scantily recognized and he had hard work to live rowland hung his little watercolors on the parlor wall and found that as he lived with them he grew very fond of them singleton was a diminutive dwarfish personage he looked like a precocious child he had a high protuberant forehead a transparent brown eye a perpetual smile an extraordinary expression of modesty and patience he listened much more willingly than he talked with a little fixed grateful grin he blushed when he spoke and always offered his ideas in a sidelong fashion as if the presumption were against them his modesty set them off and they were eminently to the point he was so perfect an example of the little noiseless laborious artist whom chance in the person of a moneyed patron has never taken by the hand that rowland would have liked to befriend him by stealth singleton had expressed a fervent admiration for rodericks productions but had not yet met the young master roderick was lounging against the chimneypiece when he came in and rowland presently introduced him the little watercolorist stood with folded hands blushing smiling and looking up at him as if roderick were himself a statue on a pedestal singleton began to murmur something about his pleasure his admiration the desire to make his compliment smoothly gave him a kind of grotesque formalism roderick looked down at him surprised and suddenly burst into a laugh singleton paused a moment and then with an intenser smile went on well sir your statues are beautiful all the same  rowlands two other guests were ladies and one of them miss blanchard belonged also to the artistic fraternity she was an american she was young she was pretty and she had made her way to rome alone and unaided she lived alone or with no other duenna than a bushybrowed old servingwoman though indeed she had a friendly neighbor in the person of a certain madame grandoni who in various social emergencies lent her a protecting wing and had come with her to rowlands dinner miss blanchard had a little money but she was not above selling her pictures these represented generally a bunch of dewsprinkled roses with the dewdrops very highly finished or else a wayside shrine and a peasant woman with her back turned kneeling before it she did backs very well but she was a little weak in faces flowers however were her speciality and though her touch was a little oldfashioned and finical she painted them with remarkable skill her pictures were chiefly bought by the english rowland had made her acquaintance early in the winter and as she kept a saddle horse and rode a great deal he had asked permission to be her cavalier in this way they had become almost intimate miss blanchards name was augusta she was slender pale and elegant looking she had a very pretty head and brilliant auburn hair which she braided with classical simplicity she talked in a sweet soft voice used language at times a trifle superfine and made literary allusions these had often a patriotic strain and rowland had more than once been irritated by her quotations from mrs sigourney in the corkwoods of monte mario and from mr willis among the ruins of veii rowland was of a dozen different minds about her and was half surprised at times to find himself treating it as a matter of serious moment whether he liked her or not he admired her and indeed there was something admirable in her combination of beauty and talent of isolation and tranquil selfsupport he used sometimes to go into the little highniched ordinary room which served her as a studio and find her working at a panel six inches square at an open casement profiled against the deep blue roman sky she received him with a meekeyed dignity that made her seem like a painted saint on a church window receiving the daylight in all her being the breath of reproach passed her by with folded wings and yet rowland wondered why he did not like her better if he failed the reason was not far to seek there was another woman whom he liked better an image in his heart which refused to yield precedence  on that evening to which allusion has been made when rowland was left alone between the starlight and the waves with the sudden knowledge that mary garland was to become another mans wife he had made after a while the simple resolution to forget her and every day since like a famous philosopher who wished to abbreviate his mourning for a faithful servant he had said to himself in substanceremember to forget mary garland sometimes it seemed as if he were succeeding then suddenly when he was least expecting it he would find her name inaudibly on his lips and seem to see her eyes meeting his eyes all this made him uncomfortable and seemed to portend a possible discord discord was not to his taste he shrank from imperious passions and the idea of finding himself jealous of an unsuspecting friend was absolutely repulsive more than ever then the path of duty was to forget mary garland and he cultivated oblivion as we may say in the person of miss blanchard her fine temper he said to himself was a trifle cold and conscious her purity prudish perhaps her culture pedantic but since he was obliged to give up hopes of mary garland providence owed him a compensation and he had fits of angry sadness in which it seemed to him that to attest his right to sentimental satisfaction he would be capable of falling in love with a woman he absolutely detested if she were the best that came in his way and what was the use after all of bothering about a possible which was only perhaps a dream even if mary garland had been free what right had he to assume that he would have pleased her the actual was good enough miss blanchard had beautiful hair and if she was a trifle oldmaidish there is nothing like matrimony for curing oldmaidishness  madame grandoni who had formed with the companion of rowlands rides an alliance which might have been called defensive on the part of the former and attractive on that of miss blanchard was an excessively ugly old lady highly esteemed in roman society for her homely benevolence and her shrewd and humorous good sense she had been the widow of a german archaeologist who had come to rome in the early ages as an attache of the prussian legation on the capitoline her good sense had been wanting on but a single occasion that of her second marriage this occasion was certainly a momentous one but these by common consent are not test cases a couple of years after her first husbands death she had accepted the hand and the name of a neapolitan musicmaster ten years younger than herself and with no fortune but his fiddlebow the marriage was most unhappy and the maestro grandoni was suspected of using the fiddlebow as an instrument of conjugal correction he had finally run off with a prima donna assoluta who it was to be hoped had given him a taste of the quality implied in her title he was believed to be living still but he had shrunk to a small black spot in madame grandonis life and for ten years she had not mentioned his name she wore a light flaxen wig which was never very artfully adjusted but this mattered little as she made no secret of it she used to say i was not always so ugly as this as a young girl i had beautiful golden hair very much the color of my wig she had worn from time immemorial an old blue satin dress and a white crape shawl embroidered in colors her appearance was ridiculous but she had an interminable teutonic pedigree and her manners in every presence were easy and jovial as became a lady whose ancestor had been cupbearer to frederick barbarossa thirty years observation of roman society had sharpened her wits and given her an inexhaustible store of anecdotes but she had beneath her crumpled bodice a deepwelling fund of teutonic sentiment which she communicated only to the objects of her particular favor rowland had a great regard for her and she repaid it by wishing him to get married she never saw him without whispering to him that augusta blanchard was just the girl  it seemed to rowland a sort of foreshadowing of matrimony to see miss blanchard standing gracefully on his hearthrug and blooming behind the central bouquet at his circular dinnertable the dinner was very prosperous and roderick amply filled his position as hero of the feast he had always an air of buoyant enjoyment in his work but on this occasion he manifested a good deal of harmless pleasure in his glory he drank freely and talked bravely he leaned back in his chair with his hands in his pockets and flung open the gates of his eloquence singleton sat gazing and listening openmouthed as if apollo in person were talking gloriani showed a twinkle in his eye and an evident disposition to draw roderick out rowland was rather regretful for he knew that theory was not his friends strong point and that it was never fair to take his measure from his talk  as you have begun with adam and eve said gloriani i suppose you are going straight through the bible he was one of the persons who thought roderick delightfully fresh  i may make a david said roderick but i shall not try any more of the old testament people i dont like the jews i dont like pendulous noses david the boy david is rather an exception you can think of him and treat him as a young greek standing forth there on the plain of battle between the contending armies rushing forward to let fly his stone he looks like a beautiful runner at the olympic games after that i shall skip to the new testament i mean to make a christ  you ll put nothing of the olympic games into him i hope said gloriani  oh i shall make him very different from the christ of tradition moremoreand roderick paused a moment to think this was the first that rowland had heard of his christ  more rationalistic i suppose suggested miss blanchard  more idealistic cried roderick the perfection of form you know to symbolize the perfection of spirit  for a companion piece said miss blanchard you ought to make a judas  never i mean never to make anything ugly the greeks never made anything ugly and i m a hellenist i m not a hebraist i have been thinking lately of making a cain but i should never dream of making him ugly he should be a very handsome fellow and he should lift up the murderous club with the beautiful movement of the fighters in the greek friezes who are chopping at their enemies  there s no use trying to be a greek said gloriani if phidias were to come back he would recommend you to give it up i am half italian and half french and as a whole a yankee what sort of a greek should i make i think the judas is a capital idea for a statue much obliged to you madame for the suggestion what an insidious little scoundrel one might make of him sitting there nursing his moneybag and his treachery there can be a great deal of expression in a pendulous nose my dear sir especially when it is cast in green bronze  very likely said roderick but it is not the sort of expression i care for i care only for perfect beauty there it is if you want to know it that s as good a profession of faith as another in future so far as my things are not positively beautiful you may set them down as failures for me it s either that or nothing it s against the taste of the day i know we have really lost the faculty to understand beauty in the large ideal way we stand like a race with shrunken muscles staring helplessly at the weights our forefathers easily lifted but i dont hesitate to proclaim iti mean to lift them again i mean to go in for big things that s my notion of my art i mean to do things that will be simple and vast and infinite you ll see if they wont be infinite excuse me if i brag a little all those italian fellows in the renaissance used to brag there was a sensation once common i am sure in the human breasta kind of religious awe in the presence of a marble image newly created and expressing the human type in superhuman purity when phidias and praxiteles had their statues of goddesses unveiled in the temples of the aegean dont you suppose there was a passionate beating of hearts a thrill of mysterious terror i mean to bring it back i mean to thrill the world again i mean to produce a juno that will make you tremble a venus that will make you swoon  so that when we come and see you said madame grandoni we must be sure and bring our smellingbottles and pray have a few soft sofas conveniently placed  phidias and praxiteles miss blanchard remarked had the advantage of believing in their goddesses i insist on believing for myself that the pagan mythology is not a fiction and that venus and juno and apollo and mercury used to come down in a cloud into this very city of rome where we sit talking nineteenth century english  nineteenth century nonsense my dear cried madame grandoni mr hudson may be a new phidias but venus and junothat s you and iarrived today in a very dirty cab and were cheated by the driver too  but my dear fellow objected gloriani you dont mean to say you are going to make over in cold blood those poor old exploded apollos and hebes  it wont matter what you call them said roderick they shall be simply divine forms they shall be beauty they shall be wisdom they shall be power they shall be genius they shall be daring that s all the greek divinities were  that s rather abstract you know said miss blanchard  my dear fellow cried gloriani you re delightfully young  i hope you ll not grow any older said singleton with a flush of sympathy across his large white forehead you can do it if you try  then there are all the forces and mysteries and elements of nature roderick went on i mean to do the morning i mean to do the night i mean to do the ocean and the mountains the moon and the west wind i mean to make a magnificent statue of america  americathe mountainsthe moon said gloriani you ll find it rather hard i m afraid to compress such subjects into classic forms  oh there s a way cried roderick and i shall think it out my figures shall make no contortions but they shall mean a tremendous deal  i m sure there are contortions enough in michael angelo said madame grandoni perhaps you dont approve of him  oh michael angelo was not me said roderick with sublimity there was a great laugh but after all roderick had done some fine things  rowland had bidden one of the servants bring him a small portfolio of prints and had taken out a photograph of rodericks little statue of the youth drinking it pleased him to see his friend sitting there in radiant ardor defending idealism against so knowing an apostle of corruption as gloriani and he wished to help the elder artist to be confuted he silently handed him the photograph  bless me cried gloriani did he do this  ages ago said roderick  gloriani looked at the photograph a long time with evident admiration  it s deucedly pretty he said at last but my dear young friend you cant keep this up  i shall do better said roderick  you will do worse you will become weak you will have to take to violence to contortions to romanticism in selfdefense this sort of thing is like a man trying to lift himself up by the seat of his trousers he may stand on tiptoe but he cant do more here you stand on tiptoe very gracefully i admit but you cant fly there s no use trying  my america shall answer you said roderick shaking toward him a tall glass of champagne and drinking it down  singleton had taken the photograph and was poring over it with a little murmur of delight  was this done in america he asked  in a square white wooden house at northampton massachusetts roderick answered  dear old white wooden houses said miss blanchard  if you could do as well as this there said singleton blushing and smiling one might say that really you had only to lose by coming to rome  mallet is to blame for that said roderick but i am willing to risk the loss  the photograph had been passed to madame grandoni it reminds me she said of the things a young man used to do whom i knew years ago when i first came to rome he was a german a pupil of overbeck and a votary of spiritual art he used to wear a black velvet tunic and a very low shirt collar he had a neck like a sickly crane and let his hair grow down to his shoulders his name was herr schafgans he never painted anything so profane as a man taking a drink but his figures were all of the simple and slender and angular pattern and nothing if not innocentlike this one of yours he would not have agreed with gloriani any more than you he used to come and see me very often and in those days i thought his tunic and his long neck infallible symptoms of genius his talk was all of gilded aureoles and beatific visions he lived on weak wine and biscuits and wore a lock of saint somebodys hair in a little bag round his neck if he was not a beato angelico it was not his own fault i hope with all my heart that mr hudson will do the fine things he talks about but he must bear in mind the history of dear mr schafgans as a warning against highflown pretensions one fine day this poor young man fell in love with a roman model though she had never sat to him i believe for she was a buxom boldfaced highcolored creature and he painted none but pale sickly women he offered to marry her and she looked at him from head to foot gave a shrug and consented but he was ashamed to set up his menage in rome they went to naples and there a couple of years afterwards i saw him the poor fellow was ruined his wife used to beat him and he had taken to drinking he wore a ragged black coat and he had a blotchy red face madame had turned washerwoman and used to make him go and fetch the dirty linen his talent had gone heaven knows where he was getting his living by painting views of vesuvius in eruption on the little boxes they sell at sorrento  moral dont fall in love with a buxom roman model said roderick i m much obliged to you for your story but i dont mean to fall in love with any one  gloriani had possessed himself of the photograph again and was looking at it curiously it s a happy bit of youth he said but you cant keep it upyou cant keep it up  the two sculptors pursued their discussion after dinner in the drawingroom rowland left them to have it out in a corner where rodericks eve stood over them in the shaded lamplight in vague white beauty like the guardian angel of the young idealist singleton was listening to madame grandoni and rowland took his place on the sofa near miss blanchard they had a good deal of familiar desultory talk every now and then madame grandoni looked round at them miss blanchard at last asked rowland certain questions about roderick who he was where he came from whether it was true as she had heard that rowland had discovered him and brought him out at his own expense rowland answered her questions to the last he gave a vague affirmative finally after a pause looking at him you re very generous miss blanchard said the declaration was made with a certain richness of tone but it brought to rowlands sense neither delight nor confusion he had heard the words before he suddenly remembered the grave sincerity with which miss garland had uttered them as he strolled with her in the woods the day of rodericks picnic they had pleased him then now he asked miss blanchard whether she would have some tea  when the two ladies withdrew he attended them to their carriage coming back to the drawingroom he paused outside the open door he was struck by the group formed by the three men they were standing before rodericks statue of eve and the young sculptor had lifted up the lamp and was showing different parts of it to his companions he was talking ardently and the lamplight covered his head and face rowland stood looking on for the group struck him with its picturesque symbolism roderick bearing the lamp and glowing in its radiant circle seemed the beautiful image of a genius which combined sincerity with power gloriani with his head on one side pulling his long moustache and looking keenly from halfclosed eyes at the lighted marble represented art with a worldly motive skill unleavened by faith the mere base maximum of cleverness poor little singleton on the other side with his hands behind him his head thrown back and his eyes following devoutly the course of rodericks elucidation might pass for an embodiment of aspiring candor with feeble wings to rise on in all this rodericks was certainly the beau role  gloriani turned to rowland as he came up and pointed back with his thumb to the statue with a smile half sardonic half goodnatured a pretty thinga devilish pretty thing he said it s as fresh as the foam in the milkpail he can do it once he can do it twice he can do it at a stretch half a dozen times butbut  he was returning to his former refrain but rowland intercepted him oh he will keep it up he said smiling i will answer for him  gloriani was not encouraging but roderick had listened smiling he was floating unperturbed on the tide of his deep selfconfidence now suddenly however he turned with a flash of irritation in his eye and demanded in a ringing voice in a word then you prophesy that i am to fail  gloriani answered imperturbably patting him kindly on the shoulder my dear fellow passion burns out inspiration runs to seed some fine day every artist finds himself sitting face to face with his lump of clay with his empty canvas with his sheet of blank paper waiting in vain for the revelation to be made for the muse to descend he must learn to do without the muse when the fickle jade forgets the way to your studio dont waste any time in tearing your hair and meditating on suicide come round and see me and i will show you how to console yourself  if i break down said roderick passionately i shall stay down if the muse deserts me she shall at least have her infidelity on her conscience  you have no business rowland said to gloriani to talk lightly of the muse in this company mr singleton too has received pledges from her which place her constancy beyond suspicion and he pointed out on the wall near by two small landscapes by the modest watercolorist  the sculptor examined them with deference and singleton himself began to laugh nervously he was trembling with hope that the great gloriani would be pleased yes these are fresh too gloriani said extraordinarily fresh how old are you  twentysix sir said singleton  for twentysix they are famously fresh they must have taken you a long time you work slowly  yes unfortunately i work very slowly one of them took me six weeks the other two months  upon my word the muse pays you long visits and gloriani turned and looked from head to foot at so unlikely an object of her favors singleton smiled and began to wipe his forehead very hard oh you said the sculptor you ll keep it up  a week after his dinnerparty rowland went into rodericks studio and found him sitting before an unfinished piece of work with a hanging head and a heavy eye he could have fancied that the fatal hour foretold by gloriani had struck roderick rose with a sombre yawn and flung down his tools it s no use he said i give it up  what is it  i have struck a shallow i have been sailing bravely but for the last day or two my keel has been crunching the bottom  a difficult place rowland asked with a sympathetic inflection looking vaguely at the roughly modeled figure  oh it s not the poor clay roderick answered the difficult place is here and he struck a blow on his heart i dont know what s the matter with me nothing comes all of a sudden i hate things my old things look ugly everything looks stupid  rowland was perplexed he was in the situation of a man who has been riding a blood horse at an even elastic gallop and of a sudden feels him stumble and balk as yet he reflected he had seen nothing but the sunshine of genius he had forgotten that it has its storms of course it had and he felt a flood of comradeship rise in his heart which would float them both safely through the worst weather why you re tired he said of course you re tired you have a right to be  do you think i have a right to be roderick asked looking at him  unquestionably after all you have done  well then right or wrong i am tired i certainly have done a fair winters work i want a change  rowland declared that it was certainly high time they should be leaving rome they would go north and travel they would go to switzerland to germany to holland to england roderick assented his eye brightened and rowland talked of a dozen things they might do roderick walked up and down he seemed to have something to say which he hesitated to bring out he hesitated so rarely that rowland wondered and at last asked him what was on his mind roderick stopped before him frowning a little  i have such unbounded faith in your goodwill he said that i believe nothing i can say would offend you  try it said rowland  well then i think my journey will do me more good if i take it alone i need nt say i prefer your society to that of any man living for the last six months it has been everything to me but i have a perpetual feeling that you are expecting something of me that you are measuring my doings by a terrifically high standard you are watching me i dont want to be watched i want to go my own way to work when i choose and to loaf when i choose it is not that i dont know what i owe you it is not that we are not friends it is simply that i want a taste of absolutely unrestricted freedom therefore i say let us separate  rowland shook him by the hand willingly do as you desire i shall miss you and i venture to believe you ll pass some lonely hours but i have only one request to make that if you get into trouble of any kind whatever you will immediately let me know  they began their journey however together and crossed the alps side by side muffled in one rug on the top of the st gothard coach rowland was going to england to pay some promised visits his companion had no plan save to ramble through switzerland and germany as fancy guided him he had money now that would outlast the summer when it was spent he would come back to rome and make another statue at a little mountain village by the way roderick declared that he would stop he would scramble about a little in the high places and doze in the shade of the pine forests the coach was changing horses the two young men walked along the village street picking their way between dunghills breathing the light cool air and listening to the plash of the fountain and the tinkle of cattlebells the coach overtook them and then rowland as he prepared to mount felt an almost overmastering reluctance  say the word he exclaimed and i will stop too  roderick frowned ah you dont trust me you dont think i m able to take care of myself that proves that i was right in feeling as if i were watched  watched my dear fellow said rowland i hope you may never have anything worse to complain of than being watched in the spirit in which i watch you but i will spare you even that goodby standing in his place as the coach rolled away he looked back at his friend lingering by the roadside a great snowmountain behind roderick was beginning to turn pink in the sunset the young man waved his hat still looking grave rowland settled himself in his place reflecting after all that this was a salubrious beginning of independence he was among forests and glaciers leaning on the pure bosom of nature and thenand thenwas it not in itself a guarantee against folly to be engaged to mary garland       chapter iv experience  rowland passed the summer in england staying with several old friends and two or three new ones on his arrival he felt it on his conscience to write to mrs hudson and inform her that her son had relieved him of his tutelage he felt that she considered him an incorruptible mentor following roderick like a shadow and he wished to let her know the truth but he made the truth very comfortable and gave a succinct statement of the young mans brilliant beginnings he owed it to himself he said to remind her that he had not judged lightly and that rodericks present achievements were more profitable than his inglorious drudgery at messrs striker  spooners he was now taking a wellearned holiday and proposing to see a little of the world he would work none the worse for this every artist needed to knock about and look at things for himself they had parted company for a couple of months for roderick was now a great man and beyond the need of going about with a keeper but they were to meet again in rome in the autumn and then he should be able to send her more good news meanwhile he was very happy in what roderick had already doneespecially happy in the happiness it must have brought to her he ventured to ask to be kindly commended to miss garland  his letter was promptly answeredto his surprise in miss garlands own hand the same mail brought also an epistle from cecilia the latter was voluminous and we must content ourselves with giving an extract  your letter was filled with an echo of that brilliant roman world which made me almost ill with envy for a week after i got it i thought northampton really unpardonably tame but i am drifting back again to my old deeps of resignation and i rush to the window when any one passes with all my old gratitude for small favors so roderick hudson is already a great man and you turn out to be a great prophet my compliments to both of you i never heard of anything working so smoothly and he takes it all very quietly and does nt lose his balance nor let it turn his head you judged him then in a day better than i had done in six months for i really did not expect that he would settle down into such a jogtrot of prosperity i believed he would do fine things but i was sure he would intersperse them with a good many follies and that his beautiful statues would spring up out of the midst of a straggling plantation of wild oats but from what you tell me mr striker may now go hang himself there is one thing however to say as a friend in the way of warning that candid soul can keep a secret and he may have private designs on your equanimity which you dont begin to suspect what do you think of his being engaged to miss garland the two ladies had given no hint of it all winter but a fortnight ago when those big photographs of his statues arrived they first pinned them up on the wall and then trotted out into the town made a dozen calls and announced the news mrs hudson did at least miss garland i suppose sat at home writing letters to me i confess the thing was a perfect surprise i had not a suspicion that all the while he was coming so regularly to make himself agreeable on my veranda he was quietly preferring his cousin to any one else not indeed that he was ever at particular pains to make himself agreeable i suppose he has picked up a few graces in rome but he must not acquire too many if he is too polite when he comes back miss garland will count him as one of the lost she will be a very good wife for a man of genius and such a one as they are often shrewd enough to take she ll darn his stockings and keep his accounts and sit at home and trim the lamp and keep up the fire while he studies the beautiful in pretty neighbors at dinnerparties the two ladies are evidently very happy and to do them justice very humbly grateful to you mrs hudson never speaks of you without tears in her eyes and i am sure she considers you a specially patented agent of providence verily it s a good thing for a woman to be in love miss garland has grown almost pretty i met her the other night at a teaparty she had a white rose in her hair and sang a sentimental ballad in a fine contralto voice  miss garlands letter was so much shorter that we may give it entire  my dear sirmrs hudson as i suppose you know has been for some time unable to use her eyes she requests me therefore to answer your favor of the 22d of june she thanks you extremely for writing and wishes me to say that she considers herself in every way under great obligations to you your account of her sons progress and the high estimation in which he is held has made her very happy and she earnestly prays that all may continue well with him he sent us a short time ago several large photographs of his two statues taken from different points of view we know little about such things but they seem to us wonderfully beautiful we sent them to boston to be handsomely framed and the man on returning them wrote us that he had exhibited them for a week in his store and that they had attracted great attention the frames are magnificent and the pictures now hang in a row on the parlor wall our only quarrel with them is that they make the old papering and the engravings look dreadfully shabby mr striker stood and looked at them the other day full five minutes and said at last that if rodericks head was running on such things it was no wonder he could not learn to draw up a deed we lead here so quiet and monotonous a life that i am afraid i can tell you nothing that will interest you mrs hudson requests me to say that the little more or less that may happen to us is of small account as we live in our thoughts and our thoughts are fixed on her dear son she thanks heaven he has so good a friend mrs hudson says that this is too short a letter but i can say nothing more  yours most respectfully  mary garland  it is a question whether the reader will know why but this letter gave rowland extraordinary pleasure he liked its very brevity and meagreness and there seemed to him an exquisite modesty in its saying nothing from the young girl herself he delighted in the formal address and conclusion they pleased him as he had been pleased by an angular gesture in some expressive girlish figure in an early painting the letter renewed that impression of strong feeling combined with an almost rigid simplicity which rodericks betrothed had personally given him and its homely stiffness seemed a vivid reflection of a life concentrated as the young girl had borrowed warrant from her companion to say in a single devoted idea the monotonous days of the two women seemed to rowlands fancy to follow each other like the ticktick of a great timepiece marking off the hours which separated them from the supreme felicity of clasping the faraway son and lover to lips sealed with the excess of joy he hoped that roderick now that he had shaken off the oppression of his own importunate faith was not losing a tolerant temper for the silent prayers of the two women at northampton  he was left to vain conjectures however as to rodericks actual moods and occupations he knew he was no letterwriter and that in the young sculptors own phrase he had at any time rather build a monument than write a note but when a month had passed without news of him he began to be half anxious and half angry and wrote him three lines in the care of a continental banker begging him at least to give some sign of whether he was alive or dead a week afterwards came an answerbrief and dated badenbaden i know i have been a great brute roderick wrote not to have sent you a word before but really i dont know what has got into me i have lately learned terribly well how to be idle i am afraid to think how long it is since i wrote to my mother or to mary heaven help thempoor patient trustful creatures i dont know how to tell you what i am doing it seems all amusing enough while i do it but it would make a poor show in a narrative intended for your formidable eyes i found baxter in switzerland or rather he found me and he grabbed me by the arm and brought me here i was walking twenty miles a day in the alps drinking milk in lonely chalets sleeping as you sleep and thinking it was all very good fun but baxter told me it would never do that the alps were dd rot that badenbaden was the place and that if i knew what was good for me i would come along with him it is a wonderful place certainly though thank the lord baxter departed last week blaspheming horribly at trente et quarante but you know all about it and what one doeswhat one is liable to do i have succumbed in a measure to the liabilities and i wish i had some one here to give me a thundering good blowing up not you dear friend you would draw it too mild you have too much of the milk of human kindness i have fits of horrible homesickness for my studio and i shall be devoutly grateful when the summer is over and i can go back and swing a chisel i feel as if nothing but the chisel would satisfy me as if i could rush in a rage at a block of unshaped marble there are a lot of the roman people here english and american i live in the midst of them and talk nonsense from morning till night there is also some one else and to her i dont talk sense nor thank heaven mean what i say i confess i need a months work to recover my selfrespect  these lines brought rowland no small perturbation the more that what they seemed to point to surprised him during the nine months of their companionship roderick had shown so little taste for dissipation that rowland had come to think of it as a canceled danger and it greatly perplexed him to learn that his friend had apparently proved so pliant to opportunity but rodericks allusions were ambiguous and it was possible they might simply mean that he was out of patience with a frivolous way of life and fretting wholesomely over his absent work it was a very good thing certainly that idleness should prove on experiment to sit heavily on his conscience nevertheless the letter needed to rowlands mind a key the key arrived a week later in common charity roderick wrote lend me a hundred pounds i have gambled away my last franci have made a mountain of debts send me the money first lecture me afterwards rowland sent the money by return of mail then he proceeded not to lecture but to think he hung his head he was acutely disappointed he had no right to be he assured himself but so it was roderick was young impulsive unpracticed in stoicism it was a hundred to one that he was to pay the usual vulgar tribute to folly but his friend had regarded it as securely gained to his own belief in virtue that he was not as other foolish youths are and that he would have been capable of looking at folly in the face and passing on his way rowland for a while felt a sore sense of wrath what right had a man who was engaged to that fine girl in northampton to behave as if his consciousness were a common blank to be overlaid with coarse sensations yes distinctly he was disappointed he had accompanied his missive with an urgent recommendation to leave badenbaden immediately and an offer to meet roderick at any point he would name the answer came promptly it ran as follows send me another fifty pounds i have been back to the tables i will leave as soon as the money comes and meet you at geneva there i will tell you everything  there is an ancient terrace at geneva planted with trees and studded with benches overlooked by gravely aristocratic old dwellings and overlooking the distant alps a great many generations have made it a loungingplace a great many friends and lovers strolled there a great many confidential talks and momentous interviews gone forward here one morning sitting on one of the battered green benches roderick as he had promised told his friend everything he had arrived late the night before he looked tired and yet flushed and excited he made no professions of penitence but he practiced an unmitigated frankness and his selfreprobation might be taken for granted he implied in every phrase that he had done with it all and that he was counting the hours till he could get back to work we shall not rehearse his confession in detail its main outline will be sufficient he had fallen in with some very idle people and had discovered that a little example and a little practice were capable of producing on his own part a considerable relish for their diversions what could he do he never read and he had no studio in one way or another he had to pass the time he passed it in dangling about several very pretty women in wonderful paris toilets and reflected that it was always something gained for a sculptor to sit under a tree looking at his leisure into a charming face and saying things that made it smile and play its muscles and part its lips and show its teeth attached to these ladies were certain gentlemen who walked about in clouds of perfume rose at midday and supped at midnight roderick had found himself in the mood for thinking them very amusing fellows he was surprised at his own taste but he let it take its course it led him to the discovery that to live with ladies who expect you to present them with expensive bouquets to ride with them in the black forest on welllooking horses to come into their operaboxes on nights when patti sang and prices were consequent to propose little light suppers at the conversation house after the opera or drives by moonlight to the castle to be always arrayed and anointed trinketed and glovedthat to move in such society we say though it might be a privilege was a privilege with a penalty attached but the tables made such things easy half the baden world lived by the tables roderick tried them and found that at first they smoothed his path delightfully this simplification of matters however was only momentary for he soon perceived that to seem to have money and to have it in fact exposed a goodlooking young man to peculiar liabilities at this point of his friends narrative rowland was reminded of madame de cruchecassee in the newcomes and though he had listened in tranquil silence to the rest of it he found it hard not to say that all this had been under the circumstances a very bad business roderick admitted it with bitterness and then told how muchmeasured simply financiallyit had cost him his luck had changed the tables had ceased to back him and he had found himself up to his knees in debt every penny had gone of the solid sum which had seemed a large equivalent of those shining statues in rome he had been an ass but it was not irreparable he could make another statue in a couple of months  rowland frowned for heavens sake he said dont play such dangerous games with your facility if you have got facility revere it respect it adore it treasure itdont speculate on it and he wondered what his companion up to his knees in debt would have done if there had been no goodnatured rowland mallet to lend a helping hand but he did not formulate his curiosity audibly and the contingency seemed not to have presented itself to rodericks imagination the young sculptor reverted to his late adventures again in the evening and this time talked of them more objectively as the phrase is more as if they had been the adventures of another person he related half a dozen droll things that had happened to him and as if his responsibility had been disengaged by all this free discussion he laughed extravagantly at the memory of them rowland sat perfectly grave on principle then roderick began to talk of half a dozen statues that he had in his head and set forth his design with his usual vividness suddenly as it was relevant he declared that his baden doings had not been altogether fruitless for that the lady who had reminded rowland of madame de cruchecassee was tremendously statuesque rowland at last said that it all might pass if he felt that he was really the wiser for it by the wiser he added i mean the stronger in purpose in will  oh dont talk about will roderick answered throwing back his head and looking at the stars this conversation also took place in the open air on the little island in the shooting rhone where jeanjacques has a monument the will i believe is the mystery of mysteries who can answer for his will who can say beforehand that it s strong there are all kinds of indefinable currents moving to and fro between ones will and ones inclinations people talk as if the two things were essentially distinct on different sides of ones organism like the heart and the liver mine i know are much nearer together it all depends upon circumstances i believe there is a certain group of circumstances possible for every man in which his will is destined to snap like a dry twig  my dear boy said rowland dont talk about the will being destined the will is destiny itself that s the way to look at it  look at it my dear rowland roderick answered as you find most comfortable one conviction i have gathered from my summers experience he went onit s as well to look it frankly in the faceis that i possess an almost unlimited susceptibility to the influence of a beautiful woman  rowland stared then strolled away softly whistling to himself he was unwilling to admit even to himself that this speech had really the sinister meaning it seemed to have in a few days the two young men made their way back to italy and lingered a while in florence before going on to rome in florence roderick seemed to have won back his old innocence and his preference for the pleasures of study over any others rowland began to think of the baden episode as a bad dream or at the worst as a mere sporadic piece of disorder without roots in his companions character they passed a fortnight looking at pictures and exploring for out the way bits of fresco and carving and roderick recovered all his earlier fervor of appreciation and comment in rome he went eagerly to work again and finished in a month two or three small things he had left standing on his departure he talked the most joyous nonsense about finding himself back in his old quarters on the first sunday afternoon following their return on their going together to saint peters he delivered himself of a lyrical greeting to the great church and to the city in general in a tone of voice so irrepressibly elevated that it rang through the nave in rather a scandalous fashion and almost arrested a procession of canons who were marching across to the choir he began to model a new statuea female figure of which he had said nothing to rowland it represented a woman leaning lazily back in her chair with her head drooping as if she were listening a vague smile on her lips and a pair of remarkably beautiful arms folded in her lap with rather less softness of contour it would have resembled the noble statue of agrippina in the capitol rowland looked at it and was not sure he liked it who is it what does it mean he asked  anything you please said roderick with a certain petulance i call it a reminiscence  rowland then remembered that one of the baden ladies had been statuesque and asked no more questions this after all was a way of profiting by experience a few days later he took his first ride of the season on the campagna and as on his homeward way he was passing across the long shadow of a ruined tower he perceived a small figure at a short distance bent over a sketchbook as he drew near he recognized his friend singleton the honest little painters face was scorched to flamecolor by the light of southern suns and borrowed an even deeper crimson from his gleeful greeting of his most appreciative patron he was making a careful and charming little sketch on rowlands asking him how he had spent his summer he gave an account of his wanderings which made poor mallet sigh with a sense of more contrasts than one he had not been out of italy but he had been delving deep into the picturesque heart of the lovely land and gathering a wonderful store of subjects he had rambled about among the unvisited villages of the apennines pencil in hand and knapsack on back sleeping on straw and eating black bread and beans but feasting on local color rioting as it were on chiaroscuro and laying up a treasure of pictorial observations he took a devout satisfaction in his hardearned wisdom and his happy frugality rowland went the next day by appointment to look at his sketches and spent a whole morning turning them over singleton talked more than he had ever done before explained them all and told some quaintly humorous anecdote about the production of each  dear me how i have chattered he said at last i am afraid you had rather have looked at the things in peace and quiet i did nt know i could talk so much but somehow i feel very happy i feel as if i had improved  that you have said rowland i doubt whether an artist ever passed a more profitable three months you must feel much more sure of yourself  singleton looked for a long time with great intentness at a knot in the floor yes he said at last in a fluttered tone i feel much more sure of myself i have got more facility and he lowered his voice as if he were communicating a secret which it took some courage to impart i hardly like to say it for fear i should after all be mistaken but since it strikes you perhaps it s true it s a great happiness i would not exchange it for a great deal of money  yes i suppose it s a great happiness said rowland i shall really think of you as living here in a state of scandalous bliss i dont believe it s good for an artist to be in such brutally high spirits  singleton stared for a moment as if he thought rowland was in earnest then suddenly fathoming the kindly jest he walked about the room scratching his head and laughing intensely to himself and mr hudson he said as rowland was going i hope he is well and happy  he is very well said rowland he is back at work again  ah there s a man cried singleton who has taken his start once for all and does nt need to stop and ask himself in fear and trembling every month or two whether he is advancing or not when he stops it s to rest and where did he spend his summer  the greater part of it at badenbaden  ah that s in the black forest cried singleton with profound simplicity they say you can make capital studies of trees there  no doubt said rowland with a smile laying an almost paternal hand on the little painters yellow head unfortunately trees are not rodericks line nevertheless he tells me that at baden he made some studies come when you can by the way he added after a moment to his studio and tell me what you think of something he has lately begun singleton declared that he would come delightedly and rowland left him to his work  he met a number of his last winters friends again and called upon madame grandoni upon miss blanchard and upon gloriani shortly after their return the ladies gave an excellent account of themselves madame grandoni had been taking seabaths at rimini and miss blanchard painting wild flowers in the tyrol her complexion was somewhat browned which was very becoming and her flowers were uncommonly pretty gloriani had been in paris and had come away in high goodhumor finding no one there in the artistworld cleverer than himself he came in a few days to rodericks studio one afternoon when rowland was present he examined the new statue with great deference said it was very promising and abstained considerately from irritating prophecies but rowland fancied he observed certain signs of inward jubilation on the clever sculptors part and walked away with him to learn his private opinion  certainly i liked it as well as i said gloriani declared in answer to rowlands anxious query or rather i liked it a great deal better i did nt say how much for fear of making your friend angry but one can leave him alone now for he s coming round i told you he could nt keep up the transcendental style and he has already broken down dont you see it yourself man  i dont particularly like this new statue said rowland  that s because you re a purist it s deuced clever it s deuced knowing it s deuced pretty but it is nt the topping high art of three months ago he has taken his turn sooner than i supposed what has happened to him has he been disappointed in love but that s none of my business i congratulate him on having become a practical man  roderick however was less to be congratulated than gloriani had taken it into his head to believe he was discontented with his work he applied himself to it by fits and starts he declared that he did nt know what was coming over him he was turning into a man of moods is this of necessity what a fellow must come tohe asked of rowland with a sort of peremptory flash in his eye which seemed to imply that his companion had undertaken to insure him against perplexities and was not fulfilling his contractthis damnable uncertainty when he goes to bed at night as to whether he is going to wake up in a working humor or in a swearing humor have we only a season over before we know it in which we can call our faculties our own six months ago i could stand up to my work like a man day after day and never dream of asking myself whether i felt like it but now some mornings it s the very devil to get going my statue looks so bad when i come into the studio that i have twenty minds to smash it on the spot and i lose three or four hours in sitting there moping and getting used to it  rowland said that he supposed that this sort of thing was the lot of every artist and that the only remedy was plenty of courage and faith and he reminded him of glorianis having forewarned him against these sterile moods the year before  gloriani s an ass said roderick almost fiercely he hired a horse and began to ride with rowland on the campagna this delicious amusement restored him in a measure to cheerfulness but seemed to rowland on the whole not to stimulate his industry their rides were always very long and roderick insisted on making them longer by dismounting in picturesque spots and stretching himself in the sun among a heap of overtangled stones he let the scorching roman luminary beat down upon him with an equanimity which rowland found it hard to emulate but in this situation roderick talked so much amusing nonsense that for the sake of his company rowland consented to be uncomfortable and often forgot that though in these diversions the days passed quickly they brought forth neither high art nor low and yet it was perhaps by their help after all that roderick secured several mornings of ardent work on his new figure and brought it to rapid completion one afternoon when it was finished rowland went to look at it and roderick asked him for his opinion  what do you think yourself rowland demanded not from pusillanimity but from real uncertainty  i think it is curiously bad roderick answered it was bad from the first it has fundamental vices i have shuffled them in a measure out of sight but i have not corrected them i canti canti cant he cried passionately they stare me in the facethey are all i see  rowland offered several criticisms of detail and suggested certain practicable changes but roderick differed with him on each of these points the thing had faults enough but they were not those faults rowland unruffled concluded by saying that whatever its faults might be he had an idea people in general would like it  i wish to heaven some person in particular would buy it and take it off my hands and out of my sight roderick cried what am i to do now he went on i have nt an idea i think of subjects but they remain mere lifeless names they are mere wordsthey are not images what am i to do  rowland was a trifle annoyed be a man he was on the point of saying and dont for heavens sake talk in that confoundedly querulous voice but before he had uttered the words there rang through the studio a loud peremptory ring at the outer door  roderick broke into a laugh talk of the devil he said and you see his horns if that s not a customer it ought to be  the door of the studio was promptly flung open and a lady advanced to the thresholdan imposing voluminous person who quite filled up the doorway rowland immediately felt that he had seen her before but he recognized her only when she moved forward and disclosed an attendant in the person of a little brighteyed elderly gentleman with a bristling white moustache then he remembered that just a year before he and his companion had seen in the ludovisi gardens a wonderfully beautiful girl strolling in the train of this conspicuous couple he looked for her now and in a moment she appeared following her companions with the same nonchalant step as before and leading her great snowwhite poodle decorated with motley ribbons the elder lady offered the two young men a sufficiently gracious salute the little old gentleman bowed and smiled with extreme alertness the young girl without casting a glance either at roderick or at rowland looked about for a chair and on perceiving one sank into it listlessly pulled her poodle towards her and began to rearrange his topknot rowland saw that even with her eyes dropped her beauty was still dazzling  i trust we are at liberty to enter said the elder lady with majesty we were told that mr hudson had no fixed day and that we might come at any time let us not disturb you  roderick as one of the lesser lights of the roman artworld had not hitherto been subject to incursions from inquisitive tourists and having no regular reception day was not versed in the usual formulas of welcome he said nothing and rowland looking at him saw that he was looking amazedly at the young girl and was apparently unconscious of everything else by jove he cried precipitately it s that goddess of the villa ludovisi rowland in some confusion did the honors as he could but the little old gentleman begged him with the most obsequious of smiles to give himself no trouble i have been in many a studio he said with his finger on his nose and a strong italian accent  we are going about everywhere said his companion i am passionately fond of art  rowland smiled sympathetically and let them turn to rodericks statue he glanced again at the young sculptor to invite him to bestir himself but roderick was still gazing wideeyed at the beautiful young mistress of the poodle who by this time had looked up and was gazing straight at him there was nothing bold in her look it expressed a kind of languid imperturbable indifference her beauty was extraordinary it grew and grew as the young man observed her in such a face the maidenly custom of averted eyes and ready blushes would have seemed an anomaly nature had produced it for mans delight and meant that it should surrender itself freely and coldly to admiration it was not immediately apparent however that the young lady found an answering entertainment in the physiognomy of her host she turned her head after a moment and looked idly round the room and at last let her eyes rest on the statue of the woman seated it being left to rowland to stimulate conversation he began by complimenting her on the beauty of her dog  yes he s very handsome she murmured he s a florentine the dogs in florence are handsomer than the people and on rowlands caressing him his name is stenterello she added stenterello give your hand to the gentleman this order was given in italian say buon giorno a lei  stenterello thrust out his paw and gave four short shrill barks upon which the elder lady turned round and raised her forefinger  my dear my dear remember where you are excuse my foolish child she added turning to roderick with an agreeable smile she can think of nothing but her poodle  i am teaching him to talk for me the young girl went on without heeding her mother to say little things in society it will save me a great deal of trouble stenterello love give a pretty smile and say tanti complimenti the poodle wagged his white pateit looked like one of those little pads in swansdown for applying powder to the faceand repeated the barking process  he is a wonderful beast said rowland  he is not a beast said the young girl a beast is something black and dirtysomething you cant touch  he is a very valuable dog the elder lady explained he was presented to my daughter by a florentine nobleman  it is not for that i care about him it is for himself he is better than the prince  my dear my dear repeated the mother in deprecating accents but with a significant glance at rowland which seemed to bespeak his attention to the glory of possessing a daughter who could deal in that fashion with the aristocracy  rowland remembered that when their unknown visitors had passed before them a year previous in the villa ludovisi roderick and he had exchanged conjectures as to their nationality and social quality roderick had declared that they were oldworld people but rowland now needed no telling to feel that he might claim the elder lady as a fellowcountrywoman she was a person of what is called a great deal of presence with the faded traces artfully revived here and there of once brilliant beauty her daughter had come lawfully by her loveliness but rowland mentally made the distinction that the mother was silly and that the daughter was not the mother had a very silly moutha mouth rowland suspected capable of expressing an inordinate degree of unreason the young girl in spite of her childish satisfaction in her poodle was not a person of feeble understanding rowland received an impression that for reasons of her own she was playing a part what was the part and what were her reasons she was interesting rowland wondered what were her domestic secrets if her mother was a daughter of the great republic it was to be supposed that the young girl was a flower of the american soil but her beauty had a robustness and tone uncommon in the somewhat facile loveliness of our western maidenhood she spoke with a vague foreign accent as if she had spent her life in strange countries the little italian apparently divined rowlands mute imaginings for he presently stepped forward with a bow like a master of ceremonies i have not done my duty he said in not announcing these ladies mrs light miss light  rowland was not materially the wiser for this information but roderick was aroused by it to the exercise of some slight hospitality he altered the light pulled forward two or three figures and made an apology for not having more to show i dont pretend to have anything of an exhibitioni am only a novice  indeeda novice for a novice this is very well mrs light declared cavaliere we have seen nothing better than this  the cavaliere smiled rapturously it is stupendous he murmured and we have been to all the studios  not to allheaven forbid cried mrs light but to a number that i have had pointed out by artistic friends i delight in studios they are the temples of the beautiful here below and if you are a novice mr hudson she went on you have already great admirers half a dozen people have told us that yours were among the things to see this gracious speech went unanswered roderick had already wandered across to the other side of the studio and was revolving about miss light ah he s gone to look at my beautiful daughter he is not the first that has had his head turned mrs light resumed lowering her voice to a confidential undertone a favor which considering the shortness of their acquaintance rowland was bound to appreciate the artists are all crazy about her when she goes into a studio she is fatal to the pictures and when she goes into a ballroom what do the other women say eh cavaliere  she is very beautiful rowland said gravely  mrs light who through her long goldcased glass was looking a little at everything and at nothing as if she saw it interrupted her random murmurs and exclamations and surveyed rowland from head to foot she looked at him all over apparently he had not been mentioned to her as a feature of rodericks establishment it was the gaze rowland felt which the vigilant and ambitious mamma of a beautiful daughter has always at her command for welldressed young men of candid physiognomy her inspection in this case seemed satisfactory are you also an artist she inquired with an almost caressing inflection it was clear that what she meant was something of this kind be so good as to assure me without delay that you are really the young man of substance and amiability that you appear  but rowland answered simply the formal questionnot the latent one dear me no i am only a friend of mr hudson  mrs light with a sigh returned to the statues and after mistaking the adam for a gladiator and the eve for a pocahontas declared that she could not judge of such things unless she saw them in the marble rowland hesitated a moment and then speaking in the interest of rodericks renown said that he was the happy possessor of several of his friends works and that she was welcome to come and see them at his rooms she bade the cavaliere make a note of his address ah you re a patron of the arts she said that s what i should like to be if i had a little money i delight in beauty in every form but all these people ask such monstrous prices one must be a millionaire to think of such things eh twenty years ago my husband had my portrait painted here in rome by papucci who was the great man in those days i was in a ball dress with all my jewels my neck and arms and all that the man got six hundred francs and thought he was very well treated those were the days when a family could live like princes in italy for five thousand scudi a year the cavaliere once upon a time was a great dandydont blush cavaliere any one can see that just as any one can see that i was once a pretty woman get him to tell you what he made a figure upon the railroads have brought in the vulgarians that s what i call it nowthe invasion of the vulgarians what are poor we to do  rowland had begun to murmur some remedial proposition when he was interrupted by the voice of miss light calling across the room mamma  my own love  this gentleman wishes to model my bust please speak to him  the cavaliere gave a little chuckle already he cried  rowland looked round equally surprised at the promptitude of the proposal roderick stood planted before the young girl with his arms folded looking at her as he would have done at the medicean venus he never paid compliments and rowland though he had not heard him speak could imagine the startling distinctness with which he made his request  he saw me a year ago the young girl went on and he has been thinking of me ever since her tone in speaking was peculiar it had a kind of studied inexpressiveness which was yet not the vulgar device of a drawl  i must make your daughters bustthat s all madame cried roderick with warmth  i had rather you made the poodles said the young girl is it very tiresome i have spent half my life sitting for my photograph in every conceivable attitude and with every conceivable coiffure i think i have posed enough  my dear child said mrs light it may be ones duty to pose but as to my daughters sitting to you sirto a young sculptor whom we dont knowit is a matter that needs reflection it is not a favor that s to be had for the mere asking  if i dont make her from life said roderick with energy i will make her from memory and if the thing s to be done you had better have it done as well as possible  mamma hesitates said miss light because she does nt know whether you mean she shall pay you for the bust i can assure you that she will not pay you a sou  my darling you forget yourself said mrs light with an attempt at majestic severity of course she added in a moment with a change of note the bust would be my own property  of course cried roderick impatiently  dearest mother interposed the young girl how can you carry a marble bust about the world with you is it not enough to drag the poor original  my dear you re nonsensical cried mrs light almost angrily  you can always sell it said the young girl with the same artful artlessness  mrs light turned to rowland who pitied her flushed and irritated she is very wicked today  the cavaliere grinned in silence and walked away on tiptoe with his hat to his lips as if to leave the field clear for action rowland on the contrary wished to avert the coming storm you had better not refuse he said to miss light until you have seen mr hudsons things in the marble your mother is to come and look at some that i possess  thank you i have no doubt you will see us i dare say mr hudson is very clever but i dont care for modern sculpture i cant look at it  you shall care for my bust i promise you cried roderick with a laugh  to satisfy miss light said the cavaliere one of the old greeks ought to come to life  it would be worth his while said roderick paying to rowlands knowledge his first compliment  i might sit to phidias if he would promise to be very amusing and make me laugh what do you say stenterello would you sit to phidias  we must talk of this some other time said mrs light we are in rome for the winter many thanks cavaliere call the carriage the cavaliere led the way out backing like a silverstick and miss light following her mother nodded without looking at them to each of the young men  immortal powers what a head cried roderick when they had gone there s my fortune  she is certainly very beautiful said rowland but i m sorry you have undertaken her bust  and why pray  i suspect it will bring trouble with it  what kind of trouble  i hardly know they are queer people the mamma i suspect is the least bit of an adventuress heaven knows what the daughter is  she s a goddess cried roderick  just so she is all the more dangerous  dangerous what will she do to me she does nt bite i imagine  it remains to be seen there are two kinds of womenyou ought to know it by this timethe safe and the unsafe miss light if i am not mistaken is one of the unsafe a word to the wise  much obliged said roderick and he began to whistle a triumphant air in honor apparently of the advent of his beautiful model  in calling this young lady and her mamma queer people rowland but roughly expressed his sentiment they were so marked a variation from the monotonous troop of his fellowcountry people that he felt much curiosity as to the sources of the change especially since he doubted greatly whether on the whole it elevated the type for a week he saw the two ladies driving daily in a wellappointed landau with the cavaliere and the poodle in the front seat from mrs light he received a gracious salute tempered by her native majesty but the young girl looking straight before her seemed profoundly indifferent to observers her extraordinary beauty however had already made observers numerous and given the habitues of the pincian plenty to talk about the echoes of their commentary reached rowlands ears but he had little taste for random gossip and desired a distinctly veracious informant he had found one in the person of madame grandoni for whom mrs light and her beautiful daughter were a pair of old friends  i have known the mamma for twenty years said this judicious critic and if you ask any of the people who have been living here as long as i you will find they remember her well i have held the beautiful christina on my knee when she was a little wizened baby with a very red face and no promise of beauty but those magnificent eyes ten years ago mrs light disappeared and has not since been seen in rome except for a few days last winter when she passed through on her way to naples then it was you met the trio in the ludovisi gardens when i first knew her she was the unmarried but very marriageable daughter of an old american painter of very bad landscapes which people used to buy from charity and use for fireboards his name was savage it used to make every one laugh he was such a mild melancholy pitiful old gentleman he had married a horrible wife an englishwoman who had been on the stage it was said she used to beat poor savage with his mahlstick and when the domestic finances were low to lock him up in his studio and tell him he should nt come out until he had painted half a dozen of his daubs she had a good deal of showy beauty she would then go forth and her beauty helping she would make certain people take the pictures it helped her at last to make an english lord run away with her at the time i speak of she had quite disappeared mrs light was then a very handsome girl though by no means so handsome as her daughter has now become mr light was an american consul newly appointed at one of the adriatic ports he was a mild fairwhiskered young man with some little property and my impression is that he had got into bad company at home and that his family procured him his place to keep him out of harms way he came up to rome on a holiday fell in love with miss savage and married her on the spot he had not been married three years when he was drowned in the adriatic no one ever knew how the young widow came back to rome to her father and here shortly afterwards in the shadow of saint peters her little girl was born it might have been supposed that mrs light would marry again and i know she had opportunities but she overreached herself she would take nothing less than a title and a fortune and they were not forthcoming she was admired and very fond of admiration very vain very worldly very silly she remained a pretty widow with a surprising variety of bonnets and a dozen men always in her train giacosa dates from this period he calls himself a roman but i have an impression he came up from ancona with her he was lami de la maison he used to hold her bouquets clean her gloves i was told run her errands get her operaboxes and fight her battles with the shopkeepers for this he needed courage for she was smothered in debt she at last left rome to escape her creditors many of them must remember her still but she seems now to have money to satisfy them she left her poor old father here alonehelpless infirm and unable to work a subscription was shortly afterwards taken up among the foreigners and he was sent back to america where as i afterwards heard he died in some sort of asylum from time to time for several years i heard vaguely of mrs light as a wandering beauty at french and german wateringplaces once came a rumor that she was going to make a grand marriage in england then we heard that the gentleman had thought better of it and left her to keep afloat as she could she was a terribly scatterbrained creature she pretends to be a great lady but i consider that old filomena my washerwoman is in essentials a greater one but certainly after all she has been fortunate she embarked at last on a lawsuit about some property with her husbands family and went to america to attend to it she came back triumphant with a long purse she reappeared in italy and established herself for a while in venice then she came to florence where she spent a couple of years and where i saw her last year she passed down to naples which i should have said was just the place for her and this winter she has laid siege to rome she seems very prosperous she has taken a floor in the palazzo f she keeps her carriage and christina and she between them must have a pretty milliners bill giacosa has turned up again looking as if he had been kept on ice at ancona for her return  what sort of education rowland asked do you imagine the mothers adventures to have been for the daughter  a strange school but mrs light told me in florence that she had given her child the education of a princess in other words i suppose she speaks three or four languages and has read several hundred french novels christina i suspect is very clever when i saw her i was amazed at her beauty and certainly if there is any truth in faces she ought to have the soul of an angel perhaps she has i dont judge her she s an extraordinary young person she has been told twenty times a day by her mother since she was five years old that she is a beauty of beauties that her face is her fortune and that if she plays her cards she may marry a duke if she has not been fatally corrupted she is a very superior girl my own impression is that she is a mixture of good and bad of ambition and indifference mrs light having failed to make her own fortune in matrimony has transferred her hopes to her daughter and nursed them till they have become a kind of monomania she has a hobby which she rides in secret but some day she will let you see it i m sure that if you go in some evening unannounced you will find her scanning the tealeaves in her cup or telling her daughters fortune with a greasy pack of cards preserved for the purpose she promises her a princea reigning prince but if mrs light is silly she is shrewd too and lest considerations of state should deny her prince the luxury of a lovematch she keeps on hand a few common mortals at the worst she would take a duke an english lord or even a young american with a proper number of millions the poor woman must be rather uncomfortable she is always building castles and knocking them down againalways casting her nets and pulling them in if her daughter were less of a beauty her transparent ambition would be very ridiculous but there is something in the girl as one looks at her that seems to make it very possible she is marked out for one of those wonderful romantic fortunes that history now and then relates who after all was the empress of the french mrs light is forever saying and beside christina the empress is a dowdy  and what does christina say  she makes no scruple as you know of saying that her mother is a fool what she thinks heaven knows i suspect that practically she does not commit herself she is excessively proud and thinks herself good enough to occupy the highest station in the world but she knows that her mother talks nonsense and that even a beautiful girl may look awkward in making unsuccessful advances so she remains superbly indifferent and lets her mother take the risks if the prince is secured so much the better if he is not she need never confess to herself that even a prince has slighted her  your report is as solid rowland said to madame grandoni thanking her as if it had been prepared for the academy of sciences and he congratulated himself on having listened to it when a couple of days later mrs light and her daughter attended by the cavaliere and the poodle came to his rooms to look at rodericks statues it was more comfortable to know just with whom he was dealing  mrs light was prodigiously gracious and showered down compliments not only on the statues but on all his possessions upon my word she said you men know how to make yourselves comfortable if one of us poor women had half as many easychairs and knickknacks we should be famously abused it s really selfish to be living all alone in such a place as this cavaliere how should you like this suite of rooms and a fortune to fill them with pictures and statues christina love look at that mosaic table mr mallet i could almost beg it from you yes that eve is certainly very fine we need nt be ashamed of such a greatgrandmother as that if she was really such a beautiful woman it accounts for the good looks of some of us where is mr what shisname the young sculptor why is nt he here to be complimented  christina had remained but for a moment in the chair which rowland had placed for her had given but a cursory glance at the statues and then leaving her place had begun to wander round the roomlooking at herself in the mirror touching the ornaments and curiosities glancing at the books and prints rowlands sittingroom was encumbered with bricabrac and she found plenty of occupation rowland presently joined her and pointed out some of the objects he most valued  it s an odd jumble she said frankly some things are very prettysome are very ugly but i like ugly things when they have a certain look prettiness is terribly vulgar nowadays and it is not every one that knows just the sort of ugliness that has chic but chic is getting dreadfully common too there s a hint of it even in madame baldis bonnets i like looking at peoples things she added in a moment turning to rowland and resting her eyes on him it helps you to find out their characters  am i to suppose asked rowland smiling that you have arrived at any conclusions as to mine  i am rather muddled you have too many things one seems to contradict another you are very artistic and yet you are very prosaic you have what is called a catholic taste and yet you are full of obstinate little prejudices and habits of thought which if i knew you i should find very tiresome i dont think i like you  you make a great mistake laughed rowland i assure you i am very amiable  yes i am probably wrong and if i knew you i should find out i was wrong and that would irritate me and make me dislike you more so you see we are necessary enemies  no i dont dislike you  worse and worse for you certainly will not like me  you are very discouraging  i am fond of facing the truth though some day you will deny that where is that queer friend of yours  you mean mr hudson he is represented by these beautiful works  miss light looked for some moments at rodericks statues yes she said they are not so silly as most of the things we have seen they have no chic and yet they are beautiful  you describe them perfectly said rowland they are beautiful and yet they have no chic that s it  if he will promise to put none into my bust i have a mind to let him make it a request made in those terms deserves to be granted  in what terms  did nt you hear him mademoiselle you almost satisfy my conception of the beautiful i must model your bust that almost should be rewarded he is like me he likes to face the truth i think we should get on together  the cavaliere approached rowland to express the pleasure he had derived from his beautiful collection his smile was exquisitely bland his accent appealing caressing insinuating but he gave rowland an odd sense of looking at a little waxen image adjusted to perform certain gestures and emit certain sounds it had once contained a soul but the soul had leaked out nevertheless rowland reflected there are more profitless things than mere sound and gesture in a consummate italian and the cavaliere too had soul enough left to desire to speak a few words on his own account and call rowlands attention to the fact that he was not after all a hired cicerone but an ancient roman gentleman rowland felt sorry for him he hardly knew why he assured him in a friendly fashion that he must come again that his house was always at his service the cavaliere bowed down to the ground you do me too much honor he murmured if you will allow meit is not impossible  mrs light meanwhile had prepared to depart if you are not afraid to come and see two quiet little women we shall be most happy she said we have no statues nor pictureswe have nothing but each other eh darling  i beg your pardon said christina  oh and the cavaliere added her mother  the poodle please cried the young girl  rowland glanced at the cavaliere he was smiling more blandly than ever  a few days later rowland presented himself as civility demanded at mrs lights door he found her living in one of the stately houses of the via dell angelo custode and rather to his surprise was told she was at home he passed through half a dozen rooms and was ushered into an immense saloon at one end of which sat the mistress of the establishment with a piece of embroidery she received him very graciously and then pointing mysteriously to a large screen which was unfolded across the embrasure of one of the deep windows i am keeping guard she said rowland looked interrogative whereupon she beckoned him forward and motioned him to look behind the screen he obeyed and for some moments stood gazing roderick with his back turned stood before an extemporized pedestal ardently shaping a formless mass of clay before him sat christina light in a white dress with her shoulders bare her magnificent hair twisted into a classic coil and her head admirably poised meeting rowlands gaze she smiled a little only with her deep gray eyes without moving she looked divinely beautiful       chapter v christina  the brilliant roman winter came round again and rowland enjoyed it in a certain way more deeply than before he grew at last to feel that sense of equal possession of intellectual nearness which it belongs to the peculiar magic of the ancient city to infuse into minds of a cast that she never would have produced he became passionately unreasoningly fond of all roman sights and sensations and to breathe the roman atmosphere began to seem a needful condition of being he could not have defined and explained the nature of his great love nor have made up the sum of it by the addition of his calculable pleasures it was a large vague idle halfprofitless emotion of which perhaps the most pertinent thing that may be said is that it enforced a sort of oppressive reconciliation to the present the actual the sensuousto life on the terms that there offered themselves it was perhaps for this very reason that in spite of the charm which rome flings over ones mood there ran through rowlands meditations an undertone of melancholy natural enough in a mind which finds its horizon insidiously limited to the finite even in very picturesque forms whether it is one that tacitly concedes to the roman church the monopoly of a guarantee of immortality so that if one is indisposed to bargain with her for the precious gift one must do without it altogether or whether in an atmosphere so heavily weighted with echoes and memories one grows to believe that there is nothing in ones consciousness that is not foredoomed to moulder and crumble and become dust for the feet and possible malaria for the lungs of future generationsthe fact at least remains that one parts halfwillingly with ones hopes in rome and misses them only under some very exceptional stress of circumstance for this reason one may perhaps say that there is no other place in which ones daily temper has such a mellow serenity and none at the same time in which acute attacks of depression are more intolerable rowland found in fact a perfect response to his prevision that to live in rome was an education to ones senses and ones imagination but he sometimes wondered whether this was not a questionable gain in case of ones not being prepared to live wholly by ones imagination and ones senses the tranquil profundity of his daily satisfaction seemed sometimes to turn by a mysterious inward impulse and face itself with questioning admonishing threatening eyes but afterwards it seemed to ask with a long reverberation and he could give no answer but a shy affirmation that there was no such thing as afterwards and a hope divided against itself that his actual way of life would last forever he often felt heavyhearted he was sombre without knowing why there were no visible clouds in his heaven but there were cloudshadows on his mood shadows projected they often were without his knowing it by an undue apprehension that things after all might not go so ideally well with roderick when he understood his anxiety it vexed him and he rebuked himself for taking things unmanfully hard if roderick chose to follow a crooked path it was no fault of his he had given him he would continue to give him all that he had offered himfriendship sympathy advice he had not undertaken to provide him with unflagging strength of purpose nor to stand bondsman for unqualified success  if rowland felt his roots striking and spreading in the roman soil roderick also surrendered himself with renewed abandon to the local influence more than once he declared to his companion that he meant to live and die within the shadow of saint peters and that he cared little if he never again drew breath in american air for a man of my temperament rome is the only possible place he said it s better to recognize the fact early than late so i shall never go home unless i am absolutely forced  what is your idea of force asked rowland smiling it seems to me you have an excellent reason for going home some day or other  ah you mean my engagement roderick answered with unaverted eyes yes i am distinctly engaged in northampton and impatiently waited for and he gave a little sympathetic sigh to reconcile northampton and rome is rather a problem mary had better come out here even at the worst i have no intention of giving up rome within six or eight years and an engagement of that duration would be rather absurd  miss garland could hardly leave your mother rowland observed  oh of course my mother should come i think i will suggest it in my next letter it will take her a year or two to make up her mind to it but if she consents it will brighten her up it s too small a life over there even for a timid old lady it is hard to imagine he added any change in mary being a change for the better but i should like her to take a look at the world and have her notions stretched a little one is never so good i suppose but that one can improve a little  if you wish your mother and miss garland to come rowland suggested you had better go home and bring them  oh i cant think of leaving europe for many a day roderick answered at present it would quite break the charm i am just beginning to profit to get used to things and take them naturally i am sure the sight of northampton main street would permanently upset me  it was reassuring to hear that roderick in his own view was but just beginning to spread his wings and rowland if he had had any forebodings might have suffered them to be modified by this declaration this was the first time since their meeting at geneva that roderick had mentioned miss garlands name but the ice being broken he indulged for some time afterward in frequent allusions to his betrothed which always had an accent of scrupulous of almost studied consideration an uninitiated observer hearing him would have imagined her to be a person of a certain agepossibly an affectionate maiden auntwho had once done him a kindness which he highly appreciated perhaps presented him with a check for a thousand dollars rowland noted the difference between his present frankness and his reticence during the first six months of his engagement and sometimes wondered whether it was not rather an anomaly that he should expatiate more largely as the happy event receded he had wondered over the whole matter first and last in a great many different ways and looked at it in all possible lights there was something terribly hard to explain in the fact of his having fallen in love with his cousin she was not as rowland conceived her the sort of girl he would have been likely to fancy and the operation of sentiment in all cases so mysterious was particularly so in this one just why it was that roderick should not logically have fancied miss garland his companion would have been at loss to say but i think the conviction had its roots in an unformulated comparison between himself and the accepted suitor roderick and he were as different as two men could be and yet roderick had taken it into his head to fall in love with a woman for whom he himself had been keeping in reserve for years a profoundly characteristic passion that if he chose to conceive a great notion of the merits of rodericks mistress the irregularity here was hardly rodericks was a view of the case to which poor rowland did scanty justice there were women he said to himself whom it was every ones business to fall in love with a littlewomen beautiful brilliant artful easily fascinating miss light for instance was one of these every man who spoke to her did so if not in the language at least with something of the agitation the divine tremor of a lover there were other womenthey might have great beauty they might have small perhaps they were generally to be classified as plainwhose triumphs in this line were rare but immutably permanent such a one preeminently was mary garland upon the doctrine of probabilities it was unlikely that she had had an equal charm for each of them and was it not possible therefore that the charm for roderick had been simply the charm imagined unquestioningly accepted the general charm of youth sympathy kindnessof the present feminine in shortenhanced indeed by several fine facial traits the charm in this case for rowland wasthe charmthe mysterious individual essential woman there was an element in the charm as his companion saw it which rowland was obliged to recognize but which he forbore to ponder the rather important attraction namely of reciprocity as to miss garland being in love with roderick and becoming charming thereby this was a point with which his imagination ventured to take no liberties partly because it would have been indelicate and partly because it would have been vain he contented himself with feeling that the young girl was still as vivid an image in his memory as she had been five days after he left her and with drifting nearer and nearer to the impression that at just that crisis any other girl would have answered rodericks sentimental needs as well any other girl indeed would do so still roderick had confessed as much to him at geneva in saying that he had been taking at baden the measure of his susceptibility to female beauty  his extraordinary success in modeling the bust of the beautiful miss light was pertinent evidence of this amiable quality she sat to him repeatedly for a fortnight and the work was rapidly finished on one of the last days roderick asked rowland to come and give his opinion as to what was still wanting for the sittings had continued to take place in mrs lights apartment the studio being pronounced too damp for the fair model when rowland presented himself christina still in her white dress with her shoulders bare was standing before a mirror readjusting her hair the arrangement of which on this occasion had apparently not met the young sculptors approval he stood beside her directing the operation with a peremptoriness of tone which seemed to rowland to denote a considerable advance in intimacy as rowland entered christina was losing patience do it yourself then she cried and with a rapid movement unloosed the great coil of her tresses and let them fall over her shoulders  they were magnificent and with her perfect face dividing their rippling flow she looked like some immaculate saint of legend being led to martyrdom rowlands eyes presumably betrayed his admiration but her own manifested no consciousness of it if christina was a coquette as the remarkable timeliness of this incident might have suggested she was not a superficial one  hudson s a sculptor said rowland with warmth but if i were only a painter  thank heaven you are not said christina i am having quite enough of this minute inspection of my charms  my dear young man hands off cried mrs light coming forward and seizing her daughters hair christina love i am surprised  is it indelicate christina asked i beg mr mallets pardon mrs light gathered up the dusky locks and let them fall through her fingers glancing at her visitor with a significant smile rowland had never been in the east but if he had attempted to make a sketch of an old slavemerchant calling attention to the points of a circassian beauty he would have depicted such a smile as mrs lights mamma s not really shocked added christina in a moment as if she had guessed her mothers byplay she is only afraid that mr hudson might have injured my hair and that per consequenza i should sell for less  you unnatural child cried mamma you deserve that i should make a fright of you and with half a dozen skillful passes she twisted the tresses into a single picturesque braid placed high on the head as a kind of coronal  what does your mother do when she wants to do you justice rowland asked observing the admirable line of the young girls neck  i do her justice when i say she says very improper things what is one to do with such a thorn in the flesh mrs light demanded  think of it at your leisure mr mallet said christina and when you ve discovered something let us hear but i must tell you that i shall not willingly believe in any remedy of yours for you have something in your physiognomy that particularly provokes me to make the remarks that my mother so sincerely deplores i noticed it the first time i saw you i think it s because your face is so broad for some reason or other broad faces exasperate me they fill me with a kind of rabbia last summer at carlsbad there was an austrian count with enormous estates and some great office at court he was very attentiveseriously so he was really very far gone cela ne tenait qu a moi but i could nt he was impossible he must have measured from ear to ear at least a yard and a half and he was blond too which made it worseas blond as stenterello pure fleece so i said to him frankly many thanks herr graf your uniform is magnificent but your face is too fat  i am afraid that mine also said rowland with a smile seems just now to have assumed an unpardonable latitude  oh i take it you know very well that we are looking for a husband and that none but tremendous swells need apply surely before these gentlemen mamma i may speak freely they are disinterested mr mallet wont do because though he s rich he s not rich enough mamma made that discovery the day after we went to see you moved to it by the promising look of your furniture i hope she was right eh unless you have millions you know you have no chance  i feel like a beggar said rowland  oh some better girl than i will decide some day after mature reflection that on the whole you have enough mr hudson of course is nowhere he has nothing but his genius and his beaux yeux  roderick had stood looking at christina intently while she delivered herself softly and slowly of this surprising nonsense when she had finished she turned and looked at him their eyes met and he blushed a little let me model you and he who can may marry you he said abruptly  mrs light while her daughter talked had been adding a few touches to her coiffure she is not so silly as you might suppose she said to rowland with dignity if you will give me your arm we will go and look at the bust  does that represent a silly girl christina demanded when they stood before it  rowland transferred his glance several times from the portrait to the original it represents a young lady he said whom i should not pretend to judge offhand  she may be a fool but you are not sure many thanks you have seen me half a dozen times you are either very slow or i am very deep  i am certainly slow said rowland i dont expect to make up my mind about you within six months  i give you six months if you will promise then a perfectly frank opinion mind i shall not forget i shall insist upon it  well though i am slow i am tolerably brave said rowland we shall see  christina looked at the bust with a sigh i am afraid after all she said that there s very little wisdom in it save what the artist has put there mr hudson looked particularly wise while he was working he scowled and growled but he never opened his mouth it is very kind of him not to have represented me gaping  if i had talked a lot of stuff to you said roderick roundly the thing would not have been a tenth so good  is it good after all mr mallet is a famous connoisseur has he not come here to pronounce  the bust was in fact a very happy performance and roderick had risen to the level of his subject it was thoroughly a portrait and not a vague fantasy executed on a graceful theme as the busts of pretty women in modern sculpture are apt to be the resemblance was deep and vivid there was extreme fidelity of detail and yet a noble simplicity one could say of the head that without idealization it was a representation of ideal beauty rowland however as we know was not fond of exploding into superlatives and after examining the piece contented himself with suggesting two or three alterations of detail  nay how can you be so cruel demanded mrs light with soft reproachfulness it is surely a wonderful thing  rowland knows it s a wonderful thing said roderick smiling i can tell that by his face the other day i finished something he thought bad and he looked very differently from this  how did mr mallet look asked christina  my dear rowland said roderick i am speaking of my seated woman you looked as if you had on a pair of tight boots  ah my child you ll not understand that cried mrs light you never yet had a pair that were small enough  it s a pity mr hudson said christina gravely that you could not have introduced my feet into the bust but we can hang a pair of slippers round the neck  i nevertheless like your statues roderick rowland rejoined better than your jokes this is admirable miss light you may be proud  thank you mr mallet for the permission rejoined the young girl  i am dying to see it in the marble with a red velvet screen behind it said mrs light  placed there under the sassoferrato christina went on i hope you keep well in mind mr hudson that you have not a grain of property in your work and that if mamma chooses she may have it photographed and the copies sold in the piazza di spagna at five francs apiece without your having a sou of the profits  amen said roderick it was so nominated in the bond my profits are here and he tapped his forehead  it would be prettier if you said here and christina touched her heart  my precious child how you do run on murmured mrs light  it is mr mallet the young girl answered i cant talk a word of sense so long as he is in the room i dont say that to make you go she added i say it simply to justify myself  rowland bowed in silence roderick declared that he must get at work and requested christina to take her usual position and mrs light proposed to her visitor that they should adjourn to her boudoir this was a small room hardly more spacious than an alcove opening out of the drawingroom and having no other issue here as they entered on a divan near the door rowland perceived the cavaliere giacosa with his arms folded his head dropped upon his breast and his eyes closed  sleeping at his post said rowland with a kindly laugh  that s a punishable offense rejoined mrs light sharply she was on the point of calling him in the same tone when he suddenly opened his eyes stared a moment and then rose with a smile and a bow  excuse me dear lady he said i was overcome by thethe great heat  nonsense cavaliere cried the lady you know we are perishing here with the cold you had better go and cool yourself in one of the other rooms  i obey dear lady said the cavaliere and with another smile and bow to rowland he departed walking very discreetly on his toes rowland outstayed him but a short time for he was not fond of mrs light and he found nothing very inspiring in her frank intimation that if he chose he might become a favorite he was disgusted with himself for pleasing her he confounded his fatal urbanity in the courtyard of the palace he overtook the cavaliere who had stopped at the porters lodge to say a word to his little girl she was a young lady of very tender years and she wore a very dirty pinafore he had taken her up in his arms and was singing an infantine rhyme to her and she was staring at him with big soft roman eyes on seeing rowland he put her down with a kiss and stepped forward with a conscious grin an unresentful admission that he was sensitive both to chubbiness and ridicule rowland began to pity him again he had taken his dismissal from the drawingroom so meekly  you dont keep your promise said rowland to come and see me dont forget it i want you to tell me about rome thirty years ago  thirty years ago ah dear sir rome is rome still a place where strange things happen but happy things too since i have your renewed permission to call you do me too much honor is it in the morning or in the evening that i should least intrude  take your own time cavaliere only come sometime i depend upon you said rowland  the cavaliere thanked him with an humble obeisance to the cavaliere too he felt that he was in roman phrase sympathetic but the idea of pleasing this extremely reduced gentleman was not disagreeable to him  miss lights bust stood for a while on exhibition in rodericks studio and half the foreign colony came to see it with the completion of his work however rodericks visits at the palazzo f by no means came to an end he spent half his time in mrs lights drawingroom and began to be talked about as attentive to christina the success of the bust restored his equanimity and in the garrulity of his goodhumor he suffered rowland to see that she was just now the object uppermost in his thoughts rowland when they talked of her was rather listener than speaker partly because rodericks own tone was so resonant and exultant and partly because when his companion laughed at him for having called her unsafe he was too perplexed to defend himself the impression remained that she was unsafe that she was a complex willful passionate creature who might easily engulf a too confiding spirit in the eddies of her capricious temper and yet he strongly felt her charm the eddies had a strange fascination roderick in the glow of that renewed admiration provoked by the fixed attention of portrayal was never weary of descanting on the extraordinary perfection of her beauty  i had no idea of it he said till i began to look at her with an eye to reproducing line for line and curve for curve her face is the most exquisite piece of modeling that ever came from creative hands not a line without meaning not a hairs breadth that is not admirably finished and then her mouth it s as if a pair of lips had been shaped to utter pure truth without doing it dishonor later after he had been working for a week he declared if miss light were inordinately plain she would still be the most fascinating of women i ve quite forgotten her beauty he said or rather i have ceased to perceive it as something distinct and defined something independent of the rest of her she is all one and all consummately interesting  what does she dowhat does she say that is so remarkable rowland had asked  say sometimes nothingsometimes everything she is never the same sometimes she walks in and takes her place without a word without a smile gravely stiffly as if it were an awful bore she hardly looks at me and she walks away without even glancing at my work on other days she laughs and chatters and asks endless questions and pours out the most irresistible nonsense she is a creature of moods you cant count upon her she keeps observation on the stretch and then bless you she has seen such a lot her talk is full of the oddest allusions  it is altogether a very singular type of young lady said rowland after the visit which i have related at length it may be a charm but it is certainly not the orthodox charm of marriageable maidenhood the charm of shrinking innocence and soft docility our american girls are accused of being more knowing than any others and miss light is nominally an american but it has taken twenty years of europe to make her what she is the first time we saw her i remember you called her a product of the old world and certainly you were not far wrong  ah she has an atmosphere said roderick in the tone of high appreciation  young unmarried women rowland answered should be careful not to have too much  ah you dont forgive her cried his companion for hitting you so hard a man ought to be flattered at such a girl as that taking so much notice of him  a man is never flattered at a womans not liking him  are you sure she does nt like you that s to the credit of your humility a fellow of more vanity might on the evidence persuade himself that he was in favor  he would have also said rowland laughing to be a fellow of remarkable ingenuity he asked himself privately how the deuce roderick reconciled it to his conscience to think so much more of the girl he was not engaged to than of the girl he was but it amounted almost to arrogance you may say in poor rowland to pretend to know how often roderick thought of miss garland he wondered gloomily at any rate whether for men of his companions large easy power there was not a larger moral law than for narrow mediocrities like himself who yielding nature a meagre interest on her investment such as it was had no reason to expect from her this affectionate laxity as to their accounts was it not a part of the eternal fitness of things that roderick while rhapsodizing about miss light should have it at his command to look at you with eyes of the most guileless and unclouded blue and to shake off your musty imputations by a toss of his picturesque brown locks or had he in fact no conscience to speak of happy fellow either way  our friend gloriani came among others to congratulate roderick on his model and what he had made of her devilish pretty through and through he said as he looked at the bust capital handling of the neck and throat lovely work on the nose you re a detestably lucky fellow my boy but you ought not to have squandered such material on a simple bust you should have made a great imaginative figure if i could only have got hold of her i would have put her into a statue in spite of herself what a pity she is not a ragged trasteverine whom we might have for a franc an hour i have been carrying about in my head for years a delicious design for a fantastic figure but it has always stayed there for want of a tolerable model i have seen intimations of the type but miss light is the perfection of it as soon as i saw her i said to myself by jove there s my statue in the flesh  what is your subject asked roderick  dont take it ill said gloriani you know i m the very deuce for observation she would make a magnificent herodias  if roderick had taken it ill which was unlikely for we know he thought gloriani an ass and expected little of his wisdom he might have been soothed by the candid incense of sam singleton who came and sat for an hour in a sort of mental prostration before both bust and artist but rodericks attitude before his patient little devotee was one of undisguised though friendly amusement and indeed judged from a strictly plastic point of view the poor fellows diminutive stature his enormous mouth his pimples and his yellow hair were sufficiently ridiculous nay dont envy our friend rowland said to singleton afterwards on his expressing with a little groan of depreciation of his own paltry performances his sense of the brilliancy of rodericks talent you sail nearer the shore but you sail in smoother waters be contented with what you are and paint me another picture  oh i dont envy hudson anything he possesses singleton said because to take anything away would spoil his beautiful completeness complete that s what he is while we little clevernesses are like halfripened plums only good eating on the side that has had a glimpse of the sun nature has made him so and fortune confesses to it he is the handsomest fellow in rome he has the most genius and as a matter of course the most beautiful girl in the world comes and offers to be his model if that is not completeness where shall we find it  one morning going into rodericks studio rowland found the young sculptor entertaining miss blanchardif this is not too flattering a description of his gracefully passive tolerance of her presence he had never liked her and never climbed into her skystudio to observe her wonderful manipulation of petals he had once quoted tennyson against her  and is there any moral shut within the bosom of the rose  in all miss blanchards roses you may be sure there is a moral he had said you can see it sticking out its head and if you go to smell the flower it scratches your nose but on this occasion she had come with a propitiatory giftintroducing her friend mr leavenworth mr leavenworth was a tall expansive bland gentleman with a carefully brushed whisker and a spacious fair wellfavored face which seemed somehow to have more room in it than was occupied by a smile of superior benevolence so that with his smooth white forehead it bore a certain resemblance to a large parlor with a very florid carpet but no pictures on the walls he held his head high talked sonorously and told roderick within five minutes that he was a widower traveling to distract his mind and that he had lately retired from the proprietorship of large mines of borax in pennsylvania roderick supposed at first that in his character of depressed widower he had come to order a tombstone but observing then the extreme blandness of his address to miss blanchard he credited him with a judicious prevision that by the time the tombstone was completed a monument of his inconsolability might have become an anachronism but mr leavenworth was disposed to order something  you will find me eager to patronize our indigenous talent he said i am putting up a little shanty in my native town and i propose to make a rather nice thing of it it has been the will of heaven to plunge me into mourning but art has consolations in a tasteful home surrounded by the memorials of my wanderings i hope to take more cheerful views i ordered in paris the complete appurtenances of a diningroom do you think you could do something for my library it is to be filled with wellselected authors and i think a pure white image in this stylepointing to one of rodericks statuesstanding out against the morocco and gilt would have a noble effect the subject i have already fixed upon i desire an allegorical representation of culture do you think now asked mr leavenworth encouragingly you could rise to the conception  a most interesting subject for a truly serious mind remarked miss blanchard  roderick looked at her a moment and thenthe simplest thing i could do he said would be to make a fulllength portrait of miss blanchard i could give her a scroll in her hand and that would do for the allegory  miss blanchard colored the compliment might be ironical and there was ever afterwards a reflection of her uncertainty in her opinion of rodericks genius mr leavenworth responded that with all deference to miss blanchards beauty he desired something colder more monumental more impersonal if i were to be the happy possessor of a likeness of miss blanchard he added i should prefer to have it in no factitious disguise  roderick consented to entertain the proposal and while they were discussing it rowland had a little talk with the fair artist who is your friend he asked  a very worthy man the architect of his own fortunewhich is magnificent one of natures gentlemen  this was a trifle sententious and rowland turned to the bust of miss light like every one else in rome by this time miss blanchard had an opinion on the young girls beauty and in her own fashion she expressed it epigrammatically she looks half like a madonna and half like a ballerina she said  mr leavenworth and roderick came to an understanding and the young sculptor goodnaturedly promised to do his best to rise to his patrons conception his conception be hanged roderick exclaimed after he had departed his conception is sitting on a globe with a pen in her ear and a photographic album in her hand i shall have to conceive myself for the money i ought to be able to  mrs light meanwhile had fairly established herself in roman society heaven knows how madame grandoni said to rowland who had mentioned to her several evidences of the ladys prosperity in such a case there is nothing like audacity a month ago she knew no one but her washerwoman and now i am told that the cards of roman princesses are to be seen on her table she is evidently determined to play a great part and she has the wit to perceive that to make remunerative acquaintances you must seem yourself to be worth knowing you must have striking rooms and a confusing variety of dresses and give good dinners and so forth she is spending a lot of money and you ll see that in two or three weeks she will take upon herself to open the season by giving a magnificent ball of course it is christinas beauty that floats her people go to see her because they are curious  and they go again because they are charmed said rowland miss christina is a very remarkable young lady  oh i know it well i had occasion to say so to myself the other day she came to see me of her own free will and for an hour she was deeply interesting i think she s an actress but she believes in her part while she is playing it she took it into her head the other day to believe that she was very unhappy and she sat there where you are sitting and told me a tale of her miseries which brought tears into my eyes she cried herself profusely and as naturally as possible she said she was weary of life and that she knew no one but me she could speak frankly to she must speak or she would go mad she sobbed as if her heart would break i assure you it s well for you susceptible young men that you dont see her when she sobs she said in so many words that her mother was an immoral woman heaven knows what she meant she meant i suppose that she makes debts that she knows she cant pay she said the life they led was horrible that it was monstrous a poor girl should be dragged about the world to be sold to the highest bidder she was meant for better things she could be perfectly happy in poverty it was not money she wanted i might not believe her but she really cared for serious things sometimes she thought of taking poison  what did you say to that  i recommended her said madame grandoni to come and see me instead i would help her about as much and i was on the whole less unpleasant of course i could help her only by letting her talk herself out and kissing her and patting her beautiful hands and telling her to be patient and she would be happy yet about once in two months i expect her to reappear on the same errand and meanwhile to quite forget my existence i believe i melted down to the point of telling her that i would find some good quiet affectionate husband for her but she declared almost with fury that she was sick unto death of husbands and begged i would never again mention the word and in fact it was a rash offer for i am sure that there is not a man of the kind that might really make a woman happy but would be afraid to marry mademoiselle looked at in that way she is certainly very much to be pitied and indeed altogether though i dont think she either means all she says or by a great deal says all that she means i feel very sorry for her  rowland met the two ladies about this time at several entertainments and looked at christina with a kind of distant attendrissement he imagined more than once that there had been a passionate scene between them about coming out and wondered what arguments mrs light had found effective but christinas face told no tales and she moved about beautiful and silent looking absently over peoples heads barely heeding the men who pressed about her and suggesting somehow that the soul of a worldwearied mortal had found its way into the blooming body of a goddess where in the world has miss light been before she is twenty observers asked to have left all her illusions behind and the general verdict was that though she was incomparably beautiful she was intolerably proud young ladies to whom the former distinction was not conceded were free to reflect that she was not at all liked  it would have been difficult to guess however how they reconciled this conviction with a variety of conflicting evidence and in especial with the spectacle of rodericks inveterate devotion all rome might behold that he at least liked christina light wherever she appeared he was either awaiting her or immediately followed her he was perpetually at her side trying apparently to preserve the thread of a disconnected talk the fate of which was to judge by her face profoundly immaterial to the young lady people in general smiled at the radiant good faith of the handsome young sculptor and asked each other whether he really supposed that beauties of that quality were meant to wed with poor artists but although christinas deportment as i have said was one of superb inexpressiveness rowland had derived from roderick no suspicion that he suffered from snubbing and he was therefore surprised at an incident which befell one evening at a large musical party roderick as usual was in the field and on the ladies taking the chairs which had been arranged for them he immediately placed himself beside christina as most of the gentlemen were standing his position made him as conspicuous as hamlet at ophelias feet at the play rowland was leaning somewhat apart against the chimneypiece there was a long solemn pause before the music began and in the midst of it christina rose left her place came the whole length of the immense room with every one looking at her and stopped before him she was neither pale nor flushed she had a soft smile  will you do me a favor she asked  a thousand  not now but at your earliest convenience please remind mr hudson that he is not in a new england villagethat it is not the custom in rome to address ones conversation exclusively night after night to the same poor girl and that  the music broke out with a great blare and covered her voice she made a gesture of impatience and rowland offered her his arm and led her back to her seat  the next day he repeated her words to roderick who burst into joyous laughter she s a delightfully strange girl he cried she must do everything that comes into her head  had she never asked you before not to talk to her so much  on the contrary she has often said to me mind you now i forbid you to leave me here comes that tiresome soandso she cares as little about the custom as i do what could be a better proof than her walking up to you with five hundred people looking at her is that the custom for young girls in rome  why then should she take such a step  because as she sat there it came into her head that s reason enough for her i have imagined she wishes me well as they say herethough she has never distinguished me in such a way as that  madame grandoni had foretold the truth mrs light a couple of weeks later convoked all roman society to a brilliant ball rowland went late and found the staircase so encumbered with flowerpots and servants that he was a long time making his way into the presence of the hostess at last he approached her as she stood making courtesies at the door with her daughter by her side some of mrs lights courtesies were very low for she had the happiness of receiving a number of the social potentates of the roman world she was rosy with triumph to say nothing of a less metaphysical cause and was evidently vastly contented with herself with her company and with the general promise of destiny her daughter was less overtly jubilant and distributed her greetings with impartial frigidity she had never been so beautiful dressed simply in vaporous white relieved with half a dozen white roses the perfection of her features and of her person and the mysterious depth of her expression seemed to glow with the white light of a splendid pearl she recognized no one individually and made her courtesy slowly gravely with her eyes on the ground rowland fancied that as he stood before her her obeisance was slightly exaggerated as with an intention of irony but he smiled philosophically to himself and reflected as he passed into the room that if she disliked him he had nothing to reproach himself with he walked about had a few words with miss blanchard who with a fillet of cameos in her hair was leaning on the arm of mr leavenworth and at last came upon the cavaliere giacosa modestly stationed in a corner the little gentlemans coatlappet was decorated with an enormous bouquet and his neck encased in a voluminous white handkerchief of the fashion of thirty years ago his arms were folded and he was surveying the scene with contracted eyelids through which you saw the glitter of his intensely dark vivacious pupil he immediately embarked on an elaborate apology for not having yet manifested as he felt it his sense of the honor rowland had done him  i am always on service with these ladies you see he explained and that is a duty to which one would not willingly be faithless for an instant  evidently said rowland you are a very devoted friend mrs light in her situation is very happy in having you  we are old friends said the cavaliere gravely old friends i knew the signora many years ago when she was the prettiest woman in romeor rather in ancona which is even better the beautiful christina now is perhaps the most beautiful young girl in europe  very likely said rowland  very well sir i taught her to read i guided her little hands to touch the piano keys and at these faded memories the cavalieres eyes glittered more brightly rowland half expected him to proceed with a little flash of longrepressed passion and nowand now sir they treat me as you observed the other day but the cavaliere only looked out at him keenly from among his wrinkles and seemed to say with all the vividness of the italian glance oh i say nothing more i am not so shallow as to complain  evidently the cavaliere was not shallow and rowland repeated respectfully you are a devoted friend  that s very true i am a devoted friend a man may do himself justice after twenty years  rowland after a pause made some remark about the beauty of the ball it was very brilliant  stupendous said the cavaliere solemnly it is a great day we have four roman princes to say nothing of others and he counted them over on his fingers and held up his hand triumphantly and there she stands the girl to whom ii giuseppe giacosataught her alphabet and her pianoscales there she stands in her incomparable beauty and roman princes come and bow to her here in his corner her old master permits himself to be proud  it is very friendly of him said rowland smiling  the cavaliere contracted his lids a little more and gave another keen glance it is very natural signore the christina is a good girl she remembers my little services but here comes he added in a moment the young prince of the fine arts i am sure he has bowed lowest of all  rowland looked round and saw roderick moving slowly across the room and casting about him his usual luminous unshrinking looks he presently joined them nodded familiarly to the cavaliere and immediately demanded of rowland have you seen her  i have seen miss light said rowland she s magnificent  i m half crazy cried roderick so loud that several persons turned round  rowland saw that he was flushed and laid his hand on his arm roderick was trembling if you will go away rowland said instantly i will go with you  go away cried roderick almost angrily i intend to dance with her  the cavaliere had been watching him attentively he gently laid his hand on his other arm softly softly dear young man he said let me speak to you as a friend  oh speak even as an enemy and i shall not mind it roderick answered frowning  be very reasonable then and go away  why the deuce should i go away  because you are in love said the cavaliere  i might as well be in love here as in the streets  carry your love as far as possible from christina she will not listen to youshe cant  she cant demanded roderick she is not a person of whom you may say that she can if she will she does as she chooses  up to a certain point it would take too long to explain i only beg you to believe that if you continue to love miss light you will be very unhappy have you a princely title have you a princely fortune otherwise you can never have her  and the cavaliere folded his arms again like a man who has done his duty roderick wiped his forehead and looked askance at rowland he seemed to be guessing his thoughts and they made him blush a little but he smiled blandly and addressing the cavaliere i m much obliged to you for the information he said now that i have obtained it let me tell you that i am no more in love with miss light than you are mr mallet knows that i admire heryes profoundly but that s no ones business but my own and though i have as you say neither a princely title nor a princely fortune i mean to suffer neither those advantages nor those who possess them to diminish my right  if you are not in love my dear young man said the cavaliere with his hand on his heart and an apologetic smile so much the better but let me entreat you as an affectionate friend to keep a watch on your emotions you are young you are handsome you have a brilliant genius and a generous heart buti may say it almost with authoritychristina is not for you  whether roderick was in love or not he was nettled by what apparently seemed to him an obtrusive negation of an inspiring possibility you speak as if she had made her choice he cried without pretending to confidential information on the subject i am sure she has not  no but she must make it soon said the cavaliere and raising his forefinger he laid it against his under lip she must choose a name and a fortuneand she will  she will do exactly as her inclination prompts she will marry the man who pleases her if he has nt a dollar i know her better than you  the cavaliere turned a little paler than usual and smiled more urbanely no no my dear young man you do not know her better than i you have not watched her day by day for twenty years i too have admired her she is a good girl she has never said an unkind word to me the blessed virgin be thanked but she must have a brilliant destiny it has been marked out for her and she will submit you had better believe me it may save you much suffering  we shall see said roderick with an excited laugh  certainly we shall see but i retire from the discussion the cavaliere added i have no wish to provoke you to attempt to prove to me that i am wrong you are already excited  no more than is natural to a man who in an hour or so is to dance the cotillon with miss light  the cotillon has she promised  roderick patted the air with a grand confidence you ll see his gesture might almost have been taken to mean that the state of his relations with miss light was such that they quite dispensed with vain formalities  the cavaliere gave an exaggerated shrug you make a great many mourners  he has made one already rowland murmured to himself this was evidently not the first time that reference had been made between roderick and the cavaliere to the young mans possible passion and roderick had failed to consider it the simplest and most natural course to say in three words to the vigilant little gentleman that there was no cause for alarmhis affections were preoccupied rowland hoped silently with some dryness that his motives were of a finer kind than they seemed to be he turned away it was irritating to look at rodericks radiant unscrupulous eagerness the tide was setting toward the supperroom and he drifted with it to the door the crowd at this point was dense and he was obliged to wait for some minutes before he could advance at last he felt his neighbors dividing behind him and turning he saw christina pressing her way forward alone she was looking at no one and save for the fact of her being alone you would not have supposed she was in her mothers house as she recognized rowland she beckoned to him took his arm and motioned him to lead her into the supperroom she said nothing until he had forced a passage and they stood somewhat isolated  take me into the most outoftheway corner you can find she then said and then go and get me a piece of bread  nothing more there seems to be everything conceivable  a simple roll nothing more on your peril only bring something for yourself  it seemed to rowland that the embrasure of a window embrasures in roman palaces are deep was a retreat sufficiently obscure for miss light to execute whatever design she might have contrived against his equanimity a roll after he had found her a seat was easily procured as he presented it he remarked that frankly speaking he was at loss to understand why she should have selected for the honor of a teteatete an individual for whom she had so little taste  ah yes i dislike you said christina to tell the truth i had forgotten it there are so many people here whom i dislike more that when i espied you just now you seemed like an intimate friend but i have not come into this corner to talk nonsense she went on you must not think i always do eh  i have never heard you do anything else said rowland deliberately having decided that he owed her no compliments  very good i like your frankness it s quite true you see i am a strange girl to begin with i am frightfully egotistical dont flatter yourself you have said anything very clever if you ever take it into your head to tell me so i know it much better than you so it is i cant help it i am tired to death of myself i would give all i possess to get out of myself but somehow at the end i find myself so vastly more interesting than nine tenths of the people i meet if a person wished to do me a favor i would say to him i beg you with tears in my eyes to interest me be strong be positive be imperious if you will only be somethingsomething that in looking at i can forget my detestable self perhaps that is nonsense too if it is i cant help it i can only apologize for the nonsense i know to be such and that i talkoh for more reasons than i can tell you i wonder whether if i were to try you would understand me  i am afraid i should never understand said rowland why a person should willingly talk nonsense  that proves how little you know about women but i like your frankness when i told you the other day that you displeased me i had an idea you were more formalhow do you say itmore guinde i am very capricious tonight i like you better  oh i am not guinde said rowland gravely  i beg your pardon then for thinking so now i have an idea that you would make a useful friendan intimate frienda friend to whom one could tell everything for such a friend what would nt i give  rowland looked at her in some perplexity was this touching sincerity or unfathomable coquetry her beautiful eyes looked divinely candid but then if candor was beautiful beauty was apt to be subtle i hesitate to recommend myself out and out for the office he said but i believe that if you were to depend upon me for anything that a friend may do i should not be found wanting  very good one of the first things one asks of a friend is to judge one not by isolated acts but by ones whole conduct i care for your opinioni dont know why  nor do i i confess said rowland with a laugh  what do you think of this affair she continued without heeding his laugh  of your ball why it s a very grand affair  it s horriblethat s what it is it s a mere rabble there are people here whom i never saw before people who were never asked mamma went about inviting every one asking other people to invite any one they knew doing anything to have a crowd i hope she is satisfied it is not my doing i feel weary i feel angry i feel like crying i have twenty minds to escape into my room and lock the door and let mamma go through with it as she can by the way she added in a moment without a visible reason for the transition can you tell me something to read  rowland stared at the disconnectedness of the question  can you recommend me some books she repeated i know you are a great reader i have no one else to ask we can buy no books we can make debts for jewelry and bonnets and fivebutton gloves but we cant spend a sou for ideas and yet though you may not believe it i like ideas quite as well  i shall be most happy to lend you some books rowland said i will pick some out tomorrow and send them to you  no novels please i am tired of novels i can imagine better stories for myself than any i read some good poetry if there is such a thing nowadays and some memoirs and histories and books of facts  you shall be served your taste agrees with my own  she was silent a moment looking at him then suddenlytell me something about mr hudson she demanded you are great friends  oh yes said rowland we are great friends  tell me about him come begin  where shall i begin you know him for yourself  no i dont know him i dont find him so easy to know since he has finished my bust and begun to come here disinterestedly he has become a great talker he says very fine things but does he mean all he says  few of us do that  you do i imagine you ought to know for he tells me you discovered him rowland was silent and christina continued do you consider him very clever  unquestionably  his talent is really something out of the common way  so it seems to me  in short he s a man of genius  yes call it genius  and you found him vegetating in a little village and took him by the hand and set him on his feet in rome  is that the popular legend asked rowland  oh you need nt be modest there was no great merit in it there would have been none at least on my part in the same circumstances real geniuses are not so common and if i had discovered one in the wilderness i would have brought him out into the marketplace to see how he would behave it would be excessively amusing you must find it so to watch mr hudson eh tell me this do you think he is going to be a great manbecome famous have his life written and all that  i dont prophesy but i have good hopes  christina was silent she stretched out her bare arm and looked at it a moment absently turning it so as to seeor almost to seethe dimple in her elbow this was apparently a frequent gesture with her rowland had already observed it it was as coolly and naturally done as if she had been in her room alone so he s a man of genius she suddenly resumed dont you think i ought to be extremely flattered to have a man of genius perpetually hanging about he is the first i ever saw but i should have known he was not a common mortal there is something strange about him to begin with he has no manners you may say that it s not for me to blame him for i have none myself that s very true but the difference is that i can have them when i wish to and very charming ones too i ll show you some day whereas mr hudson will never have them and yet somehow one sees he s a gentleman he seems to have something urging driving pushing him making him restless and defiant you see it in his eyes they are the finest by the way i ever saw when a person has such eyes as that you can forgive him his bad manners i suppose that is what they call the sacred fire  rowland made no answer except to ask her in a moment if she would have another roll she merely shook her head and went on  tell me how you found him where was hehow was he  he was in a place called northampton did you ever hear of it he was studying lawbut not learning it  it appears it was something horrible eh  something horrible  this little village no society no pleasures no beauty no life  you have received a false impression northampton is not as gay as rome but roderick had some charming friends  tell me about them who were they  well there was my cousin through whom i made his acquaintance a delightful woman  youngpretty  yes a good deal of both and very clever  did he make love to her  not in the least  well who else  he lived with his mother she is the best of women  ah yes i know all that ones mother is but she does not count as society and who else  rowland hesitated he wondered whether christinas insistence was the result of a general interest in rodericks antecedents or of a particular suspicion he looked at her she was looking at him a little askance waiting for his answer as roderick had said nothing about his engagement to the cavaliere it was probable that with this beautiful girl he had not been more explicit and yet the thing was announced it was public that other girl was happy in it proud of it rowland felt a kind of dumb anger rising in his heart he deliberated a moment intently  what are you frowning at christina asked  there was another person he answered the most important of all the young girl to whom he is engaged  christina stared a moment raising her eyebrows ah mr hudson is engaged she said very simply is she pretty  she is not called a beauty said rowland he meant to practice great brevity but in a moment he added i have seen beauties however who pleased me less  ah she pleases you too why dont they marry  roderick is waiting till he can afford to marry  christina slowly put out her arm again and looked at the dimple in her elbow ah he s engaged she repeated in the same tone he never told me  rowland perceived at this moment that the people about them were beginning to return to the dancingroom and immediately afterwards he saw roderick making his way toward themselves roderick presented himself before miss light  i dont claim that you have promised me the cotillon he said but i consider that you have given me hopes which warrant the confidence that you will dance with me  christina looked at him a moment certainly i have made no promises she said it seemed to me that as the daughter of the house i should keep myself free and let it depend on circumstances  i beseech you to dance with me said roderick with vehemence  christina rose and began to laugh you say that very well but the italians do it better  this assertion seemed likely to be put to the proof mrs light hastily approached leading rather than led by a tall slim young man of an unmistakably southern physiognomy my precious love she cried what a place to hide in we have been looking for you for twenty minutes i have chosen a cavalier for you and chosen well  the young man disengaged himself made a ceremonious bow joined his two hands and murmured with an ecstatic smile may i venture to hope dear signorina for the honor of your hand  of course you may said mrs light the honor is for us  christina hesitated but for a moment then swept the young man a courtesy as profound as his own bow you are very kind but you are too late i have just accepted  ah my own darling murmuredalmost moanedmrs light  christina and roderick exchanged a single glancea glance brilliant on both sides she passed her hand into his arm he tossed his clustering locks and led her away  a short time afterwards rowland saw the young man whom she had rejected leaning against a doorway he was ugly but what is called distinguishedlooking he had a heavy black eye a sallow complexion a long thin neck his hair was cropped en brosse he looked very young yet extremely bored he was staring at the ceiling and stroking an imperceptible moustache rowland espied the cavaliere giacosa hard by and having joined him asked him the young mans name  oh said the cavaliere he s a pezzo grosso a neapolitan prince casamassima       chapter vi frascati  one day on entering rodericks lodging not the modest rooms on the ripetta which he had first occupied but a much more sumptuous apartment on the corso rowland found a letter on the table addressed to himself it was from roderick and consisted of but three lines i am gone to frascatifor meditation if i am not at home on friday you had better join me on friday he was still absent and rowland went out to frascati here he found his friend living at the inn and spending his days according to his own account lying under the trees of the villa mondragone reading ariosto he was in a sombre mood meditation seemed not to have been fruitful nothing especially pertinent to our narrative had passed between the two young men since mrs lights ball save a few words bearing on an incident of that entertainment rowland informed roderick the next day that he had told miss light of his engagement i dont know whether you ll thank me he had said but it s my duty to let you know it miss light perhaps has already done so  roderick looked at him a moment intently with his color slowly rising why should nt i thank you he asked i am not ashamed of my engagement  as you had not spoken of it yourself i thought you might have a reason for not having it known  a man does nt gossip about such a matter with strangers roderick rejoined with the ring of irritation in his voice  with strangersno said rowland smiling  roderick continued his work but after a moment turning round with a frown if you supposed i had a reason for being silent pray why should you have spoken  i did not speak idly my dear roderick i weighed the matter before i spoke and promised myself to let you know immediately afterwards it seemed to me that miss light had better know that your affections are pledged  the cavaliere has put it into your head then that i am making love to her  no in that case i would not have spoken to her first  do you mean then that she is making love to me  this is what i mean said rowland after a pause that girl finds you interesting and is pleased even though she may play indifference at your finding her so i said to myself that it might save her some sentimental disappointment to know without delay that you are not at liberty to become indefinitely interested in other women  you seem to have taken the measure of my liberty with extraordinary minuteness cried roderick  you must do me justice i am the cause of your separation from miss garland the cause of your being exposed to temptations which she hardly even suspects how could i ever face her rowland demanded with much warmth of tone if at the end of it all she should be unhappy  i had no idea that miss garland had made such an impression on you you are too zealous i take it she did nt charge you to look after her interests  if anything happens to you i am accountable you must understand that  that s a view of the situation i cant accept in your own interest no less than in mine it can only make us both very uncomfortable i know all i owe you i feel it you know that but i am not a small boy nor an outer barbarian any longer and whatever i do i do with my eyes open when i do well the merit s mine if i do ill the fault s mine the idea that i make you nervous is detestable dedicate your nerves to some better cause and believe that if miss garland and i have a quarrel we shall settle it between ourselves  rowland had found himself wondering shortly before whether possibly his brilliant young friend was without a conscience now it dimly occurred to him that he was without a heart rowland as we have already intimated was a man with a moral passion and no small part of it had gone forth into his relations with roderick there had been from the first no protestations of friendship on either side but rowland had implicitly offered everything that belongs to friendship and roderick had apparently as deliberately accepted it rowland indeed had taken an exquisite satisfaction in his companions deep inexpressive assent to his interest in him here is an uncommonly fine thing he said to himself a nature unconsciously grateful a man in whom friendship does the thing that love alone generally has the credit ofknocks the bottom out of pride his reflective judgment of roderick as time went on had indulged in a great many irrepressible vagaries but his affection his sense of something in his companions whole personality that overmastered his heart and beguiled his imagination had never for an instant faltered he listened to rodericks last words and then he smiled as he rarely smiledwith bitterness  i dont at all like your telling me i am too zealous he said if i had not been zealous i should never have cared a fig for you  roderick flushed deeply and thrust his modeling tool up to the handle into the clay say it outright you have been a great fool to believe in me  i desire to say nothing of the kind and you dont honestly believe i do said rowland it seems to me i am really very goodnatured even to reply to such nonsense  roderick sat down crossed his arms and fixed his eyes on the floor rowland looked at him for some moments it seemed to him that he had never so clearly read his companions strangely commingled characterhis strength and his weakness his picturesque personal attractiveness and his urgent egoism his exalted ardor and his puerile petulance it would have made him almost sick however to think that on the whole roderick was not a generous fellow and he was so far from having ceased to believe in him that he felt just now more than ever that all this was but the painful complexity of genius rowland who had not a grain of genius either to make one say he was an interested reasoner or to enable one to feel that he could afford a dangerous theory or two adhered to his conviction of the essential salubrity of genius suddenly he felt an irresistible compassion for his companion it seemed to him that his beautiful faculty of production was a doubleedged instrument susceptible of being dealt in backhanded blows at its possessor genius was priceless inspired divine but it was also at its hours capricious sinister cruel and men of genius accordingly were alternately very enviable and very helpless it was not the first time he had had a sense of rodericks standing helpless in the grasp of his temperament it had shaken him as yet but with a half goodhumored wantonness but henceforth possibly it meant to handle him more roughly these were not times therefore for a friend to have a short patience  when you err you say the fault s your own he said at last it is because your faults are your own that i care about them  rowlands voice when he spoke with feeling had an extraordinary amenity roderick sat staring a moment longer at the floor then he sprang up and laid his hand affectionately on his friends shoulder you are the best man in the world he said and i am a vile brute only he added in a moment you dont understand me and he looked at him with eyes of such radiant lucidity that one might have said and rowland did almost say so himself that it was the fault of ones own grossness if one failed to read to the bottom of that beautiful soul  rowland smiled sadly what is it now explain  oh i cant explain cried roderick impatiently returning to his work i have only one way of expressing my deepest feelingsit s this and he swung his tool he stood looking at the halfwrought clay for a moment and then flung the instrument down and even this half the time plays me false  rowland felt that his irritation had not subsided and he himself had no taste for saying disagreeable things nevertheless he saw no sufficient reason to forbear uttering the words he had had on his conscience from the beginning we must do what we can and be thankful he said and let me assure you of thisthat it wont help you to become entangled with miss light  roderick pressed his hand to his forehead with vehemence and then shook it in the air despairingly a gesture that had become frequent with him since he had been in italy no no it s no use you dont understand me but i dont blame you you cant  you think it will help you then said rowland wondering  i think that when you expect a man to produce beautiful and wonderful works of art you ought to allow him a certain freedom of action you ought to give him a long rope you ought to let him follow his fancy and look for his material wherever he thinks he may find it a mother cant nurse her child unless she follows a certain diet an artist cant bring his visions to maturity unless he has a certain experience you demand of us to be imaginative and you deny us that which feeds the imagination in labor we must be as passionate as the inspired sibyl in life we must be mere machines it wont do when you have got an artist to deal with you must take him as he is good and bad together i dont say they are pleasant fellows to know or easy fellows to live with i dont say they satisfy themselves any better than other people i only say that if you want them to produce you must let them conceive if you want a bird to sing you must not cover up its cage shoot them the poor devils drown them exterminate them if you will in the interest of public morality it may be morality would gaini dare say it would but if you suffer them to live let them live on their own terms and according to their own inexorable needs  rowland burst out laughing i have no wish whatever either to shoot you or to drown you he said why launch such a tirade against a warning offered you altogether in the interest of your freest development do you really mean that you have an inexorable need of embarking on a flirtation with miss lighta flirtation as to the felicity of which there may be differences of opinion but which cannot at best under the circumstances be called innocent your last summers adventures were more so as for the terms on which you are to live i had an idea you had arranged them otherwise  i have arranged nothingthank god i dont pretend to arrange i am young and ardent and inquisitive and i admire miss light that s enough i shall go as far as admiration leads me i am not afraid your genuine artist may be sometimes half a madman but he s not a coward  suppose that in your speculation you should come to grief not only sentimentally but artistically  come what come will if i m to fizzle out the sooner i know it the better sometimes i half suspect it but let me at least go out and reconnoitre for the enemy and not sit here waiting for him cudgeling my brains for ideas that wont come  do what he would rowland could not think of rodericks theory of unlimited experimentation especially as applied in the case under discussion as anything but a pernicious illusion but he saw it was vain to combat longer for inclination was powerfully on rodericks side he laid his hand on rodericks shoulder looked at him a moment with troubled eyes then shook his head mournfully and turned away  i cant work any more said roderick you have upset me i ll go and stroll on the pincian and he tossed aside his workingjacket and prepared himself for the street as he was arranging his cravat before the glass something occurred to him which made him thoughtful he stopped a few moments afterward as they were going out with his hand on the doorknob you did from your own point of view an indiscreet thing he said to tell miss light of my engagement  rowland looked at him with a glance which was partly an interrogation but partly also an admission  if she s the coquette you say roderick added you have given her a reason the more  and that s the girl you propose to devote yourself to cried rowland  oh i dont say it mind i only say that she s the most interesting creature in the world the next time you mean to render me a service pray give me notice beforehand  it was perfectly characteristic of roderick that a fortnight later he should have let his friend know that he depended upon him for society at frascati as freely as if no irritating topic had ever been discussed between them rowland thought him generous and he had at any rate a liberal faculty of forgetting that he had given you any reason to be displeased with him it was equally characteristic of rowland that he complied with his friends summons without a moments hesitation his cousin cecilia had once told him that he was the dupe of his intense benevolence she put the case with too little favor or too much as the reader chooses it is certain at least that he had a constitutional tendency towards magnanimous interpretations nothing happened however to suggest to him that he was deluded in thinking that rodericks secondary impulses were wiser than his primary ones and that the rounded total of his nature had a harmony perfectly attuned to the most amiable of its brilliant parts rodericks humor for the time was pitched in a minor key he was lazy listless and melancholy but he had never been more friendly and kindly and appealingly submissive winter had begun by the calendar but the weather was divinely mild and the two young men took long slow strolls on the hills and lounged away the mornings in the villas the villas at frascati are delicious places and replete with romantic suggestiveness roderick as he had said was meditating and if a masterpiece was to come of his meditations rowland was perfectly willing to bear him company and coax along the process but roderick let him know from the first that he was in a miserably sterile mood and cudgel his brains as he would could think of nothing that would serve for the statue he was to make for mr leavenworth  it is worse out here than in rome he said for here i am face to face with the dead blank of my mind there i could nt think of anything either but there i found things to make me forget that i needed to this was as frank an allusion to christina light as could have been expected under the circumstances it seemed indeed to rowland surprisingly frank and a pregnant example of his companions often strangely irresponsible way of looking at harmful facts roderick was silent sometimes for hours with a puzzled look on his face and a constant fold between his even eyebrows at other times he talked unceasingly with a slow idle halfnonsensical drawl rowland was half a dozen times on the point of asking him what was the matter with him he was afraid he was going to be ill roderick had taken a great fancy to the villa mondragone and used to declaim fantastic compliments to it as they strolled in the winter sunshine on the great terrace which looks toward tivoli and the iridescent sabine mountains he carried his volume of ariosto in his pocket and took it out every now and then and spouted half a dozen stanzas to his companion he was as a general thing very little of a reader but at intervals he would take a fancy to one of the classics and peruse it for a month in disjointed scraps he had picked up italian without study and had a wonderfully sympathetic accent though in reading aloud he ruined the sense of half the lines he rolled off so sonorously rowland who pronounced badly but understood everything once said to him that ariosto was not the poet for a man of his craft a sculptor should make a companion of dante so he lent him the inferno which he had brought with him and advised him to look into it roderick took it with some eagerness perhaps it would brighten his wits he returned it the next day with disgust he had found it intolerably depressing  a sculptor should model as dante writesyou re right there he said but when his genius is in eclipse dante is a dreadfully smoky lamp by what perversity of fate he went on has it come about that i am a sculptor at all a sculptor is such a confoundedly special genius there are so few subjects he can treat so few things in life that bear upon his work so few moods in which he himself is inclined to it it may be noted that rowland had heard him a dozen times affirm the flat reverse of all this if i had only been a paintera little quiet docile matteroffact painter like our friend singletoni should only have to open my ariosto here to find a subject to find color and attitudes stuffs and composition i should only have to look up from the page at that mouldy old fountain against the blue sky at that cypress alley wandering away like a procession of priests in couples at the crags and hollows of the sabine hills to find myself grasping my brush best of all would be to be ariosto himself or one of his brotherhood then everything in nature would give you a hint and every form of beauty be part of your stock you would nt have to look at things only to saywith tears of rage half the timeoh yes it s wonderfully pretty but what the deuce can i do with it but a sculptor now that s a pretty trade for a fellow who has got his living to make and yet is so damnably constituted that he cant work to order and considers that aesthetically clock ornaments dont pay you cant model the sergecoated cypresses nor those mouldering old tritons and all the sunny sadness of that driedup fountain you cant put the light into marblethe lovely caressing consenting italian light that you get so much of for nothing say that a dozen times in his life a man has a complete sculpturesque visiona vision in which the imagination recognizes a subject and the subject kindles the imagination it is a remunerative rate of work and the intervals are comfortable  one morning as the two young men were lounging on the sunwarmed grass at the foot of one of the slanting pines of the villa mondragone roderick delivered himself of a tissue of lugubrious speculations as to the possible mischances of ones genius what if the watch should run down he asked and you should lose the key what if you should wake up some morning and find it stopped inexorably appallingly stopped such things have been and the poor devils to whom they happened have had to grin and bear it the whole matter of genius is a mystery it bloweth where it listeth and we know nothing of its mechanism if it gets out of order we cant mend it if it breaks down altogether we cant set it going again we must let it choose its own pace and hold our breath lest it should lose its balance it s dealt out in different doses in big cups and little and when you have consumed your portion it s as naif to ask for more as it was for oliver twist to ask for more porridge lucky for you if you ve got one of the big cups we drink them down in the dark and we cant tell their size until we tip them up and hear the last gurgle those of some men last for life those of others for a couple of years nay what are you smiling at so damnably he went on nothing is more common than for an artist who has set out on his journey on a highstepping horse to find himself all of a sudden dismounted and invited to go his way on foot you can number them by the thousandthe people of two or three successes the poor fellows whose candle burnt out in a night some of them groped their way along without it some of them gave themselves up for blind and sat down by the wayside to beg who shall say that i m not one of these who shall assure me that my credit is for an unlimited sum nothing proves it and i never claimed it or if i did i did so in the mere boyish joy of shaking off the dust of northampton if you believed so my dear fellow you did so at your own risk what am i what are the best of us but an experiment do i succeeddo i fail it does nt depend on me i m prepared for failure it wont be a disappointment simply because i shant survive it the end of my work shall be the end of my life when i have played my last card i shall cease to care for the game i m not making vulgar threats of suicide for destiny i trust wont add insult to injury by putting me to that abominable trouble but i have a conviction that if the hour strikes here and he tapped his forehead i shall disappear dissolve be carried off in a cloud for the past ten days i have had the vision of some such fate perpetually swimming before my eyes my mind is like a dead calm in the tropics and my imagination as motionless as the phantom ship in the ancient mariner  rowland listened to this outbreak as he often had occasion to listen to rodericks heated monologues with a number of mental restrictions both in gravity and in gayety he said more than he meant and you did him simple justice if you privately concluded that neither the glow of purpose nor the chill of despair was of so intense a character as his florid diction implied the moods of an artist his exaltations and depressions rowland had often said to himself were like the penflourishes a writingmaster makes in the air when he begins to set his copy he may bespatter you with ink he may hit you in the eye but he writes a magnificent hand it was nevertheless true that at present poor roderick gave unprecedented tokens of moral stagnation and as for genius being held by the precarious tenure he had sketched rowland was at a loss to see whence he could borrow the authority to contradict him he sighed to himself and wished that his companion had a trifle more of little sam singletons evenness of impulse but then was singleton a man of genius he answered that such reflections seemed to him unprofitable not to say morbid that the proof of the pudding was in the eating that he did nt know about bringing a genius that had palpably spent its last breath back to life again but that he was satisfied that vigorous effort was a cure for a great many ills that seemed far gone dont heed your mood he said and dont believe there is any calm so dead that your own lungs cant ruffle it with a breeze if you have work to do dont wait to feel like it set to work and you will feel like it  set to work and produce abortions cried roderick with ire preach that to others production with me must be either pleasure or nothing as i said just now i must either stay in the saddle or not go at all i wont do secondrate work i cant if i would i have no cleverness apart from inspiration i am not a gloriani you are right he added after a while this is unprofitable talk and it makes my head ache i shall take a nap and see if i can dream of a bright idea or two  he turned his face upward to the parasol of the great pine closed his eyes and in a short time forgot his sombre fancies january though it was the mild stillness seemed to vibrate with faint midsummer sounds rowland sat listening to them and wishing that for the sake of his own felicity rodericks temper were graced with a certain absent ductility he was brilliant but was he like many brilliant things brittle suddenly to his musing sense the soft atmospheric hum was overscored with distincter sounds he heard voices beyond a mass of shrubbery at the turn of a neighboring path in a moment one of them began to seem familiar and an instant later a large white poodle emerged into view he was slowly followed by his mistress miss light paused a moment on seeing rowland and his companion but though the former perceived that he was recognized she made no bow presently she walked directly toward him he rose and was on the point of waking roderick but she laid her finger on her lips and motioned him to forbear she stood a moment looking at rodericks handsome slumber  what delicious oblivion she said happy man stenterelloand she pointed to his facewake him up  the poodle extended a long pink tongue and began to lick rodericks cheek  why asked rowland if he is happy  oh i want companions in misery besides i want to show off my dog roderick roused himself sat up and stared by this time mrs light had approached walking with a gentleman on each side of her one of these was the cavaliere giacosa the other was prince casamassima i should have liked to lie down on the grass and go to sleep christina added but it would have been unheard of  oh not quite said the prince in english with a tone of great precision there was already a sleeping beauty in the wood  charming cried mrs light do you hear that my dear  when the prince says a brilliant thing it would be a pity to lose it said the young girl your servant sir and she smiled at him with a grace that might have reassured him if he had thought her compliment ambiguous  roderick meanwhile had risen to his feet and mrs light began to exclaim on the oddity of their meeting and to explain that the day was so lovely that she had been charmed with the idea of spending it in the country and who would ever have thought of finding mr mallet and mr hudson sleeping under a tree  oh i beg your pardon i was not sleeping said rowland  dont you know that mr mallet is mr hudsons sheepdog asked christina he was mounting guard to keep away the wolves  to indifferent purpose madame said rowland indicating the young girl  is that the way you spend your time christina demanded of roderick i never yet happened to learn what men were doing when they supposed women were not watching them but it was something vastly below their reputation  when pray said roderick smoothing his ruffled locks are women not watching them  we shall give you something better to do at any rate how long have you been here it s an age since i have seen you we consider you domiciled here and expect you to play host and entertain us  roderick said that he could offer them nothing but to show them the great terrace with its view and ten minutes later the group was assembled there mrs light was extravagant in her satisfaction christina looked away at the sabine mountains in silence the prince stood by frowning at the rapture of the elder lady  this is nothing he said at last my word of honor have you seen the terrace at san gaetano  ah that terrace murmured mrs light amorously i suppose it is magnificent  it is four hundred feet long and paved with marble and the view is a thousand times more beautiful than this you see far away the blue blue sea and the little smoke of vesuvio  christina love cried mrs light forthwith the prince has a terrace four hundred feet long all paved with marble  the cavaliere gave a little cough and began to wipe his eyeglass  stupendous said christina to go from one end to the other the prince must have out his golden carriage this was apparently an allusion to one of the other items of the young mans grandeur  you always laugh at me said the prince i know no more what to say  she looked at him with a sad smile and shook her head no no dear prince i dont laugh at you heaven forbid you are much too serious an affair i assure you i feel your importance what did you inform us was the value of the hereditary diamonds of the princess casamassima  ah you are laughing at me yet said the poor young man standing rigid and pale  it does nt matter christina went on we have a note of it mamma writes all those things down in a little book  if you are laughed at dear prince at least it s in company said mrs light caressingly and she took his arm as if to resist his possible displacement under the shock of her daughters sarcasm but the prince looked heavyeyed toward rowland and roderick to whom the young girl was turning as if he had much rather his lot were cast with theirs  is the villa inhabited christina asked pointing to the vast melancholy structure which rises above the terrace  not privately said roderick it is occupied by a jesuits college for little boys  can women go in  i am afraid not and roderick began to laugh fancy the poor little devils looking up from their latin declensions and seeing miss light standing there  i should like to see the poor little devils with their rosy cheeks and their long black gowns and when they were pretty i should nt scruple to kiss them but if i cant have that amusement i must have some other we must not stand planted on this enchanting terrace as if we were stakes driven into the earth we must dance we must feast we must do something picturesque mamma has arranged i believe that we are to go back to frascati to lunch at the inn i decree that we lunch here and send the cavaliere to the inn to get the provisions he can take the carriage which is waiting below  miss light carried out this undertaking with unfaltering ardor the cavaliere was summoned and he stook to receive her commands hat in hand with his eyes cast down as if she had been a princess addressing her majordomo she however laid her hand with friendly grace upon his buttonhole and called him a dear good old cavaliere for being always so willing her spirits had risen with the occasion and she talked irresistible nonsense bring the best they have she said no matter if it ruins us and if the best is very bad it will be all the more amusing i shall enjoy seeing mr mallet try to swallow it for proprietys sake mr hudson will say out like a man that it s horrible stuff and that he ll be choked first be sure you bring a dish of maccaroni the prince must have the diet of the neapolitan nobility but i leave all that to you my poor dear cavaliere you know what s good only be sure above all you bring a guitar mr mallet will play us a tune i ll dance with mr hudson and mamma will pair off with the prince of whom she is so fond  and as she concluded her recommendations she patted her bland old servitor caressingly on the shoulder he looked askance at rowland his little black eye glittered it seemed to say did nt i tell you she was a good girl  the cavaliere returned with zealous speed accompanied by one of the servants of the inn laden with a basket containing the materials of a rustic luncheon the porter of the villa was easily induced to furnish a table and half a dozen chairs and the repast when set forth was pronounced a perfect success not so good as to fail of the proper picturesqueness nor yet so bad as to defeat the proper function of repasts christina continued to display the most charming animation and compelled rowland to reflect privately that think what one might of her the harmonious gayety of a beautiful girl was the most beautiful sight in nature her goodhumor was contagious roderick who an hour before had been descanting on madness and suicide commingled his laughter with hers in ardent devotion prince casamassima stroked his young moustache and found a fine cool smile for everything his neighbor mrs light who had rowland on the other side made the friendliest confidences to each of the young men and the cavaliere contributed to the general hilarity by the solemnity of his attention to his plate as for rowland the spirit of kindly mirth prompted him to propose the health of this useful old gentleman as the effective author of their pleasure a moment later he wished he had held his tongue for although the toast was drunk with demonstrative goodwill the cavaliere received it with various small signs of eager selfeffacement which suggested to rowland that his diminished gentility but half relished honors which had a flavor of patronage to perform punctiliously his mysterious duties toward the two ladies and to elude or to baffle observation on his own meritsthis seemed the cavalieres modest programme rowland perceived that mrs light who was not always remarkable for tact seemed to have divined his humor on this point she touched her glass to her lips but offered him no compliment and immediately gave another direction to the conversation he had brought no guitar so that when the feast was over there was nothing to hold the little group together christina wandered away with roderick to another part of the terrace the prince whose smile had vanished sat gnawing the head of his cane near mrs light and rowland strolled apart with the cavaliere to whom he wished to address a friendly word in compensation for the discomfort he had inflicted on his modesty the cavaliere was a mine of information upon all roman places and people he told rowland a number of curious anecdotes about the old villa mondragone if history could always be taught in this fashion thought rowland it s the idealstrolling up and down on the very spot commemorated hearing sympathetic anecdotes from deeply indigenous lips at last as they passed rowland observed the mournful physiognomy of prince casamassima and glancing toward the other end of the terrace saw that roderick and christina had disappeared from view the young man was sitting upright in an attitude apparently habitual of ceremonious rigidity but his lower jaw had fallen and was propped up with his cane and his dull dark eye was fixed upon the angle of the villa which had just eclipsed miss light and her companion his features were grotesque and his expression vacuous but there was a lurking delicacy in his face which seemed to tell you that nature had been making casamassimas for a great many centuries and though she adapted her mould to circumstances had learned to mix her material to an extraordinary fineness and to perform the whole operation with extreme smoothness the prince was stupid rowland suspected but he imagined he was amiable and he saw that at any rate he had the great quality of regarding himself in a thoroughly serious light rowland touched his companions arm and pointed to the melancholy nobleman  why in the world does he not go after her and insist on being noticed he asked  oh he s very proud said the cavaliere  that s all very well but a gentleman who cultivates a passion for that young lady must be prepared to make sacrifices  he thinks he has already made a great many he comes of a very great familya race of princes who for six hundred years have married none but the daughters of princes but he is seriously in love and he would marry her tomorrow  and she will not have him  ah she is very proud too the cavaliere was silent a moment as if he were measuring the propriety of frankness he seemed to have formed a high opinion of rowlands discretion for he presently continued it would be a great match for she brings him neither a name nor a fortunenothing but her beauty but the signorina will receive no favors i know her well she would rather have her beauty blasted than seem to care about the marriage and if she ever accepts the prince it will be only after he has implored her on his knees  but she does care about it said rowland and to bring him to his knees she is working upon his jealousy by pretending to be interested in my friend hudson if you said more you would say that eh  the cavalieres shrewdness exchanged a glance with rowlands by no means miss light is a singular girl she has many romantic ideas she would be quite capable of interesting herself seriously in an interesting young man like your friend and doing her utmost to discourage a splendid suitor like the prince she would act sincerely and she would go very far but it would be unfortunate for the young man he added after a pause for at the last she would retreat  a singular girl indeed  she would accept the more brilliant parti i can answer for it  and what would be her motive  she would be forced there would be circumstances i cant tell you more  but this implies that the rejected suitor would also come back he might grow tired of waiting  oh this one is good look at him now rowland looked and saw that the prince had left his place by mrs light and was marching restlessly to and fro between the villa and the parapet of the terrace every now and then he looked at his watch in this country you know said the cavaliere a young lady never goes walking alone with a handsome young man it seems to him very strange  it must seem to him monstrous and if he overlooks it he must be very much in love  oh he will overlook it he is far gone  who is this exemplary lover then what is he  a neapolitan one of the oldest houses in italy he is a prince in your english sense of the word for he has a princely fortune he is very young he is only just of age he saw the signorina last winter in naples he fell in love with her from the first but his family interfered and an old uncle an ecclesiastic monsignor b hurried up to naples seized him and locked him up meantime he has passed his majority and he can dispose of himself his relations are moving heaven and earth to prevent his marrying miss light and they have sent us word that he forfeits his property if he takes his wife out of a certain line i have investigated the question minutely and i find this is but a fiction to frighten us he is perfectly free but the estates are such that it is no wonder they wish to keep them in their own hands for italy it is an extraordinary case of unincumbered property the prince has been an orphan from his third year he has therefore had a long minority and made no inroads upon his fortune besides he is very prudent and orderly i am only afraid that some day he will pull the pursestrings too tight all these years his affairs have been in the hands of monsignor b who has managed them to perfectionpaid off mortagages planted forests opened up mines it is now a magnificent fortune such a fortune as with his name would justify the young man in pretending to any alliance whatsoever and he lays it all at the feet of that young girl who is wandering in yonder boschetto with a penniless artist  he is certainly a phoenix of princes the signora must be in a state of bliss  the cavaliere looked imperturbably grave the signora has a high esteem for his character  his character by the way rejoined rowland with a smile what sort of a character is it  eh prince casamassima is a veritable prince he is a very good young man he is not brilliant nor witty but he ll not let himself be made a fool of he s very grave and very devoutthough he does propose to marry a protestant he will handle that point after marriage he s as you see him there a young man without many ideas but with a very firm grasp of a single onethe conviction that prince casamassima is a very great person that he greatly honors any young lady by asking for her hand and that things are going very strangely when the young lady turns her back upon him the poor young man i am sure is profoundly perplexed but i whisper to him every day pazienza signor principe  so you firmly believe said rowland in conclusion that miss light will accept him just in time not to lose him  i count upon it she would make too perfect a princess to miss her destiny  and you hold that nevertheless in the mean while in listening to say my friend hudson she will have been acting in good faith  the cavaliere lifted his shoulders a trifle and gave an inscrutable smile eh dear signore the christina is very romantic  so much so you intimate that she will eventually retract in consequence not of a change of sentiment but of a mysterious outward pressure  if everything else fails there is that resource but it is mysterious as you say and you need nt try to guess it you will never know  the poor signorina then will suffer  not too much i hope  and the poor young man you maintain that there is nothing but disappointment in store for the infatuated youth who loses his heart to her  the cavaliere hesitated he had better he said in a moment go and pursue his studies in florence there are very fine antiques in the uffizi  rowland presently joined mrs light to whom her restless protege had not yet returned that s right she said sit down here i have something serious to say to you i am going to talk to you as a friend i want your assistance in fact i demand it it s your duty to render it look at that unhappy young man  yes said rowland he seems unhappy  he is just come of age he bears one of the greatest names in italy and owns one of the greatest properties and he is pining away with love for my daughter  so the cavaliere tells me  the cavaliere should nt gossip said mrs light dryly such information should come from me the prince is pining as i say he s consumed he s devoured it s a real italian passion i know what that means and the lady gave a speaking glance which seemed to coquet for a moment with retrospect meanwhile if you please my daughter is hiding in the woods with your dear friend mr hudson i could cry with rage  if things are so bad as that said rowland it seems to me that you ought to find nothing easier than to dispatch the cavaliere to bring the guilty couple back  never in the world my hands are tied do you know what christina would do she would tell the cavaliere to go about his businessheaven forgive herand send me word that if she had a mind to she would walk in the woods till midnight fancy the cavaliere coming back and delivering such a message as that before the prince think of a girl wantonly making light of such a chance as hers he would marry her tomorrow at six oclock in the morning  it is certainly very sad said rowland  that costs you little to say if you had left your precious young meddler to vegetate in his native village you would have saved me a world of distress  nay you marched into the jaws of danger said rowland you came and disinterred poor hudson in his own secluded studio  in an evil hour i wish to heaven you would talk with him  i have done my best  i wish then you would take him away you have plenty of money do me a favor take him to travel go to the eastgo to timbuctoo then when christina is princess casamassima mrs light added in a moment he may come back if he chooses  does she really care for him rowland asked abruptly  she thinks she does possibly she is a living riddle she must needs follow out every idea that comes into her head fortunately most of them dont last long but this one may last long enough to give the prince a chill if that were to happen i dont know what i should do i should be the most miserable of women it would be too cruel after all i ve suffered to make her what she is to see the labor of years blighted by a caprice for i can assure you sir mrs light went on that if my daughter is the greatest beauty in the world some of the credit is mine  rowland promptly remarked that this was obvious he saw that the ladys irritated nerves demanded comfort from flattering reminiscence and he assumed designedly the attitude of a zealous auditor she began to retail her efforts her hopes her dreams her presentiments her disappointments in the cause of her daughters matrimonial fortunes it was a long story and while it was being unfolded the prince continued to pass to and fro stiffly and solemnly like a pendulum marking the time allowed for the young lady to come to her senses mrs light evidently at an early period had gathered her maternal hopes into a sacred sheaf which she said her prayers and burnt incense to and treated like a sort of fetish they had been her religion she had none other and she performed her devotions bravely and cheerily in the light of day the poor old fetish had been so caressed and manipulated so thrust in and out of its niche so passed from hand to hand so dressed and undressed so mumbled and fumbled over that it had lost by this time much of its early freshness and seemed a rather battered and disfeatured divinity but it was still brought forth in moments of trouble to have its tinseled petticoat twisted about and be set up on its altar rowland observed that mrs light had a genuine maternal conscience she considered that she had been performing a sacred duty in bringing up christina to set her cap for a prince and when the future looked dark she found consolation in thinking that destiny could never have the heart to deal a blow at so deserving a person this conscience upside down presented to rowlands fancy a real physical image he was on the point half a dozen times of bursting out laughing  i dont know whether you believe in presentiments said mrs light and i dont care i have had one for the last fifteen years people have laughed at it but they have nt laughed me out of it it has been everything to me i could nt have lived without it one must believe in something it came to me in a flash when christina was five years old i remember the day and the place as if it were yesterday she was a very ugly baby for the first two years i could hardly bear to look at her and i used to spoil my own looks with crying about her she had an italian nurse who was very fond of her and insisted that she would grow up pretty i could nt believe her i used to contradict her and we were forever squabbling i was just a little silly in those dayssurely i may say it nowand i was very fond of being amused if my daughter was ugly it was not that she resembled her mamma i had no lack of amusement people accused me i believe of neglecting my little girl if it was so i ve made up for it since one day i went to drive on the pincio in very low spirits a trusted friend had greatly disappointed me while i was there he passed me in a carriage driving with a horrible woman who had made trouble between us i got out of my carriage to walk about and at last sat down on a bench i can show you the spot at this hour while i sat there a child came wandering along the patha little girl of four or five very fantastically dressed in crimson and orange she stopped in front of me and stared at me and i stared at her queer little dress which was a cheap imitation of the costume of one of these contadine at last i looked up at her face and said to myself bless me what a beautiful child what a splendid pair of eyes what a magnificent head of hair if my poor christina were only like that the child turned away slowly but looking back with its eyes fixed on me all of a sudden i gave a cry pounced on it pressed it in my arms and covered it with kisses it was christina my own precious child so disguised by the ridiculous dress which the nurse had amused herself in making for her that her own mother had not recognized her she knew me but she said afterwards that she had not spoken to me because i looked so angry of course my face was sad i rushed with my child to the carriage drove home posthaste pulled off her rags and as i may say wrapped her in cotton i had been blind i had been insane she was a creature in ten millions she was to be a beauty of beauties a priceless treasure every day after that the certainty grew from that time i lived only for my daughter i watched her i caressed her from morning till night i worshipped her i went to see doctors about her i took every sort of advice i was determined she should be perfection the things that have been done for that girl siryou would nt believe them they would make you smile nothing was spared if i had been told that she must have a bath every morning of molten pearls i would have found means to give it to her she never raised a finger for herself she breathed nothing but perfumes she walked upon velvet she never was out of my sight and from that day to this i have never said a sharp word to her by the time she was ten years old she was beautiful as an angel and so noticed wherever we went that i had to make her wear a veil like a woman of twenty her hair reached down to her feet her hands were the hands of a princess then i saw that she was as clever as she was beautiful and that she had only to play her cards she had masters professors every educational advantage they told me she was a little prodigy she speaks french italian german better than most natives she has a wonderful genius for music and might make her fortune as a pianist if it was not made for her otherwise i traveled all over europe every one told me she was a marvel the director of the opera in paris saw her dance at a childs party at spa and offered me an enormous sum if i would give her up to him and let him have her educated for the ballet i said no i thank you sir she is meant to be something finer than a princesse de theatre i had a passionate belief that she might marry absolutely whom she chose that she might be a princess out and out it has never left me till this hour and i can assure you that it has sustained me in many embarrassments financial some of them i dont mind confessing it i have raised money on that girls face i ve taken her to the jews and bade her put up her veil and asked if the mother of that young lady was not safe she of course was too young to understand me and yet as a child you would have said she knew what was in store for her before she could read she had the manners the tastes the instincts of a little princess she would have nothing to do with shabby things or shabby people if she stained one of her frocks she was seized with a kind of frenzy and tore it to pieces at nice at baden at brighton wherever we stayed she used to be sent for by all the great people to play with their children she has played at kissinggames with people who now stand on the steps of thrones i have gone so far as to think at times that those childish kisses were a signa symbola portent you may laugh at me if you like but have nt such things happened again and again without half as good a cause and does nt history notoriously repeat itself there was a little spanish girl at a secondrate english boardingschool thirty years ago the empress certainly is a pretty woman but what is my christina pray i ve dreamt of it sometimes every night for a month i wont tell you i have been to consult those old women who advertise in the newspapers you ll call me an old imbecile imbecile if you please i have refused magnificent offers because i believed that somehow or otherif wars and revolutions were needed to bring it aboutwe should have nothing less than that there might be another coup detat somewhere and another brilliant young sovereign looking out for a wife at last however mrs light proceeded with incomparable gravity since the overturning of the poor king of naples and that charming queen and the expulsion of all those dear little oldfashioned italian granddukes and the dreadful radical talk that is going on all over the world it has come to seem to me that with christina in such a position i should be really very nervous even in such a position she would hold her head very high and if anything should happen to her she would make no concessions to the popular fury the best thing if one is prudent seems to be a nobleman of the highest possible rank short of belonging to a reigning stock there you see one striding up and down looking at his watch and counting the minutes till my daughter reappears  rowland listened to all this with a huge compassion for the heroine of the tale what an education what a history what a school of character and of morals he looked at the prince and wondered whether he too had heard mrs lights story if he had he was a brave man i certainly hope you ll keep him he said to mrs light you have played a dangerous game with your daughter it would be a pity not to win but there is hope for you yet here she comes at last  christina reappeared as he spoke these words strolling beside her companion with the same indifferent tread with which she had departed rowland imagined that there was a faint pink flush in her cheek which she had not carried away with her and there was certainly a light in rodericks eyes which he had not seen there for a week  bless my soul how they are all looking at us she cried as they advanced one would think we were prisoners of the inquisition and she paused and glanced from the prince to her mother and from rowland to the cavaliere and then threw back her head and burst into farringing laughter what is it pray have i been very improper am i ruined forever dear prince you are looking at me as if i had committed the unpardonable sin  i myself said the prince would never have ventured to ask you to walk with me alone in the country for an hour  the more fool you dear prince as the vulgar say our walk has been charming i hope you on your side have enjoyed each others society  my dear daughter said mrs light taking the arm of her predestined soninlaw i shall have something serious to say to you when we reach home we will go back to the carriage  something serious decidedly it is the inquisition mr hudson stand firm and let us agree to make no confessions without conferring previously with each other they may put us on the rack first mr mallet i see also christina added has something serious to say to me  rowland had been looking at her with the shadow of his latelystirred pity in his eyes possibly he said but it must be for some other time  i am at your service i see our goodhumor is gone and i only wanted to be amiable it is very discouraging cavaliere you only look as if you had a little of the milk of human kindness left from your venerable visage at least there is no telling what you think give me your arm and take me away  the party took its course back to the carriage which was waiting in the grounds of the villa and rowland and roderick bade their friends farewell christina threw herself back in her seat and closed her eyes a manoeuvre for which rowland imagined the prince was grateful as it enabled him to look at her without seeming to depart from his attitude of distinguished disapproval rowland found himself aroused from sleep early the next morning to see roderick standing before him dressed for departure with his bag in his hand i am off he said i am back to work i have an idea i must strike while the iron s hot farewell and he departed by the first train rowland went alone by the next       chapter vii saint cecilias  rowland went often to the coliseum he never wearied of it one morning about a month after his return from frascati as he was strolling across the vast arena he observed a young woman seated on one of the fragments of stone which are ranged along the line of the ancient parapet it seemed to him that he had seen her before but he was unable to localize her face passing her again he perceived that one of the little redlegged french soldiers at that time on guard there had approached her and was gallantly making himself agreeable she smiled brilliantly and rowland recognized the smile it had always pleased him of a certain comely assunta who sometimes opened the door for mrs lights visitors he wondered what she was doing alone in the coliseum and conjectured that assunta had admirers as well as her young mistress but that being without the same domiciliary conveniencies she was using this massive heritage of her latin ancestors as a boudoir in other words she had an appointment with her lover who had better from present appearances be punctual it was a long time since rowland had ascended to the ruinous upper tiers of the great circus and as the day was radiant and the distant views promised to be particularly clear he determined to give himself the pleasure the custodian unlocked the great wooden wicket and he climbed through the winding shafts where the eager roman crowds had billowed and trampled not pausing till he reached the highest accessible point of the ruin the views were as fine as he had supposed the lights on the sabine mountains had never been more lovely he gazed to his satisfaction and retraced his steps in a moment he paused again on an abutment somewhat lower from which the glance dropped dizzily into the interior there are chance anfractuosities of ruin in the upper portions of the coliseum which offer a very fair imitation of the rugged face of an alpine cliff in those days a multitude of delicate flowers and sprays of wild herbage had found a friendly soil in the hoary crevices and they bloomed and nodded amid the antique masonry as freely as they would have done in the virgin rock rowland was turning away when he heard a sound of voices rising up from below he had but to step slightly forward to find himself overlooking two persons who had seated themselves on a narrow ledge in a sunny corner they had apparently had an eye to extreme privacy but they had not observed that their position was commanded by rowlands standpoint one of these airy adventurers was a lady thickly veiled so that even if he had not been standing directly above her rowland could not have seen her face the other was a young man whose face was also invisible but who as rowland stood there gave a toss of his clustering locks which was equivalent to the signatureroderick hudson a moments reflection hereupon satisfied him of the identity of the lady he had been unjust to poor assunta sitting patient in the gloomy arena she had not come on her own errand rowlands discoveries made him hesitate should he retire as noiselessly as possible or should he call out a friendly good morning while he was debating the question he found himself distinctly hearing his friends words they were of such a nature as to make him unwilling to retreat and yet to make it awkward to be discovered in a position where it would be apparent that he had heard them  if what you say is true said christina with her usual soft deliberatenessit made her words rise with peculiar distinctness to rowlands earyou are simply weak i am sorry i hopedi really believedyou were not  no i am not weak answered roderick with vehemence i maintain that i am not weak i am incomplete perhaps but i cant help that weakness is a mans own fault  incomplete then said christina with a laugh it s the same thing so long as it keeps you from splendid achievement is it written then that i shall really never know what i have so often dreamed of  what have you dreamed of  a man whom i can perfectly respect cried the young girl with a sudden flame a man at least whom i can unrestrictedly admire i meet one as i have met more than one before whom i fondly believe to be cast in a larger mould than most of the vile human breed to be large in character great in talent strong in will in such a man as that i say ones weary imagination at last may rest or it may wander if it will yet never need to wander far from the deeps where ones heart is anchored when i first knew you i gave no sign but you had struck me i observed you as women observe and i fancied you had the sacred fire  before heaven i believe i have cried roderick  ah but so little it flickers and trembles and sputters it goes out you tell me for whole weeks together from your own account it s ten to one that in the long run you re a failure  i say those things sometimes myself but when i hear you say them they make me feel as if i could work twenty years at a sitting on purpose to refute you  ah the man who is strong with what i call strength christina replied would neither rise nor fall by anything i could say i am a poor weak woman i have no strength myself and i can give no strength i am a miserable medley of vanity and folly i am silly i am ignorant i am affected i am false i am the fruit of a horrible education sown on a worthless soil i am all that and yet i believe i have one merit i should know a great character when i saw it and i should delight in it with a generosity which would do something toward the remission of my sins for a man who should really give me a certain feelingwhich i have never had but which i should know when it camei would send prince casamassima and his millions to perdition i dont know what you think of me for saying all this i suppose we have not climbed up here under the skies to play propriety why have you been at such pains to assure me after all that you are a little man and not a great one a weak one and not a strong i innocently imagined that your eyes declared you were strong but your voice condemns you i always wondered at it it s not the voice of a conqueror  give me something to conquer cried roderick and when i say that i thank you from my soul my voice whatever you think of it shall speak the truth  christina for a moment said nothing rowland was too interested to think of moving you pretend to such devotion she went on and yet i am sure you have never really chosen between me and that person in america  do me the favor not to speak of her said roderick imploringly  why not i say no ill of her and i think all kinds of good i am certain she is a far better girl than i and far more likely to make you happy  this is happiness this present palpable moment said roderick though you have such a genius for saying the things that torture me  it s greater happiness than you deserve then you have never chosen i say you have been afraid to choose you have never really faced the fact that you are false that you have broken your faith you have never looked at it and seen that it was hideous and yet said no matter i ll brave the penalty i ll bear the shame you have closed your eyes you have tried to stifle remembrance to persuade yourself that you were not behaving as badly as you seemed to be and there would be some way after all of compassing bliss and yet escaping trouble you have faltered and drifted you have gone on from accident to accident and i am sure that at this present moment you cant tell what it is you really desire  roderick was sitting with his knees drawn up and bent and his hands clapsed around his legs he bent his head and rested his forehead on his knees  christina went on with a sort of infernal calmness i believe that really you dont greatly care for your friend in america any more than you do for me you are one of the men who care only for themselves and for what they can make of themselves that s very well when they can make something great and i could interest myself in a man of extraordinary power who should wish to turn all his passions to account but if the power should turn out to be after all rather ordinary fancy feeling ones self ground in the mill of a thirdrate talent if you have doubts about yourself i cant reassure you i have too many doubts myself about everything in this weary world you have gone up like a rocket in your profession they tell me are you going to come down like the stick i dont pretend to know i repeat frankly what i have said beforethat all modern sculpture seems to me weak and that the only things i care for are some of the most battered of the antiques of the vatican no no i cant reassure you and when you tell mewith a confidence in my discretion of which certainly i am duly sensiblethat at times you feel terribly small why i can only answer ah then my poor friend i am afraid you are small the language i should like to hear from a certain person would be the language of absolute decision  roderick raised his head but he said nothing he seemed to be exchanging a long glance with his companion the result of it was to make him fling himself back with an inarticulate murmur rowland admonished by the silence was on the point of turning away but he was arrested by a gesture of the young girl she pointed for a moment into the blue air roderick followed the direction of her gesture  is that little flower we see outlined against that dark niche she asked as intensely blue as it looks through my veil she spoke apparently with the amiable design of directing the conversation into a less painful channel  rowland from where he stood could see the flower she meanta delicate plant of radiant hue which sprouted from the top of an immense fragment of wall some twenty feet from christinas place  roderick turned his head and looked at it without answering at last glancing round put up your veil he said christina complied does it look as blue now he asked  ah what a lovely color she murmured leaning her head on one side  would you like to have it  she stared a moment and then broke into a light laugh  would you like to have it he repeated in a ringing voice  dont look as if you would eat me up she answered it s harmless if i say yes  roderick rose to his feet and stood looking at the little flower it was separated from the ledge on which he stood by a rugged surface of vertical wall which dropped straight into the dusky vaults behind the arena suddenly he took off his hat and flung it behind him christina then sprang to her feet  i will bring it you he said  she seized his arm are you crazy do you mean to kill yourself  i shall not kill myself sit down  excuse me not till you do and she grasped his arm with both hands  roderick shook her off and pointed with a violent gesture to her former place go there he cried fiercely  you can never never she murmured beseechingly clasping her hands i implore you  roderick turned and looked at her and then in a voice which rowland had never heard him use a voice almost thunderous a voice which awakened the echoes of the mighty ruin he repeated sit down she hesitated a moment and then she dropped on the ground and buried her face in her hands  rowland had seen all this and he saw more he saw roderick clasp in his left arm the jagged corner of the vertical partition along which he proposed to pursue his crazy journey stretch out his leg and feel for a restingplace for his foot rowland had measured with a glance the possibility of his sustaining himself and pronounced it absolutely nil the wall was garnished with a series of narrow projections the remains apparently of a brick cornice supporting the arch of a vault which had long since collapsed it was by lodging his toes on these loose brackets and grasping with his hands at certain mouldering protuberances on a level with his head that roderick intended to proceed the relics of the cornice were utterly worthless as a support rowland had observed this and yet for a moment he had hesitated if the thing were possible he felt a sudden admiring glee at the thought of rodericks doing it it would be finely done it would be gallant it would have a sort of masculine eloquence as an answer to christinas sinister persiflage but it was not possible rowland left his place with a bound and scrambled down some neighboring steps and the next moment a stronger pair of hands than christinas were laid upon rodericks shoulder  he turned staring pale and angry christina rose pale and staring too but beautiful in her wonder and alarm my dear roderick said rowland i am only preventing you from doing a very foolish thing that s an exploit for spiders not for young sculptors of promise  roderick wiped his forehead looked back at the wall and then closed his eyes as if with a spasm of retarded dizziness i wont resist you he said but i have made you obey he added turning to christina am i weak now  she had recovered her composure she looked straight past him and addressed rowland be so good as to show me the way out of this horrible place  he helped her back into the corridor roderick followed after a short interval of course as they were descending the steps came questions for rowland to answer and more or less surprise where had he come from how happened he to have appeared at just that moment rowland answered that he had been rambling overhead and that looking out of an aperture he had seen a gentleman preparing to undertake a preposterous gymnastic feat and a lady swooning away in consequence interference seemed justifiable and he had made it as prompt as possible roderick was far from hanging his head like a man who has been caught in the perpetration of an extravagant folly but if he held it more erect than usual rowland believed that this was much less because he had made a show of personal daring than because he had triumphantly proved to christina that like a certain person she had dreamed of he too could speak the language of decision christina descended to the arena in silence apparently occupied with her own thoughts she betrayed no sense of the privacy of her interview with roderick needing an explanation rowland had seen stranger things in new york the only evidence of her recent agitation was that on being joined by her maid she declared that she was unable to walk home she must have a carriage a fiacre was found resting in the shadow of the arch of constantine and rowland suspected that after she had got into it she disburdened herself under her veil of a few natural tears  rowland had played eavesdropper to so good a purpose that he might justly have omitted the ceremony of denouncing himself to roderick he preferred however to let him know that he had overheard a portion of his talk with christina  of course it seems to you roderick said a proof that i am utterly infatuated  miss light seemed to me to know very well how far she could go rowland answered she was twisting you round her finger i dont think she exactly meant to defy you but your crazy pursuit of that flower was a proof that she could go all lengths in the way of making a fool of you  yes said roderick meditatively she is making a fool of me  and what do you expect to come of it  nothing good and roderick put his hands into his pockets and looked as if he had announced the most colorless fact in the world  and in the light of your late interview what do you make of your young lady  if i could tell you that it would be plain sailing but she ll not tell me again i am weak  are you very sure you are not weak  i may be but she shall never know it  rowland said no more until they reached the corso when he asked his companion whether he was going to his studio  roderick started out of a reverie and passed his hands over his eyes oh no i cant settle down to work after such a scene as that i was not afraid of breaking my neck then but i feel all in a tremor now i will goi will go and sit in the sun on the pincio  promise me this first said rowland very solemnly that the next time you meet miss light it shall be on the earth and not in the air  since his return from frascati roderick had been working doggedly at the statue ordered by mr leavenworth to rowlands eye he had made a very fair beginning but he had himself insisted from the first that he liked neither his subject nor his patron and that it was impossible to feel any warmth of interest in a work which was to be incorporated into the ponderous personality of mr leavenworth it was all against the grain he wrought without love nevertheless after a fashion he wrought and the figure grew beneath his hands miss blanchards friend was ordering works of art on every side and his purveyors were in many cases persons whom roderick declared it was infamy to be paired with there had been grand tailors he said who declined to make you a coat unless you got the hat you were to wear with it from an artist of their own choosing it seemed to him that he had an equal right to exact that his statue should not form part of the same system of ornament as the pearl of perugia a picture by an american confrere who had in mr leavenworths opinion a prodigious eye for color as a customer mr leavenworth used to drop into rodericks studio to see how things were getting on and give a friendly hint or so he would seat himself squarely plant his goldtopped cane between his legs which he held very much apart rest his large white hands on the head and enunciate the principles of spiritual art as he hoisted them one by one as you might say out of the depths of his moral consciousness his benignant and imperturbable pomposity gave roderick the sense of suffocating beneath a large fluffy bolster and the worst of the matter was that the good gentlemans placid vanity had an integument whose toughness no sarcastic shaft could pierce roderick admitted that in thinking over the tribulations of struggling genius the danger of dying of overpatronage had never occurred to him  the deterring effect of the episode of the coliseum was apparently of long continuance if rodericks nerves had been shaken his hand needed time to recover its steadiness he cultivated composure upon principles of his own by frequenting entertainments from which he returned at four oclock in the morning and lapsing into habits which might fairly be called irregular he had hitherto made few friends among the artistic fraternity chiefly because he had taken no trouble about it and there was in his demeanor an elastic independence of the favor of his fellowmortals which made social advances on his own part peculiarly necessary rowland had told him more than once that he ought to fraternize a trifle more with the other artists and he had always answered that he had not the smallest objection to fraternizing let them come but they came on rare occasions and roderick was not punctilious about returning their visits he declared there was not one of them whose works gave him the smallest desire to make acquaintance with the insides of their heads for gloriani he professed a superb contempt and having been once to look at his wares never crossed his threshold again the only one of the fraternity for whom by his own admission he cared a straw was little singleton but he expressed his regard only in a kind of sublime hilarity whenever he encountered this humble genius and quite forgot his existence in the intervals he had never been to see him but singleton edged his way from time to time timidly into rodericks studio and agreed with characteristic modesty that brilliant fellows like the sculptor might consent to receive homage but could hardly be expected to render it roderick never exactly accepted homage and apparently did not quite observe whether poor singleton spoke in admiration or in blame rodericks taste as to companions was singularly capricious there were very good fellows who were disposed to cultivate him who bored him to death and there were others in whom even rowlands goodnature was unable to discover a pretext for tolerance in whom he appeared to find the highest social qualities he used to give the most fantastic reasons for his likes and dislikes he would declare he could nt speak a civil word to a man who brushed his hair in a certain fashion and he would explain his unaccountable fancy for an individual of imperceptible merit by telling you that he had an ancestor who in the thirteenth century had walled up his wife alive i like to talk to a man whose ancestor has walled up his wife alive he would say you may not see the fun of it and think poor p is a very dull fellow it s very possible i dont ask you to admire him but for reasons of my own i like to have him about the old fellow left her for three days with her face uncovered and placed a long mirror opposite to her so that she could see as he said if her gown was a fit  his relish for an odd flavor in his friends had led him to make the acquaintance of a number of people outside of rowlands wellordered circle and he made no secret of their being very queer fish he formed an intimacy among others with a crazy fellow who had come to rome as an emissary of one of the central american republics to drive some ecclesiastical bargain with the papal government the pope had given him the cold shoulder but since he had not prospered as a diplomatist he had sought compensation as a man of the world and his great flamboyant curricle and negro lackeys were for several weeks one of the striking ornaments of the pincian he spoke a queer jargon of italian spanish french and english humorously relieved with scraps of ecclesiastical latin and to those who inquired of roderick what he found to interest him in such a fantastic jackanapes the latter would reply looking at his interlocutor with his lucid blue eyes that it was worth any sacrifice to hear him talk nonsense the two had gone together one night to a ball given by a lady of some renown in the spanish colony and very late on his way home roderick came up to rowlands rooms in whose windows he had seen a light rowland was going to bed but roderick flung himself into an armchair and chattered for an hour the friends of the costa rican envoy were as amusing as himself and in very much the same line the mistress of the house had worn a yellow satin dress and gold heels to her slippers and at the close of the entertainment had sent for a pair of castanets tucked up her petticoats and danced a fandango while the gentlemen sat crosslegged on the floor it was awfully low roderick said all of a sudden i perceived it and bolted nothing of that kind ever amuses me to the end before it s half over it bores me to death it makes me sick hang it why cant a poor fellow enjoy things in peace my illusions are all brokenwinded they wont carry me twenty paces i cant laugh and forget my laugh dies away before it begins your friend stendhal writes on his bookcovers i never got farther that he has seen too early in life la beaute parfaite i dont know how early he saw it i saw it before i was bornin another state of being i cant describe it positively i can only say i dont find it anywhere now not at the bottom of champagne glasses not strange as it may seem in that extra halfyard or so of shoulder that some women have their balldresses cut to expose i dont find it at merry suppertables where half a dozen ugly men with pomatumed heads are rapidly growing uglier still with heat and wine not when i come away and walk through these squalid black streets and go out into the forum and see a few old battered stone posts standing there like gnawed bones stuck into the earth everything is mean and dusky and shabby and the men and women who make up this socalled brilliant society are the meanest and shabbiest of all they have no real spontaneity they are all cowards and popinjays they have no more dignity than so many grasshoppers nothing is good but one and he jumped up and stood looking at one of his statues which shone vaguely across the room in the dim lamplight  yes do tell us said rowland what to hold on by  those things of mine were tolerably good he answered but my idea was betterand that s what i mean  rowland said nothing he was willing to wait for roderick to complete the circle of his metamorphoses but he had no desire to officiate as chorus to the play if roderick chose to fish in troubled waters he must land his prizes himself  you think i m an impudent humbug the latter said at last coming up to moralize at this hour of the night you think i want to throw dust into your eyes to put you off the scent that s your eminently rational view of the case  excuse me from taking any view at all said rowland  you have given me up then  no i have merely suspended judgment i am waiting  you have ceased then positively to believe in me  rowland made an angry gesture oh cruel boy when you have hit your mark and made people care for you you should nt twist your weapon about at that rate in their vitals allow me to say i am sleepy good night  some days afterward it happened that rowland on a long afternoon ramble took his way through one of the quiet corners of the trastevere he was particularly fond of this part of rome though he could hardly have expressed the charm he found in it as you pass away from the dusky swarming purlieus of the ghetto you emerge into a region of empty soundless grassgrown lanes and alleys where the shabby houses seem mouldering away in disuse and yet your footstep brings figures of startling roman type to the doorways there are few monuments here but no part of rome seemed more historic in the sense of being weighted with a crushing past blighted with the melancholy of things that had had their day when the yellow afternoon sunshine slept on the sallow battered walls and lengthened the shadows in the grassy courtyards of small closed churches the place acquired a strange fascination the church of saint cecilia has one of these sunny wastelooking courts the edifice seems abandoned to silence and the charity of chance devotion rowland never passed it without going in and he was generally the only visitor he entered it now but found that two persons had preceded him both were women one was at her prayers at one of the side altars the other was seated against a column at the upper end of the nave rowland walked to the altar and paid in a momentary glance at the clever statue of the saint in death in the niche beneath it the usual tribute to the charm of polished ingenuity as he turned away he looked at the person seated and recognized christina light seeing that she perceived him he advanced to speak to her  she was sitting in a listless attitude with her hands in her lap she seemed to be tired she was dressed simply as if for walking and escaping observation when he had greeted her he glanced back at her companion and recognized the faithful assunta  christina smiled are you looking for mr hudson he is not here i am happy to say  but you he asked this is a strange place to find you  not at all people call me a strange girl and i might as well have the comfort of it i came to take a walk that by the way is part of my strangeness i cant loll all the morning on a sofa and all the afternoon in a carriage i get horribly restless i must move i must do something and see something mamma suggests a cup of tea meanwhile i put on an old dress and half a dozen veils i take assunta under my arm and we start on a pedestrian tour it s a bore that i cant take the poodle but he attracts attention we trudge about everywhere there is nothing i like so much i hope you will congratulate me on the simplicity of my tastes  i congratulate you on your wisdom to live in rome and not to walk would i think be poor pleasure but you are terribly far from home and i am afraid you are tired  a littleenough to sit here a while  might i offer you my company while you rest  if you will promise to amuse me i am in dismal spirits  rowland said he would do what he could and brought a chair and placed it near her he was not in love with her he disapproved of her he mistrusted her and yet he felt it a kind of privilege to watch her and he found a peculiar excitement in talking to her the background of her nature as he would have called it was large and mysterious and it emitted strange fantastic gleams and flashes watching for these rather quickened ones pulses moreover it was not a disadvantage to talk to a girl who made one keep guard on ones composure it diminished ones chronic liability to utter something less than revised wisdom  assunta had risen from her prayers and as he took his place was coming back to her mistress but christina motioned her away no no while you are about it say a few dozen more she said pray for me she added in english pray i say nothing silly she has been at it half an hour i envy her capacity  have you never felt in any degree rowland asked the fascination of catholicism  yes i have been through that too there was a time when i wanted immensely to be a nun it was not a laughing matter it was when i was about sixteen years old i read the imitation and the life of saint catherine i fully believed in the miracles of the saints and i was dying to have one of my own the least little accident that could have been twisted into a miracle would have carried me straight into the bosom of the church i had the real religious passion it has passed away and as i sat here just now i was wondering what had become of it  rowland had already been sensible of something in this young ladys tone which he would have called a want of veracity and this epitome of her religious experience failed to strike him as an absolute statement of fact but the trait was not disagreeable for she herself was evidently the foremost dupe of her inventions she had a fictitious history in which she believed much more fondly than in her real one and an infinite capacity for extemporized reminiscence adapted to the mood of the hour she liked to idealize herself to take interesting and picturesque attitudes to her own imagination and the vivacity and spontaneity of her character gave her really a startingpoint in experience so that the manycolored flowers of fiction which blossomed in her talk were not so much perversions as sympathetic exaggerations of fact and rowland felt that whatever she said of herself might have been under the imagined circumstances impulse was there audacity the restless questioning temperament i am afraid i am sadly prosaic he said for in these many months now that i have been in rome i have never ceased for a moment to look at catholicism simply from the outside i dont see an opening as big as your fingernail where i could creep into it  what do you believe asked christina looking at him are you religious  i believe in god  christina let her beautiful eyes wander a while and then gave a little sigh you are much to be envied  you i imagine in that line have nothing to envy me  yes i have rest  you are too young to say that  i am not young i have never been young my mother took care of that i was a little wrinkled old woman at ten  i am afraid said rowland in a moment that you are fond of painting yourself in dark colors  she looked at him a while in silence do you wish she demanded at last to win my eternal gratitude prove to me that i am better than i suppose  i should have first to know what you really suppose  she shook her head it would nt do you would be horrified to learn even the things i imagine about myself and shocked at the knowledge of evil displayed in my very mistakes  well then said rowland i will ask no questions but at a venture i promise you to catch you some day in the act of doing something very good  can it be can it be she asked that you too are trying to flatter me i thought you and i had fallen from the first into rather a truthspeaking vein  oh i have not abandoned it said rowland and he determined since he had the credit of homely directness to push his advantage farther the opportunity seemed excellent but while he was hesitating as to just how to begin the young girl said bending forward and clasping her hands in her lap please tell me about your religion  tell you about it i cant said rowland with a good deal of emphasis  she flushed a little is it such a mighty mystery it cannot be put into words nor communicated to my base ears  it is simply a sentiment that makes part of my life and i cant detach myself from it sufficiently to talk about it  religion it seems to me should be eloquent and aggressive it should wish to make converts to persuade and illumine to sway all hearts  ones religion takes the color of ones general disposition i am not aggressive and certainly i am not eloquent  beware then of finding yourself confronted with doubt and despair i am sure that doubt at times and the bitterness that comes of it can be terribly eloquent to tell the truth my lonely musings before you came in were eloquent enough in their way what do you know of anything but this strange terrible world that surrounds you how do you know that your faith is not a mere crazy castle in the air one of those castles that we are called fools for building when we lodge them in this life  i dont know it any more than any one knows the contrary but ones religion is extremely ingenious in doing without knowledge  in such a world as this it certainly needs to be  rowland smiled what is your particular quarrel with this world  it s a general quarrel nothing is true or fixed or permanent we all seem to be playing with shadows more or less grotesque it all comes over me here so dismally the very atmosphere of this cold deserted church seems to mock at ones longing to believe in something who cares for it now who comes to it who takes it seriously poor stupid assunta there gives in her adhesion in a jargon she does nt understand and you and i proper passionless tourists come lounging in to rest from a walk and yet the catholic church was once the proudest institution in the world and had quite its own way with mens souls when such a mighty structure as that turns out to have a flaw what faith is one to put in ones poor little views and philosophies what is right and what is wrong what is one really to care for what is the proper rule of life i am tired of trying to discover and i suspect it s not worth the trouble live as most amuses you  your perplexities are so terribly comprehensive said rowland smiling that one hardly knows where to meet them first  i dont care much for anything you can say because it s sure to be halfhearted you are not in the least contented yourself  how do you know that  oh i am an observer  no one is absolutely contented i suppose but i assure you i complain of nothing  so much the worse for your honesty to begin with you are in love  you would not have me complain of that  and it does nt go well there are grievous obstacles so much i know you need nt protest i ask no questions you will tell no oneme least of all why does one never see you  why if i came to see you said rowland deliberating it would nt be it could nt be for a trivial reasonbecause i had not been in a month because i was passing because i admire you it would be because i should have something very particular to say i have not come because i have been slow in making up my mind to say it  you are simply cruel something particular in this ocean of inanities in common charity speak  i doubt whether you will like it  oh i hope to heaven it s not a compliment  it may be called a compliment to your reasonableness you perhaps remember that i gave you a hint of it the other day at frascati  has it been hanging fire all this time explode i promise not to stop my ears  it relates to my friend hudson and rowland paused she was looking at him expectantly her face gave no sign i am rather disturbed in mind about him he seems to me at times to be in an unpromising way he paused again but christina said nothing the case is simply this he went on it was by my advice he renounced his career at home and embraced his present one i made him burn his ships i brought him to rome i launched him in the world and i stand surety in a measure toto his mother for his prosperity it is not such smooth sailing as it might be and i am inclined to put up prayers for fair winds if he is to succeed he must workquietly devotedly it is not news to you i imagine that hudson is a great admirer of yours  christina remained silent she turned away her eyes with an air not of confusion but of deep deliberation surprising frankness had as a general thing struck rowland as the keynote of her character but she had more than once given him a suggestion of an unfathomable power of calculation and her silence now had something which it is hardly extravagant to call portentous he had of course asked himself how far it was questionable taste to inform an unprotected girl for the needs of a cause that another man admired her the thing superficially had an uncomfortable analogy with the shrewdness that uses a cats paw and lets it risk being singed but he decided that even rigid discretion is not bound to take a young lady at more than her own valuation and christina presently reassured him as to the limits of her susceptibility mr hudson is in love with me she said  rowland flinched a trifle thenam i he asked from this point of view of mine to be glad or sorry  i dont understand you  why is hudson to be happy or unhappy  she hesitated a moment you wish him to be great in his profession and for that you consider that he must be happy in his life  decidedly i dont say it s a general rule but i think it is a rule for him  so that if he were very happy he would become very great  he would at least do himself justice  and by that you mean a great deal  a great deal  christina sank back in her chair and rested her eyes on the cracked and polished slabs of the pavement at last looking up you have not forgotten i suppose that you told me he was engaged  by no means  he is still engaged then  to the best of my belief  and yet you desire that as you say he should be made happy by something i can do for him  what i desire is this that your great influence with him should be exerted for his good that it should help him and not retard him understand me you probably know that your lovers have rather a restless time of it i can answer for two of them you dont know your own mind very well i imagine and you like being admired rather at the expense of the admirer since we are really being frank i wonder whether i might not say the great word  you need nt i know it i am a horrible coquette  no not a horrible one since i am making an appeal to your generosity i am pretty sure you cannot imagine yourself marrying my friend  there s nothing i cannot imagine that is my trouble  rowlands brow contracted impatiently i cannot imagine it then he affirmed  christina flushed faintly then very gently i am not so bad as you think she said  it is not a question of badness it is a question of whether circumstances dont make the thing an extreme improbability  worse and worse i can be bullied then or bribed  you are not so candid said rowland as you pretend to be my feeling is this hudson as i understand him does not need as an artist the stimulus of strong emotion of passion hes better without it hes emotional and passionate enough when he s left to himself the sooner passion is at rest therefore the sooner he will settle down to work and the fewer emotions he has that are mere emotions and nothing more the better for him if you cared for him enough to marry him i should have nothing to say i would never venture to interfere but i strongly suspect you dont and therefore i would suggest most respectfully that you should let him alone  and if i let him alone as you say all will be well with him for ever more  not immediately and not absolutely but things will be easier he will be better able to concentrate himself  what is he doing now wherein does he dissatisfy you  i can hardly say he s like a watch that s running down he is moody desultory idle irregular fantastic  heavens what a list and it s all poor me  no not all but you are a part of it and i turn to you because you are a more tangible sensible responsible cause than the others  christina raised her hand to her eyes and bent her head thoughtfully rowland was puzzled to measure the effect of his venture she rather surprised him by her gentleness at last without moving if i were to marry him she asked what would have become of his fiancee  i am bound to suppose that she would be extremely unhappy  christina said nothing more and rowland to let her make her reflections left his place and strolled away poor assunta sitting patiently on a stone bench and unprovided on this occasion with military consolation gave him a bright frank smile which might have been construed as an expression of regret for herself and of sympathy for her mistress rowland presently seated himself again near christina  what do you think she asked looking at him of your friends infidelity  i dont like it  was he very much in love with her  he asked her to marry him you may judge  is she rich  no she is poor  is she very much in love with him  i know her too little to say  she paused again and then resumed you have settled in your mind then that i will never seriously listen to him  i think it unlikely until the contrary is proved  how shall it be proved how do you know what passes between us  i can judge of course but from appearance but like you i am an observer hudson has not at all the air of a prosperous suitor  if he is depressed there is a reason he has a bad conscience one must hope so at least on the other hand simply as a friend she continued gently you think i can do him no good  the humility of her tone combined with her beauty as she made this remark was inexpressibly touching and rowland had an uncomfortable sense of being put at a disadvantage there are doubtless many good things you might do if you had proper opportunity he said but you seem to be sailing with a current which leaves you little leisure for quiet benevolence you live in the whirl and hurry of a world into which a poor artist can hardly find it to his advantage to follow you  in plain english i am hopelessly frivolous you put it very generously  i wont hesitate to say all my thought said rowland for better or worse you seem to me to belong both by character and by circumstance to what is called the world the great world you are made to ornament it magnificently you are not made to be an artists wife  i see but even from your point of view that would depend upon the artist extraordinary talent might make him a member of the great world  rowland smiled that is very true  if as it is christina continued in a moment you take a low view of meno you need nt protesti wonder what you would think if you knew certain things  what things do you mean  well for example how i was brought up i have had a horrible education there must be some good in me since i have perceived it since i have turned and judged my circumstances  my dear miss light rowland murmured  she gave a little quick laugh you dont want to hear you dont want to have to think about that  have i a right to you need nt justify yourself  she turned upon him a moment the quickened light of her beautiful eyes then fell to musing again is there not some novel or some play she asked at last in which some beautiful wicked woman who has ensnared a young man sees his father come to her and beg her to let him go  very likely said rowland i hope she consents  i forget but tell me she continued shall you consideradmitting your propositionthat in ceasing to flirt with mr hudson so that he may go about his business i do something magnanimous heroic sublimesomething with a fine name like that  rowland elated with the prospect of gaining his point was about to reply that she would deserve the finest name in the world but he instantly suspected that this tone would not please her and besides it would not express his meaning  you do something i shall greatly respect he contented himself with saying  she made no answer and in a moment she beckoned to her maid what have i to do today she asked  assunta meditated eh it s a very busy day fortunately i have a better memory than the signorina she said turning to rowland she began to count on her fingers we have to go to the pie di marmo to see about those laces that were sent to be washed you said also that you wished to say three sharp words to the buonvicini about your pink dress you want some mossrosebuds for tonight and you wont get them for nothing you dine at the austrian embassy and that frenchman is to powder your hair you re to come home in time to receive for the signora gives a dance and so away away till morning  ah yes the mossroses christina murmured caressingly i must have a quantityat least a hundred nothing but buds eh you must sew them in a kind of immense apron down the front of my dress packed tight together eh it will be delightfully barbarous and then twenty more or so for my hair they go very well with powder dont you think so and she turned to rowland i am going en pompadour  going where  to the spanish embassy or whatever it is  all down the front signorina dio buono you must give me time assunta cried  yes well go and she left her place she walked slowly to the door of the church looking at the pavement and rowland could not guess whether she was thinking of her apron of mossrosebuds or of her opportunity for moral sublimity before reaching the door she turned away and stood gazing at an old picture indistinguishable with blackness over an altar at last they passed out into the court glancing at her in the open air rowland was startled he imagined he saw the traces of hastily suppressed tears they had lost time she said and they must hurry she sent assunta to look for a fiacre she remained silent a while scratching the ground with the point of her parasol and then at last looking up she thanked rowland for his confidence in her reasonableness it s really very comfortable to be asked to be expected to do something good after all the horrid things one has been used to doinginstructed commanded forced to do i ll think over what you have said to me in that deserted quarter fiacres are rare and there was some delay in assuntas procuring one christina talked of the church of the picturesque old court of that strange decaying corner of rome rowland was perplexed he was ill at ease at last the fiacre arrived but she waited a moment longer so decidedly she suddenly asked i can only harm him  you make me feel very brutal said rowland  and he is such a fine fellow that it would be really a great pity eh  i shall praise him no more rowland said  she turned away quickly but she lingered still do you remember promising me soon after we first met that at the end of six months you would tell me definitely what you thought of me  it was a foolish promise  you gave it bear it in mind i will think of what you have said to me farewell she stepped into the carriage and it rolled away rowland stood for some minutes looking after it and then went his way with a sigh if this expressed general mistrust he ought three days afterward to have been reassured he received by the post a note containing these words  i have done it begin and respect me  c l  to be perfectly satisfactory indeed the note required a commentary he called that evening upon roderick and found one in the information offered him at the door by the old servingwomanthe startling information that the signorino had gone to naples       chapter viii provocation  about a month later rowland addressed to his cousin cecilia a letter of which the following is a portion   so much for myself yet i tell you but a tithe of my own story unless i let you know how matters stand with poor hudson for he gives me more to think about just now than anything else in the world i need a good deal of courage to begin this chapter you warned me you know and i made rather light of your warning i have had all kinds of hopes and fears but hitherto in writing to you i have resolutely put the hopes foremost now however my pride has forsaken me and i should like hugely to give expression to a little comfortable despair i should like to say my dear wise woman you were right and i was wrong you were a shrewd observer and i was a meddlesome donkey when i think of a little talk we had about the salubrity of genius i feel my ears tingle if this is salubrity give me raging disease i m pestered to death i go about with a chronic heartache there are moments when i could shed salt tears there s a pretty portrait of the most placid of men i wish i could make you understand or rather i wish you could make me i dont understand a jot it s a hideous mocking mystery i give it up i dont in the least give it up you know i m incapable of giving it up i sit holding my head by the hour racking my brain wondering what under heaven is to be done you told me at northampton that i took the thing too easily you would tell me now perhaps that i take it too hard i do altogether but it cant be helped without flattering myself i may say i m sympathetic many another man before this would have cast his perplexities to the winds and declared that mr hudson must lie on his bed as he had made it some men perhaps would even say that i am making a mighty ado about nothing that i have only to give him rope and he will tire himself out but he tugs at his rope altogether too hard for me to hold it comfortably i certainly never pretended the thing was anything else than an experiment i promised nothing i answered for nothing i only said the case was hopeful and that it would be a shame to neglect it i have done my best and if the machine is running down i have a right to stand aside and let it scuttle amen amen no i can write that but i cant feel it i cant be just i can only be generous i love the poor fellow and i cant give him up as for understanding him that s another matter nowadays i dont believe even you would ones wits are sadly pestered over here i assure you and i m in the way of seeing more than one puzzling specimen of human nature roderick and miss light between them have nt i already told you about miss light last winter everything was perfection roderick struck out bravely did really great things and proved himself as i supposed thoroughly solid he was strong he was firstrate i felt perfectly secure and sang private paeans of joy we had passed at a bound into the open sea and left danger behind but in the summer i began to be puzzled though i succeeded in not being alarmed when we came back to rome however i saw that the tide had turned and that we were close upon the rocks it is in fact another case of ulysses alongside of the sirens only roderick refuses to be tied to the mast he is the most extraordinary being the strangest mixture of qualities i dont understand so much force going with so much weaknesssuch a brilliant gift being subject to such lapses the poor fellow is incomplete and it is really not his own fault nature has given him the faculty out of hand and bidden him be hanged with it i never knew a man harder to advise or assist if he is not in the mood for listening i suppose there is some key or other to his character but i try in vain to find it and yet i cant believe that providence is so cruel as to have turned the lock and thrown the key away he perplexes me as i say to death and though he tires out my patience he still fascinates me sometimes i think he has nt a grain of conscience and sometimes i think that in a way he has an excess he takes things at once too easily and too hard he is both too lax and too tense too reckless and too ambitious too cold and too passionate he has developed faster even than you prophesied and for good and evil alike he takes up a formidable space there s too much of him for me at any rate yes he is hard there is no mistake about that he s inflexible he s brittle and though he has plenty of spirit plenty of soul he has nt what i call a heart he has something that miss garland took for one and i m pretty sure she s a judge but she judged on scanty evidence he has something that christina light here makes believe at times that she takes for one but she is no judge at all i think it is established that in the long run egotism makes a failure in conduct is it also true that it makes a failure in the arts rodericks standard is immensely high i must do him that justice he will do nothing beneath it and while he is waiting for inspiration his imagination his nerves his senses must have something to amuse them this is a highly philosophical way of saying that he has taken to dissipation and that he has just been spending a month at naplesa city where pleasure is actively cultivatedin very bad company are they all like that all the men of genius there are a great many artists here who hammer away at their trade with exemplary industry in fact i am surprised at their success in reducing the matter to a steady daily grind but i really dont think that one of them has his exquisite quality of talent it is in the matter of quantity that he has broken down the bottle wont pour he turns it upside down it s no use sometimes he declares it s emptythat he has done all he was made to do this i consider great nonsense but i would nevertheless take him on his own terms if it was only i that was concerned but i keep thinking of those two praying trusting neighbors of yours and i feel wretchedly like a swindler if his working mood came but once in five years i would willingly wait for it and maintain him in leisure if need be in the intervals but that would be a sorry account to present to them five years of this sort of thing moreover would effectually settle the question i wish he were less of a genius and more of a charlatan he s too confoundedly all of one piece he wont throw overboard a grain of the cargo to save the rest fancy him thus with all his brilliant personal charm his handsome head his careless step his look as of a nervous nineteenthcentury apollo and you will understand that there is mighty little comfort in seeing him in a bad way he was tolerably foolish last summer at baden baden but he got on his feet and for a while he was steady then he began to waver again and at last toppled over now literally he s lying prone he came into my room last night miserably tipsy i assure you it did nt amuse me about miss light it s a long story she is one of the great beauties of all time and worth coming barefoot to rome like the pilgrims of old to see her complexion her glance her step her dusky tresses may have been seen before in a goddess but never in a woman and you may take this for truth because i m not in love with her on the contrary her education has been simply infernal she is corrupt perverse as proud as the queen of sheba and an appalling coquette but she is generous and with patience and skill you may enlist her imagination in a good cause as well as in a bad one the other day i tried to manipulate it a little chance offered me an interview to which it was possible to give a serious turn and i boldly broke ground and begged her to suffer my poor friend to go in peace after a good deal of finessing she consented and the next day with a single word packed him off to naples to drown his sorrow in debauchery i have come to the conclusion that she is more dangerous in her virtuous moods than in her vicious ones and that she probably has a way of turning her back which is the most provoking thing in the world she s an actress she could nt forego doing the thing dramatically and it was the dramatic touch that made it fatal i wished her of course to let him down easily but she desired to have the curtain drop on an attitude and her attitudes deprive inflammable young artists of their reason roderick made an admirable bust of her at the beginning of the winter and a dozen women came rushing to him to be done mutatis mutandis in the same style they were all great ladies and ready to take him by the hand but he told them all their faces did nt interest him and sent them away vowing his destruction  at this point of his long effusion rowland had paused and put by his letter he kept it three days and then read it over he was disposed at first to destroy it but he decided finally to keep it in the hope that it might strike a spark of useful suggestion from the flint of cecilias good sense we know he had a talent for taking advice and then it might be he reflected that his cousins answer would throw some light on mary garlands present vision of things in his altered mood he added these few lines  i unburdened myself the other day of this monstrous load of perplexity i think it did me good and i let it stand i was in a melancholy muddle and i was trying to work myself free you know i like discussion in a quiet way and there is no one with whom i can have it as quietly as with you most sagacious of cousins there is an excellent old lady with whom i often chat and who talks very much to the point but madame grandoni has disliked roderick from the first and if i were to take her advice i would wash my hands of him you will laugh at me for my long face but you would do that in any circumstances i am half ashamed of my letter for i have a faith in my friend that is deeper than my doubts he was here last evening talking about the naples museum the aristides the bronzes the pompeian frescoes with such a beautiful intelligence that doubt of the ultimate future seemed blasphemy i walked back to his lodging with him and he was as mild as midsummer moonlight he has the ineffable something that charms and convinces my last word about him shall not be a harsh one  shortly after sending his letter going one day into his friends studio he found roderick suffering from the grave infliction of a visit from mr leavenworth roderick submitted with extreme ill grace to being bored and he was now evidently in a state of high exasperation he had lately begun a representation of a lazzarone lounging in the sun an image of serene irresponsible sensuous life the real lazzarone he had admitted was a vile fellow but the ideal lazzaroneand his own had been subtly idealizedwas a precursor of the millennium  mr leavenworth had apparently just transferred his unhurrying gaze to the figure  something in the style of the dying gladiator he sympathetically observed  oh no said roderick seriously he s not dying he s only drunk  ah but intoxication you know mr leavenworth rejoined is not a proper subject for sculpture sculpture should not deal with transitory attitudes  lying dead drunk is not a transitory attitude nothing is more permanent more sculpturesque more monumental  an entertaining paradox said mr leavenworth if we had time to exercise our wits upon it i remember at florence an intoxicated figure by michael angelo which seemed to me a deplorable aberration of a great mind i myself touch liquor in no shape whatever i have traveled through europe on cold water the most varied and attractive lists of wines are offered me but i brush them aside no cork has ever been drawn at my command  the movement of drawing a cork calls into play a very pretty set of muscles said roderick i think i will make a figure in that position  a bacchus realistically treated my dear young friend never trifle with your lofty mission spotless marble should represent virtue not vice and mr leavenworth placidly waved his hand as if to exorcise the spirit of levity while his glance journeyed with leisurely benignity to another objecta marble replica of the bust of miss light an ideal head i presume he went on a fanciful representation of one of the pagan goddessesa diana a flora a naiad or dryad i often regret that our american artists should not boldly cast off that extinct nomenclature  she is neither a naiad nor a dryad said roderick and her name is as good as yours or mine  you call hermr leavenworth blandly inquired  miss light rowland interposed in charity  ah our great american beauty not a pagan goddessan american christian lady yes i have had the pleasure of conversing with miss light her conversational powers are not remarkable but her beauty is of a high order i observed her the other evening at a large party where some of the proudest members of the european aristocracy were presentduchesses princesses countesses and others distinguished by similar titles but for beauty grace and elegance my fair countrywoman left them all nowhere what women can compare with a truly refined american lady the duchesses the other night had no attractions for my eyes they looked coarse and sensual it seemed to me that the tyranny of class distinctions must indeed be terrible when such countenances could inspire admiration you see more beautiful girls in an hour on broadway than in the whole tour of europe miss light now on broadway would excite no particular remark  she has never been there cried roderick triumphantly  i m afraid she never will be there i suppose you have heard the news about her  what news roderick had stood with his back turned fiercely poking at his lazzarone but at mr leavenworths last words he faced quickly about  it s the news of the hour i believe miss light is admired by the highest people here they tacitly recognize her superiority she has had offers of marriage from various great lords i was extremely happy to learn this circumstance and to know that they all had been left sighing she has not been dazzled by their titles and their gilded coronets she has judged them simply as men and found them wanting one of them however a young neapolitan prince i believe has after a long probation succeeded in making himself acceptable miss light has at last said yes and the engagement has just been announced i am not generally a retailer of gossip of this description but the fact was alluded to an hour ago by a lady with whom i was conversing and here in europe these conversational trifles usurp the lions share of ones attention i therefore retained the circumstance yes i regret that miss light should marry one of these usedup foreigners americans should stand by each other if she wanted a brilliant match we could have fixed it for her if she wanted a fine fellowa fine sharp enterprising modern mani would have undertaken to find him for her without going out of the city of new york and if she wanted a big fortune i would have found her twenty that she would have had hard work to spend money downnot tied up in feverstricken lands and wormeaten villas what is the name of the young man prince castaway or some such thing  it was well for mr leavenworth that he was a voluminous and imperturbable talker for the current of his eloquence floated him past the short sharp startled cry with which roderick greeted his conversational trifle the young man stood looking at him with parted lips and an excited eye  the position of woman mr leavenworth placidly resumed is certainly a very degraded one in these countries i doubt whether a european princess can command the respect which in our country is exhibited toward the obscurest females the civilization of a country should be measured by the deference shown to the weaker sex judged by that standard where are they over here  though mr leavenworth had not observed rodericks emotion it was not lost upon rowland who was making certain uncomfortable reflections upon it he saw that it had instantly become one with the acute irritation produced by the poor gentlemans oppressive personality and that an explosion of some sort was imminent mr leavenworth with calm unconsciousness proceeded to fire the mine  and now for our culture he said in the same sonorous tones demanding with a gesture the unveiling of the figure which stood somewhat apart muffled in a great sheet  roderick stood looking at him for a moment with concentrated rancor and then strode to the statue and twitched off the cover mr leavenworth settled himself into his chair with an air of flattered proprietorship and scanned the unfinished image i can conscientiously express myself as gratified with the general conception he said the figure has considerable majesty and the countenance wears a fine open expression the forehead however strikes me as not sufficiently intellectual in a statue of culture you know that should be the great point the eye should instinctively seek the forehead could nt you heighten it up a little  roderick for all answer tossed the sheet back over the statue oblige me sir he said oblige me never mention that thing again  never mention it why my dear sir  never mention it it s an abomination  an abomination my culture  yours indeed cried roderick it s none of mine i disown it  disown it if you please said mr leavenworth sternly but finish it first  i d rather smash it cried roderick  this is folly sir you must keep your engagements  i made no engagement a sculptor is nt a tailor did you ever hear of inspiration mine is dead and it s no laughing matter you yourself killed it  iikilled your inspiration cried mr leavenworth with the accent of righteous wrath you re a very ungrateful boy if ever i encouraged and cheered and sustained any one i m sure i have done so to you  i appreciate your good intentions and i dont wish to be uncivil but your encouragement issuperfluous i cant work for you  i call this illhumor young man said mr leavenworth as if he had found the damning word  oh i m in an infernal humor roderick answered  pray sir is it my infelicitous allusion to miss lights marriage  it s your infelicitous everything i dont say that to offend you i beg your pardon if it does i say it by way of making our rupture complete irretrievable  rowland had stood by in silence but he now interfered listen to me he said laying his hand on rodericks arm you are standing on the edge of a gulf if you suffer anything that has passed to interrupt your work on that figure you take your plunge it s no matter that you dont like it you will do the wisest thing you ever did if you make that effort of will necessary for finishing it destroy the statue then if you like but make the effort i speak the truth  roderick looked at him with eyes that still inexorableness made almost tender you too he simply said  rowland felt that he might as well attempt to squeeze water from a polished crystal as hope to move him he turned away and walked into the adjoining room with a sense of sickening helplessness in a few moments he came back and found that mr leavenworth had departedpresumably in a manner somewhat portentous roderick was sitting with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands  rowland made one more attempt you decline to think of what i urge  absolutely  theres one more pointthat you shouldnt for a month go to mrs lights  i go there this evening  that too is an utter folly  there are such things as necessary follies  you are not reflecting you are speaking in passion  why then do you make me speak  rowland meditated a moment is it also necessary that you should lose the best friend you have  roderick looked up that s for you to settle  his best friend clapped on his hat and strode away in a moment the door closed behind him rowland walked hard for nearly a couple of hours he passed up the corso out of the porta del popolo and into the villa borghese of which he made a complete circuit the keenness of his irritation subsided but it left him with an intolerable weight upon his heart when dusk had fallen he found himself near the lodging of his friend madame grandoni he frequently paid her a visit during the hour which preceded dinner and he now ascended her unillumined staircase and rang at her relaxed bellrope with an especial desire for diversion he was told that for the moment she was occupied but that if he would come in and wait she would presently be with him he had not sat musing in the firelight for ten minutes when he heard the jingle of the doorbell and then a rustling and murmuring in the hall the door of the little saloon opened but before the visitor appeared he had recognized her voice christina light swept forward preceded by her poodle and almost filling the narrow parlor with the train of her dress she was colored here and there by the flicking firelight  they told me you were here she said simply as she took a seat  and yet you came in it is very brave said rowland  you are the brave one when one thinks of it where is the padrona  occupied for the moment but she is coming  how soon  i have already waited ten minutes i expect her from moment to moment  meanwhile we are alone and she glanced into the dusky corners of the room  unless stenterello counts said rowland  oh he knows my secretsunfortunate brute she sat silent awhile looking into the firelight then at last glancing at rowland come say something pleasant she exclaimed  i have been very happy to hear of your engagement  no i dont mean that i have heard that so often only since breakfast that it has lost all sense i mean some of those unexpected charming things that you said to me a month ago at saint cecilias  i offended you then said rowland i was afraid i had  ah it occurred to you why have nt i seen you since  really i dont know and he began to hesitate for an explanation i have called but you have never been at home  you were careful to choose the wrong times you have a way with a poor girl you sit down and inform her that she is a person with whom a respectable young man cannot associate without contamination your friend is a very nice fellow you are very careful of his morals you wish him to know none but nice people and you beg me therefore to desist you request me to take these suggestions to heart and to act upon them as promptly as possible they are not particularly flattering to my vanity vanity however is a sin and i listen submissively with an immense desire to be just if i have many faults i know it in a general way and i try on the whole to do my best voyons i say to myself it is nt particularly charming to hear ones self made out such a low person but it is worth thinking over there s probably a good deal of truth in it and at any rate we must be as good a girl as we can that s the great point and then here s a magnificent chance for humility if there s doubt in the matter let the doubt count against ones self that is what saint catherine did and saint theresa and all the others and they are said to have had in consequence the most ineffable joys let us go in for a little ineffable joy i tried it i swallowed my rising sobs i made you my courtesy i determined i would not be spiteful nor passionate nor vengeful nor anything that is supposed to be particularly feminine i was a better girl than you made outbetter at least than you thought but i would let the difference go and do magnificently right lest i should not do right enough i thought of it a deal for six hours when i know i did nt seem to be and then at last i did it santo dio  my dear miss light my dear miss light said rowland pleadingly  since then the young girl went on i have been waiting for the ineffable joys they have nt yet turned up  pray listen to me rowland urged  nothing nothing nothing has come of it i have passed the dreariest month of my life  my dear miss light you are a very terrible young lady cried rowland  what do you mean by that  a good many things we ll talk them over but first forgive me if i have offended you  she looked at him a moment hesitating and then thrust her hands into her muff that means nothing forgiveness is between equals and you dont regard me as your equal  really i dont understand  christina rose and moved for a moment about the room then turning suddenly you dont believe in me she cried not a grain i dont know what i would not give to force you to believe in me  rowland sprang up protesting but before he had time to go far one of the scanty portieres was raised and madame grandoni came in pulling her wig straight but you shall believe in me yet murmured christina as she passed toward her hostess  madame grandoni turned tenderly to christina i must give you a very solemn kiss my dear you are the heroine of the hour you have really accepted him eh  so they say  but you ought to know best  i dont knowi dont care she stood with her hand in madame grandonis but looking askance at rowland  that s a pretty state of mind said the old lady for a young person who is going to become a princess  christina shrugged her shoulders every one expects me to go into ecstacies over that could anything be more vulgar they may chuckle by themselves will you let me stay to dinner  if you can dine on a risotto but i imagine you are expected at home  you are right prince casamassima dines there en famille but i m not in his family yet  do you know you are very wicked i have half a mind not to keep you  christina dropped her eyes reflectively i beg you will let me stay she said if you wish to cure me of my wickedness you must be very patient and kind with me it will be worth the trouble you must show confidence in me and she gave another glance at rowland then suddenly in a different tone i dont know what i m saying she cried i am weary i am more lonely than ever i wish i were dead the tears rose to her eyes she struggled with them an instant and buried her face in her muff but at last she burst into uncontrollable sobs and flung her arms upon madame grandonis neck this shrewd woman gave rowland a significant nod and a little shrug over the young girls beautiful bowed head and then led christina tenderly away into the adjoining room rowland left alone stood there for an instant intolerably puzzled face to face with miss lights poodle who had set up a sharp unearthly cry of sympathy with his mistress rowland vented his confusion in dealing a rap with his stick at the animals unmelodious muzzle and then rapidly left the house he saw mrs lights carriage waiting at the door and heard afterwards that christina went home to dinner  a couple of days later he went for a fortnight to florence he had twenty minds to leave italy altogether and at florence he could at least more freely decide upon his future movements he felt profoundly incurably disgusted reflective benevolence stood prudently aside and for the time touched the source of his irritation with no softening sidelights  it was the middle of march and by the middle of march in florence the spring is already warm and deep he had an infinite relish for the place and the season but as he strolled by the arno and paused here and there in the great galleries they failed to soothe his irritation he was sore at heart and as the days went by the soreness deepened rather than healed he felt as if he had a complaint against fortune goodnatured as he was his goodnature this time quite declined to let it pass he had tried to be wise he had tried to be kind he had embarked upon an estimable enterprise but his wisdom his kindness his energy had been thrown back in his face he was disappointed and his disappointment had an angry spark in it the sense of wasted time of wasted hope and faith kept him constant company there were times when the beautiful things about him only exasperated his discontent he went to the pitti palace and raphaels madonna of the chair seemed in its soft serenity to mock him with the suggestion of unattainable repose he lingered on the bridges at sunset and knew that the light was enchanting and the mountains divine but there seemed to be something horribly invidious and unwelcome in the fact he felt in a word like a man who has been cruelly defrauded and who wishes to have his revenge life owed him he thought a compensation and he would be restless and resentful until he found it he knewor he seemed to knowwhere he should find it but he hardly told himself and thought of the thing under mental protest as a man in want of money may think of certain funds that he holds in trust in his melancholy meditations the idea of something better than all this something that might softly richly interpose something that might reconcile him to the future something that might make ones tenure of life deep and zealous instead of harsh and uneventhe idea of concrete compensation in a wordshaped itself sooner or later into the image of mary garland  very odd you may say that at this time of day rowland should still be brooding over a plain girl of whom he had had but the lightest of glimpses two years before very odd that so deep an impression should have been made by so lightlypressed an instrument we must admit the oddity and offer simply in explanation that his sentiment apparently belonged to that species of emotion of which by the testimony of the poets the very name and essence is oddity one night he slept but half an hour he found his thoughts taking a turn which excited him portentously he walked up and down his room half the night it looked out on the arno the noise of the river came in at the open window he felt like dressing and going down into the streets toward morning he flung himself into a chair though he was wide awake he was less excited it seemed to him that he saw his idea from the outside that he judged it and condemned it yet it stood there before him distinct and in a certain way imperious during the day he tried to banish it and forget it but it fascinated haunted at moments frightened him he tried to amuse himself paid visits resorted to several rather violent devices for diverting his thoughts if on the morrow he had committed a crime the persons whom he had seen that day would have testified that he had talked strangely and had not seemed like himself he felt certainly very unlike himself long afterwards in retrospect he used to reflect that during those days he had for a while been literally beside himself his idea persisted it clung to him like a sturdy beggar the sense of the matter roughly expressed was this if roderick was really going as he himself had phrased it to fizzle out one might help him on the wayone might smooth the descensus averno for fortyeight hours there swam before rowlands eyes a vision of roderick graceful and beautiful as he passed plunging like a diver from an eminence into a misty gulf the gulf was destruction annihilation death but if death was decreed why should not the agony be brief beyond this vision there faintly glimmered another as in the childrens game of the magic lantern a picture is superposed on the white wall before the last one has quite faded it represented mary garland standing there with eyes in which the horror seemed slowly slowly to expire and hanging motionless hands which at last made no resistance when his own offered to take them when of old a man was burnt at the stake it was cruel to have to be present but if one was present it was kind to lend a hand to pile up the fuel and make the flames do their work quickly and the smoke muffle up the victim with all deference to your kindness this was perhaps an obligation you would especially feel if you had a reversionary interest in something the victim was to leave behind him  one morning in the midst of all this rowland walked heedlessly out of one of the city gates and found himself on the road to fiesole it was a completely lovely day the march sun felt like may as the english poet of florence says the thickblossomed shrubs and vines that hung over the walls of villa and podere flung their odorous promise into the warm still air rowland followed the winding climbing lanes lingered as he got higher beneath the rusty cypresses beside the low parapets where you look down on the charming city and sweep the vale of the arno reached the little square before the cathedral and rested awhile in the massive dusky church then climbed higher to the franciscan convent which is poised on the very apex of the mountain he rang at the little gateway a shabby senile redfaced brother admitted him with almost maudlin friendliness there was a dreary chill in the chapel and the corridors and he passed rapidly through them into the delightfully steep and tangled old garden which runs wild over the forehead of the great hill he had been in it before and he was very fond of it the garden hangs in the air and you ramble from terrace to terrace and wonder how it keeps from slipping down in full consummation of its bereaved forlornness into the nakedly romantic gorge beneath it was just noon when rowland went in and after roaming about awhile he flung himself in the sun on a mossy stone bench and pulled his hat over his eyes the short shadows of the browncoated cypresses above him had grown very long and yet he had not passed back through the convent one of the monks in his faded snuffcolored robe came wandering out into the garden reading his greasy little breviary suddenly he came toward the bench on which rowland had stretched himself and paused a moment attentively rowland was lingering there still he was sitting with his head in his hands and his elbows on his knees he seemed not to have heard the sandaled tread of the good brother but as the monk remained watching him he at last looked up it was not the ignoble old man who had admitted him but a pale gaunt personage of a graver and more ascetic and yet of a benignant aspect rowlands face bore the traces of extreme trouble the frate kept his finger in his little book and folded his arms picturesquely across his breast it can hardly be determined whether his attitude as he bent his sympathetic italian eye upon rowland was a happy accident or the result of an exquisite spiritual discernment to rowland at any rate under the emotion of that moment it seemed blessedly opportune he rose and approached the monk and laid his hand on his arm  my brother he said did you ever see the devil  the frate gazed gravely and crossed himself heaven forbid  he was here rowland went on here in this lovely garden as he was once in paradise half an hour ago but have no fear i drove him out and rowland stooped and picked up his hat which had rolled away into a bed of cyclamen in vague symbolism of an actual physical tussle  you have been tempted my brother asked the friar tenderly  hideously  and you have resistedand conquered  i believe i have conquered  the blessed saint francis be praised it is well done if you like we will offer a mass for you  i am not a catholic said rowland  the frate smiled with dignity that is a reason the more  but it s for you then to choose shake hands with me rowland added that will do as well and suffer me as i go out to stop a moment in your chapel  they shook hands and separated the frate crossed himself opened his book and wandered away in relief against the western sky rowland passed back into the convent and paused long enough in the chapel to look for the almsbox he had had what is vulgarly termed a great scare he believed very poignantly for the time in the devil and he felt an irresistible need to subscribe to any institution which engaged to keep him at a distance  the next day he returned to rome and the day afterwards he went in search of roderick he found him on the pincian with his back turned to the crowd looking at the sunset i went to florence rowland said and i thought of going farther but i came back on purpose to give you another piece of advice once more you refuse to leave rome  never said roderick  the only chance that i see then of your reviving your sense of responsibility toto those various sacred things you have forgotten is in sending for your mother to join you here  roderick stared for my mother  for your motherand for miss garland  roderick still stared and then slowly and faintly his face flushed for mary garlandfor my mother he repeated send for them  tell me this i have often wondered but till now i have forborne to ask you are still engaged to miss garland  roderick frowned darkly but assented  it would give you pleasure then to see her  roderick turned away and for some moments answered nothing pleasure he said at last huskily call it pain  i regard you as a sick man rowland continued in such a case miss garland would say that her place was at your side  roderick looked at him some time askance mistrustfully is this a deeplaid snare he asked slowly  rowland had come back with all his patience rekindled but these words gave it an almost fatal chill heaven forgive you he cried bitterly my idea has been simply this try in decency to understand it i have tried to befriend you to help you to inspire you with confidence and i have failed i took you from the hands of your mother and your betrothed and it seemed to me my duty to restore you to their hands that s all i have to say  he was going but roderick forcibly detained him it would have been but a rough way of expressing it to say that one could never know how roderick would take a thing it had happened more than once that when hit hard deservedly he had received the blow with touching gentleness on the other hand he had often resented the softest taps the secondary effect of rowlands present admonition seemed reassuring i beg you to wait he said to forgive that shabby speech and to let me reflect and he walked up and down awhile reflecting at last he stopped with a look in his face that rowland had not seen all winter it was a strikingly beautiful look  how strange it is he said that the simplest devices are the last that occur to one and he broke into a light laugh to see mary garland is just what i want and my mothermy mother cant hurt me now  you will write then  i will telegraph they must come at whatever cost striker can arrange it all for them  in a couple of days he told rowland that he had received a telegraphic answer to his message informing him that the two ladies were to sail immediately for leghorn in one of the small steamers which ply between that port and new york they would arrive therefore in less than a month rowland passed this month of expectation in no very serene frame of mind his suggestion had had its source in the deepest places of his agitated conscience but there was something intolerable in the thought of the suffering to which the event was probably subjecting those undefended women they had scraped together their scanty funds and embarked at twentyfour hours notice upon the dreadful sea to journey tremulously to shores darkened by the shadow of deeper alarms he could only promise himself to be their devoted friend and servant preoccupied as he was he was able to observe that expectation with roderick took a form which seemed singular even among his characteristic singularities if redemptionroderick seemed to reasonwas to arrive with his mother and his affianced bride these last moments of error should be doubly erratic he did nothing but inaction with him took on an unwonted air of gentle gayety he laughed and whistled and went often to mrs lights though rowland knew not in what fashion present circumstances had modified his relations with christina the month ebbed away and rowland daily expected to hear from roderick that he had gone to leghorn to meet the ship he heard nothing and late one evening not having seen his friend in three or four days he stopped at rodericks lodging to assure himself that he had gone at last a cab was standing in the street but as it was a couple of doors off he hardly heeded it the hall at the foot of the staircase was dark like most roman halls and he paused in the streetdoorway on hearing the advancing footstep of a person with whom he wished to avoid coming into collision while he did so he heard another footstep behind him and turning round found that roderick in person had just overtaken him at the same moment a womans figure advanced from within into the light of the streetlamp and a face halfstartled glanced at him out of the darkness he gave a cryit was the face of mary garland her glance flew past him to roderick and in a second a startled exclamation broke from her own lips it made rowland turn again roderick stood there pale apparently trying to speak but saying nothing his lips were parted and he was wavering slightly with a strange movementthe movement of a man who has drunk too much then rowlands eyes met miss garlands again and her own which had rested a moment on rodericks were formidable       chapter ix mary garland  how it befell that roderick had failed to be in leghorn on his mothers arrival never clearly transpired for he undertook to give no elaborate explanation of his fault he never indulged in professions touching personal conduct as to the future or in remorse as to the past and as he would have asked no praise if he had traveled night and day to embrace his mother as she set foot on shore he made in rowlands presence at least no apology for having left her to come in search of him it was to be said that thanks to an unprecedentedly fine season the voyage of the two ladies had been surprisingly rapid and that according to common probabilities if roderick had left rome on the morrow as he declared that he had intended he would have had a day or two of waiting at leghorn rowlands silent inference was that christina light had beguiled him into letting the time slip and it was accompanied with a silent inquiry whether she had done so unconsciously or maliciously he had told her presumably that his mother and his cousin were about to arrive and it was pertinent to remember hereupon that she was a young lady of mysterious impulses rowland heard in due time the story of the adventures of the two ladies from northampton miss garlands wish at leghorn on finding they were left at the mercy of circumstances had been to telegraph to roderick and await an answer for she knew that their arrival was a trifle premature but mrs hudsons maternal heart had taken the alarm rodericks sending for them was to her imagination a confession of illness and his not being at leghorn a proof of it an hours delay was therefore cruel both to herself and to him she insisted on immediate departure and unskilled as they were in the mysteries of foreign or even of domestic travel they had hurried in trembling eagerness to rome they had arrived late in the evening and knowing nothing of inns had got into a cab and proceeded to rodericks lodging at the door poor mrs hudsons frightened anxiety had overcome her and she had sat quaking and crying in the vehicle too weak to move miss garland had bravely gone in groped her way up the dusky staircase reached rodericks door and with the assistance of such acquaintance with the italian tongue as she had culled from a phrasebook during the calmer hours of the voyage had learned from the old woman who had her cousins household economy in charge that he was in the best of health and spirits and had gone forth a few hours before with his hat on his ear per divertirsi  these things rowland learned during a visit he paid the two ladies the evening after their arrival mrs hudson spoke of them at great length and with an air of clinging confidence in rowland which told him how faithfully time had served him in her imagination but her fright was over though she was still catching her breath a little like a person dragged ashore out of waters uncomfortably deep she was excessively bewildered and confused and seemed more than ever to demand a tender handling from her friends before miss garland rowland was distinctly conscious that he trembled he wondered extremely what was going on in her mind what was her silent commentary on the incidents of the night before he wondered all the more because he immediately perceived that she was greatly changed since their parting and that the change was by no means for the worse she was older easier more free more like a young woman who went sometimes into company she had more beauty as well inasmuch as her beauty before had been the depth of her expression and the sources from which this beauty was fed had in these two years evidently not wasted themselves rowland felt almost instantlyhe could hardly have said why it was in her voice in her tone in the airthat a total change had passed over her attitude towards himself she trusted him now absolutely whether or no she liked him she believed he was solid he felt that during the coming weeks he would need to be solid mrs hudson was at one of the smaller hotels and her sittingroom was frugally lighted by a couple of candles rowland made the most of this dim illumination to try to detect the afterglow of that frightened flash from miss garlands eyes the night before it had been but a flash for what provoked it had instantly vanished rowland had murmured a rapturous blessing on rodericks head as he perceived him instantly apprehend the situation if he had been drinking its gravity sobered him on the spot in a single moment he collected his wits the next moment with a ringing jovial cry he was folding the young girl in his arms and the next he was beside his mothers carriage half smothered in her sobs and caresses rowland had recommended a hotel close at hand and had then discreetly withdrawn roderick was at this time doing his part superbly and miss garlands brow was serene it was serene now twentyfour hours later but nevertheless her alarm had lasted an appreciable moment what had become of it it had dropped down deep into her memory and it was lying there for the present in the shade but with another week rowland said to himself it would leap erect again the lightest friction would strike a spark from it rowland thought he had schooled himself to face the issue of mary garlands advent casting it even in a tragical phase but in her personal presencein which he found a poignant mixture of the familiar and the strangehe seemed to face it and all that it might bring with it for the first time in vulgar parlance he stood uneasy in his shoes he felt like walking on tiptoe not to arouse the sleeping shadows he felt indeed almost like saying that they might have their own way later if they would only allow to these first few days the clear light of ardent contemplation for rowland at last was ardent and all the bells within his soul were ringing bravely in jubilee roderick he learned had been the whole day with his mother and had evidently responded to her purest trust he appeared to her appealing eyes still unspotted by the world that is what it is thought rowland to be gifted to escape not only the superficial but the intrinsic penalties of misconduct the two ladies had spent the day within doors resting from the fatigues of travel miss garland rowland suspected was not so fatigued as she suffered it to be assumed she had remained with mrs hudson to attend to her personal wants which the latter seemed to think now that she was in a foreign land with a southern climate and a catholic religion would forthwith become very complex and formidable though as yet they had simply resolved themselves into a desire for a great deal of tea and for a certain extremely familiar old black and white shawl across her feet as she lay on the sofa but the sense of novelty was evidently strong upon miss garland and the light of expectation was in her eye she was restless and excited she moved about the room and went often to the window she was observing keenly she watched the italian servants intently as they came and went she had already had a long colloquy with the french chambermaid who had expounded her views on the roman question she noted the small differences in the furniture in the food in the sounds that came in from the street rowland felt in all this that her intelligence here would have a great unfolding he wished immensely he might have a share in it he wished he might show her rome that of course would be rodericks office but he promised himself at least to take advantage of offhours  it behooves you to appreciate your good fortune he said to her to be young and elastic and yet old enough and wise enough to discriminate and reflect and to come to italy for the first timethat is one of the greatest pleasures that life offers us it is but right to remind you of it so that you make the most of opportunity and do not accuse yourself later of having wasted the precious season  miss garland looked at him smiling intently and went to the window again i expect to enjoy it she said dont be afraid i am not wasteful  i am afraid we are not qualified you know said mrs hudson we are told that you must know so much that you must have read so many books our taste has not been cultivated when i was a young lady at school i remember i had a medal with a pink ribbon for proficiency in ancient historythe seven kings or is it the seven hills and quintus curtius and julius caesar andand that period you know i believe i have my medal somewhere in a drawer now but i have forgotten all about the kings but after roderick came to italy we tried to learn something about it last winter mary used to read corinne to me in the evenings and in the mornings she used to read another book to herself what was it mary that book that was so long you knowin fifteen volumes  it was sismondis italian republics said mary simply  rowland could not help laughing whereupon mary blushed did you finish it he asked  yes and began anothera shorter oneroscoes leo the tenth  did you find them interesting  oh yes  do you like history  some of it  that s a womans answer and do you like art  she paused a moment i have never seen it  you have great advantages now my dear with roderick and mr mallet said mrs hudson i am sure no young lady ever had such advantages you come straight to the highest authorities roderick i suppose will show you the practice of art and mr mallet perhaps if he will be so good will show you the theory as an artists wife you ought to know something about it  one learns a good deal about it here by simply living said rowland by going and coming about ones daily avocations  dear dear how wonderful that we should be here in the midst of it murmured mrs hudson to think of art being out there in the streets we did nt see much of it last evening as we drove from the depot but the streets were so dark and we were so frightened but we are very easy now are nt we mary  i am very happy said mary gravely and wandered back to the window again  roderick came in at this moment and kissed his mother and then went over and joined miss garland rowland sat with mrs hudson who evidently had a word which she deemed of some value for his private ear she followed roderick with intensely earnest eyes  i wish to tell you sir she said how very gratefulhow very thankfulwhat a happy mother i am i feel as if i owed it all to you sir to find my poor boy so handsome so prosperous so elegant so famousand ever to have doubted of you what must you think of me you re our guardian angel sir i often say so to mary  rowland wore in response to this speech a rather haggard brow he could only murmur that he was glad she found roderick looking well he had of course promptly asked himself whether the best discretion dictated that he should give her a word of warningjust turn the handle of the door through which later disappointment might enter he had determined to say nothing but simply to wait in silence for roderick to find effective inspiration in those confidently expectant eyes it was to be supposed that he was seeking for it now he remained sometime at the window with his cousin but at last he turned away and came over to the fireside with a contraction of the eyebrows which seemed to intimate that miss garlands influence was for the moment at least not soothing she presently followed him and for an instant rowland observed her watching him as if she thought him strange strange enough thought rowland he may seem to her if he will roderick directed his glance to his friend with a certain peremptory air whichroughly interpretedwas equivalent to a request to share the intellectual expense of entertaining the ladies good heavens rowland cried within himself is he already tired of them  tomorrow of course we must begin to put you through the mill roderick said to his mother and be it hereby known to mallet that we count upon him to turn the wheel  i will do as you please my son said mrs hudson so long as i have you with me i dont care where i go we must not take up too much of mr mallets time  his time is inexhaustible he has nothing under the sun to do have you rowland if you had seen the big hole i have been making in it where will you go first you have your choicefrom the scala santa to the cloaca maxima  let us take things in order said rowland we will go first to saint peters miss garland i hope you are impatient to see saint peters  i would like to go first to rodericks studio said miss garland  it s a very nasty place said roderick at your pleasure  yes we must see your beautiful things before we can look contentedly at anything else said mrs hudson  i have no beautiful things said roderick you may see what there is what makes you look so odd  this inquiry was abruptly addressed to his mother who in response glanced appealingly at mary and raised a startled hand to her smooth hair  no it s your face said roderick what has happened to it these two years it has changed its expression  your mother has prayed a great deal said miss garland simply  i did nt suppose of course it was from doing anything bad it makes you a very good facevery interesting very solemn it has very fine lines in it something might be done with it and rowland held one of the candles near the poor ladys head  she was covered with confusion my son my son she said with dignity i dont understand you  in a flash all his old alacrity had come to him i suppose a man may admire his own mother he cried if you please madame you ll sit to me for that head i see it i see it i will make something that a queen cant get done for her  rowland respectfully urged her to assent he saw roderick was in the vein and would probably do something eminently original she gave her promise at last after many soft inarticulate protests and a frightened petition that she might be allowed to keep her knitting  rowland returned the next day with plenty of zeal for the part roderick had assigned to him it had been arranged that they should go to saint peters roderick was in high goodhumor and in the carriage was watching his mother with a fine mixture of filial and professional tenderness mrs hudson looked up mistrustfully at the tall shabby houses and grasped the side of the barouche in her hand as if she were in a sailboat in dangerous waters rowland sat opposite to miss garland she was totally oblivious of her companions from the moment the carriage left the hotel she sat gazing wideeyed and absorbed at the objects about them if rowland had felt disposed he might have made a joke of her intense seriousness from time to time he told her the name of a place or a building and she nodded without looking at him when they emerged into the great square between berninis colonnades she laid her hand on mrs hudsons arm and sank back in the carriage staring up at the vast yellow facade of the church inside the church roderick gave his arm to his mother and rowland constituted himself the especial guide of miss garland he walked with her slowly everywhere and made the entire circuit telling her all he knew of the history of the building this was a great deal but she listened attentively keeping her eyes fixed on the dome to rowland himself it had never seemed so radiantly sublime as at these moments he felt almost as if he had contrived it himself and had a right to be proud of it he left miss garland a while on the steps of the choir where she had seated herself to rest and went to join their companions mrs hudson was watching a great circle of tattered contadini who were kneeling before the image of saint peter the fashion of their tatters fascinated her she stood gazing at them in a sort of terrified pity and could not be induced to look at anything else rowland went back to miss garland and sat down beside her  well what do you think of europe he asked smiling  i think it s horrible she said abruptly  horrible  i feel so strangelyi could almost cry  how is it that you feel  so sorry for the poor past that seems to have died here in my heart in an hour  but surely you re pleasedyou re interested  i am overwhelmed here in a single hour everything is changed it is as if a wall in my mind had been knocked down at a stroke before me lies an immense new world and it makes the old one the poor little narrow familiar one i have always known seem pitiful  but you did nt come to rome to keep your eyes fastened on that narrow little world forget it turn your back on it and enjoy all this  i want to enjoy it but as i sat here just now looking up at that golden mist in the dome i seemed to see in it the vague shapes of certain people and things at home to enjoy as you say as these things demand of one to enjoy them is to break with ones past and breaking is a pain  dont mind the pain and it will cease to trouble you enjoy enjoy it is your duty yours especially  why mine especially  because i am very sure that you have a mind capable of doing the most liberal justice to everything interesting and beautiful you are extremely intelligent  you dont know said miss garland simply  in that matter one feels i really think that i know better than you i dont want to seem patronizing but i suspect that your mind is susceptible of a great development give it the best company trust it let it go  she looked away from him for some moments down the gorgeous vista of the great church but what you say she said at last means change  change for the better cried rowland  how can one tell as one stands one knows the worst it seems to me very frightful to develop she added with her complete smile  one is in for it in one way or another and one might as well do it with a good grace as with a bad since one cant escape life it is better to take it by the hand  is this what you call life she asked  what do you mean by this  saint petersall this splendor all romepictures ruins statues beggars monks  it is not all of it but it is a large part of it all these things are impregnated with life they are the fruits of an old and complex civilization  an old and complex civilization i am afraid i dont like that  dont conclude on that point just yet wait till you have tested it while you wait you will see an immense number of very beautiful thingsthings that you are made to understand they wont leave you as they found you then you can judge dont tell me i know nothing about your understanding i have a right to assume it  miss garland gazed awhile aloft in the dome i am not sure i understand that she said  i hope at least that at a cursory glance it pleases you said rowland you need nt be afraid to tell the truth what strikes some people is that it is so remarkably small  oh its large enough its very wonderful there are things in rome then she added in a moment turning and looking at him that are very very beautiful  lots of them  some of the most beautiful things in the world  unquestionably  what are they which things have most beauty  that is according to taste i should say the statues  how long will it take to see them all to know at least something about them  you can see them all as far as mere seeing goes in a fortnight but to know them is a thing for ones leisure the more time you spend among them the more you care for them after a moments hesitation he went on why should you grudge time it s all in your way since you are to be an artists wife  i have thought of that she said it may be that i shall always live here among the most beautiful things in the world  very possibly i should like to see you ten years hence  i dare say i shall seem greatly altered but i am sure of one thing  of what  that for the most part i shall be quite the same i ask nothing better than to believe the fine things you say about my understanding but even if they are true it wont matter i shall be what i was made what i am nowa young woman from the country the fruit of a civilization not old and complex but new and simple  i am delighted to hear it that s an excellent foundation  perhaps if you show me anything more you will not always think so kindly of it therefore i warn you  i am not frightened i should like vastly to say something to you be what you are be what you choose but do sometimes as i tell you  if rowland was not frightened neither perhaps was miss garland but she seemed at least slightly disturbed she proposed that they should join their companions  mrs hudson spoke under her breath she could not be accused of the want of reverence sometimes attributed to protestants in the great catholic temples mary dear she whispered suppose we had to kiss that dreadful brass toe if i could only have kept our doorknocker at northampton as bright as that i think its so heathenish but roderick says he thinks it s sublime  roderick had evidently grown a trifle perverse it s sublimer than anything that your religion asks you to do he exclaimed  surely our religion sometimes gives us very difficult duties said miss garland  the duty of sitting in a whitewashed meetinghouse and listening to a nasal puritan i admit that s difficult but it s not sublime i am speaking of ceremonies of forms it is in my line you know to make much of forms i think this is a very beautiful one could nt you do it he demanded looking at his cousin  she looked back at him intently and then shook her head i think not  why not  i dont know i could nt  during this little discussion our four friends were standing near the venerable image of saint peter and a squalid savagelooking peasant a tattered ruffian of the most orthodox italian aspect had been performing his devotions before it he turned away crossing himself and mrs hudson gave a little shudder of horror  after that she murmured i suppose he thinks he is as good as any one and here is another oh what a beautiful person  a young lady had approached the sacred effigy after having wandered away from a group of companions she kissed the brazen toe touched it with her forehead and turned round facing our friends rowland then recognized christina light he was stupefied had she suddenly embraced the catholic faith it was but a few weeks before that she had treated him to a passionate profession of indifference had she entered the church to put herself en regle with what was expected of a princess casamassima while rowland was mentally asking these questions she was approaching him and his friends on her way to the great altar at first she did not perceive them  mary garland had been gazing at her you told me she said gently to rowland that rome contained some of the most beautiful things in the world this surely is one of them  at this moment christinas eye met rowlands and before giving him any sign of recognition she glanced rapidly at his companions she saw roderick but she gave him no bow she looked at mrs hudson she looked at mary garland at mary garland she looked fixedly piercingly from head to foot as the slow pace at which she was advancing made possible then suddenly as if she had perceived roderick for the first time she gave him a charming nod a radiant smile in a moment he was at her side she stopped and he stood talking to her she continued to look at miss garland  why roderick knows her cried mrs hudson in an awestruck whisper i supposed she was some great princess  she isalmost said rowland she is the most beautiful girl in europe and roderick has made her bust  her bust dear dear murmured mrs hudson vaguely shocked what a strange bonnet  she has very strange eyes said mary and turned away  the two ladies with rowland began to descend toward the door of the church on their way they passed mrs light the cavaliere and the poodle and rowland informed his companions of the relation in which these personages stood to rodericks young lady  think of it mary said mrs hudson what splendid people he must know no wonder he found northampton dull  i like the poor little old gentleman said mary  why do you call him poor rowland asked struck with the observation  he seems so she answered simply  as they were reaching the door they were overtaken by roderick whose interview with miss light had perceptibly brightened his eye so you are acquainted with princesses said his mother softly as they passed into the portico  miss light is not a princess said roderick curtly  but mr mallet says so urged mrs hudson rather disappointed  i meant that she was going to be said rowland  it s by no means certain that she is even going to be roderick answered  ah said rowland i give it up  roderick almost immediately demanded that his mother should sit to him at his studio for her portrait and rowland ventured to add another word of urgency if rodericks idea really held him it was an immense pity that his inspiration should be wasted inspiration in these days had become too precious a commodity it was arranged therefore that for the present during the mornings mrs hudson should place herself at her sons service this involved but little sacrifice for the good ladys appetite for antiquities was diminutive and birdlike the usual round of galleries and churches fatigued her and she was glad to purchase immunity from sightseeing by a regular afternoon drive it became natural in this way that miss garland having her mornings free rowland should propose to be the younger ladys guide in whatever explorations she might be disposed to make she said she knew nothing about it but she had a great curiosity and would be glad to see anything that he would show her rowland could not find it in his heart to accuse roderick of neglect of the young girl for it was natural that the inspirations of a capricious man of genius when they came should be imperious but of course he wondered how miss garland felt as the young mans promised wife on being thus expeditiously handed over to another man to be entertained however she felt he was certain he would know little about it there had been between them none but indirect allusions to her engagement and rowland had no desire to discuss it more largely for he had no quarrel with matters as they stood they wore the same delightful aspect through the lovely month of may and the ineffable charm of rome at that period seemed but the radiant sympathy of nature with his happy opportunity the weather was divine each particular morning as he walked from his lodging to mrs hudsons modest inn seemed to have a blessing upon it the elder lady had usually gone off to the studio and he found miss garland sitting alone at the open window turning the leaves of some book of artistic or antiquarian reference that he had given her she always had a smile she was always eager alert responsive she might be grave by nature she might be sad by circumstance she might have secret doubts and pangs but she was essentially young and strong and fresh and able to enjoy her enjoyment was not especially demonstrative but it was curiously diligent rowland felt that it was not amusement and sensation that she coveted but knowledgefacts that she might noiselessly lay away piece by piece in the perfumed darkness of her serious mind so that under this head at least she should not be a perfectly portionless bride she never merely pretended to understand she let things go in her modest fashion at the moment but she watched them on their way over the crest of the hill and when her fancy seemed not likely to be missed it went hurrying after them and ran breathless at their side as it were and begged them for the secret rowland took an immense satisfaction in observing that she never mistook the secondbest for the best and that when she was in the presence of a masterpiece she recognized the occasion as a mighty one she said many things which he thought very profoundthat is if they really had the fine intention he suspected this point he usually tried to ascertain but he was obliged to proceed cautiously for in her mistrustful shyness it seemed to her that crossexamination must necessarily be ironical she wished to know just where she was goingwhat she would gain or lose this was partly on account of a native intellectual purity a temper of mind that had not lived with its door ajar as one might say upon the highroad of thought for passing ideas to drop in and out at their pleasure but had made much of a few long visits from guests cherished and honoredguests whose presence was a solemnity but it was even more because she was conscious of a sort of growing selfrespect a sense of devoting her life not to her own ends but to those of another whose life would be large and brilliant she had been brought up to think a great deal of nature and natures innocent laws but now rowland had spoken to her ardently of culture her strenuous fancy had responded and she was pursuing culture into retreats where the need for some intellectual effort gave a noble severity to her purpose she wished to be very sure to take only the best knowing it to be the best there was something exquisite in this labor of pious selfadornment and rowland helped it though its fruits were not for him in spite of her lurking rigidity and angularity it was very evident that a nervous impulsive sense of beauty was constantly at play in her soul and that her actual experience of beautiful things moved her in some very deep places for all that she was not demonstrative that her manner was simple and her smalltalk of no very ample flow for all that as she had said she was a young woman from the country and the country was west nazareth and west nazareth was in its way a stubborn little fact she was feeling the direct influence of the great amenities of the world and they were shaping her with a divinely intelligent touch oh exquisite virtue of circumstance cried rowland to himself that takes us by the hand and leads us forth out of corners where perforce our attitudes are a trifle contracted and beguiles us into testing mistrusted faculties when he said to mary garland that he wished he might see her ten years hence he was paying mentally an equal compliment to circumstance and to the girl herself capacity was there it could be freely trusted observation would have but to sow its generous seed a superior womanthe idea had harsh associations but he watched it imaging itself in the vagueness of the future with a kind of hopeless confidence  they went a great deal to saint peters for which rowland had an exceeding affection a large measure of which he succeeded in infusing into his companion she confessed very speedily that to climb the long low yellow steps beneath the huge florid facade and then to push the ponderous leathern apron of the door to find ones self confronted with that builded luminous sublimity was a sensation of which the keenness renewed itself with surprising generosity in those days the hospitality of the vatican had not been curtailed and it was an easy and delightful matter to pass from the gorgeous church to the solemn company of the antique marbles here rowland had with his companion a great deal of talk and found himself expounding aesthetics a perte de vue he discovered that she made notes of her likes and dislikes in a newlooking little memorandum book and he wondered to what extent she reported his own discourse these were charming hours the galleries had been so cold all winter that rowland had been an exile from them but now that the sun was already scorching in the great square between the colonnades where the twin fountains flashed almost fiercely the marble coolness of the long imagebordered vistas made them a delightful refuge the great herd of tourists had almost departed and our two friends often found themselves for half an hour at a time in sole and tranquil possession of the beautiful braccio nuovo here and there was an open window where they lingered and leaned looking out into the warm dead air over the towers of the city at the softhued historic hills at the stately shabby gardens of the palace or at some sunny empty grassgrown court lost in the heart of the labyrinthine pile they went sometimes into the chambers painted by raphael and of course paid their respects to the sistine chapel but marys evident preference was to linger among the statues once when they were standing before that noblest of sculptured portraits the socalled demosthenes in the braccio nuovo she made the only spontaneous allusion to her projected marriage direct or indirect that had yet fallen from her lips i am so glad she said that roderick is a sculptor and not a painter  the allusion resided chiefly in the extreme earnestness with which the words were uttered rowland immediately asked her the reason of her gladness  it s not that painting is not fine she said but that sculpture is finer it is more manly  rowland tried at times to make her talk about herself but in this she had little skill she seemed to him so much older so much more pliant to social uses than when he had seen her at home that he had a desire to draw from her some categorical account of her occupation and thoughts he told her his desire and what suggested it it appears then she said that after all one can grow at home  unquestionably if one has a motive your growth then was unconscious you did not watch yourself and water your roots  she paid no heed to his question i am willing to grant she said that europe is more delightful than i supposed and i dont think that mentally i had been stingy but you must admit that america is better than you have supposed  i have not a fault to find with the country which produced you rowland thought he might risk this smiling  and yet you want me to changeto assimilate europe i suppose you would call it  i have felt that desire only on general principles shall i tell you what i feel now america has made you thus far let america finish you i should like to ship you back without delay and see what becomes of you that sounds unkind and i admit there is a cold intellectual curiosity in it  she shook her head the charm is broken the thread is snapped i prefer to remain here  invariably when he was inclined to make of something they were talking of a direct application to herself she wholly failed to assist him she made no response whereupon once with a spark of ardent irritation he told her she was very secretive at this she colored a little and he said that in default of any larger confidence it would at least be a satisfaction to make her confess to that charge but even this satisfaction she denied him and his only revenge was in making two or three times afterward a softly ironical allusion to her slyness he told her that she was what is called in french a sournoise very good she answered almost indifferently and now please tell me againi have forgotten itwhat you said an architrave was  it was on the occasion of her asking him a question of this kind that he charged her with a humorous emphasis in which also if she had been curious in the matter she might have detected a spark of restless ardor with having an insatiable avidity for facts you are always snatching at information he said you will never consent to have any disinterested conversation  she frowned a little as she always did when he arrested their talk upon something personal but this time she assented and said that she knew she was eager for facts one must make hay while the sun shines she added i must lay up a store of learning against dark days somehow my imagination refuses to compass the idea that i may be in rome indefinitely  he knew he had divined her real motives but he felt that if he might have said to herwhat it seemed impossible to saythat fortune possibly had in store for her a bitter disappointment she would have been capable of answering immediately after the first sense of pain say then that i am laying up resources for solitude  but all the accusations were not his he had been watching once during some brief argument to see whether she would take her forefinger out of her murray into which she had inserted it to keep a certain page it would have been hard to say why this point interested him for he had not the slightest real apprehension that she was dry or pedantic the simple human truth was the poor fellow was jealous of science in preaching science to her he had overestimated his powers of selfeffacement suddenly sinking science for the moment she looked at him very frankly and began to frown at the same time she let the murray slide down to the ground and he was so charmed with this circumstance that he made no movement to pick it up  you are singularly inconsistent mr mallet she said  how  that first day that we were in saint peters you said things that inspired me you bade me plunge into all this i was all ready i only wanted a little push yours was a great one here i am in midocean and now as a reward for my bravery you have repeatedly snubbed me  distinctly then said rowland i strike you as inconsistent  that is the word  then i have played my part very ill  your part what is your part supposed to have been  he hesitated a moment that of usefulness pure and simple  i dont understand you she said and picking up her murray she fairly buried herself in it  that evening he said something to her which necessarily increased her perplexity though it was not uttered with such an intention do you remember he asked my begging you the other day to do occasionally as i told you it seemed to me you tacitly consented  very tacitly  i have never yet really presumed on your consent but now i would like you to do this whenever you catch me in the act of what you call inconsistency ask me the meaning of some architectural term i will know what you mean a word to the wise  one morning they spent among the ruins of the palatine that sunny desolation of crumbling overtangled fragments half excavated and half identified known as the palace of the caesars nothing in rome is more interesting and no locality has such a confusion of picturesque charms it is a vast rambling garden where you stumble at every step on the disinterred bones of the past where damp frescoed corridors relics possibly of neros golden house serve as gigantic bowers and where in the springtime you may sit on a latin inscription in the shade of a flowering almondtree and admire the composition of the campagna the day left a deep impression on rowlands mind partly owing to its intrinsic sweetness and partly because his companion on this occasion let her murray lie unopened for an hour and asked several questions irrelevant to the consuls and the caesars she had begun by saying that it was coming over her after all that rome was a ponderously sad place the sirocco was gently blowing the air was heavy she was tired she looked a little pale  everything she said seems to say that all things are vanity if one is doing something i suppose one feels a certain strength within one to contradict it but if one is idle surely it is depressing to live year after year among the ashes of things that once were mighty if i were to remain here i should either become permanently low as they say or i would take refuge in some dogged daily work  what work  i would open a school for those beautiful little beggars though i am sadly afraid i should never bring myself to scold them  i am idle said rowland and yet i have kept up a certain spirit  i dont call you idle she answered with emphasis  it is very good of you do you remember our talking about that in northampton  during that picnic perfectly has your coming abroad succeeded for yourself as well as you hoped  i think i may say that it has turned out as well as i expected  are you happy  dont i look so  so it seems to me butand she hesitated a momenti imagine you look happy whether you are so or not  i m like that ancient comic mask that we saw just now in yonder excavated fresco i am made to grin  shall you come back here next winter  very probably  are you settled here forever  forever is a long time i live only from year to year  shall you never marry  rowland gave a laugh forevernever you handle large ideas i have not taken a vow of celibacy  would nt you like to marry  i should like it immensely  to this she made no rejoinder but presently she asked why dont you write a book  rowland laughed this time more freely a book what book should i write  a history something about art or antiquities  i have neither the learning nor the talent  she made no attempt to contradict him she simply said she had supposed otherwise you ought at any rate she continued in a moment to do something for yourself  for myself i should have supposed that if ever a man seemed to live for himself  i dont know how it seems she interrupted to careless observers but we knowwe know that you have liveda great dealfor us  her voice trembled slightly and she brought out the last words with a little jerk  she has had that speech on her conscience thought rowland she has been thinking she owed it to me and it seemed to her that now was her time to make it and have done with it  she went on in a way which confirmed these reflections speaking with due solemnity you ought to be made to know very well what we all feel mrs hudson tells me that she has told you what she feels of course roderick has expressed himself i have been wanting to thank you too i do from my heart  rowland made no answer his face at this moment resembled the tragic mask much more than the comic but miss garland was not looking at him she had taken up her murray again  in the afternoon she usually drove with mrs hudson but rowland frequently saw her again in the evening he was apt to spend half an hour in the little sittingroom at the hotelpension on the slope of the pincian and roderick who dined regularly with his mother was present on these occasions rowland saw him little at other times and for three weeks no observations passed between them on the subject of mrs hudsons advent to rowlands vision as the weeks elapsed the benefits to proceed from the presence of the two ladies remained shrouded in mystery roderick was peculiarly inscrutable he was preoccupied with his work on his mothers portrait which was taking a very happy turn and often when he sat silent with his hands in his pockets his legs outstretched his head thrown back and his eyes on vacancy it was to be supposed that his fancy was hovering about the halfshaped image in his studio exquisite even in its immaturity he said little but his silence did not of necessity imply disaffection for he evidently found it a deep personal luxury to lounge away the hours in an atmosphere so charged with feminine tenderness he was not alert he suggested nothing in the way of excursions rowland was the prime mover in such as were attempted but he conformed passively at least to the tranquil temper of the two women and made no harsh comments nor sombre allusions rowland wondered whether he had after all done his friend injustice in denying him the sentiment of duty he refused invitations to rowlands knowledge in order to dine at the jejune little tabledhote wherever his spirit might be he was present in the flesh with religious constancy mrs hudsons felicity betrayed itself in a remarkable tendency to finish her sentences and wear her best black silk gown her tremors had trembled away she was like a child who discovers that the shaggy monster it has so long been afraid to touch is an inanimate terror compounded of straw and sawdust and that it is even a safe audacity to tickle its nose as to whether the loveknot of which mary garland had the keeping still held firm who should pronounce the young girl as we know did not wear it on her sleeve she always sat at the table near the candles with a piece of needlework this was the attitude in which rowland had first seen her and he thought now that he had seen her in several others it was not the least becoming       chapter x the cavaliere  there befell at last a couple of days during which rowland was unable to go to the hotel late in the evening of the second one roderick came into his room in a few moments he announced that he had finished the bust of his mother  and it s magnificent he declared it s one of the best things i have done  i believe it said rowland never again talk to me about your inspiration being dead  why not this may be its last kick i feel very tired but it s a masterpiece though i do say it they tell us we owe so much to our parents well i ve paid the filial debt handsomely he walked up and down the room a few moments with the purpose of his visit evidently still undischarged there s one thing more i want to say he presently resumed i feel as if i ought to tell you he stopped before rowland with his head high and his brilliant glance unclouded your invention is a failure  my invention rowland repeated  bringing out my mother and mary  a failure  it s no use they dont help me  rowland had fancied that roderick had no more surprises for him but he was now staring at him wideeyed  they bore me roderick went on  oh oh cried rowland  listen listen said roderick with perfect gentleness i am not complaining of them i am simply stating a fact i am very sorry for them i am greatly disappointed  have you given them a fair trial  should nt you say so it seems to me i have behaved beautifully  you have done very well i have been building great hopes on it  i have done too well then after the first fortyeight hours my own hopes collapsed but i determined to fight it out to stand within the temple to let the spirit of the lord descend do you want to know the result another week of it and i shall begin to hate them i shall want to poison them  miserable boy cried rowland they are the loveliest of women  very likely but they mean no more to me than a bible text to an atheist  i utterly fail said rowland in a moment to understand your relation to miss garland  roderick shrugged his shoulders and let his hands drop at his sides she adores me that s my relation and he smiled strangely  have you broken your engagement  broken it you cant break a ray of moonshine  have you absolutely no affection for her  roderick placed his hand on his heart and held it there a moment deaddeaddead he said at last  i wonder rowland asked presently if you begin to comprehend the beauty of miss garlands character she is a person of the highest merit  evidentlyor i would not have cared for her  has that no charm for you now  oh dont force a fellow to say rude things  well i can only say that you dont know what you are giving up  roderick gave a quickened glance do you know so well  i admire her immeasurably  roderick smiled we may almost say sympathetically you have not wasted time  rowlands thoughts were crowding upon him fast if roderick was resolute why oppose him if mary was to be sacrificed why in that way try to save her there was another way it only needed a little presumption to make it possible rowland tried mentally to summon presumption to his aid but whether it came or not it found conscience there before it conscience had only three words but they were cogent for her sakefor her sake it dumbly murmured and rowland resumed his argument i dont know what i would nt do he said rather than that miss garland should suffer  there is one thing to be said roderick answered reflectively she is very strong  well then if she s strong believe that with a longer chance a better chance she will still regain your affection  do you know what you ask cried roderick make love to a girl i hate  you hate  as her lover i should hate her  listen to me said rowland with vehemence  no listen you to me do you really urge my marrying a woman who would bore me to death i would let her know it in very good season and then where would she be  rowland walked the length of the room a couple of times and then stopped suddenly go your way then say all this to her not to me  to her i am afraid of her i want you to help me  my dear roderick said rowland with an eloquent smile i can help you no more  roderick frowned hesitated a moment and then took his hat oh well he said i am not so afraid of her as all that and he turned as if to depart  stop cried rowland as he laid his hand on the door  roderick paused and stood waiting with his irritated brow  come back sit down there and listen to me of anything you were to say in your present state of mind you would live most bitterly to repent you dont know what you really think you dont know what you really feel you dont know your own mind you dont do justice to miss garland all this is impossible here under these circumstances you re blind you re deaf you re under a spell to break it you must leave rome  leave rome rome was never so dear to me  that s not of the smallest consequence leave it instantly  and where shall i go  go to some place where you may be alone with your mother and miss garland  alone you will not come  oh if you desire it i will come  roderick inclining his head a little looked at his friend askance i dont understand you he said i wish you liked miss garland either a little less or a little more  rowland felt himself coloring but he paid no heed to rodericks speech you ask me to help you he went on on these present conditions i can do nothing but if you will postpone all decision as to the continuance of your engagement a couple of months longer and meanwhile leave rome leave italy i will do what i can to help you as you say in the event of your still wishing to break it  i must do without your help then your conditions are impossible i will leave rome at the time i have always intendedat the end of june my rooms and my mothers are taken till then all my arrangements are made accordingly then i will depart not before  you are not frank said rowland your real reason for staying has nothing to do with your rooms  rodericks face betrayed neither embarrassment nor resentment if i m not frank it s for the first time in my life since you know so much about my real reason let me hear it no stop he suddenly added i wont trouble you you are right i have a motive on the twentyfourth of june miss light is to be married i take an immense interest in all that concerns her and i wish to be present at her wedding  but you said the other day at saint peters that it was by no means certain her marriage would take place  apparently i was wrong the invitations i am told are going out  rowland felt that it would be utterly vain to remonstrate and that the only thing for him was to make the best terms possible if i offer no further opposition to your waiting for miss lights marriage he said will you promise meanwhile and afterwards for a certain period to defer to my judgmentto say nothing that may be a cause of suffering to miss garland  for a certain period what period roderick demanded  ah dont drive so close a bargain dont you understand that i have taken you away from her that i suffer in every nerve in consequence and that i must do what i can to restore you  do what you can then said roderick gravely putting out his hand do what you can his tone and his handshake seemed to constitute a promise and upon this they parted  rodericks bust of his mother whether or no it was a discharge of what he called the filial debt was at least a most admirable production rowland at the time it was finished met gloriani one evening and this unscrupulous genius immediately began to ask questions about it i am told our highflying friend has come down he said he has been doing a queer little old woman  a queer little old woman rowland exclaimed my dear sir she is hudsons mother  all the more reason for her being queer it is a bust for terracotta eh  by no means it is for marble  that s a pity it was described to me as a charming piece of quaintness a little demure thinlipped old lady with her head on one side and the prettiest wrinkles in the worlda sort of fairy godmother  go and see it and judge for yourself said rowland  no i see i shall be disappointed it s quite the other thing the sort of thing they put into the camposantos i wish that boy would listen to me an hour  but a day or two later rowland met him again in the street and as they were near proposed they should adjourn to rodericks studio he consented and on entering they found the young master rodericks demeanor to gloriani was never conciliatory and on this occasion supreme indifference was apparently all he had to offer but gloriani like a genuine connoisseur cared nothing for his manners he cared only for his skill in the bust of mrs hudson there was something almost touching it was an exquisite example of a ruling sense of beauty the poor ladys small neat timorous face had certainly no great character but roderick had reproduced its sweetness its mildness its minuteness its still maternal passion with the most unerring art it was perfectly unflattered and yet admirably tender it was the poetry of fidelity gloriani stood looking at it a long time most intently roderick wandered away into the neighboring room  i give it up said the sculptor at last i dont understand it  but you like it said rowland  like it it s a pearl of pearls tell me this he added is he very fond of his mother is he a very good son and he gave rowland a sharp look  why she adores him said rowland smiling  that s not an answer but it s none of my business only if i in his place being suspected of havingwhat shall i call ita cold heart managed to do that piece of work oh oh i should be called a pretty lot of names charlatan poseur arrangeur but he can do as he chooses my dear young man i know you dont like me he went on as roderick came back it s a pity you are strong enough not to care about me at all you are very strong  not at all said roderick curtly i am very weak  i told you last year that you would nt keep it up i was a great ass you will  i beg your pardoni wont retorted roderick  though i m a great ass all the same eh well call me what you will so long as you turn out this sort of thing i dont suppose it makes any particular difference but i should like to say now i believe in you  roderick stood looking at him for a moment with a strange hardness in his face it flushed slowly and two glittering angry tears filled his eyes it was the first time rowland had ever seen them there he saw them but once again poor gloriani he was sure had never in his life spoken with less of irony but to roderick there was evidently a sense of mockery in his profession of faith he turned away with a muttered passionate imprecation gloriani was accustomed to deal with complex problems but this time he was hopelessly puzzled what s the matter with him he asked simply  rowland gave a sad smile and touched his forehead genius i suppose  gloriani sent another parting lingering look at the bust of mrs hudson well it s deuced perfect it s deuced simple i do believe in him he said but i m glad i m not a genius it makes he added with a laugh as he looked for roderick to wave him goodby and saw his back still turned it makes a more sociable studio  rowland had purchased as he supposed temporary tranquillity for mary garland but his own humor in these days was not especially peaceful he was attempting in a certain sense to lead the ideal life and he found it at the least not easy the days passed but brought with them no official invitation to miss lights wedding he occasionally met her and he occasionally met prince casamassima but always separately never together they were apparently taking their happiness in the inexpressive manner proper to people of social eminence rowland continued to see madame grandoni for whom he felt a confirmed affection he had always talked to her with frankness but now he made her a confidant of all his hidden dejection roderick and rodericks concerns had been a common theme with him and it was in the natural course to talk of mrs hudsons arrival and miss garlands fine smile madame grandoni was an intelligent listener and she lost no time in putting his case for him in a nutshell at one moment you tell me the girl is plain she said the next you tell me she s pretty i will invite them and i shall see for myself but one thing is very clear you are in love with her  rowland for all answer glanced round to see that no one heard her  more than that she added you have been in love with her these two years there was that certain something about you i knew you were a mild sweet fellow but you had a touch of it more than was natural why did nt you tell me at once you would have saved me a great deal of trouble and poor augusta blanchard too and herewith madame grandoni communicated a pertinent fact augusta blanchard and mr leavenworth were going to make a match the young lady had been staying for a month at albano and mr leavenworth had been dancing attendance the event was a matter of course rowland who had been lately reproaching himself with a failure of attention to miss blanchards doings made some such observation  but you did not find it so cried his hostess it was a matter of course perhaps that mr leavenworth who seems to be going about europe with the sole view of picking up furniture for his home as he calls it should think miss blanchard a very handsome piece but it was not a matter of courseor it need nt have beenthat she should be willing to become a sort of superior tableornament she would have accepted you if you had tried  you are supposing the insupposable said rowland she never gave me a particle of encouragement  what would you have had her do the poor girl did her best and i am sure that when she accepted mr leavenworth she thought of you  she thought of the pleasure her marriage would give me  ay pleasure indeed she is a thoroughly good girl but she has her little grain of feminine spite like the rest well he s richer than you and she will have what she wants but before i forgive you i must wait and see this new arrivalwhat do you call hermiss garland if i like her i will forgive you if i dont i shall always bear you a grudge  rowland answered that he was sorry to forfeit any advantage she might offer him but that his exculpatory passion for miss garland was a figment of her fancy miss garland was engaged to another man and he himself had no claims  well then said madame grandoni if i like her we ll have it that you ought to be in love with her if you fail in this it will be a double misdemeanor the man she s engaged to does nt care a straw for her leave me alone and i ll tell her what i think of you  as to christina lights marriage madame grandoni could make no definite statement the young girl of late had made her several flying visits in the intervals of the usual prematrimonial shopping and dressfitting she had spoken of the event with a toss of her head as a matter which with a wise old friend who viewed things in their essence she need not pretend to treat as a solemnity it was for prince casamassima to do that it is what they call a marriage of reason she once said that means you know a marriage of madness  what have you said in the way of advice rowland asked  very little but that little has favored the prince i know nothing of the mysteries of the young ladys heart it may be a goldmine but at any rate it s a mine and it s a long journey down into it but the marriage in itself is an excellent marriage it s not only brilliant but it s safe i think christina is quite capable of making it a means of misery but there is no position that would be sacred to her casamassima is an irreproachable young man there is nothing against him but that he is a prince it is not often i fancy that a prince has been put through his paces at this rate no one knows the weddingday the cards of invitation have been printed half a dozen times over with a different date each time christina has destroyed them there are people in rome who are furious at the delay they want to get away they are in a dreadful fright about the fever but they are dying to see the wedding and if the day were fixed they would make their arrangements to wait for it i think it very possible that after having kept them a month and produced a dozen cases of malaria christina will be married at midnight by an old friar with simply the legal witnesses  it is true then that she has become a catholic  so she tells me one day she got up in the depths of despair at her wits end i suppose in other words for a new sensation suddenly it occurred to her that the catholic church might after all hold the key might give her what she wanted she sent for a priest he happened to be a clever man and he contrived to interest her she put on a black dress and a black lace veil and looking handsomer than ever she rustled into the catholic church the prince who is very devout and who had her heresy sorely on his conscience was thrown into an ecstasy may she never have a caprice that pleases him less  rowland had already asked madame grandoni what to her perception was the present state of matters between christina and roderick and he now repeated his question with some earnestness of apprehension the girl is so deucedly dramatic he said that i dont know what coup de theatre she may have in store for us such a stroke was her turning catholic such a stroke would be her some day making her courtesy to a disappointed world as princess casamassima married at midnight in her bonnet she might doshe may dosomething that would make even more starers i m prepared for anything  you mean that she might elope with your sculptor eh  i m prepared for anything  do you mean that he s ready  do you think that she is  they re a precious pair i think this you by no means exhaust the subject when you say that christina is dramatic it s my belief that in the course of her life she will do a certain number of things from pure disinterested passion she s immeasurably proud and if that is often a fault in a virtuous person it may be a merit in a vicious one she needs to think well of herself she knows a fine character easily when she meets one she hates to suffer by comparison even though the comparison is made by herself alone and when the estimate she may have made of herself grows vague she needs to do something to give it definite impressive form what she will do in such a case will be better or worse according to her opportunity but i imagine it will generally be something that will drive her mother to despair something of the sort usually termed unworldly  rowland as he was taking his leave after some further exchange of opinions rendered miss light the tribute of a deeply meditative sigh she has bothered me half to death he said but somehow i cant manage as i ought to hate her i admire her half the time and a good part of the rest i pity her  i think i most pity her said madame grandoni  this enlightened woman came the next day to call upon the two ladies from northampton she carried their shy affections by storm and made them promise to drink tea with her on the evening of the morrow her visit was an era in the life of poor mrs hudson who did nothing but make sudden desultory allusions to her for the next thirtysix hours to think of her being a foreigner she would exclaim after much intent reflection over her knitting she speaks so beautifully then in a little while she was nt so much dressed as you might have expected did you notice how easy it was in the waist i wonder if that s the fashion or she s very old to wear a hat i should never dare to wear a hat or did you notice her handsvery pretty hands for such a stout person a great many rings but nothing very handsome i suppose they are hereditary or she s certainly not handsome but she s very sweetlooking i wonder why she does nt have something done to her teeth rowland also received a summons to madame grandonis teadrinking and went betimes as he had been requested he was eagerly desirous to lend his mute applause to mary garlands debut in the roman social world the two ladies had arrived with roderick silent and careless in attendance miss blanchard was also present escorted by mr leavenworth and the party was completed by a dozen artists of both sexes and various nationalities it was a friendly and easy assembly like all madame grandonis parties and in the course of the evening there was some excellent music people played and sang for madame grandoni on easy terms who elsewhere were not to be heard for the asking she was herself a superior musician and singers found it a privilege to perform to her accompaniment rowland talked to various persons but for the first time in his life his attention visibly wandered he could not keep his eyes off mary garland madame grandoni had said that he sometimes spoke of her as pretty and sometimes as plain tonight if he had had occasion to describe her appearance he would have called her beautiful she was dressed more than he had ever seen her it was becoming and gave her a deeper color and an ampler presence two or three persons were introduced to her who were apparently witty people for she sat listening to them with her brilliant natural smile rowland from an opposite corner reflected that he had never varied in his appreciation of miss blanchards classic contour but that somehow tonight it impressed him hardly more than an effigy stamped upon a coin of low value roderick could not be accused of rancor for he had approached mr leavenworth with unstudied familiarity and lounging against the wall with hands in pockets was discoursing to him with candid serenity now that he had done him an impertinence he evidently found him less intolerable mr leavenworth stood stirring his tea and silently opening and shutting his mouth without looking at the young sculptor like a large drowsy dog snapping at flies rowland had found it disagreeable to be told miss blanchard would have married him for the asking and he would have felt some embarrassment in going to speak to her if his modesty had not found incredulity so easy the facile side of a union with miss blanchard had never been present to his mind it had struck him as a thing in all ways to be compassed with a great effort he had half an hours talk with her a farewell talk as it seemed to hima farewell not to a real illusion but to the idea that for him in that matter there could ever be an acceptable pisaller he congratulated miss blanchard upon her engagement and she received his compliment with a touch of primness but she was always a trifle prim even when she was quoting mrs browning and george sand and this harmless defect did not prevent her responding on this occasion that mr leavenworth had a glorious heart rowland wished to manifest an extreme regard but toward the end of the talk his zeal relaxed and he fell athinking that a certain natural ease in a woman was the most delightful thing in the world there was christina light who had too much and here was miss blanchard who had too little and there was mary garland in whom the quality was wholly uncultivated who had just the right amount  he went to madame grandoni in an adjoining room where she was pouring out tea  i will make you an excellent cup she said because i have forgiven you  he looked at her answering nothing but he swallowed his tea with great gusto and a slight deepening of his color by all of which one would have known that he was gratified in a moment he intimated that in so far as he had sinned he had forgiven himself  she is a lovely girl said madame grandoni there is a great deal there i have taken a great fancy to her and she must let me make a friend of her  she is very plain said rowland slowly very simple very ignorant  which being interpreted means she is very handsome very subtle and has read hundreds of volumes on winter evenings in the country  you are a veritable sorceress cried rowland you frighten me away as he was turning to leave her there rose above the hum of voices in the drawingroom the sharp grotesque note of a barking dog their eyes met in a glance of intelligence  there is the sorceress said madame grandoni the sorceress and her necromantic poodle and she hastened back to the post of hospitality  rowland followed her and found christina light standing in the middle of the drawingroom and looking about in perplexity her poodle sitting on his haunches and gazing at the company had apparently been expressing a sympathetic displeasure at the absence of a welcome but in a moment madame grandoni had come to the young girls relief and christina had tenderly kissed her  i had no idea said christina surveying the assembly that you had such a lot of grand people or i would not have come in the servant said nothing he took me for an invitee i came to spend a neighborly halfhour you know i have nt many left it was too dismally dreary at home i hoped i should find you alone and i brought stenterello to play with the cat i dont know that if i had known about all this i would have dared to come in but since i ve stumbled into the midst of it i beg you ll let me stay i am not dressed but am i very hideous i will sit in a corner and no one will notice me my dear sweet lady do let me stay pray why did nt you ask me i never have been to a little party like this they must be very charming no dancingtea and conversation no tea thank you but if you could spare a biscuit for stenterello a sweet biscuit please really why did nt you ask me do you have these things often madame grandoni it s very unkind and the young girl who had delivered herself of the foregoing succession of sentences in her usual low cool penetrating voice uttered these last words with a certain tremor of feeling i see she went on i do very well for balls and great banquets but when people wish to have a cosy friendly comfortable evening they leave me out with the big flowerpots and the gilt candlesticks  i m sure you re welcome to stay my dear said madame grandoni and at the risk of displeasing you i must confess that if i did nt invite you it was because you re too grand your dress will do very well with its fifty flounces and there is no need of your going into a corner indeed since you re here i propose to have the glory of it you must remain where my people can see you  they are evidently determined to do that by the way they stare do they think i intend to dance a tarantella who are they all do i know them and lingering in the middle of the room with her arm passed into madame grandonis she let her eyes wander slowly from group to group they were of course observing her standing in the little circle of lamplight with the hood of an eastern burnous shot with silver threads falling back from her beautiful head one hand gathering together its voluminous shimmering folds and the other playing with the silken topknot on the uplifted head of her poodle she was a figure of radiant picturesqueness she seemed to be a sort of extemporized tableau vivant rowlands position made it becoming for him to speak to her without delay as she looked at him he saw that judging by the light of her beautiful eyes she was in a humor of which she had not yet treated him to a specimen in a simpler person he would have called it exquisite kindness but in this young ladys deportment the flower was one thing and the perfume another tell me about these people she said to him i had no idea there were so many people in rome i had not seen what are they all talking about it s all beyond me i suppose there is miss blanchard sitting as usual in profile against a dark object she is like a head on a postagestamp and there is that nice little old lady in black mrs hudson what a dear little woman for a mother comme elle est proprette and the other the fiancee of course she s here ah i see she paused she was looking intently at miss garland rowland measured the intentness of her glance and suddenly acquired a firm conviction i should like so much to know her she said turning to madame grandoni she has a charming face i am sure she s an angel i wish very much you would introduce me no on second thoughts i had rather you did nt i will speak to her bravely myself as a friend of her cousin madame grandoni and rowland exchanged glances of baffled conjecture and christina flung off her burnous crumpled it together and with uplifted finger tossing it into a corner gave it in charge to her poodle he stationed himself upon it on his haunches with upright vigilance christina crossed the room with the step and smile of a ministering angel and introduced herself to mary garland she had once told rowland that she would show him some day how gracious her manners could be she was now redeeming her promise rowland watching her saw mary garland rise slowly in response to her greeting and look at her with serious deepgazing eyes the almost dramatic opposition of these two keenly interesting girls touched rowland with a nameless apprehension and after a moment he preferred to turn away in doing so he noticed roderick the young sculptor was standing planted on the train of a ladys dress gazing across at christinas movements with undisguised earnestness there were several more pieces of music rowland sat in a corner and listened to them when they were over several people began to take their leave mrs hudson among the number rowland saw her come up to madame grandoni clinging shyly to mary garlands arm miss garland had a brilliant eye and a deep color in her cheek the two ladies looked about for roderick but roderick had his back turned he had approached christina who with an absent air was sitting alone where she had taken her place near miss garland looking at the guests pass out of the room christinas eye like miss garlands was bright but her cheek was pale hearing rodericks voice she looked up at him sharply then silently with a single quick gesture motioned him away he obeyed her and came and joined his mother in bidding good night to madame grandoni christina in a moment met rowlands glance and immediately beckoned him to come to her he was familiar with her spontaneity of movement and was scarcely surprised she made a place for him on the sofa beside her he wondered what was coming now he was not sure it was not a mere fancy but it seemed to him that he had never seen her look just as she was looking then it was a humble touching appealing look and it threw into wonderful relief the nobleness of her beauty how many more metamorphoses he asked himself am i to be treated to before we have done  i want to tell you said christina i have taken an immense fancy to miss garland are nt you glad  delighted exclaimed poor rowland  ah you dont believe it she said with soft dignity  is it so hard to believe  not that people in general should admire her but that i should but i want to tell you i want to tell some one and i cant tell miss garland herself she thinks me already a horrid false creature and if i were to express to her frankly what i think of her i should simply disgust her she would be quite right she has repose and from that point of view i and my doings must seem monstrous unfortunately i have nt repose i am trembling now if i could ask you to feel my arm you would see but i want to tell you that i admire miss garland more than any of the people who call themselves her friendsexcept of course you oh i know that to begin with she is extremely handsome and she does nt know it  she is not generally thought handsome said rowland  evidently that s the vulgarity of the human mind her head has great character great natural style if a woman is not to be a supreme beauty in the regular way she will choose if she s wise to look like that she ll not be thought pretty by people in general and desecrated as she passes by the stare of every vile wretch who chooses to thrust his nose under her bonnet but a certain number of superior people will find it one of the delightful things of life to look at her that lot is as good as another then she has a beautiful character  you found that out soon said rowland smiling  how long did it take you i found it out before i ever spoke to her i met her the other day in saint peters i knew it then i knew itdo you want to know how long i have known it  really said rowland i did nt mean to crossexamine you  do you remember mammas ball in december we had some talk and you then mentioned hernot by name you said but three words but i saw you admired her and i knew that if you admired her she must have a beautiful character that s what you require  upon my word cried rowland you make three words go very far  oh mr hudson has also spoken of her  ah that s better said rowland  i dont know he does nt like her  did he tell you so the question left rowlands lips before he could stay it which he would have done on a moments reflection  christina looked at him intently no she said at last that would have been dishonorable would nt it but i know it from my knowledge of him he does nt like perfection he is not bent upon being safe in his likings he s willing to risk something poor fellow he risks too much  rowland was silent he did not care for the thrust but he was profoundly mystified christina beckoned to her poodle and the dog marched stiffly across to her she gave a loving twist to his rosecolored topknot and bade him go and fetch her burnous he obeyed gathered it up in his teeth and returned with great solemnity dragging it along the floor  i do her justice i do her full justice she went on with soft earnestness i like to say that i like to be able to say it she s full of intelligence and courage and devotion she does nt do me a grain of justice but that is no harm there is something so fine in the aversions of a good woman  if you would give miss garland a chance said rowland i am sure she would be glad to be your friend  what do you mean by a chance she has only to take it i told her i liked her immensely and she frowned as if i had said something disgusting she looks very handsome when she frowns christina rose with these words and began to gather her mantle about her i dont often like women she went on in fact i generally detest them but i should like to know miss garland well i should like to have a friendship with her i have never had one they must be very delightful but i shant have one now eithernot if she can help it ask her what she thinks of me see what she will say i dont want to know keep it to yourself it s too sad so we go through life it s fatalitythat s what they call it is nt it we please the people we dont care for we displease those we do but i appreciate her i do her justice that s the more important thing it s because i have imagination she has none never mind it s her only fault i do her justice i understand very well she kept softly murmuring and looking about for madame grandoni she saw the good lady near the door and put out her hand to rowland for good night she held his hand an instant fixing him with her eyes the living splendor of which at this moment was something transcendent yes i do her justice she repeated and you do her more you would lay down your life for her with this she turned away and before he could answer she left him she went to madame grandoni grasped her two hands and held out her forehead to be kissed the next moment she was gone  that was a happy accident said madame grandoni she never looked so beautiful and she made my little party brilliant  beautiful verily rowland answered but it was no accident  what was it then  it was a plan she wished to see miss garland she knew she was to be here  how so  by roderick evidently  and why did she wish to see miss garland  heaven knows i give it up  ah the wicked girl murmured madame grandoni  no said rowland dont say that now she s too beautiful  oh you men the best of you  well then cried rowland she s too good  the opportunity presenting itself the next day he failed not as you may imagine to ask mary garland what she thought of miss light it was a saturday afternoon the time at which the beautiful marbles of the villa borghese are thrown open to the public mary had told him that roderick had promised to take her to see them with his mother and he joined the party in the splendid casino the warm weather had left so few strangers in rome that they had the place almost to themselves mrs hudson had confessed to an invincible fear of treading even with the help of her sons arm the polished marble floors and was sitting patiently on a stool with folded hands looking shyly here and there at the undraped paganism around her roderick had sauntered off alone with an irritated brow which seemed to betray the conflict between the instinct of observation and the perplexities of circumstance miss garland was wandering in another direction and though she was consulting her catalogue rowland fancied it was from habit she too was preoccupied he joined her and she presently sat down on a divan rather wearily and closed her murray then he asked her abruptly how christina had pleased her  she started the least bit at the question and he felt that she had been thinking of christina  i dont like her she said with decision  what do you think of her  i think she s false this was said without petulance or bitterness but with a very positive air  but she wished to please you she tried rowland rejoined in a moment  i think not she wished to please herself  rowland felt himself at liberty to say no more no allusion to christina had passed between them since the day they met her at saint peters but he knew that she knew by that infallible sixth sense of a woman who loves that this strange beautiful girl had the power to injure her to what extent she had the will mary was uncertain but last nights interview apparently had not reassured her it was under these circumstances equally unbecoming for rowland either to depreciate or to defend christina and he had to content himself with simply having verified the girls own assurance that she had made a bad impression he tried to talk of indifferent mattersabout the statues and the frescoes but today plainly aesthetic curiosity with miss garland had folded its wings curiosity of another sort had taken its place mary was longing he was sure to question him about christina but she found a dozen reasons for hesitating her questions would imply that roderick had not treated her with confidence for information on this point should properly have come from him they would imply that she was jealous and to betray her jealousy was intolerable to her pride for some minutes as she sat scratching the brilliant pavement with the point of her umbrella it was to be supposed that her pride and her anxiety held an earnest debate at last anxiety won  a propos of miss light she asked do you know her well  i can hardly say that but i have seen her repeatedly  do you like her  yes and no i think i am sorry for her  mary had spoken with her eyes on the pavement at this she looked up sorry for her why  wellshe is unhappy  what are her misfortunes  wellshe has a horrible mother and she has had a most injurious education  for a moment miss garland was silent then is nt she very beautiful she asked  dont you think so  that s measured by what men think she is extremely clever too  oh incontestably  she has beautiful dresses  yes any number of them  and beautiful manners  yessometimes  and plenty of money  money enough apparently  and she receives great admiration  very true  and she is to marry a prince  so they say  miss garland rose and turned to rejoin her companions commenting these admissions with a pregnant silence poor miss light she said at last simply and in this it seemed to rowland there was a touch of bitterness  very late on the following evening his servant brought him the card of a visitor he was surprised at a visit at such an hour but it may be said that when he read the inscriptioncavaliere giuseppe giacosahis surprise declined he had had an unformulated conviction that there was to be a sequel to the apparition at madame grandonis the cavaliere had come to usher it in  he had come evidently on a portentous errand he was as pale as ashes and prodigiously serious his little cold black eye had grown ardent and he had left his caressing smile at home he saluted rowland however with his usual obsequious bow  you have more than once done me the honor to invite me to call upon you he said i am ashamed of my long delay and i can only say to you frankly that my time this winter has not been my own rowland assented ungrudgingly fumbled for the italian correlative of the adage better late than never begged him to be seated and offered him a cigar the cavaliere sniffed imperceptibly the fragrant weed and then declared that if his kind host would allow him he would reserve it for consumption at another time he apparently desired to intimate that the solemnity of his errand left him no breath for idle smokepuffings rowland stayed himself just in time from an enthusiastic offer of a dozen more cigars and as he watched the cavaliere stow his treasure tenderly away in his pocketbook reflected that only an italian could go through such a performance with uncompromised dignity i must confess the little old man resumed that even now i come on business not of my ownor my own at least only in a secondary sense i have been dispatched as an ambassador an envoy extraordinary i may say by my dear friend mrs light  if i can in any way be of service to mrs light i shall be happy rowland said  well then dear sir casa light is in commotion the signora is in troublein terrible trouble for a moment rowland expected to hear that the signoras trouble was of a nature that a loan of five thousand francs would assuage but the cavaliere continued miss light has committed a great crime she has plunged a dagger into the heart of her mother  a dagger cried rowland  the cavaliere patted the air an instant with his fingertips i speak figuratively she has broken off her marriage  broken it off  short she has turned the prince from the door and the cavaliere when he had made this announcement folded his arms and bent upon rowland his intense inscrutable gaze it seemed to rowland that he detected in the polished depths of it a sort of fantastic gleam of irony or of triumph but superficially at least giacosa did nothing to discredit his character as a presumably sympathetic representative of mrs lights affliction  rowland heard his news with a kind of fierce disgust it seemed the sinister counterpart of christinas preternatural mildness at madame grandonis teaparty she had been too plausible to be honest without being able to trace the connection he yet instinctively associated her present rebellion with her meeting with mary garland if she had not seen mary she would have let things stand it was monstrous to suppose that she could have sacrificed so brilliant a fortune to a mere movement of jealousy to a refined instinct of feminine deviltry to a desire to frighten poor mary from her security by again appearing in the field yet rowland remembered his first impression of her she was dangerous and she had measured in each direction the perturbing effect of her rupture she was smiling her sweetest smile at it for half an hour rowland simply detested her and longed to denounce her to her face of course all he could say to giacosa was that he was extremely sorry but i am not surprised he added  you are not surprised  with miss light everything is possible is nt that true  another ripple seemed to play for an instant in the current of the old mans irony but he waived response it was a magnificent marriage he said solemnly i do not respect many people but i respect prince casamassima  i should judge him indeed to be a very honorable young man said rowland  eh young as he is he s made of the old stuff and now perhaps he s blowing his brains out he is the last of his house it s a great house but miss light will have put an end to it  is that the view she takes of it rowland ventured to ask  this time unmistakably the cavaliere smiled but still in that very outoftheway place you have observed miss light with attention he said and this brings me to my errand mrs light has a high opinion of your wisdom of your kindness and she has reason to believe you have influence with her daughter  iwith her daughter not a grain  that is possibly your modesty mrs light believes that something may yet be done and that christina will listen to you she begs you to come and see her before it is too late  but all this my dear cavaliere is none of my business rowland objected i cant possibly in such a matter take the responsibility of advising miss light  the cavaliere fixed his eyes for a moment on the floor in brief but intense reflection then looking up unfortunately he said she has no man near her whom she respects she has no father  and a fatally foolish mother rowland gave himself the satisfaction of exclaiming  the cavaliere was so pale that he could not easily have turned paler yet it seemed for a moment that his dead complexion blanched eh signore such as she is the mother appeals to you a very handsome womandisheveled in tears in despair in dishabille  rowland reflected a moment not on the attractions of mrs light under the circumstances thus indicated by the cavaliere but on the satisfaction he would take in accusing christina to her face of having struck a cruel blow  i must add said the cavaliere that mrs light desires also to speak to you on the subject of mr hudson  she considers mr hudson then connected with this step of her daughters  intimately he must be got out of rome  mrs light then must get an order from the pope to remove him it s not in my power  the cavaliere assented deferentially mrs light is equally helpless she would leave rome tomorrow but christina will not budge an order from the pope would do nothing a bull in council would do nothing  she s a remarkable young lady said rowland with bitterness  but the cavaliere rose and responded coldly she has a great spirit and it seemed to rowland that her great spirit for mysterious reasons gave him more pleasure than the distressing use she made of it gave him pain he was on the point of charging him with his inconsistency when giacosa resumed but if the marriage can be saved it must be saved it s a beautiful marriage it will be saved  notwithstanding miss lights great spirit to the contrary  miss light notwithstanding her great spirit will call prince casamassima back  heaven grant it said rowland  i dont know said the cavaliere solemnly that heaven will have much to do with it  rowland gave him a questioning look but he laid his finger on his lips and with rowlands promise to present himself on the morrow at casa light he shortly afterwards departed he left rowland revolving many things christinas magnanimity christinas perversity rodericks contingent fortune mary garlands certain trouble and the cavalieres own fine ambiguities  rowlands promise to the cavaliere obliged him to withdraw from an excursion which he had arranged with the two ladies from northampton before going to casa light he repaired in person to mrs hudsons hotel to make his excuses  he found rodericks mother sitting with tearful eyes staring at an open note that lay in her lap at the window sat miss garland who turned her intense regard upon him as he came in mrs hudson quickly rose and came to him holding out the note  in pitys name she cried what is the matter with my boy if he is ill i entreat you to take me to him  he is not ill to my knowledge said rowland what have you there  a notea dreadful note he tells us we are not to see him for a week if i could only go to his room but i am afraid i am afraid  i imagine there is no need of going to his room what is the occasion may i ask of his note  he was to have gone with us on this drive towhat is the placeto cervara you know it was arranged yesterday morning in the evening he was to have dined with us but he never came and this morning arrives this awful thing oh dear i m so excited would you mind reading it  rowland took the note and glanced at its halfdozen lines i cannot go to cervara they ran i have something else to do this will occupy me perhaps for a week and you ll not see me dont miss melearn not to miss me r h  why it means rowland commented that he has taken up a piece of work and that it is allabsorbing that s very good news this explanation was not sincere but he had not the courage not to offer it as a stopgap but he found he needed all his courage to maintain it for miss garland had left her place and approached him formidably unsatisfied  he does not work in the evening said mrs hudson cant he come for five minutes why does he write such a cruel cold note to his poor motherto poor mary what have we done that he acts so strangely it s this wicked infectious heathenish place and the poor ladys suppressed mistrust of the eternal city broke out passionately oh dear mr mallet she went on i am sure he has the fever and he s already delirious  i am very sure it s not that said miss garland with a certain dryness  she was still looking at rowland his eyes met hers and his own glance fell this made him angry and to carry off his confusion he pretended to be looking at the floor in meditation after all what had he to be ashamed of for a moment he was on the point of making a clean breast of it of crying out dearest friends i abdicate i cant help you but he checked himself he felt so impatient to have his three words with christina he grasped his hat  i will see what it is he cried and then he was glad he had not abdicated for as he turned away he glanced again at mary and saw that though her eyes were full of trouble they were not hard and accusing but charged with appealing friendship  he went straight to rodericks apartment deeming this at an early hour the safest place to seek him he found him in his sittingroom which had been closely darkened to keep out the heat the carpets and rugs had been removed the floor of speckled concrete was bare and lightly sprinkled with water here and there over it certain strongly perfumed flowers had been scattered roderick was lying on his divan in a white dressinggown staring up at the frescoed ceiling the room was deliciously cool and filled with the moist sweet odor of the circumjacent roses and violets all this seemed highly fantastic and yet rowland hardly felt surprised  your mother was greatly alarmed at your note he said and i came to satisfy myself that as i believed you are not ill roderick lay motionless except that he slightly turned his head toward his friend he was smelling a large white rose and he continued to present it to his nose in the darkness of the room he looked exceedingly pale but his handsome eyes had an extraordinary brilliancy he let them rest for some time on rowland lying there like a buddhist in an intellectual swoon whose perception should be slowly ebbing back to temporal matters oh i m not ill he said at last i have never been better  your note nevertheless and your absence rowland said have very naturally alarmed your mother i advise you to go to her directly and reassure her  go to her going to her would be worse than staying away staying away at present is a kindness and he inhaled deeply his huge rose looking up over it at rowland my presence in fact would be indecent  indecent pray explain  why you see as regards mary garland i am divinely happy does nt it strike you you ought to agree with me you wish me to spare her feelings i spare them by staying away last night i heard something  i heard it too said rowland with brevity and it s in honor of this piece of news that you have taken to your bed in this fashion  extremes meet i cant get up for joy  may i inquire how you heard your joyous newsfrom miss light herself  by no means it was brought me by her maid who is in my service as well  casamassimas loss then is to a certainty your gain  i dont talk about certainties i dont want to be arrogant i dont want to offend the immortal gods i m keeping very quiet but i cant help being happy i shall wait a while i shall bide my time  and then  and then that transcendent girl will confess to me that when she threw overboard her prince she remembered that i adored her  i feel bound to tell you was in the course of a moment rowlands response to this speech that i am now on my way to mrs lights  i congratulate you i envy you roderick murmured imperturbably  mrs light has sent for me to remonstrate with her daughter with whom she has taken it into her head that i have influence i dont know to what extent i shall remonstrate but i give you notice i shall not speak in your interest  roderick looked at him a moment with a lazy radiance in his eyes pray dont he simply answered  you deserve i should tell her you are a very shabby fellow  my dear rowland the comfort with you is that i can trust you you re incapable of doing anything disloyal  you mean to lie here then smelling your roses and nursing your visions and leaving your mother and miss garland to fall ill with anxiety  can i go and flaunt my felicity in their faces wait till i get used to it a trifle i have done them a palpable wrong but i can at least forbear to add insult to injury i may be an arrant fool but for the moment i have taken it into my head to be prodigiously pleased i should nt be able to conceal it my pleasure would offend them so i lock myself up as a dangerous character  well i can only say may your pleasure never grow less or your danger greater  roderick closed his eyes again and sniffed at his rose gods will be done  on this rowland left him and repaired directly to mrs lights this afflicted lady hurried forward to meet him since the cavalieres report of her condition she had somewhat smoothed and trimmed the exuberance of her distress but she was evidently in extreme tribulation and she clutched rowland by his two hands as if in the shipwreck of her hopes he were her single floating spar rowland greatly pitied her for there is something respectable in passionate grief even in a very bad cause and as pity is akin to love he endured her rather better than he had done hitherto  speak to her plead with her command her she cried pressing and shaking his hands she ll not heed us no more than if we were a pair of clocks aticking perhaps she will listen to you she always liked you  she always disliked me said rowland but that does nt matter now i have come here simply because you sent for me not because i can help you i cannot advise your daughter  oh cruel deadly man you must advise her you shant leave this house till you have advised her the poor woman passionately retorted look at me in my misery and refuse to help me oh you need nt be afraid i know i m a fright i have nt an idea what i have on if this goes on we may both as well turn scarecrows if ever a woman was desperate frantic heartbroken i am that woman i cant begin to tell you to have nourished a serpent sir all these years to have lavished ones self upon a viper that turns and stings her own poor mother to have toiled and prayed to have pushed and struggled to have eaten the bread of bitterness and all the rest of it sirand at the end of all things to find myself at this pass it cant be it s too cruel such things dont happen the lord dont allow it i m a religious woman sir and the lord knows all about me with his own hand he had given me his reward i would have lain down in the dust and let her walk over me i would have given her the eyes out of my head if she had taken a fancy to them no she s a cruel wicked heartless unnatural girl i speak to you mr mallet in my dire distress as to my only friend there is nt a creature here that i can look tonot one of them all that i have faith in but i always admired you i said to christina the first time i saw you that there at last was a real gentleman come dont disappoint me now i feel so terribly alone you see i feel what a nasty hard heartless world it is that has come and devoured my dinners and danced to my fiddles and yet that has nt a word to throw to me in my agony oh the money alone that i have put into this thing would melt the heart of a turk  during this frenzied outbreak rowland had had time to look round the room and to see the cavaliere sitting in a corner like a majordomo on the divan of an antechamber pale rigid and inscrutable  i have it at heart to tell you rowland said that if you consider my friend hudson  mrs light gave a toss of her head and hands oh it s not that she told me last night to bother her no longer with hudson hudson she did nt care a button for hudson i almost wish she did then perhaps one might understand it but she does nt care for anything in the wide world except to do her own hard wicked will and to crush me and shame me with her cruelty  ah then said rowland i am as much at sea as you and my presence here is an impertinence i should like to say three words to miss light on my own account but i must absolutely and inexorably decline to urge the cause of prince casamassima this is simply impossible  mrs light burst into angry tears because the poor boy is a prince eh because he s of a great family and has an income of millions eh that s why you grudge him and hate him i knew there were vulgar people of that way of feeling but i did nt expect it of you make an effort mr mallet rise to the occasion forgive the poor fellow his splendor be just be reasonable it s not his fault and it s not mine he s the best the kindest young man in the world and the most correct and moral and virtuous if he were standing here in rags i would say it all the same the man firstthe money afterwards that was always my motto and always will be what do you take me for do you suppose i would give christina to a vicious person do you suppose i would sacrifice my precious child little comfort as i have in her to a man against whose character one word could be breathed casamassima is only too good he s a saint of saints he s stupidly good there is nt such another in the length and breadth of europe what he has been through in this house not a common peasant would endure christina has treated him as you would nt treat a dog he has been insulted outraged persecuted he has been driven hither and thither till he did nt know where he was he has stood there where you standthere with his name and his millions and his devotionas white as your handkerchief with hot tears in his eyes and me ready to go down on my knees to him and say my own sweet prince i could kiss the ground you tread on but it is nt decent that i should allow you to enter my house and expose yourself to these horrors again and he would come back and he would come back and go through it all again and take all that was given him and only want the girl the more i was his confidant i know everything he used to beg my forgiveness for christina what do you say to that i seized him once and kissed him i did to find that and to find all the rest with it and to believe it was a gift straight from the pitying angels of heaven and then to see it dashed away before your eyes and to stand here helplessoh it s a fate i hope you may ever be spared  it would seem then that in the interest of prince casamassima himself i ought to refuse to interfere said rowland  mrs light looked at him hard slowly drying her eyes the intensity of her grief and anger gave her a kind of majesty and rowland for the moment felt ashamed of the ironical ring of his observation very good sir she said i m sorry your heart is not so tender as your conscience my compliments to your conscience it must give you great happiness heaven help me since you fail us we are indeed driven to the wall but i have fought my own battles before and i have never lost courage and i dont see why i should break down now cavaliere come here  giacosa rose at her summons and advanced with his usual deferential alacrity he shook hands with rowland in silence  mr mallet refuses to say a word mrs light went on time presses every moment is precious heaven knows what that poor boy may be doing if at this moment a clever woman should get hold of him she might be as ugly as she pleased it s horrible to think of it  the cavaliere fixed his eyes on rowland and his look which the night before had been singular was now most extraordinary there was a nameless force of anguish in it which seemed to grapple with the young mans reluctance to plead to entreat and at the same time to be glazed over with a reflection of strange things  suddenly though most vaguely rowland felt the presence of a new element in the drama that was going on before him he looked from the cavaliere to mrs light whose eyes were now quite dry and were fixed in stony hardness on the floor  if you could bring yourself the cavaliere said in a low soft caressing voice to address a few words of solemn remonstrance to miss light you would perhaps do more for us than you know you would save several persons a great pain the dear signora first and then christina herself christina in particular me too i might take the liberty to add  there was to rowland something acutely touching in this humble petition he had always felt a sort of imaginative tenderness for poor little unexplained giacosa and these words seemed a supreme contortion of the mysterious obliquity of his life all of a sudden as he watched the cavaliere something occurred to him it was something very odd and it stayed his glance suddenly from again turning to mrs light his idea embarrassed him and to carry off his embarrassment he repeated that it was folly to suppose that his words would have any weight with christina  the cavaliere stepped forward and laid two fingers on rowlands breast do you wish to know the truth you are the only man whose words she remembers  rowland was going from surprise to surprise i will say what i can he said by this time he had ventured to glance at mrs light she was looking at him askance as if upon this she was suddenly mistrusting his motives  if you fail she said sharply we have something else but please to lose no time  she had hardly spoken when the sound of a short sharp growl caused the company to turn christinas fleecy poodle stood in the middle of the vast saloon with his muzzle lowered in pompous defiance of the three conspirators against the comfort of his mistress this young ladys claims for him seemed justified he was an animal of amazingly delicate instincts he had preceded christina as a sort of vanguard of defense and she now slowly advanced from a neighboring room  you will be so good as to listen to mr mallet her mother said in a terrible voice and to reflect carefully upon what he says i suppose you will admit that he is disinterested in half an hour you shall hear from me again and passing her hand through the cavalieres arm she swept rapidly out of the room  christina looked hard at rowland but offered him no greeting she was very pale and strangely enough it at first seemed to rowland that her beauty was in eclipse but he very soon perceived that it had only changed its character and that if it was a trifle less brilliant than usual it was admirably touching and noble the clouded light of her eyes the magnificent gravity of her features the conscious erectness of her head might have belonged to a deposed sovereign or a condemned martyr why have you come here at this time she asked  your mother sent for me in pressing terms and i was very glad to have an opportunity to speak to you  have you come to help me or to persecute me  i have as little power to do one as i have desire to do the other i came in great part to ask you a question first your decision is irrevocable  christinas two hands had been hanging clasped in front of her she separated them and flung them apart by an admirable gesture  would you have done this if you had not seen miss garland  she looked at him with quickened attention then suddenly this is interesting she cried let us have it out and she flung herself into a chair and pointed to another  you dont answer my question rowland said  you have no right that i know of to ask it but it s a very clever one so clever that it deserves an answer very likely i would not  last night when i said that to myself i was extremely angry rowland rejoined  oh dear and you are not angry now  i am less angry  how very stupid but you can say something at least  if i were to say what is uppermost in my mind i would say that face to face with you it is never possible to condemn you  perche  you know yourself but i can at least say now what i felt last night it seemed to me that you had consciously cruelly dealt a blow at that poor girl do you understand  wait a moment and with her eyes fixed on him she inclined her head on one side meditatively then a cold brilliant smile covered her face and she made a gesture of negation i see your train of reasoning but it s quite wrong i meant no harm to miss garland i should be extremely sorry to make her suffer tell me you believe that  this was said with ineffable candor rowland heard himself answering i believe it  and yet in a sense your supposition was true christina continued i conceived as i told you a great admiration for miss garland and i frankly confess i was jealous of her what i envied her was simply her character i said to myself she in my place would nt marry casamassima i could not help saying it and i said it so often that i found a kind of inspiration in it i hated the idea of being worse than sheof doing something that she would nt do i might be bad by nature but i need nt be by volition the end of it all was that i found it impossible not to tell the prince that i was his very humble servant but that i could not marry him  are you sure it was only of miss garlands character that you were jealous not ofnot of  speak out i beg you we are talking philosophy  not of her affection for her cousin  sure is a good deal to ask still i think i may say it there are two reasons one at least i can tell you her affection has not a shadows weight with mr hudson why then should one fear it  and what is the other reason  excuse me that is my own affair  rowland was puzzled baffled charmed inspired almost all at once i have promised your mother he presently resumed to say something in favor of prince casamassima  she shook her head sadly prince casamassima needs nothing that you can say for him he is a magnificent parti i know it perfectly  you know also of the extreme affliction of your mother  her affliction is demonstrative she has been abusing me for the last twentyfour hours as if i were the vilest of the vile to see christina sit there in the purity of her beauty and say this might have made one bow ones head with a kind of awe i have failed of respect to her at other times but i have not done so now since we are talking philosophy she pursued with a gentle smile i may say it s a simple matter i dont love him or rather perhaps since we are talking philosophy i may say it s not a simple matter i spoke just now of inspiration the inspiration has been great buti frankly confess itthe choice has been hard shall i tell you she demanded with sudden ardor will you understand me it was on the one side the world the splendid beautiful powerful interesting world i know what that is i have tasted of the cup i know its sweetness ah if i chose if i let myself go if i flung everything to the winds the world and i would be famous friends i know its merits and i think without vanity it would see mine you would see some fine things i should like to be a princess and i think i should be a very good one i would play my part well i am fond of luxury i am fond of a great society i am fond of being looked at i am corrupt corruptible corruption ah what a pity that could nt be too mercy of heaven there was a passionate tremor in her voice she covered her face with her hands and sat motionless rowland saw that an intense agitation hitherto successfully repressed underlay her calmness and he could easily believe that her battle had been fierce she rose quickly and turned away walked a few paces and stopped in a moment she was facing him again with tears in her eyes and a flush in her cheeks but you need nt think i m afraid she said i have chosen and i shall hold to it i have something here here here and she patted her heart it s my own i shant part with it is it what you call an ideal i dont know i dont care it is brighter than the casamassima diamonds  you say that certain things are your own affair rowland presently rejoined but i must nevertheless make an attempt to learn what all this meanswhat it promises for my friend hudson is there any hope for him  this is a point i cant discuss with you minutely i like him very much  would you marry him if he were to ask you  he has asked me  and if he asks again  i shall marry no one just now  roderick said rowland has great hopes  does he know of my rupture with the prince  he is making a great holiday of it  christina pulled her poodle towards her and began to smooth his silky fleece i like him very much she repeated much more than i used to since you told me all that about him at saint cecilias i have felt a great friendship for him there s something very fine about him he s not afraid of anything he is not afraid of failure he is not afraid of ruin or death  poor fellow said rowland bitterly he is fatally picturesque  picturesque yes that s what he is i am very sorry for him  your mother told me just now that you had said that you did nt care a straw for him  very likely i meant as a lover one does nt want a lover one pities and one does nt wantof all things in the worlda picturesque husband i should like mr hudson as something else i wish he were my brother so that he could never talk to me of marriage then i could adore him i would nurse him i would wait on him and save him all disagreeable rubs and shocks i am much stronger than he and i would stand between him and the world indeed with mr hudson for my brother i should be willing to live and die an old maid  have you ever told him all this  i suppose so i ve told him five hundred things if it would please you i will tell him again  oh heaven forbid cried poor rowland with a groan  he was lingering there weighing his sympathy against his irritation and feeling it sink in the scale when the curtain of a distant doorway was lifted and mrs light passed across the room she stopped halfway and gave the young persons a flushed and menacing look it found apparently little to reassure her and she moved away with a passionate toss of her drapery rowland thought with horror of the sinister compulsion to which the young girl was to be subjected in this ethereal flight of hers there was a certain painful effort and tension of wing but it was none the less piteous to imagine her being rudely jerked down to the base earth she was doing her adventurous utmost to spurn she would need all her magnanimity for her own trial and it seemed gross to make further demands upon it on rodericks behalf  rowland took up his hat you asked a while ago if i had come to help you he said if i knew how i might help you i should be particularly glad  she stood silent a moment reflecting then at last looking up you remember she said your promising me six months ago to tell me what you finally thought of me i should like you to tell me now  he could hardly help smiling madame grandoni had insisted on the fact that christina was an actress though a sincere one and this little speech seemed a glimpse of the cloven foot she had played her great scene she had made her point and now she had her eye at the hole in the curtain and she was watching the house but she blushed as she perceived his smile and her blush which was beautiful made her fault venial  you are an excellent girl he said in a particular tone and gave her his hand in farewell  there was a great chain of rooms in mrs lights apartment the pride and joy of the hostess on festal evenings through which the departing visitor passed before reaching the door in one of the first of these rowland found himself waylaid and arrested by the distracted lady herself  well well she cried seizing his arm has she listened to youhave you moved her  in heavens name dear madame rowland begged leave the poor girl alone she is behaving very well  behaving very well is that all you have to tell me i dont believe you said a proper word to her you are conspiring together to kill me  rowland tried to soothe her to remonstrate to persuade her that it was equally cruel and unwise to try to force matters but she answered him only with harsh lamentations and imprecations and ended by telling him that her daughter was her property not his and that his interference was most insolent and most scandalous her disappointment seemed really to have crazed her and his only possible rejoinder was to take a summary departure  a moment later he came upon the cavaliere who was sitting with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands so buried in thought that rowland had to call him before he roused himself giacosa looked at him a moment keenly and then gave a shake of the head interrogatively  rowland gave a shake negative to which the cavaliere responded by a long melancholy sigh but her mother is determined to force matters said rowland  it seems that it must be  do you consider that it must be  i dont differ with mrs light  it will be a great cruelty  the cavaliere gave a tragic shrug eh it is nt an easy world  you should do nothing to make it harder then  what will you have it s a magnificent marriage  you disappoint me cavaliere said rowland solemnly i imagined you appreciated the great elevation of miss lights attitude she does nt love the prince she has let the matter stand or fall by that  the old man grasped him by the hand and stood a moment with averted eyes at last looking at him he held up two fingers  i have two hearts he said one for myself one for the world this one opposes miss light the other adores her one suffers horribly at what the other does  i dont understand double people cavaliere rowland said and i dont pretend to understand you but i have guessed that you are going to play some secret card  the card is mrs lights not mine said the cavaliere  it s a menace at any rate  the sword of damocles it hangs by a hair christina is to be given ten minutes to recant under penalty of having it fall on the blade there is something written in strange characters dont scratch your head you will not make it out  i think i have guessed it rowland said after a pregnant silence the cavaliere looked at him blankly but intently and rowland added though there are some signs indeed i dont understand  puzzle them out at your leisure said the cavaliere shaking his hand i hear mrs light i must go to my post i wish you were a catholic i would beg you to step into the first church you come to and pray for us the next halfhour  for us for whom  for all of us at any rate remember this i worship the christina  rowland heard the rustle of mrs lights dress he turned away and the cavaliere went as he said to his post rowland for the next couple of days pondered his riddle       chapter xi mrs hudson  of roderick meanwhile rowland saw nothing but he immediately went to mrs hudson and assured her that her son was in even exceptionally good health and spirits after this he called again on the two ladies from northampton but as rodericks absence continued he was able neither to furnish nor to obtain much comfort miss garlands apprehensive face seemed to him an image of his own state of mind he was profoundly depressed he felt that there was a storm in the air and he wished it would come without more delay and perform its ravages on the afternoon of the third day he went into saint peters his frequent resort whenever the outer world was disagreeable from a heartache to a roman rain there were few importunate pains the great church did not help him to forget he had wandered there for half an hour when he came upon a short figure lurking in the shadow of one of the great piers he saw it was that of an artist hastily transferring to his sketchbook a memento of some fleeting variation in the scenery of the basilica and in a moment he perceived that the artist was little sam singleton  singleton pocketed his sketchbook with a guilty air as if it cost his modesty a pang to be detected in this greedy culture of opportunity rowland always enjoyed meeting him talking with him in these days was as good as a wayside gush of clear cold water on a long hot walk there was perhaps no drinkingvessel and you had to apply your lips to some simple natural conduit but the result was always a sense of extreme moral refreshment on this occasion he mentally blessed the ingenuous little artist and heard presently with keen regret that he was to leave rome on the morrow singleton had come to bid farewell to saint peters and he was gathering a few supreme memories he had earned a pursefull of money and he was meaning to take a summers holiday going to switzerland to germany to paris in the autumn he was to return home his familycomposed as rowland knew of a father who was cashier in a bank and five unmarried sisters one of whom gave lyceumlectures on womans rights the whole resident at buffalo new yorkhad been writing him peremptory letters and appealing to him as a son brother and fellowcitizen he would have been grateful for another year in rome but what must be must be and he had laid up treasure which in buffalo would seem infinite they talked some time rowland hoped they might meet in switzerland and take a walk or two together singleton seemed to feel that buffalo had marked him for her own he was afraid he should not see rome again for many a year  so you expect to live at buffalo rowland asked sympathetically  well it will depend upon the viewsupon the attitudeof my family singleton replied oh i think i shall get on i think it can be done if i find it can be done i shall really be quite proud of it as an artist of course i mean you know do you know i have some nine hundred sketches i shall live in my portfolio and so long as one is not in rome pray what does it matter where one is but how i shall envy all you romansyou and mr gloriani and mr hudson especially  dont envy hudson he has nothing to envy  singleton grinned at what he considered a harmless jest yes he s going to be the great man of our time and i say mr mallet is nt it a mighty comfort that it s we who have turned him out  between ourselves said rowland he has disappointed me  singleton stared openmouthed dear me what did you expect  truly said rowland to himself what did i expect  i confess cried singleton i cant judge him rationally he fascinates me he s the sort of man one makes ones hero of  strictly speaking he is not a hero said rowland  singleton looked intensely grave and with almost tearful eyes is there anything amissanything out of the way about him he timidly asked then as rowland hesitated to reply he quickly added please if there is dont tell me i want to know no evil of him and i think i should hardly believe it in my memories of this roman artistlife he will be the central figure he will stand there in radiant relief as beautiful and unspotted as one of his own statues  amen said rowland gravely he remembered afresh that the sea is inhabited by big fishes and little and that the latter often find their way down the throats of the former singleton was going to spend the afternoon in taking last looks at certain other places and rowland offered to join him on his sentimental circuit but as they were preparing to leave the church he heard himself suddenly addressed from behind turning he beheld a young woman whom he immediately recognized as madame grandonis maid her mistress was present she said and begged to confer with him before he departed  this summons obliged rowland to separate from singleton to whom he bade farewell he followed the messenger and presently found madame grandoni occupying a liberal area on the steps of the tribune behind the great altar where spreading a shawl on the polished red marble she had comfortably seated herself he expected that she had something especial to impart and she lost no time in bringing forth her treasure  dont shout very loud she said remember that we are in church there s a limit to the noise one may make even in saint peters christina light was married this morning to prince casamassima  rowland did not shout at all he gave a deep short murmur marriedthis morning  married this morning at seven oclock le plus tranquillement du monde before three or four persons the young couple left rome an hour afterwards  for some moments this seemed to him really terrible the dark little drama of which he had caught a glimpse had played itself out he had believed that christina would resist that she had succumbed was a proof that the pressure had been cruel rowlands imagination followed her forth with an irresistible tremor into the world toward which she was rolling away with her detested husband and her stifled ideal but it must be confessed that if the first impulse of his compassion was for christina the second was for prince casamassima madame grandoni acknowledged an extreme curiosity as to the secret springs of these strange doings casamassimas sudden dismissal his still more sudden recall the hurried private marriage listen said rowland hereupon and i will tell you something and he related in detail his last visit to mrs light and his talk with this lady with christina and with the cavaliere  good she said it s all very curious but it s a riddle and i only half guess it  well said rowland i desire to harm no one but certain suppositions have taken shape in my mind which serve as a solvent to several ambiguities  it is very true madame grandoni answered that the cavaliere as he stands has always needed to be explained  he is explained by the hypothesis that threeandtwenty years ago at ancona mrs light had a lover  i see ancona was dull mrs light was lively andthreeandtwenty years agoperhaps the cavaliere was fascinating doubtless it would be fairer to say that he was fascinated poor giacosa  he has had his compensation rowland said he has been passionately fond of christina  naturally but has christina never wondered why  if she had been near guessing her mothers shabby treatment of him would have put her off the scent mrs lights conscience has apparently told her that she could expiate an hours too great kindness by twenty years contempt so she kept her secret but what is the profit of having a secret unless you can make some use of it the day at last came when she could turn hers to account she could let the skeleton out of the closet and create a panic  i dont understand  neither do i morally said rowland i only conceive that there was a horrible fabulous scene the poor cavaliere stood outside at the door white as a corpse and as dumb the mother and daughter had it out together mrs light burnt her ships when she came out she had three lines of writing in her daughters hand which the cavaliere was dispatched with to the prince they overtook the young man in time and when he reappeared he was delighted to dispense with further waiting i dont know what he thought of the look in his brides face but that is how i roughly reconstruct history  christina was forced to decide then that she could not afford not to be a princess  she was reduced by humiliation she was assured that it was not for her to make conditions but to thank her stars that there were none made for her if she persisted she might find it coming to pass that there would be conditions and the formal rupturethe rupture that the world would hear of and pry intowould then proceed from the prince and not from her  that s all nonsense said madame grandoni energetically  to us yes but not to the proudest girl in the world deeply wounded in her pride and not stopping to calculate probabilities but muffling her shame with an almost sensuous relief in a splendor that stood within her grasp and asked no questions is it not possible that the late mr light had made an outbreak before witnesses who are still living  certainly her marriage now said madame grandoni less analytically has the advantage that it takes her away from herparents  this ladys farther comments upon the event are not immediately pertinent to our history there were some other comments of which rowland had a deeply oppressive foreboding he called on the evening of the morrow upon mrs hudson and found roderick with the two ladies their companion had apparently but lately entered and rowland afterwards learned that it was his first appearance since the writing of the note which had so distressed his mother he had flung himself upon a sofa where he sat with his chin upon his breast staring before him with a sinister spark in his eye he fixed his gaze on rowland but gave him no greeting he had evidently been saying something to startle the women mrs hudson had gone and seated herself timidly and imploringly on the edge of the sofa trying to take his hand miss garland was applying herself to some needlework with conscious intentness  mrs hudson gave rowland on his entrance a touching look of gratitude oh we have such blessed news she said roderick is ready to leave rome  it s not blessed news it s most damnable news cried roderick  oh but we are very glad my son and i am sure you will be when you get away you re looking most dreadfully thin is nt he mr mallet it s plain enough you need a change i m sure we will go wherever you like where would you like to go  roderick turned his head slowly and looked at her he had let her take his hand which she pressed tenderly between her own he gazed at her for some time in silence poor mother he said at last in a portentous tone  my own dear son murmured mrs hudson in all the innocence of her trust  i dont care a straw where you go i dont care a straw for anything  oh my dear boy you must not say that before all of us herebefore mary before mr mallet  marymr mallet roderick repeated almost savagely he released himself from the clasp of his mothers hand and turned away leaning his elbows on his knees and holding his head in his hands there was a silence rowland said nothing because he was watching miss garland why should i stand on ceremony with mary and mr mallet roderick presently added mary pretends to believe i m a fine fellow and if she believes it as she ought to nothing i can say will alter her opinion mallet knows i m a hopeless humbug so i need nt mince my words with him  ah my dear dont use such dreadful language said mrs hudson are nt we all devoted to you and proud of you and waiting only to hear what you want so that we may do it  roderick got up and began to walk about the room he was evidently in a restless reckless profoundly demoralized condition rowland felt that it was literally true that he did not care a straw for anything but he observed with anxiety that mrs hudson who did not know on what delicate ground she was treading was disposed to chide him caressingly as a mere expression of tenderness he foresaw that she would bring down the hovering thunderbolt on her head  in gods name roderick cried dont remind me of my obligations it s intolerable to me and i dont believe it s pleasant to mallet i know they re tremendousi know i shall never repay them i m bankrupt do you know what that means  the poor lady sat staring dismayed and rowland angrily interfered dont talk such stuff to your mother he cried dont you see you re frightening her  frightening her she may as well be frightened first as last do i frighten you mother roderick demanded  oh roderick what do you mean whimpered the poor lady mr mallet what does he mean  i mean that i m an angry savage disappointed miserable man roderick went on i mean that i cant do a stroke of work nor think a profitable thought i mean that i m in a state of helpless rage and grief and shame helpless helplessthat s what it is you cant help me poor mothernot with kisses nor tears nor prayers mary cant help menot for all the honor she does me nor all the big books on art that she pores over mallet cant help menot with all his money nor all his good example nor all his friendship which i m so profoundly well aware of not with it all multiplied a thousand times and repeated to all eternity i thought you would help me you and mary that s why i sent for you but you cant dont think it the sooner you give up the idea the better for you give up being proud of me too there s nothing left of me to be proud of a year ago i was a mighty fine fellow but do you know what has become of me now i have gone to the devil  there was something in the ring of rodericks voice as he uttered these words which sent them home with convincing force he was not talking for effect or the mere sensuous pleasure of extravagant and paradoxical utterance as had often enough been the case ere this he was not even talking viciously or illhumoredly he was talking passionately desperately and from an irresistible need to throw off the oppressive burden of his mothers confidence his cruel eloquence brought the poor lady to her feet and she stood there with clasped hands petrified and voiceless mary garland quickly left her place came straight to roderick and laid her hand on his arm looking at him with all her tormented heart in her eyes he made no movement to disengage himself he simply shook his head several times in dogged negation of her healing powers rowland had been living for the past month in such intolerable expectancy of disaster that now that the ice was broken and the fatal plunge taken his foremost feeling was almost elation but in a moment his orderly instincts and his natural love of superficial smoothness overtook it  i really dont see roderick he said the profit of your talking in just this way at just this time dont you see how you are making your mother suffer  do i enjoy it myself cried roderick is the suffering all on your side and theirs do i look as if i were happy and were stirring you up with a stick for my amusement here we all are in the same boat we might as well understand each other these women must know that i m not to be counted on that sounds remarkably cool no doubt and i certainly dont deny your right to be utterly disgusted with me  will you keep what you have got to say till another time said mary and let me hear it alone  oh i ll let you hear it as often as you please but what s the use of keeping it i m in the humor it wont keep it s a very simple matter i m a failure that s all i m not a firstrate man i m secondrate tenthrate anything you please after that it s all one  mary garland turned away and buried her face in her hands but roderick struck apparently in some unwonted fashion with her gesture drew her towards him again and went on in a somewhat different tone it s hardly worth while we should have any private talk about this mary he said the thing would be comfortable for neither of us it s better after all that it be said once for all and dismissed there are things i cant talk to you about can i at least you are such a queer creature  i can imagine nothing you should nt talk to me about said mary  you are not afraid he demanded sharply looking at her  she turned away abruptly with lowered eyes hesitating a moment anything you think i should hear i will hear she said and then she returned to her place at the window and took up her work  i have had a great blow said roderick i was a great ass but it does nt make the blow any easier to bear  mr mallet tell me what roderick means said mrs hudson who had found her voice in a tone more peremptory than rowland had ever heard her use  he ought to have told you before said roderick really rowland if you will allow me to say so you ought you could have given a much better account of all this than i myself better especially in that it would have been more lenient to me you ought to have let them down gently it would have saved them a great deal of pain but you always want to keep things so smooth allow me to say that it s very weak of you  i hereby renounce such weakness said rowland  oh what is it sir what is it groaned mrs hudson insistently  it s what roderick says he s a failure  mary garland on hearing this declaration gave rowland a single glance and then rose laid down her work and walked rapidly out of the room mrs hudson tossed her head and timidly bristled this from you mr mallet she said with an injured air which rowland found harrowing  but roderick most characteristically did not in the least resent his friends assertion he sent him on the contrary one of those large clear looks of his which seemed to express a stoical pleasure in rowlands frankness and which set his companion then and there wondering again as he had so often done before at the extraordinary contradictions of his temperament my dear mother roderick said if you had had eyes that were not blinded by this sad maternal vanity you would have seen all this for yourself you would have seen that i m anything but prosperous  is it anything about money cried mrs hudson oh do write to mr striker  money said roderick i have nt a cent of money i m bankrupt  oh mr mallet how could you let him asked mrs hudson terribly  everything i have is at his service said rowland feeling ill  of course mr mallet will help you my son cried the poor lady eagerly  oh leave mr mallet alone said roderick i have squeezed him dry it s not my fault at least if i have nt  roderick what have you done with all your money his mother demanded  thrown it away it was no such great amount i have done nothing this winter  you have done nothing  i have done no work why in the world did nt you guess it and spare me all this could nt you see i was idle distracted dissipated  dissipated my dear son mrs hudson repeated  that s over for the present but could nt you seecould nt mary seethat i was in a damnably bad way  i have no doubt miss garland saw said rowland  mary has said nothing cried mrs hudson  oh she s a fine girl rowland said  have you done anything that will hurt poor mary mrs hudson asked  i have only been thinking night and day of another woman  mrs hudson dropped helplessly into her seat again oh dear dear had nt we better go home  not to get out of her way roderick said she has started on a career of her own and she does nt care a straw for me my head was filled with her i could think of nothing else i would have sacrificed everything to heryou mary mallet my work my fortune my future my honor i was in a fine state eh i dont pretend to be giving you good news but i m telling the simple literal truth so that you may know why i have gone to the dogs she pretended to care greatly for all this and to be willing to make any sacrifice in return she had a magnificent chance for she was being forced into a mercenary marriage with a man she detested she led me to believe that she would give this up and break short off and keep herself free and sacred and pure for me this was a great honor and you may believe that i valued it it turned my head and i lived only to see my happiness come to pass she did everything to encourage me to hope it would everything that her infernal coquetry and falsity could suggest  oh i say this is too much rowland broke out  do you defend her roderick cried with a renewal of his passion do you pretend to say that she gave me no hopes he had been speaking with growing bitterness quite losing sight of his mothers pain and bewilderment in the passionate joy of publishing his wrongs since he was hurt he must cry out since he was in pain he must scatter his pain abroad of his never thinking of others save as they spoke and moved from his cue as it were this extraordinary insensibility to the injurious effects of his eloquence was a capital example the more so as the motive of his eloquence was never an appeal for sympathy or compassion things to which he seemed perfectly indifferent and of which he could make no use the great and characteristic point with him was the perfect absoluteness of his own emotions and experience he never saw himself as part of a whole only as the clearcut sharpedged isolated individual rejoicing or raging as the case might be but needing in any case absolutely to affirm himself all this to rowland was ancient history but his perception of it stirred within him afresh at the sight of rodericks sense of having been betrayed that he under the circumstances should not in fairness be the first to lodge a complaint of betrayal was a point to which at his leisure rowland was of course capable of rendering impartial justice but rodericks present desperation was so peremptory that it imposed itself on ones sympathies do you pretend to say he went on that she did nt lead me along to the very edge of fulfillment and stupefy me with all that she suffered me to believe all that she sacredly promised it amused her to do it and she knew perfectly well what she really meant she never meant to be sincere she never dreamed she could be she s a ravenous flirt and why a flirt is a flirt is more than i can tell you i cant understand playing with those matters for me they re serious whether i take them up or lay them down i dont see what s in your head rowland to attempt to defend miss light you were the first to cry out against her you told me she was dangerous and i poohpoohed you you were right you re always right she s as cold and false and heartless as she s beautiful and she has sold her heartless beauty to the highest bidder i hope he knows what he gets  oh my son cried mrs hudson plaintively how could you ever care for such a dreadful creature  it would take long to tell you dear mother  rowlands latelydeepened sympathy and compassion for christina was still throbbing in his mind and he felt that in loyalty to it he must say a word for her you believed in her too much at first he declared and you believe in her too little now  roderick looked at him with eyes almost lurid beneath lowering brows she is an angel then after allthat s what you want to prove he cried that s consoling for me who have lost her you re always right i say but dear friend in mercy be wrong for once  oh yes mr mallet be merciful said mrs hudson in a tone which for all its gentleness made rowland stare the poor fellows stare covered a great deal of concentrated wonder and apprehensiona presentiment of what a small sweet feeble elderly lady might be capable of in the way of suddenly generated animosity there was no space in mrs hudsons tiny maternal mind for complications of feeling and one emotion existed only by turning another over flat and perching on top of it she was evidently not following roderick at all in his dusky aberrations sitting without in dismay she only saw that all was darkness and trouble and as rodericks glory had now quite outstripped her powers of imagination and urged him beyond her jurisdiction so that he had become a thing too precious and sacred for blame she found it infinitely comfortable to lay the burden of their common affliction upon rowlands broad shoulders had he not promised to make them all rich and happy and this was the end of it rowland felt as if his trials were in a sense only beginning had nt you better forget all this my dear mrs hudson said had nt you better just quietly attend to your work  work madame cried roderick my work s over i cant worki have nt worked all winter if i were fit for anything this sentimental collapse would have been just the thing to cure me of my apathy and break the spell of my idleness but there s a perfect vacuum here and he tapped his forehead it s bigger than ever it grows bigger every hour  i m sure you have made a beautiful likeness of your poor little mother said mrs hudson coaxingly  i had done nothing before and i have done nothing since i quarreled with an excellent man the other day from mere exasperation of my nerves and threw away five thousand dollars  threw awayfive thousand dollars roderick had been wandering among formidable abstractions and allusions too dark to penetrate but here was a concrete fact lucidly stated and poor mrs hudson for a moment looked it in the face she repeated her sons words a third time with a gasping murmur and then suddenly she burst into tears roderick went to her sat down beside her put his arm round her fixed his eyes coldly on the floor and waited for her to weep herself out she leaned her head on his shoulder and sobbed brokenheartedly she said not a word she made no attempt to scold but the desolation of her tears was overwhelming it lasted some timetoo long for rowlands courage he had stood silent wishing simply to appear very respectful but the elation that was mentioned a while since had utterly ebbed and he found his situation intolerable he walked awaynot perhaps on tiptoe but with a total absence of bravado in his tread  the next day while he was at home the servant brought him the card of a visitor he read with surprise the name of mrs hudson and hurried forward to meet her he found her in his sittingroom leaning on the arm of her son and looking very pale her eyes red with weeping and her lips tightly compressed her advent puzzled him and it was not for some time that he began to understand the motive of it rodericks countenance threw no light upon it but rodericks countenance full of light as it was in a way itself had never thrown light upon anything he had not been in rowlands rooms for several weeks and he immediately began to look at those of his own works that adorned them he lost himself in silent contemplation mrs hudson had evidently armed herself with dignity and so far as she might she meant to be impressive her success may be measured by the fact that rowlands whole attention centred in the fear of seeing her begin to weep she told him that she had come to him for practical advice she begged to remind him that she was a stranger in the land where were they to go please what were they to do rowland glanced at roderick but roderick had his back turned and was gazing at his adam with the intensity with which he might have examined michael angelos moses  roderick says he does nt know he does nt care mrs hudson said he leaves it entirely to you  many another man in rowlands place would have greeted this information with an irate and sarcastic laugh and told his visitors that he thanked them infinitely for their confidence but that really as things stood now they must settle these matters between themselves many another man might have so demeaned himself even if like rowland he had been in love with mary garland and pressingly conscious that her destiny was also part of the question but rowland swallowed all hilarity and all sarcasm and let himself seriously consider mrs hudsons petition his wits however were but indifferently at his command they were dulled by his sense of the inexpressible change in mrs hudsons attitude her visit was evidently intended as a formal reminder of the responsiblities rowland had worn so lightly mrs hudson was doubtless too sincerely humble a person to suppose that if he had been recreant to his vows of vigilance and tenderness her still small presence would operate as a chastisement but by some diminutive logical process of her own she had convinced herself that she had been weakly trustful and that she had suffered rowland to think too meanly not only of her understanding but of her social consequence a visit in her best gown would have an admonitory effect as regards both of these attributes it would cancel some favors received and show him that she was no such fool these were the reflections of a very shy woman who determining for once in her life to hold up her head was perhaps carrying it a trifle extravagantly  you know we have very little money to spend she said as rowland remained silent roderick tells me that he has debts and nothing at all to pay them with he says i must write to mr striker to sell my house for what it will bring and send me out the money when the money comes i must give it to him i m sure i dont know i never heard of anything so dreadful my house is all i have but that is all roderick will say we must be very economical  before this speech was finished mrs hudsons voice had begun to quaver softly and her face which had no capacity for the expression of superior wisdom to look as humbly appealing as before rowland turned to roderick and spoke like a schoolmaster come away from those statues and sit down here and listen to me  roderick started but obeyed with the most graceful docility  what do you propose to your mother to do rowland asked  propose said roderick absently oh i propose nothing  the tone the glance the gesture with which this was said were horribly irritating though obviously without the slightest intention of being so and for an instant an imprecation rose to rowlands lips but he checked it and he was afterwards glad he had done so you must do something he said choose select decide  my dear rowland how you talk roderick cried the very point of the matter is that i cant do anything i will do as i m told but i dont call that doing we must leave rome i suppose though i dont see why we have got no money and you have to pay money on the railroads  mrs hudson surreptitiously wrung her hands listen to him please she cried not leave rome when we have staid here later than any christians ever did before it s this dreadful place that has made us so unhappy  that s very true said roderick serenely if i had not come to rome i would nt have risen and if i had not risen i should nt have fallen  fallenfallen murmured mrs hudson just hear him  i will do anything you say rowland roderick added i will do anything you want i have not been unkind to my motherhave i mother i was unkind yesterday without meaning it for after all all that had to be said murder will out and my low spirits cant be hidden but we talked it over and made it up did nt we it seemed to me we did let rowland decide it mother whatever he suggests will be the right thing and roderick who had hardly removed his eyes from the statues got up again and went back to look at them  mrs hudson fixed her eyes upon the floor in silence there was not a trace in rodericks face or in his voice of the bitterness of his emotion of the day before and not a hint of his having the lightest weight upon his conscience he looked at rowland with his frank luminous eye as if there had never been a difference of opinion between them as if each had ever been for both unalterably and both for each  rowland had received a few days before a letter from a lady of his acquaintance a worthy scotswoman domiciled in a villa upon one of the olivecovered hills near florence she held her apartment in the villa upon a long lease and she enjoyed for a sum not worth mentioning the possession of an extraordinary number of noble stonefloored rooms with ceilings vaulted and frescoed and barred windows commanding the loveliest view in the world she was a needy and thrifty spinster who never hesitated to declare that the lovely view was all very well but that for her own part she lived in the villa for cheapness and that if she had a clear three hundred pounds a year she would go and really enjoy life near her sister a baronets lady at glasgow she was now proposing to make a visit to that exhilarating city and she desired to turn an honest penny by subletting for a few weeks her historic italian chambers the terms on which she occupied them enabled her to ask a rent almost jocosely small and she begged rowland to do what she called a little genteel advertising for her would he say a good word for her rooms to his numerous friends as they left rome he said a good word for them now to mrs hudson and told her in dollars and cents how cheap a summers lodging she might secure he dwelt upon the fact that she would strike a truce with tablesdhote and have a cook of her own amenable possibly to instruction in the northampton mysteries he had touched a tender chord mrs hudson became almost cheerful her sentiments upon the tabledhote system and upon foreign household habits generally were remarkable and if we had space for it would repay analysis and the idea of reclaiming a lost soul to the puritanic canons of cookery quite lightened the burden of her depression while rowland set forth his case roderick was slowly walking round the magnificent adam with his hands in his pockets rowland waited for him to manifest an interest in their discussion but the statue seemed to fascinate him and he remained calmly heedless rowland was a practical man he possessed conspicuously what is called the sense of detail he entered into mrs hudsons position minutely and told her exactly why it seemed good that she should remove immediately to the florentine villa she received his advice with great frigidity looking hard at the floor and sighing like a person well on her guard against an insidious optimism but she had nothing better to propose and rowland received her permission to write to his friend that he had let the rooms  roderick assented to this decision without either sighs or smiles a florentine villa is a good thing he said i am at your service  i m sure i hope you ll get better there moaned his mother gathering her shawl together  roderick laid one hand on her arm and with the other pointed to rowlands statues better or worse remember this i did those things he said  mrs hudson gazed at them vaguely and rowland said remember it yourself  they are horribly good said roderick  rowland solemnly shrugged his shoulders it seemed to him that he had nothing more to say but as the others were going a last light pulsation of the sense of undischarged duty led him to address to roderick a few words of parting advice you ll find the villa pandolfini very delightful very comfortable he said you ought to be very contented there whether you work or whether you loaf it s a place for an artist to be happy in i hope you will work  i hope i may said roderick with a magnificent smile  when we meet again have something to show me  when we meet again where the deuce are you going roderick demanded  oh i hardly know over the alps  over the alps you re going to leave me roderick cried  rowland had most distinctly meant to leave him but his resolution immediately wavered he glanced at mrs hudson and saw that her eyebrows were lifted and her lips parted in soft irony she seemed to accuse him of a craven shirking of trouble to demand of him to repair his cruel havoc in her life by a solemn renewal of zeal but rodericks expectations were the oddest such as they were rowland asked himself why he should nt make a bargain with them you desire me to go with you he asked  if you dont go i wontthat s all how in the world shall i get through the summer without you  how will you get through it with me that s the question  i dont pretend to say the future is a dead blank but without you it s not a blankit s certain damnation  mercy mercy murmured mrs hudson  rowland made an effort to stand firm and for a moment succeeded if i go with you will you try to work  roderick up to this moment had been looking as unperturbed as if the deep agitation of the day before were a thing of the remote past but at these words his face changed formidably he flushed and scowled and all his passion returned try to work he cried trytry workwork in gods name dont talk that way or you ll drive me mad do you suppose i m trying not to work do you suppose i stand rotting here for the fun of it dont you suppose i would try to work for myself before i tried for you  mr mallet cried mrs hudson piteously will you leave me alone with this  rowland turned to her and informed her gently that he would go with her to florence after he had so pledged himself he thought not at all of the pain of his position as mediator between the mothers resentful grief and the sons incurable weakness he drank deep only of the satisfaction of not separating from mary garland if the future was a blank to roderick it was hardly less so to himself he had at moments a lively foreboding of impending calamity he paid it no especial deference but it made him feel indisposed to take the future into his account when on his going to take leave of madame grandoni this lady asked at what time he would come back to rome he answered that he was coming back either never or forever when she asked him what he meant he said he really could nt tell her and parted from her with much genuine emotion the more so doubtless that she blessed him in a quite loving maternal fashion and told him she honestly believed him to be the best fellow in the world  the villa pandolfini stood directly upon a small grassgrown piazza on the top of a hill which sloped straight from one of the gates of florence it offered to the outer world a long rather low facade colored a dull dark yellow and pierced with windows of various sizes no one of which save those on the ground floor was on the same level with any other within it had a great cool gray cortile with high light arches around it heavilycorniced doors of majestic altitude opening out of it and a beautiful mediaeval well on one side of it mrs hudsons rooms opened into a small garden supported on immense substructions which were planted on the farther side of the hill as it sloped steeply away this garden was a charming place its south wall was curtained with a dense orange vine a dozen figtrees offered you their largeleaved shade and over the low parapet the soft grave tuscan landscape kept you company the rooms themselves were as high as chapels and as cool as royal sepulchres silence peace and security seemed to abide in the ancient house and make it an ideal refuge for aching hearts mrs hudson had a stunted brownfaced maddalena who wore a crimson handkerchief passed over her coarse black locks and tied under her sharp pertinacious chin and a smile which was as brilliant as a prolonged flash of lightning she smiled at everything in life especially the things she did nt like and which kept her talent for mendacity in healthy exercise a glance a word a motion was sufficient to make her show her teeth at you like a cheerful shewolf this inexpugnable smile constituted her whole vocabulary in her dealings with her melancholy mistress to whom she had been bequeathed by the late occupant of the apartment and who to rowlands satisfaction promised to be diverted from her maternal sorrows by the still deeper perplexities of maddalenas theory of roasting sweeping and bedmaking  rowland took rooms at a villa a trifle nearer florence whence in the summer mornings he had five minutes walk in the sharp black shadowstrip projected by winding flowertopped walls to join his friends the life at the villa pandolfini when it had fairly defined itself was tranquil and monotonous but it might have borrowed from exquisite circumstance an absorbing charm if a sensible shadow rested upon it this was because it had an inherent vice it was feigning a repose which it very scantily felt roderick had lost no time in giving the full measure of his uncompromising chagrin and as he was the central figure of the little group as he held its heartstrings all in his own hand it reflected faithfully the eclipse of his own genius no one had ventured upon the cheerful commonplace of saying that the change of air and of scene would restore his spirits this would have had under the circumstances altogether too silly a sound the change in question had done nothing of the sort and his companions had at least the comfort of their perspicacity an essential spring had dried up within him and there was no visible spiritual law for making it flow again he was rarely violent he expressed little of the irritation and ennui that he must have constantly felt it was as if he believed that a spiritual miracle for his redemption was just barely possible and was therefore worth waiting for the most that one could do however was to wait grimly and doggedly suppressing an imprecation as from time to time one looked at ones watch an attitude of positive urbanity toward life was not to be expected it was doing ones duty to hold ones tongue and keep ones hands off ones own windpipe and other peoples roderick had long silences fits of profound lethargy almost of stupefaction he used to sit in the garden by the hour with his head thrown back his legs outstretched his hands in his pockets and his eyes fastened upon the blinding summer sky he would gather a dozen books about him tumble them out on the ground take one into his lap and leave it with the pages unturned these moods would alternate with hours of extreme restlessness during which he mysteriously absented himself he bore the heat of the italian summer like a salamander and used to start off at high noon for long walks over the hills he often went down into florence rambled through her close dim streets and lounged away mornings in the churches and galleries on many of these occasions rowland bore him company for they were the times when he was most like his former self before michael angelos statues and the pictures of the early tuscans he quite forgot his own infelicities and picked up the thread of his old aesthetic loquacity he had a particular fondness for andrea del sarto and affirmed that if he had been a painter he would have taken the author of the madonna del sacco for his model he found in florence some of his roman friends and went down on certain evenings to meet them more than once he asked mary garland to go with him into town and showed her the things he most cared for he had some modeling clay brought up to the villa and deposited in a room suitable for his work but when this had been done he turned the key in the door and the clay never was touched his eye was heavy and his hand cold and his mother put up a secret prayer that he might be induced to see a doctor but on a certain occasion when her prayer became articulate he had a great outburst of anger and begged her to know once for all that his health was better than it had ever been on the whole and most of the time he was a sad spectacle he looked so hopelessly idle if he was not querulous and bitter it was because he had taken an extraordinary vow not to be a vow heroic for him a vow which those who knew him well had the tenderness to appreciate talking with him was like skating on thin ice and his companions had a constant mental vision of spots designated dangerous  this was a difficult time for rowland he said to himself that he would endure it to the end but that it must be his last adventure of the kind mrs hudson divided her time between looking askance at her son with her hands tightly clasped about her pockethandkerchief as if she were wringing it dry of the last hours tears and turning her eyes much more directly upon rowland in the mutest the feeblest the most intolerable reproachfulness she never phrased her accusations but he felt that in the unillumined void of the poor ladys mind they loomed up like vaguelyoutlined monsters her demeanor caused him the acutest suffering and if at the outset of his enterprise he had seen how dimly soever one of those plaintive eyebeams in the opposite scale the brilliancy of rodericks promises would have counted for little they made their way to the softest spot in his conscience and kept it chronically aching if mrs hudson had been loquacious and vulgar he would have borne even a less valid persecution with greater fortitude but somehow neat and noiseless and dismally ladylike as she sat there keeping her grievance green with her softdropping tears her displeasure conveyed an overwhelming imputation of brutality he felt like a reckless trustee who has speculated with the widows mite and is haunted with the reflection of ruin that he sees in her tearful eyes he did everything conceivable to be polite to mrs hudson and to treat her with distinguished deference perhaps his exasperated nerves made him overshoot the mark and rendered his civilities a trifle peremptory she seemed capable of believing that he was trying to make a fool of her she would have thought him cruelly recreant if he had suddenly departed in desperation and yet she gave him no visible credit for his constancy women are said by some authorities to be cruel i dont know how true this is but it may at least be pertinent to remark that mrs hudson was very much of a woman it often seemed to rowland that he had too decidedly forfeited his freedom and that there was something positively grotesque in a man of his age and circumstances living in such a moral bondage  but mary garland had helped him before and she helped him nowhelped him not less than he had assured himself she would when he found himself drifting to florence yet her help was rendered in the same unconscious unacknowledged fashion as before there was no explicit change in their relations after that distressing scene in rome which had immediately preceded their departure it was of course impossible that there should not be on miss garlands part some frankness of allusion to rodericks sad condition she had been present the reader will remember during only half of his unsparing confession and rowland had not seen her confronted with any absolute proof of rodericks passion for christina light but he knew that she knew far too much for her happiness roderick had told him shortly after their settlement at the villa pandolfini that he had had a tremendous talk with his cousin rowland asked no questions about it he preferred not to know what had passed between them if their interview had been purely painful he wished to ignore it for miss garlands sake and if it had sown the seeds of reconciliation he wished to close his eyes to it for his ownfor the sake of that unshaped idea forever dismissed and yet forever present which hovered in the background of his consciousness with a hanging head as it were and yet an unshamed glance and whose lightest motions were an effectual bribe to patience was the engagement broken rowland wondered yet without asking but it hardly mattered for if as was more than probable miss garland had peremptorily released her cousin her own heart had by no means recovered its liberty it was very certain to rowlands mind that if she had given him up she had by no means ceased to care for him passionately and that to exhaust her charity for his weaknesses roderick would have as the phrase is a long row to hoe she spoke of roderick as she might have done of a person suffering from a serious malady which demanded much tenderness but if rowland had found it possible to accuse her of dishonesty he would have said now that she believed appreciably less than she pretended to in her victims being an involuntary patient there are women whose love is caretaking and patronizing and who rather prefer a weak man because he gives them a comfortable sense of strength it did not in the least please rowland to believe that mary garland was one of these for he held that such women were only males in petticoats and he was convinced that miss garlands heart was constructed after the most perfect feminine model that she was a very different woman from christina light did not at all prove that she was less a woman and if the princess casamassima had gone up into a high place to publish her disrelish of a man who lacked the virile will it was very certain that mary garland was not a person to put up at any point with what might be called the princesss leavings it was christinas constant practice to remind you of the complexity of her character of the subtlety of her mind of her troublous faculty of seeing everything in a dozen different lights mary garland had never pretended not to be simple but rowland had a theory that she had really a more multitudinous sense of human things a more delicate imagination and a finer instinct of character she did you the honors of her mind with a grace far less regal but was not that faculty of quite as remarkable an adjustment if in poor christinas strangely commingled nature there was circle within circle and depth beneath depth it was to be believed that mary garland though she did not amuse herself with dropping stones into her soul and waiting to hear them fall laid quite as many sources of spiritual life under contribution she had believed roderick was a fine fellow when she bade him farewell beneath the northampton elms and this belief to her young strenuous concentrated imagination had meant many things if it was to grow cold it would be because disenchantment had become total and won the battle at each successive point  miss garland had even in her face and carriage something of the preoccupied and wearied look of a person who is watching at a sickbed rodericks broken fortunes his dead ambitions were a cruel burden to the heart of a girl who had believed that he possessed genius and supposed that genius was to ones spiritual economy what full pockets were to ones domestic and yet with her rowland never felt as with mrs hudson that undercurrent of reproach and bitterness toward himself that impertinent implication that he had defrauded her of happiness was this justice in miss garland or was it mercy the answer would have been difficult for she had almost let rowland feel before leaving rome that she liked him well enough to forgive him an injury it was partly rowland fancied that there were occasional lapses deep and sweet in her sense of injury when on arriving at florence she saw the place rowland had brought them to in their trouble she had given him a look and said a few words to him that had seemed not only a remission of guilt but a positive reward this happened in the court of the villathe large gray quadrangle overstretched from edge to edge of the redtiled roof by the soft italian sky mary had felt on the spot the sovereign charm of the place it was reflected in her deeply intelligent glance and rowland immediately accused himself of not having done the villa justice miss garland took a mighty fancy to florence and used to look down wistfully at the towered city from the windows and garden roderick having now no pretext for not being her cicerone rowland was no longer at liberty as he had been in rome to propose frequent excursions to her rodericks own invitations however were not frequent and rowland more than once ventured to introduce her to a gallery or a church these expeditions were not so blissful to his sense as the rambles they had taken together in rome for his companion only half surrendered herself to her enjoyment and seemed to have but a divided attention at her command often when she had begun with looking intently at a picture her silence after an interval made him turn and glance at her he usually found that if she was looking at the picture still she was not seeing it her eyes were fixed but her thoughts were wandering and an image more vivid than any that raphael or titian had drawn had superposed itself upon the canvas she asked fewer questions than before and seemed to have lost heart for consulting guidebooks and encyclopaedias from time to time however she uttered a deep full murmur of gratification florence in midsummer was perfectly void of travelers and the dense little city gave forth its aesthetic aroma with a larger frankness as the nightingale sings when the listeners have departed the churches were deliciously cool but the gray streets were stifling and the great dovetailed polygons of pavement as hot to the tread as molten lava rowland who suffered from intense heat would have found all this uncomfortable in solitude but florence had never charmed him so completely as during these midsummer strolls with his preoccupied companion one evening they had arranged to go on the morrow to the academy miss garland kept her appointment but as soon as she appeared rowland saw that something painful had befallen her she was doing her best to look at her ease but her face bore the marks of tears rowland told her that he was afraid she was ill and that if she preferred to give up the visit to florence he would submit with what grace he might she hesitated a moment and then said she preferred to adhere to their plan i am not well she presently added but it s a moral malady and in such cases i consider your company beneficial  but if i am to be your doctor said rowland you must tell me how your illness began  i can tell you very little it began with mrs hudson being unjust to me for the first time in her life and now i am already better  i mention this incident because it confirmed an impression of rowlands from which he had derived a certain consolation he knew that mrs hudson considered her sons illregulated passion for christina light a very regrettable affair but he suspected that her manifest compassion had been all for roderick and not in the least for mary garland she was fond of the young girl but she had valued her primarily during the last two years as a kind of assistant priestess at rodericks shrine roderick had honored her by asking her to become his wife but that poor mary had any rights in consequence mrs hudson was quite incapable of perceiving her sentiment on the subject was of course not very vigorously formulated but she was unprepared to admit that miss garland had any ground for complaint roderick was very unhappy that was enough and marys duty was to join her patience and her prayers to those of his doting mother roderick might fall in love with whom he pleased no doubt that women trained in the mysterious roman arts were only too proud and too happy to make it easy for him and it was very presuming in poor plain mary to feel any personal resentment mrs hudsons philosophy was of too narrow a scope to suggest that a mother may forgive where a mistress cannot and she thought herself greatly aggrieved that miss garland was not so disinterested as herself she was ready to drop dead in rodericks service and she was quite capable of seeing her companion falter and grow faint without a tremor of compassion mary apparently had given some intimation of her belief that if constancy is the flower of devotion reciprocity is the guarantee of constancy and mrs hudson had rebuked her failing faith and called it cruelty that miss garland had found it hard to reason with mrs hudson that she suffered deeply from the elder ladys softly bitter imputations and that in short he had companionship in misfortuneall this made rowland find a certain luxury in his discomfort  the party at villa pandolfini used to sit in the garden in the evenings which rowland almost always spent with them their entertainment was in the heavily perfumed air in the dim far starlight in the crenelated tower of a neighboring villa which loomed vaguely above them in the warm darkness and in such conversation as depressing reflections allowed roderick clad always in white roamed about like a restless ghost silent for the most part but making from time to time a brief observation characterized by the most fantastic cynicism rodericks contributions to the conversation were indeed always so fantastic that though half the time they wearied him unspeakably rowland made an effort to treat them humorously with rowland alone roderick talked a great deal more often about things related to his own work or about artistic and aesthetic matters in general he talked as well as ever or even better but his talk always ended in a torrent of groans and curses when this current set in rowland straightway turned his back or stopped his ears and roderick now witnessed these movements with perfect indifference when the latter was absent from the starlit circle in the garden as often happened rowland knew nothing of his whereabouts he supposed him to be in florence but he never learned what he did there all this was not enlivening but with an even muffled tread the days followed each other and brought the month of august to a close one particular evening at this time was most enchanting there was a perfect moon looking so extraordinarily large that it made everything its light fell upon seem small the heat was tempered by a soft west wind and the wind was laden with the odors of the early harvest the hills the vale of the arno the shrunken river the domes of florence were vaguely effaced by the dense moonshine they looked as if they were melting out of sight like an exorcised vision rowland had found the two ladies alone at the villa and he had sat with them for an hour he felt absolutely hushed by the solemn splendor of the scene but he had risked the remark that whatever life might yet have in store for either of them this was a night that they would never forget  it s a night to remember on ones deathbed miss garland exclaimed  oh mary how can you murmured mrs hudson to whom this savored of profanity and to whose shrinking sense indeed the accumulated loveliness of the night seemed to have something shameless and defiant  they were silent after this for some time but at last rowland addressed certain idle words to miss garland she made no reply and he turned to look at her she was sitting motionless with her head pressed to mrs hudsons shoulder and the latter lady was gazing at him through the silvered dusk with a look which gave a sort of spectral solemnity to the sad weak meaning of her eyes she had the air for the moment of a little old malevolent fairy miss garland rowland perceived in an instant was not absolutely motionless a tremor passed through her figure she was weeping or on the point of weeping and she could not trust herself to speak rowland left his place and wandered to another part of the garden wondering at the motive of her sudden tears of womens sobs in general he had a sovereign dread but these somehow gave him a certain pleasure when he returned to his place miss garland had raised her head and banished her tears she came away from mrs hudson and they stood for a short time leaning against the parapet  it seems to you very strange i suppose said rowland that there should be any trouble in such a world as this  i used to think she answered that if any trouble came to me i would bear it like a stoic but that was at home where things dont speak to us of enjoyment as they do here here it is such a mixture one does nt know what to choose what to believe beauty stands therebeauty such as this night and this place and all this sad strange summer have been so full ofand it penetrates to ones soul and lodges there and keeps saying that man was not made to suffer but to enjoy this place has undermined my stoicism butshall i tell you i feel as if i were saying something sinfuli love it  if it is sinful i absolve you said rowland in so far as i have power we are made i suppose both to suffer and to enjoy as you say it s a mixture just now and here it seems a peculiarly strange one but we must take things in turn  his words had a singular aptness for he had hardly uttered them when roderick came out from the house evidently in his darkest mood he stood for a moment gazing hard at the view  it s a very beautiful night my son said his mother going to him timidly and touching his arm  he passed his hand through his hair and let it stay there clasping his thick locks beautiful he cried of course it s beautiful everything is beautiful everything is insolent defiant atrocious with beauty nothing is ugly but meme and my poor dead brain  oh my dearest son pleaded poor mrs hudson dont you feel any better  roderick made no immediate answer but at last he spoke in a different voice i came expressly to tell you that you need nt trouble yourselves any longer to wait for something to turn up nothing will turn up it s all over i said when i came here i would give it a chance i have given it a chance have nt i eh have nt i rowland it s no use the thing s a failure do with me now what you please i recommend you to set me up there at the end of the garden and shoot me  i feel strongly inclined said rowland gravely to go and get my revolver  oh mercy on us what language cried mrs hudson  why not roderick went on this would be a lovely night for it and i should be a lucky fellow to be buried in this garden but bury me alive if you prefer take me back to northampton  roderick will you really come cried his mother  oh yes i ll go i might as well be there as anywherereverting to idiocy and living upon alms i can do nothing with all this perhaps i should really like northampton if i m to vegetate for the rest of my days i can do it there better than here  oh come home come home mrs hudson said and we shall all be safe and quiet and happy my dearest son come home with your poor mother  let us go then and go quickly  mrs hudson flung herself upon his neck for gratitude we ll go tomorrow she cried the lord is very good to me  mary garland said nothing to this but she looked at rowland and her eyes seemed to contain a kind of alarmed appeal rowland noted it with exultation but even without it he would have broken into an eager protest  are you serious roderick he demanded  serious of course not how can a man with a crack in his brain be serious how can a muddlehead reason but i m not jesting either i can no more make jokes than utter oracles  are you willing to go home  willing god forbid i am simply amenable to force if my mother chooses to take me i wont resist i cant i have come to that  let me resist then said rowland go home as you are now i cant stand by and see it  it may have been true that roderick had lost his sense of humor but he scratched his head with a gesture that was almost comical in its effect you are a queer fellow i should think i would disgust you horribly  stay another year rowland simply said  doing nothing  you shall do something i am responsible for your doing something  to whom are you responsible  rowland before replying glanced at miss garland and his glance made her speak quickly not to me  i m responsible to myself rowland declared  my poor dear fellow said roderick  oh mr mallet are nt you satisfied cried mrs hudson in the tone in which niobe may have addressed the avenging archers after she had seen her eldestborn fall it s out of all nature keeping him here when we re in a poor way surely our own dear native land is the place for us do leave us to ourselves sir  this just failed of being a dismissal in form and rowland bowed his head to it roderick was silent for some moments then suddenly he covered his face with his two hands take me at least out of this terrible italy he cried where everything mocks and reproaches and torments and eludes me take me out of this land of impossible beauty and put me in the midst of ugliness set me down where nature is coarse and flat and men and manners are vulgar there must be something awfully ugly in germany pack me off there  rowland answered that if he wished to leave italy the thing might be arranged he would think it over and submit a proposal on the morrow he suggested to mrs hudson in consequence that she should spend the autumn in switzerland where she would find a fine tonic climate plenty of fresh milk and several pensions at three francs and a half a day switzerland of course was not ugly but one could not have everything  mrs hudson neither thanked him nor assented but she wept and packed her trunks rowland had a theory after the scene which led to these preparations that mary garland was weary of waiting for roderick to come to his senses that the faith which had bravely borne his manhood company hitherto on the tortuous march he was leading it had begun to believe it had gone far enough this theory was not vitiated by something she said to him on the day before that on which mrs hudson had arranged to leave florence  cousin sarah the other evening she said asked you to please leave us i think she hardly knew what she was saying and i hope you have not taken offense  by no means but i honestly believe that my leaving you would contribute greatly to mrs hudsons comfort i can be your hidden providence you know i can watch you at a distance and come upon the scene at critical moments  miss garland looked for a moment at the ground and then with sudden earnestness i beg you to come with us she said  it need hardly be added that after this rowland went with them       chapter xii the princess casamassima  rowland had a very friendly memory of a little mountain inn accessible with moderate trouble from lucerne where he had once spent a blissful ten days he had at that time been trudging knapsack on back over half switzerland and not being on his legs a particularly light weight it was no shame to him to confess that he was mortally tired the inn of which i speak presented striking analogies with a cowstable but in spite of this circumstance it was crowded with hungry tourists it stood in a high shallow valley with flowerstrewn alpine meadows sloping down to it from the base of certain rugged rocks whose outlines were grotesque against the evening sky rowland had seen grander places in switzerland that pleased him less and whenever afterwards he wished to think of alpine opportunities at their best he recalled this grassy concave among the mountaintops and the august days he spent there resting deliciously at his length in the lee of a sunwarmed boulder with the light cool air stirring about his temples the wafted odors of the pines in his nostrils the tinkle of the cattlebells in his ears the vast progression of the mountain shadows before his eyes and a volume of wordsworth in his pocket his face on the swiss hillsides had been scorched to within a shade of the color nowadays called magenta and his bed was a pallet in a loft which he shared with a german botanist of colossal statureevery inch of him quaking at an open window these had been drawbacks to felicity but rowland hardly cared where or how he was lodged for he spent the livelong day under the sky on the crest of a slope that looked at the jungfrau he remembered all this on leaving florence with his friends and he reflected that as the midseason was over accommodations would be more ample and charges more modest he communicated with his old friend the landlord and while september was yet young his companions established themselves under his guidance in the grassy valley  he had crossed the saint gothard pass with them in the same carriage during the journey from florence and especially during this portion of it the cloud that hung over the little party had been almost dissipated and they had looked at each other in the close contiguity of the train and the postingcarriage without either accusing or consoling glances it was impossible not to enjoy the magnificent scenery of the apennines and the italian alps and there was a tacit agreement among the travelers to abstain from sombre allusions the effect of this delicate compact seemed excellent it ensured them a weeks intellectual sunshine roderick sat and gazed out of the window with a fascinated stare and with a perfect docility of attitude he concerned himself not a particle about the itinerary or about any of the wayside arrangements he took no trouble and he gave none he assented to everything that was proposed talked very little and led for a week a perfectly contemplative life his mother rarely removed her eyes from him and if a while before this would have extremely irritated him he now seemed perfectly unconscious of her observation and profoundly indifferent to anything that might befall him they spent a couple of days on the lake of como at a hotel with white porticoes smothered in oleander and myrtle and the terracesteps leading down to little boats with striped awnings they agreed it was the earthly paradise and they passed the mornings strolling through the perfumed alleys of classic villas and the evenings floating in the moonlight in a circle of outlined mountains to the music of silvertrickling oars one day in the afternoon the two young men took a long stroll together they followed the winding footway that led toward como close to the lakeside past the gates of villas and the walls of vineyards through little hamlets propped on a dozen arches and bathing their feet and their pendant tatters in the graygreen ripple past frescoed walls and crumbling campaniles and grassy village piazzas and the mouth of soft ravines that wound upward through belts of swinging vine and vaporous olive and splendid chestnut to high ledges where white chapels gleamed amid the paler boskage and bare cliffsurfaces with their suncracked lips drank in the azure light it all was confoundingly picturesque it was the italy that we know from the steel engravings in old keepsakes and annuals from the vignettes on musicsheets and the dropcurtains at theatres an italy that we can never confess to ourselvesin spite of our own changes and of italysthat we have ceased to believe in rowland and roderick turned aside from the little paved footway that clambered and dipped and wound and doubled beside the lake and stretched themselves idly beneath a figtree on a grassy promontory rowland had never known anything so divinely soothing as the dreamy softness of that early autumn afternoon the iridescent mountains shut him in the little waves beneath him fretted the white pebbles at the laziest intervals the festooned vines above him swayed just visibly in the all but motionless air  roderick lay observing it all with his arms thrown back and his hands under his head this suits me he said i could be happy here and forget everything why not stay here forever he kept his position for a long time and seemed lost in his thoughts rowland spoke to him but he made vague answers at last he closed his eyes it seemed to rowland also a place to stay in forever a place for perfect oblivion of the disagreeable suddenly roderick turned over on his face and buried it in his arms there had been something passionate in his movement but rowland was nevertheless surprised when he at last jerked himself back into a sitting posture to perceive the trace of tears in his eyes roderick turned to his friend stretching his two hands out toward the lake and mountains and shaking them with an eloquent gesture as if his heart was too full for utterance  pity me sir pity me he presently cried look at this lovely world and think what it must be to be dead to it  dead said rowland  dead dead dead and buried buried in an open grave where you lie staring up at the sailing clouds smelling the waving flowers and hearing all nature live and grow above you that s the way i feel  i am glad to hear it said rowland death of that sort is very near to resurrection  it s too horrible roderick went on it has all come over me here tremendously if i were not ashamed i could shed a bushel of tears for one hour of what i have been i would give up anything i may be  never mind what you have been be something better  i shall never be anything again it s no use talking but i dont know what secret spring has been touched since i have lain here something in my heart seemed suddenly to open and let in a flood of beauty and desire i know what i have lost and i think it horrible mind you i know it i feel it remember that hereafter dont say that he was stupefied and senseless that his perception was dulled and his aspiration dead say that he trembled in every nerve with a sense of the beauty and sweetness of life that he rebelled and protested and shrieked that he was buried alive with his eyes open and his heart beating to madness that he clung to every blade of grass and every wayside thorn as he passed that it was the most horrible spectacle you ever witnessed that it was an outrage a murder a massacre  good heavens man are you insane rowland cried  i never have been saner i dont want to be bad company and in this beautiful spot at this delightful hour it seems an outrage to break the charm but i am bidding farewell to italy to beauty to honor to life i only want to assure you that i know what i lose i know it in every pulse of my heart here where these things are all loveliest i take leave of them farewell farewell  during their passage of the saint gothard roderick absented himself much of the time from the carriage and rambled far in advance along the huge zigzags of the road he displayed an extraordinary activity his light weight and slender figure made him an excellent pedestrian and his friends frequently saw him skirting the edge of plunging chasms loosening the stones on long steep slopes or lifting himself against the sky from the top of rocky pinnacles mary garland walked a great deal but she remained near the carriage to be with mrs hudson rowland remained near it to be with miss garland he trudged by her side up that magnificent ascent from italy and found himself regretting that the alps were so low and that their trudging was not to last a week she was exhilarated she liked to walk in the way of mountains until within the last few weeks she had seen nothing greater than mount holyoke and she found that the alps amply justified their reputation rowland knew that she loved nature but he was struck afresh with the vivacity of her observation of it and with her knowledge of plants and stones at that season the wild flowers had mostly departed but a few of them lingered and miss garland never failed to espy them in their outlying corners they interested her greatly she was charmed when they were old friends and charmed even more when they were new she displayed a very light foot in going in quest of them and had soon covered the front seat of the carriage with a tangle of strange vegetation rowland of course was alert in her service and he gathered for her several botanical specimens which at first seemed inaccessible one of these indeed had at first appeared easier of capture than his attempt attested and he had paused a moment at the base of the little peak on which it grew measuring the risk of farther pursuit suddenly as he stood there he remembered rodericks defiance of danger and of miss light at the coliseum and he was seized with a strong desire to test the courage of his companion she had just scrambled up a grassy slope near him and had seen that the flower was out of reach as he prepared to approach it she called to him eagerly to stop the thing was impossible poor rowland whose passion had been terribly starved enjoyed immensely the thought of having her care for three minutes what became of him he was the least brutal of men but for a moment he was perfectly indifferent to her suffering  i can get the flower he called to her will you trust me  i dont want it i would rather not have it she cried  will you trust me he repeated looking at her  she looked at him and then at the flower he wondered whether she would shriek and swoon as miss light had done i wish it were something better she said simply and then stood watching him while he began to clamber rowland was not shaped for an acrobat and his enterprise was difficult but he kept his wits about him made the most of narrow footholds and coigns of vantage and at last secured his prize he managed to stick it into his buttonhole and then he contrived to descend there was more than one chance for an ugly fall but he evaded them all it was doubtless not gracefully done but it was done and that was all he had proposed to himself he was red in the face when he offered miss garland the flower and she was visibly pale she had watched him without moving all this had passed without the knowledge of mrs hudson who was dozing beneath the hood of the carriage mary garlands eyes did not perhaps display that ardent admiration which was formerly conferred by the queen of beauty at a tournament but they expressed something in which rowland found his reward why did you do that she asked gravely  he hesitated he felt that it was physically possible to say because i love you but that it was not morally possible he lowered his pitch and answered simply because i wanted to do something for you  suppose you had fallen said miss garland  i believed i would not fall and you believed it i think  i believed nothing i simply trusted you as you asked me  quod erat demonstrandum cried rowland i think you know latin  when our four friends were established in what i have called their grassy valley there was a good deal of scrambling over slopes both grassy and stony a good deal of flowerplucking on narrow ledges a great many long walks and thanks to the lucid mountain air not a little exhilaration mrs hudson was obliged to intermit her suspicions of the deleterious atmosphere of the old world and to acknowledge the edifying purity of the breezes of engelthal she was certainly more placid than she had been in italy having always lived in the country she had missed in rome and florence that social solitude mitigated by bushes and rocks which is so dear to the true new england temperament the little unpainted inn at engelthal with its plank partitions its milkpans standing in the sun its help in the form of angular young women of the countryside reminded her of places of summer sojourn in her native land and the beautiful historic chambers of the villa pandolfini passed from her memory without a regret and without having in the least modified her ideal of domiciliary grace roderick had changed his sky but he had not changed his mind his humor was still that of which he had given rowland a glimpse in that tragic explosion on the lake of como he kept his despair to himself and he went doggedly about the ordinary business of life but it was easy to see that his spirit was mortally heavy and that he lived and moved and talked simply from the force of habit in that sad halfhour among the italian olives there had been such a fierce sincerity in his tone that rowland began to abdicate the critical attitude he began to feel that it was essentially vain to appeal to the poor fellows will there was no will left its place was an impotent void this view of the case indeed was occasionally contravened by certain indications on rodericks part of the power of resistance to disagreeable obligations one might still have said if one had been disposed to be didactic at any hazard that there was a method in his madness that his moral energy had its sleeping and its waking hours and that in a cause that pleased it it was capable of rising with the dawn but on the other hand pleasure in this case was quite at one with effort evidently the greatest bliss in life for roderick would have been to have a plastic idea and then it was impossible not to feel tenderly to a despair which had so ceased to be aggressivenot to forgive a great deal of apathy to a temper which had so unlearned its irritability roderick said frankly that switzerland made him less miserable than italy and the alps seemed less to mock at his enforced leisure than the apennines he indulged in long rambles generally alone and was very fond of climbing into dizzy places where no sound could overtake him and there flinging himself on the nevertrodden moss of pulling his hat over his eyes and lounging away the hours in perfect immobility rowland sometimes walked with him though roderick never invited him he seemed duly grateful for his society rowland now made it a rule to treat him like a perfectly sane man to assume that all things were well with him and never to allude to the prosperity he had forfeited or to the work he was not doing he would have still said had you questioned him that rodericks condition was a moodcertainly a puzzling one it might last yet for many a weary hour but it was a long lane that had no turning rodericks blues would not last forever rowlands interest in miss garlands relations with her cousin was still profoundly attentive and perplexed as he was on all sides he found nothing transparent here after their arrival at engelthal roderick appeared to seek the young girls society more than he had done hitherto and this revival of ardor could not fail to set his friend awondering they sat together and strolled together and miss garland often read aloud to him one day on their coming to dinner after he had been lying half the morning at her feet in the shadow of a rock rowland asked him what she had been reading  i dont know roderick said i dont heed the sense miss garland heard this and rowland looked at her she looked at roderick sharply and with a little blush i listen to mary roderick continued for the sake of her voice it s distractingly sweet at this miss garlands blush deepened and she looked away  rowland in florence as we know had suffered his imagination to wander in the direction of certain conjectures which the reader may deem unflattering to miss garlands constancy he had asked himself whether her faith in roderick had not faltered and that demand of hers which had brought about his own departure for switzerland had seemed almost equivalent to a confession that she needed his help to believe rowland was essentially a modest man and he did not risk the supposition that miss garland had contrasted him with roderick to his own advantage but he had a certain consciousness of duty resolutely done which allowed itself to fancy at moments that it might be not illogically rewarded by the bestowal of such stray grains of enthusiasm as had crumbled away from her estimate of his companion if some day she had declared in a sudden burst of passion that she was outwearied and sickened and that she gave up her recreant lover rowlands expectation would have gone halfway to meet her and certainly if her passion had taken this course no generous critic would utterly condemn her she had been neglected ignored forsaken treated with a contempt which no girl of a fine temper could endure there were girls indeed whose fineness like that of burd helen in the ballad lay in clinging to the man of their love through thick and thin and in bowing their head to all hard usage this attitude had often an exquisite beauty of its own but rowland deemed that he had solid reason to believe it never could be mary garlands she was not a passive creature she was not soft and meek and grateful for chance bounties with all her reserve of manner she was proud and eager she asked much and she wanted what she asked she believed in fine things and she never could long persuade herself that fine things missed were as beautiful as fine things achieved once rowland passed an angry day he had dreamedit was the most insubstantial of dreamsthat she had given him the right to believe that she looked to him to transmute her discontent and yet here she was throwing herself back into rodericks arms at his lightest overture and playing with his own half fearful half shameful hopes rowland declared to himself that his position was essentially detestable and that all the philosophy he could bring to bear upon it would make it neither honorable nor comfortable he would go away and make an end of it he did not go away he simply took a long walk stayed away from the inn all day and on his return found miss garland sitting out in the moonlight with roderick  rowland communing with himself during the restless ramble in question had determined that he would at least cease to observe to heed or to care for what miss garland and roderick might do or might not do together nevertheless some three days afterward the opportunity presenting itself he deliberately broached the subject with roderick he knew this was inconsistent and fainthearted it was indulgence to the fingers that itched to handle forbidden fruit but he said to himself that it was really more logical to be inconsistent than the reverse for they had formerly discussed these mysteries very candidly was it not perfectly reasonable that he should wish to know the sequel of the situation which roderick had then delineated roderick had made him promises and it was to be expected that he should ascertain how the promises had been kept rowland could not say to himself that if the promises had been extorted for mary garlands sake his present attention to them was equally disinterested and so he had to admit that he was indeed fainthearted he may perhaps be deemed too narrow a casuist but we have repeated more than once that he was solidly burdened with a conscience  i imagine he said to roderick that you are not sorry at present to have allowed yourself to be dissuaded from making a final rupture with miss garland  roderick eyed him with the vague and absent look which had lately become habitual to his face and repeated dissuaded  dont you remember that in rome you wished to break your engagement and that i urged you to respect it though it seemed to hang by so slender a thread i wished you to see what would come of it if i am not mistaken you are reconciled to it  oh yes said roderick i remember what you said you made it a kind of personal favor to yourself that i should remain faithful i consented but afterwards when i thought of it your attitude greatly amused me had it ever been seen beforea man asking another man to gratify him by not suspending his attentions to a pretty girl  it was as selfish as anything else said rowland one man puts his selfishness into one thing and one into another it would have utterly marred my comfort to see miss garland in low spirits  but you liked heryou admired her eh so you intimated  i admire her profoundly  it was your originality thento do you justice you have a great deal of a certain sortto wish her happiness secured in just that fashion many a man would have liked better himself to make the woman he admired happy and would have welcomed her low spirits as an opening for sympathy you were awfully queer about it  so be it said rowland the question is are you not glad i was queer are you not finding that your affection for miss garland has a permanent quality which you rather underestimated  i dont pretend to say when she arrived in rome i found i did nt care for her and i honestly proposed that we should have no humbug about it if you on the contrary thought there was something to be gained by having a little humbug i was willing to try it i dont see that the situation is really changed mary garland is all that she ever wasmore than all but i dont care for her i dont care for anything and i dont find myself inspired to make an exception in her favor the only difference is that i dont care now whether i care for her or not of course marrying such a useless lout as i am is out of the question for any woman and i should pay miss garland a poor compliment to assume that she is in a hurry to celebrate our nuptials  oh you re in love said rowland not very logically it must be confessed at any cost that this assertion was made for the sole purpose of hearing roderick deny it  but it quite failed of its aim roderick gave a liberal shrug of his shoulders and an irresponsible toss of his head call it what you please i am past caring for names  rowland had not only been illogical he had also been slightly disingenuous he did not believe that his companion was in love he had argued the false to learn the true the true was that roderick was again in some degree under a charm and that he found a healing virtue in marys presence indisposed though he was to admit it he had said shortly before that her voice was sweet to his ear and this was a promising beginning if her voice was sweet it was probable that her glance was not amiss that her touch had a quiet magic and that her whole personal presence had learned the art of not being irritating so rowland reasoned and invested mary garland with a still finer loveliness  it was true that she herself helped him little to definite conclusions and that he remained in puzzled doubt as to whether these happy touches were still a matter of the heart or had become simply a matter of the conscience he watched for signs that she rejoiced in rodericks renewed acceptance of her society but it seemed to him that she was on her guard against interpreting it too largely it was now her turnhe fancied that he sometimes gathered from certain nameless indications of glance and tone and gestureit was now her turn to be indifferent to care for other things again and again rowland asked himself what these things were that miss garland might be supposed to care for to the injury of ideal constancy and again having designated them he divided them into two portions one was that larger experience in general which had come to her with her arrival in europe the vague sense borne in upon her imagination that there were more things one might do with ones life than youth and ignorance and northampton had dreamt of the revision of old pledges in the light of new emotions the other was the experience in especial of rowlandswhat here rowland always paused in perfect sincerity to measure afresh his possible claim to the young girls regard what might he call it it had been more than civility and yet it had been less than devotion it had spoken of a desire to serve but it had said nothing of a hope of reward nevertheless rowlands fancy hovered about the idea that it was recompensable and his reflections ended in a reverie which perhaps did not define it but at least on each occasion added a little to its volume since miss garland had asked him as a sort of favor to herself to come also to switzerland he thought it possible she might let him know whether he seemed to have effectively served her the days passed without her doing so and at last rowland walked away to an isolated eminence some five miles from the inn and murmured to the silent rocks that she was ungrateful listening nature seemed not to contradict him so that on the morrow he asked the young girl with an infinitesimal touch of irony whether it struck her that his deflection from his florentine plan had been attended with brilliant results  why we are delighted that you are with us she answered  he was anything but satisfied with this it seemed to imply that she had forgotten that she had solemnly asked him to come he reminded her of her request and recalled the place and time that evening on the terrace late after mrs hudson had gone to bed and roderick being absent  she perfectly remembered but the memory seemed to trouble her i am afraid your kindness has been a great charge upon you she said you wanted very much to do something else  i wanted above all things to oblige you and i made no sacrifice but if i had made an immense one it would be more than made up to me by any assurance that i have helped roderick into a better mood  she was silent a moment and then why do you ask me she said you are able to judge quite as well as i  rowland blushed he desired to justify himself in the most veracious manner the truth is he said that i am afraid i care only in the second place for rodericks holding up his head what i care for in the first place is your happiness  i dont know why that should be she answered i have certainly done nothing to make you so much my friend if you were to tell me you intended to leave us tomorrow i am afraid that i should not venture to ask you to stay but whether you go or stay let us not talk of roderick  but that said rowland does nt answer my question is he better  no she said and turned away  he was careful not to tell her that he intended to leave them one day shortly after this as the two young men sat at the inndoor watching the sunset which on that evening was very striking and lurid rowland made an attempt to sound his companions present sentiment touching christina light i wonder where she is he said and what sort of a life she is leading her prince  roderick at first made no response he was watching a figure on the summit of some distant rocks opposite to them the figure was apparently descending into the valley and in relief against the crimson screen of the western sky it looked gigantic christina light roderick at last repeated as if arousing himself from a reverie where she is it s extraordinary how little i care  have you then completely got over it  to this roderick made no direct reply he sat brooding a while she s a humbug he presently exclaimed  possibly said rowland but i have known worse ones  she disappointed me roderick continued in the same tone  had she then really given you hopes  oh dont recall it roderick cried why the devil should i think of it it was only three months ago but it seems like ten years his friend said nothing more and after a while he went on of his own accord i believed there was a future in it all she pleased mepleased me and when an artistsuch as i wasis pleased you know and he paused again you never saw her as i did you never heard her in her great moments but there is no use talking about that at first she would nt regard me seriously she chaffed me and made light of me but at last i forced her to admit i was a great man think of that sir christina light called me a great man a great man was what she was looking for and we agreed to find our happiness for life in each other to please me she promised not to marry till i gave her leave i was not in a marrying way myself but it was damnation to think of another man possessing her to spare my sensibilities she promised to turn off her prince and the idea of her doing so made me as happy as to see a perfect statue shaping itself in the block you have seen how she kept her promise when i learned it it was as if the statue had suddenly cracked and turned hideous she died for me like that and he snapped his fingers was it wounded vanity disappointed desire betrayed confidence i am sure i dont know you certainly have some name for it  the poor girl did the best she could said rowland  if that was her best so much the worse for her i have hardly thought of her these two months but i have not forgiven her  well you may believe that you are avenged i cant think of her as happy  i dont pity her said roderick then he relapsed into silence and the two sat watching the colossal figure as it made its way downward along the jagged silhouette of the rocks who is this mighty man cried roderick at last and what is he coming down upon us for we are small people here and we cant undertake to keep company with giants  wait till we meet him on our own level said rowland and perhaps he will not overtop us  for ten minutes at least roderick rejoined he will have been a great man at this moment the figure sank beneath the horizon line and became invisible in the uncertain light suddenly roderick said i would like to see her once moresimply to look at her  i would not advise it said rowland  it was her beauty that did it roderick went on it was all her beauty in comparison the rest was nothing what befooled me was to think of it as my property and i had made it mineno one else had studied it as i had no one else understood it what does that stick of a casamassima know about it at this hour i should like to see it just once more it s the only thing in the world of which i can say so  i would not advise it rowland repeated  that s right dear rowland said roderick dont advise that s no use now  the dusk meanwhile had thickened and they had not perceived a figure approaching them across the open space in front of the house suddenly it stepped into the circle of light projected from the door and windows and they beheld little sam singleton stopping to stare at them he was the giant whom they had seen descending along the rocks when this was made apparent roderick was seized with a fit of intense hilarityit was the first time he had laughed in three months singleton who carried a knapsack and walkingstaff received from rowland the friendliest welcome he was in the serenest possible humor and if in the way of luggage his knapsack contained nothing but a comb and a second shirt he produced from it a dozen admirable sketches he had been trudging over half switzerland and making everywhere the most vivid pictorial notes they were mostly in a box at interlaken and in gratitude for rowlands appreciation he presently telegraphed for his box which according to the excellent swiss method was punctually delivered by post the nights were cold and our friends with three or four other chance sojourners sat indoors over a fire of logs even with roderick sitting moodily in the outer shadow they made a sympathetic little circle and they turned over singletons drawings while he perched in the chimneycorner blushing and grinning with his feet on the rounds of his chair he had been pedestrianizing for six weeks and he was glad to rest awhile at engelthal it was an economic repose however for he sallied forth every morning with his sketching tools on his back in search of material for new studies rodericks hilarity after the first evening had subsided and he watched the little painters serene activity with a gravity that was almost portentous singleton who was not in the secret of his personal misfortunes still treated him with timid frankness as the rising star of american art roderick had said to rowland at first that singleton reminded him of some curious little insect with a remarkable mechanical instinct in its antennae but as the days went by it was apparent that the modest landscapists unflagging industry grew to have an oppressive meaning for him it pointed a moral and roderick used to sit and con the moral as he saw it figured in singletons bent back on the hot hillsides protruding from beneath his white umbrella one day he wandered up a long slope and overtook him as he sat at work singleton related the incident afterwards to rowland who after giving him in rome a hint of rodericks aberrations had strictly kept his own counsel  are you always like this said roderick in almost sepulchral accents  like this repeated singleton blinking confusedly with an alarmed conscience  you remind me of a watch that never runs down if one listens hard one hears you alwaystictic tictic  oh i see said singleton beaming ingenuously i am very equable  you are very equable yes and do you find it pleasant to be equable  singleton turned and grinned more brightly while he sucked the water from his camelshair brush then with a quickened sense of his indebtedness to a providence that had endowed him with intrinsic facilities oh delightful he exclaimed  roderick stood looking at him a moment damnation he said at last solemnly and turned his back  one morning shortly after this rowland and roderick took a long walk they had walked before in a dozen different directions but they had not yet crossed a charming little wooded pass which shut in their valley on one side and descended into the vale of engelberg in coming from lucerne they had approached their inn by this path and feeling that they knew it had hitherto neglected it in favor of untrodden ways but at last the list of these was exhausted and rowland proposed the walk to engelberg as a novelty the place is half bleak and half pastoral a huge white monastery rises abruptly from the green floor of the valley and complicates its picturesqueness with an element rare in swiss scenery hard by is a group of chalets and inns with the usual appurtenances of a prosperous swiss resortlean brown guides in baggy homespun lounging under carved wooden galleries stacks of alpenstocks in every doorway sunscorched englishmen without shirtcollars our two friends sat a while at the door of an inn discussing a pint of wine and then roderick who was indefatigable announced his intention of climbing to a certain rocky pinnacle which overhung the valley and according to the testimony of one of the guides commanded a view of the lake of lucerne to go and come back was only a matter of an hour but rowland with the prospect of his homeward trudge before him confessed to a preference for lounging on his bench or at most strolling a trifle farther and taking a look at the monastery roderick went off alone and his companion after a while bent his steps to the monasterial church it was remarkable like most of the churches of catholic switzerland for a hideous style of devotional ornament but it had a certain cold and musty picturesqueness and rowland lingered there with some tenderness for alpine piety while he was near the highaltar some people came in at the west door but he did not notice them and was presently engaged in deciphering a curious old german epitaph on one of the mural tablets at last he turned away wondering whether its syntax or its theology was the more uncomfortable and to this infinite surprise found himself confronted with the prince and princess casamassima  the surprise on christinas part for an instant was equal and at first she seemed disposed to turn away without letting it give place to a greeting the prince however saluted gravely and then christina in silence put out her hand rowland immediately asked whether they were staying at engelberg but christina only looked at him without speaking the prince answered his questions and related that they had been making a months tour in switzerland that at lucerne his wife had been somewhat obstinately indisposed and that the physician had recommended a weeks trial of the tonic air and goats milk of engelberg the scenery said the prince was stupendous but the life was terribly sadand they had three days more it was a blessing he urbanely added to see a good roman face  christinas attitude her solemn silence and her penetrating gaze seemed to rowland at first to savor of affectation but he presently perceived that she was profoundly agitated and that she was afraid of betraying herself do let us leave this hideous edifice she said there are things here that set ones teeth on edge they moved slowly to the door and when they stood outside in the sunny coolness of the valley she turned to rowland and said i am extremely glad to see you then she glanced about her and observed against the wall of the church an old stone seat she looked at prince casamassima a moment and he smiled more intensely rowland thought than the occasion demanded i wish to sit here she said and speak to mr malletalone  at your pleasure dear friend said the prince  the tone of each was measured to rowlands ear but that of christina was dry and that of her husband was splendidly urbane rowland remembered that the cavaliere giacosa had told him that mrs lights candidate was thoroughly a prince and our friend wondered how he relished a peremptory accent casamassima was an italian of the undemonstrative type but rowland nevertheless divined that like other princes before him he had made the acquaintance of the thing called compromise shall i come back he asked with the same smile  in half an hour said christina  in the clear outer light rowlands first impression of her was that she was more beautiful than ever and yet in three months she could hardly have changed the change was in rowlands own vision of her which that last interview on the eve of her marriage had made unprecedentedly tender  how came you here she asked are you staying in this place  i am staying at engelthal some ten miles away i walked over  are you alone  i am with mr hudson  is he here with you  he went half an hour ago to climb a rock for a view  and his mother and that young girl where are they  they also are at engelthal  what do you do there  what do you do here said rowland smiling  i count the minutes till my week is up i hate mountains they depress me to death i am sure miss garland likes them  she is very fond of them i believe  you believedont you know but i have given up trying to imitate miss garland said christina  you surely need imitate no one  dont say that she said gravely so you have walked ten miles this morning and you are to walk back again  back again to supper  and mr hudson too  mr hudson especially he is a great walker  you men are happy christina cried i believe i should enjoy the mountains if i could do such things it is sitting still and having them scowl down at you prince casamassina never rides he only goes on a mule he was carried up the faulhorn on a litter  on a litter said rowland  in one of those machinesa chaise a porteurslike a woman  rowland received this information in silence it was equally unbecoming to either relish or deprecate its irony  is mr hudson to join you again will he come here christina asked  i shall soon begin to expect him  what shall you do when you leave switzerland christina continued shall you go back to rome  i rather doubt it my plans are very uncertain  they depend upon mr hudson eh  in a great measure  i want you to tell me about him is he still in that perverse state of mind that afflicted you so much  rowland looked at her mistrustfully without answering he was indisposed instinctively to tell her that roderick was unhappy it was possible she might offer to help him back to happiness she immediately perceived his hesitation  i see no reason why we should not be frank she said i should think we were excellently placed for that sort of thing you remember that formerly i cared very little what i said dont you well i care absolutely not at all now i say what i please i do what i please how did mr hudson receive the news of my marriage  very badly said rowland  with rage and reproaches and as rowland hesitated againwith silent contempt  i can tell you but little he spoke to me on the subject but i stopped him i told him it was none of his business or of mine  that was an excellent answer said christina softly yet it was a little your business after those sublime protestations i treated you to i was really very fine that morning eh  you do yourself injustice said rowland i should be at liberty now to believe you were insincere  what does it matter now whether i was insincere or not i cant conceive of anything mattering less i was very fineis nt it true  you know what i think of you said rowland and for fear of being forced to betray his suspicion of the cause of her change he took refuge in a commonplace your mother i hope is well  my mother is in the enjoyment of superb health and may be seen every evening at the casino at the baths of lucca confiding to every newcomer that she has married her daughter to a pearl of a prince  rowland was anxious for news of mrs lights companion and the natural course was frankly to inquire about him and the cavaliere giacosa is well he asked  christina hesitated but she betrayed no other embarrassment the cavaliere has retired to his native city of ancona upon a pension for the rest of his natural life he is a very good old man  i have a great regard for him said rowland gravely at the same time that he privately wondered whether the cavalieres pension was paid by prince casamassima for services rendered in connection with his marriage had the cavaliere received his commission and what do you do rowland continued on leaving this place  we go to italywe go to naples she rose and stood silent a moment looking down the valley the figure of prince casamassima appeared in the distance balancing his white umbrella as her eyes rested upon it rowland imagined that he saw something deeper in the strange expression which had lurked in her face while he talked to her at first he had been dazzled by her blooming beauty to which the lapse of weeks had only added splendor then he had seen a heavier ray in the light of her eyea sinister intimation of sadness and bitterness it was the outward mark of her sacrificed ideal her eyes grew cold as she looked at her husband and when after a moment she turned them upon rowland they struck him as intensely tragical he felt a singular mixture of sympathy and dread he wished to give her a proof of friendship and yet it seemed to him that she had now turned her face in a direction where friendship was impotent to interpose she half read his feelings apparently and she gave a beautiful sad smile i hope we may never meet again she said and as rowland gave her a protesting lookyou have seen me at my best i wish to tell you solemnly i was sincere i know appearances are against me she went on quickly there is a great deal i cant tell you perhaps you have guessed it i care very little you know at any rate i did my best it would nt serve i was beaten and broken they were stronger than i now it s another affair  it seems to me you have a large chance for happiness yet said rowland vaguely  happiness i mean to cultivate rapture i mean to go in for bliss ineffable you remember i told you that i was in part the worlds and the devils now they have taken me all it was their choice may they never repent  i shall hear of you said rowland  you will hear of me and whatever you do hear remember this i was sincere  prince casamassima had approached and rowland looked at him with a good deal of simple compassion as a part of that world against which christina had launched her mysterious menace it was obvious that he was a good fellow and that he could not in the nature of things be a positively bad husband but his distinguished inoffensiveness only deepened the infelicity of christinas situation by depriving her defiant attitude of the sanction of relative justice so long as she had been free to choose she had esteemed him but from the moment she was forced to marry him she had detested him rowland read in the young mans elastic italian mask a profound consciousness of all this and as he found there also a record of other curious thingsof pride of temper of bigotry of an immense heritage of more or less aggressive traditionshe reflected that the matrimonial conjunction of his two companions might be sufficiently prolific in incident  you are going to naples rowland said to the prince by way of conversation  we are going to paris christina interposed slowly and softly we are going to london we are going to vienna we are going to st petersburg  prince casamassima dropped his eyes and fretted the earth with the point of his umbrella while he engaged rowlands attention christina turned away when rowland glanced at her again he saw a change pass over her face she was observing something that was concealed from his own eyes by the angle of the churchwall in a moment roderick stepped into sight  he stopped short astonished his face and figure were jaded his garments dusty he looked at christina from head to foot and then slowly his cheek flushed and his eye expanded christina returned his gaze and for some moments there was a singular silence you dont look well christina said at last  roderick answered nothing he only looked and looked as if she had been a statue you are no less beautiful he presently cried  she turned away with a smile and stood a while gazing down the valley roderick stared at prince casamassima christina then put out her hand to rowland farewell she said if you are near me in future dont try to see me and then after a pause in a lower tone i was sincere she addressed herself again to roderick and asked him some commonplace about his walk but he said nothing he only looked at her rowland at first had expected an outbreak of reproach but it was evident that the danger was every moment diminishing he was forgetting everything but her beauty and as she stood there and let him feast upon it rowland was sure that she knew it i wont say farewell to you she said we shall meet again and she moved gravely away prince casamassima took leave courteously of rowland upon roderick he bestowed a bow of exaggerated civility roderick appeared not to see it he was still watching christina as she passed over the grass his eyes followed her until she reached the door of her inn here she stopped and looked back at him       chapter xiii switzerland  on the homeward walk that evening roderick preserved a silence which rowland allowed to make him uneasy early on the morrow roderick saying nothing of his intentions started off on a walk rowland saw him striding with light steps along the rugged path to engelberg he was absent all day and he gave no account of himself on his return he said he was deadly tired and he went to bed early when he had left the room miss garland drew near to rowland  i wish to ask you a question she said what happened to roderick yesterday at engelberg  you have discovered that something happened rowland answered  i am sure of it was it something painful  i dont know how at the present moment he judges it he met the princess casamassima  thank you said miss garland simply and turned away  the conversation had been brief but like many small things it furnished rowland with food for reflection when one is looking for symptoms one easily finds them this was the first time mary garland had asked rowland a question which it was in rodericks power to answer the first time she had frankly betrayed rodericks reticence rowland ventured to think it marked an era  the next morning was sultry and the air usually so fresh at those altitudes was oppressively heavy rowland lounged on the grass a while near singleton who was at work under his white umbrella within view of the house and then in quest of coolness he wandered away to the rocky ridge whence you looked across at the jungfrau today however the white summits were invisible their heads were muffled in sullen clouds and the valleys beneath them curtained in duncolored mist rowland had a book in his pocket and he took it out and opened it but his page remained unturned his own thoughts were more importunate his interview with christina light had made a great impression upon him and he was haunted with the memory of her almost blameless bitterness and of all that was tragic and fatal in her latest transformation these things were immensely appealing and rowland thought with infinite impatience of rodericks having again encountered them it required little imagination to apprehend that the young sculptors condition had also appealed to christina his consummate indifference his supreme defiance would make him a magnificent trophy and christina had announced with sufficient distinctness that she had said goodby to scruples it was her fancy at present to treat the world as a garden of pleasure and if hitherto she had played with rodericks passion on its stem there was little doubt that now she would pluck it with an unfaltering hand and drain it of its acrid sweetness and why the deuce need roderick have gone marching back to destruction rowlands meditations even when they began in rancor often brought him peace but on this occasion they ushered in a quite peculiar quality of unrest he felt conscious of a sudden collapse in his moral energy a current that had been flowing for two years with liquid strength seemed at last to pause and evaporate rowland looked away at the stagnant vapors on the mountains their dreariness seemed a symbol of the dreariness which his own generosity had bequeathed him at last he had arrived at the uttermost limit of the deference a sane man might pay to other peoples folly nay rather he had transgressed it he had been befooled on a gigantic scale he turned to his book and tried to woo back patience but it gave him cold comfort and he tossed it angrily away he pulled his hat over his eyes and tried to wonder dispassionately whether atmospheric conditions had not something to do with his illhumor he remained for some time in this attitude but was finally aroused from it by a singular sense that although he had heard nothing some one had approached him he looked up and saw roderick standing before him on the turf his mood made the spectacle unwelcome and for a moment he felt like uttering an uncivil speech roderick stood looking at him with an expression of countenance which had of late become rare there was an unfamiliar spark in his eye and a certain imperious alertness in his carriage confirmed habit with rowland came speedily to the front what is it now he asked himself and invited roderick to sit down roderick had evidently something particular to say and if he remained silent for a time it was not because he was ashamed of it  i would like you to do me a favor he said at last lend me some money  how much do you wish rowland asked  say a thousand francs  rowland hesitated a moment i dont wish to be indiscreet but may i ask what you propose to do with a thousand francs  to go to interlaken  and why are you going to interlaken  roderick replied without a shadow of wavering because that woman is to be there  rowland burst out laughing but roderick remained serenely grave you have forgiven her then said rowland  not a bit of it  i dont understand  neither do i i only know that she is incomparably beautiful and that she has waked me up amazingly besides she asked me to come  she asked you  yesterday in so many words  ah the jade  exactly i am willing to take her for that  why in the name of common sense did you go back to her  why did i find her standing there like a goddess who had just stepped out of her cloud why did i look at her before i knew where i was the harm was done  rowland who had been sitting erect threw himself back on the grass and lay for some time staring up at the sky at last raising himself are you perfectly serious he asked  deadly serious  your idea is to remain at interlaken some time  indefinitely said roderick and it seemed to his companion that the tone in which he said this made it immensely well worth hearing  and your mother and cousin meanwhile are to remain here it will soon be getting very cold you know  it does nt seem much like it today  very true but today is a day by itself  there is nothing to prevent their going back to lucerne i depend upon your taking charge of them  at this rowland reclined upon the grass again and again after reflection he faced his friend how would you express he asked the character of the profit that you expect to derive from your excursion  i see no need of expressing it the proof of the pudding is in the eating the case is simply this i desire immensely to be near christina light and it is such a huge refreshment to find myself again desiring something that i propose to drift with the current as i say she has waked me up and it is possible something may come of it she makes me feel as if i were alive again this and he glanced down at the inn i call death  that i am very grateful to hear you really feel as if you might do something  dont ask too much i only know that she makes my heart beat makes me see visions  you feel encouraged  i feel excited  you are really looking better  i am glad to hear it now that i have answered your questions please to give me the money  rowland shook his head for that purpose i cant  you cant  it s impossible your plan is rank folly i cant help you in it  roderick flushed a little and his eye expanded i will borrow what money i can then from mary this was not viciously said it had simply the ring of passionate resolution  instantly it brought rowland to terms he took a bunch of keys from his pocket and tossed it upon the grass the little brass one opens my dressingcase he said you will find money in it  roderick let the keys lie something seemed to have struck him he looked askance at his friend you are awfully gallant  you certainly are not your proposal is an outrage  very likely it s a proof the more of my desire  if you have so much steam on then use it for something else you say you are awake again i am delighted only be so in the best sense is nt it very plain if you have the energy to desire you have also the energy to reason and to judge if you can care to go you can also care to stay and staying being the more profitable course the inspiration on that side for a man who has his selfconfidence to win back again should be greater  roderick plainly did not relish this simple logic and his eye grew angry as he listened to its echo oh the devil he cried  rowland went on do you believe that hanging about christina light will do you any good do you believe it wont in either case you should keep away from her if it wont it s your duty and if it will you can get on without it  do me good cried roderick what do i want of goodwhat should i do with good i want what she gives me call it by what name you will i want to ask no questions but to take what comes and let it fill the impossible hours but i did nt come to discuss the matter  i have not the least desire to discuss it said rowland i simply protest  roderick meditated a moment i have never yet thought twice of accepting a favor of you he said at last but this one sticks in my throat  it is not a favor i lend you the money only under compulsion  well then i will take it only under compulsion roderick exclaimed and he sprang up abruptly and marched away  his words were ambiguous rowland lay on the grass wondering what they meant half an hour had not elapsed before roderick reappeared heated with rapid walking and wiping his forehead he flung himself down and looked at his friend with an eye which expressed something purer than bravado and yet baser than conviction  i have done my best he said my mother is out of money she is expecting next week some circular notes from london she had only ten francs in her pocket mary garland gave me every sou she possessed in the world it makes exactly thirtyfour francs that s not enough  you asked miss garland cried rowland  i asked her  and told her your purpose  i named no names but she knew  what did she say  not a syllable she simply emptied her purse  rowland turned over and buried his face in his arms he felt a movement of irrepressible elation and he barely stifled a cry of joy now surely roderick had shattered the last link in the chain that bound mary to him and after this she would be free when he turned about again roderick was still sitting there and he had not touched the keys which lay on the grass  i dont know what is the matter with me said roderick but i have an insurmountable aversion to taking your money  the matter i suppose is that you have a grain of wisdom left  no it s not that it s a kind of brute instinct i find it extremely provoking he sat there for some time with his head in his hands and his eyes on the ground his lips were compressed and he was evidently in fact in a state of profound irritation you have succeeded in making this thing excessively unpleasant he exclaimed  i am sorry said rowland but i cant see it in any other way  that i believe and i resent the range of your vision pretending to be the limit of my action you cant feel for me nor judge for me and there are certain things you know nothing about i have suffered sir roderick went on with increasing emphasis i have suffered damnable torments have i been such a placid contented comfortable man this last six months that when i find a chance to forget my misery i should take such pains not to profit by it you ask too much for a man who himself has no occasion to play the hero i dont say that invidiously it s your disposition and you cant help it but decidedly there are certain things you know nothing about  rowland listened to this outbreak with open eyes and roderick if he had been less intent upon his own eloquence would probably have perceived that he turned pale these thingswhat are they rowland asked  they are women principally and what relates to women women for you by what i can make out mean nothing you have no imaginationno sensibility  that s a serious charge said rowland gravely  i dont make it without proof  and what is your proof  roderick hesitated a moment the way you treated christina light i call that grossly obtuse  obtuse rowland repeated frowning  thickskinned beneath your good fortune  my good fortune  there it isit s all news to you you had pleased her i dont say she was dying of love for you but she took a fancy to you  we will let this pass said rowland after a silence  oh i dont insist i have only her own word for it  she told you this  you noticed at least i suppose that she was not afraid to speak i never repeated it not because i was jealous but because i was curious to see how long your ignorance would last if left to itself  i frankly confess it would have lasted forever and yet i dont consider that my insensibility is proved  oh dont say that cried roderick or i shall begin to suspectwhat i must do you the justice to say that i never have suspectedthat you are a trifle conceited upon my word when i think of all this your protest as you call it against my following christina light seems to me thoroughly offensive there is something monstrous in a mans pretending to lay down the law to a sort of emotion with which he is quite unacquaintedin his asking a fellow to give up a lovely woman for conscience sake when he has never had the impulse to strike a blow for one for passions  oh oh cried rowland  all that s very easy to say roderick went on but you must remember that there are such things as nerves and senses and imagination and a restless demon within that may sleep sometimes for a day or for six months but that sooner or later wakes up and thumps at your ribs till you listen to him if you cant understand it take it on trust and let a poor imaginative devil live his life as he can  rodericks words seemed at first to rowland like something heard in a dream it was impossible they had been actually spokenso supreme an expression were they of the insolence of egotism reality was never so consistent as that but roderick sat there balancing his beautiful head and the echoes of his strident accent still lingered along the halfmuffled mountainside rowland suddenly felt that the cup of his chagrin was full to overflowing and his longgathered bitterness surged into the simple wholesome passion of anger for wasted kindness but he spoke without violence and roderick was probably at first far from measuring the force that lay beneath his words  you are incredibly ungrateful he said you are talking arrogant nonsense what do you know about my sensibilities and my imagination how do you know whether i have loved or suffered if i have held my tongue and not troubled you with my complaints you find it the most natural thing in the world to put an ignoble construction on my silence i loved quite as well as you indeed i think i may say rather better i have been constant i have been willing to give more than i received i have not forsaken one mistress because i thought another more beautiful nor given up the other and believed all manner of evil about her because i had not my way with her i have been a good friend to christina light and it seems to me my friendship does her quite as much honor as your love  your loveyour sufferingyour silenceyour friendship cried roderick i declare i dont understand  i dare say not you are not used to understanding such thingsyou are not used to hearing me talk of my feelings you are altogether too much taken up with your own be as much so as you please i have always respected your right only when i have kept myself in durance on purpose to leave you an open field dont by way of thanking me come and call me an idiot  oh you claim then that you have made sacrifices  several you have never suspected it  if i had do you suppose i would have allowed it cried roderick  they were the sacrifices of friendship and they were easily made only i dont enjoy having them thrown back in my teeth  this was under the circumstances a sufficiently generous speech but roderick was not in the humor to take it generously come be more definite he said let me know where it is the shoe has pinched  rowland frowned if roderick would not take generosity he should have full justice it s a perpetual sacrifice he said to live with a perfect egotist  i am an egotist cried roderick  did it never occur to you  an egotist to whom you have made perpetual sacrifices he repeated the words in a singular tone a tone that denoted neither exactly indignation nor incredulity but strange as it may seem a sudden violent curiosity for news about himself  you are selfish said rowland you think only of yourself and believe only in yourself you regard other people only as they play into your own hands you have always been very frank about it and the thing seemed so mixed up with the temper of your genius and the very structure of your mind that often one was willing to take the evil with the good and to be thankful that considering your great talent you were no worse but if one believed in you as i have done one paid a tax upon it  roderick leaned his elbows on his knees clasped his hands together and crossed them shadewise over his eyes in this attitude for a moment he sat looking coldly at his friend so i have made you very uncomfortable he went on  extremely so  i have been eager grasping obstinate vain ungrateful indifferent cruel  i have accused you mentally of all these things with the exception of vanity  you have often hated me  never i should have parted company with you before coming to that  but you have wanted to part company to bid me go my way and be hanged  repeatedly then i have had patience and forgiven you  forgiven me eh suffering all the while  yes you may call it suffering  why did you never tell me all this before  because my affection was always stronger than my resentment because i preferred to err on the side of kindness because i had myself in a measure launched you in the world and thrown you into temptations and because nothing short of your unwarrantable aggression just now could have made me say these painful things  roderick picked up a blade of long grass and began to bite it rowland was puzzled by his expression and manner they seemed strangely cynical there was something revolting in his deepening calmness i must have been hideous roderick presently resumed  i am not talking for your entertainment said rowland  of course not for my edification as roderick said these words there was not a ray of warmth in his brilliant eye  i have spoken for my own relief rowland went on and so that you need never again go so utterly astray as you have done this morning  it has been a terrible mistake then what his tone expressed was not willful mockery but a kind of persistent irresponsibility which rowland found equally exasperating he answered nothing  and all this time roderick continued you have been in love tell me the woman  rowland felt an immense desire to give him a visible palpable pang her name is mary garland he said  apparently he succeeded the surprise was great roderick colored as he had never done mary garland heaven forgive us  rowland observed the us roderick threw himself back on the turf the latter lay for some time staring at the sky at last he sprang to his feet and rowland rose also rejoicing keenly it must be confessed in his companions confusion  for how long has this been roderick demanded  since i first knew her  two years and you have never told her  never  you have told no one  you are the first person  why have you been silent  because of your engagement  but you have done your best to keep that up  that s another matter  it s very strange said roderick presently it s like something in a novel  we need nt expatiate on it said rowland all i wished to do was to rebut your charge that i am an abnormal being  but still roderick pondered all these months while i was going on i wish you had mentioned it  i acted as was necessary and that s the end of it  you have a very high opinion of her  the highest  i remember now your occasionally expressing it and my being struck with it but i never dreamed you were in love with her it s a pity she does nt care for you  rowland had made his point and he had no wish to prolong the conversation but he had a desire to hear more of this and he remained silent  you hope i suppose that some day she may  i should nt have offered to say so but since you ask me i do  i dont believe it she idolizes me and if she never were to see me again she would idolize my memory  this might be profound insight and it might be profound fatuity rowland turned away he could not trust himself to speak  my indifference my neglect of her must have seemed to you horrible altogether i must have appeared simply hideous  do you really care rowland asked what you appeared  certainly i have been damnably stupid is nt an artist supposed to be a man of perceptions i am hugely disgusted  well you understand now and we can start afresh  and yet said roderick though you have suffered in a degree i dont believe you have suffered so much as some other men would have done  very likely not in such matters quantitative analysis is difficult  roderick picked up his stick and stood looking at the ground nevertheless i must have seemed hideous he repeatedhideous he turned away scowling and rowland offered no contradiction  they were both silent for some time and at last roderick gave a heavy sigh and began to walk away where are you going rowland then asked  oh i dont care to walk you have given me something to think of this seemed a salutary impulse and yet rowland felt a nameless perplexity to have been so stupid damns me more than anything roderick went on certainly i can shut up shop now  rowland felt in no smiling humor and yet in spite of himself he could almost have smiled at the very consistency of the fellow it was egotism still aesthetic disgust at the graceless contour of his conduct but never a hint of simple sorrow for the pain he had given rowland let him go and for some moments stood watching him suddenly mallet became conscious of a singular and most illogical impulsea desire to stop him to have another word with himnot to lose sight of him he called him and roderick turned i should like to go with you said rowland  i am fit only to be alone i am damned  you had better not think of it at all rowland cried than think in that way  there is only one way i have been hideous and he broke off and marched away with his long elastic step swinging his stick rowland watched him and at the end of a moment called to him roderick stopped and looked at him in silence and then abruptly turned and disappeared below the crest of a hill  rowland passed the remainder of the day uncomfortably he was half irritated half depressed he had an insufferable feeling of having been placed in the wrong in spite of his excellent cause roderick did not come home to dinner but of this with his passion for brooding away the hours on faroff mountain sides he had almost made a habit mrs hudson appeared at the noonday repast with a face which showed that rodericks demand for money had unsealed the fountains of her distress little singleton consumed an enormous and wellearned dinner miss garland rowland observed had not contributed her scanty assistance to her kinsmans pursuit of the princess casamassima without an effort the effort was visible in her pale face and her silence she looked so ill that when they left the table rowland felt almost bound to remark upon it they had come out upon the grass in front of the inn  i have a headache she said and then suddenly looking about at the menacing sky and motionless air it s this horrible day  rowland that afternoon tried to write a letter to his cousin cecilia but his head and his heart were alike heavy and he traced upon the paper but a single line i believe there is such a thing as being too reasonable but when once the habit is formed what is one to do he had occasion to use his keys and he felt for them in his pocket they were missing and he remembered that he had left them lying on the hilltop where he had had his talk with roderick he went forth in search of them and found them where he had thrown them he flung himself down in the same place again he felt indisposed to walk he was conscious that his mood had vastly changed since the morning his extraordinary acute sense of his rights had been replaced by the familiar chronic sense of his duties only his duties now seemed impracticable he turned over and buried his face in his arms he lay so a long time thinking of many things the sum of them all was that roderick had beaten him at last he was startled by an extraordinary sound it took him a moment to perceive that it was a portentous growl of thunder he roused himself and saw that the whole face of the sky had altered the clouds that had hung motionless all day were moving from their stations and getting into position as it were for a battle the wind was rising the sallow vapors were turning dark and consolidating their masses it was a striking spectacle but rowland judged best to observe it briefly as a storm was evidently imminent he took his way down to the inn and found singleton still at his post profiting by the last of the rapidlyfailing light to finish his study and yet at the same time taking rapid notes of the actual condition of the clouds  we are going to have a most interesting storm the little painter gleefully cried i should like awfully to do it  rowland adjured him to pack up his tools and decamp and repaired to the house the air by this time had become portentously dark and the thunder was incessant and tremendous in the midst of it the lightning flashed and vanished like the treble shrilling upon the bass the innkeeper and his servants had crowded to the doorway and were looking at the scene with faces which seemed a proof that it was unprecedented as rowland approached the group divided to let some one pass from within and mrs hudson came forth as white as a corpse and trembling in every limb  my boy my boy where is my boy she cried mr mallet why are you here without him bring him to me  has no one seen mr hudson rowland asked of the others has he not returned  each one shook his head and looked grave and rowland attempted to reassure mrs hudson by saying that of course he had taken refuge in a chalet  go and find him go and find him she cried insanely dont stand there and talk or i shall die it was now as dark as evening and rowland could just distinguish the figure of singleton scampering homeward with his box and easel and where is mary mrs hudson went on what in mercys name has become of her mr mallet why did you ever bring us here  there came a prodigious flash of lightning and the limitless tumult about them turned clearer than midsummer noonday the brightness lasted long enough to enable rowland to see a womans figure on the top of an eminence near the house it was mary garland questioning the lurid darkness for roderick rowland sprang out to interrupt her vigil but in a moment he encountered her retreating he seized her hand and hurried her to the house where as soon as she stepped into the covered gallery mrs hudson fell upon her with frantic lamentations  did you see nothingnothing she cried tell mr mallet he must go and find him with some men some lights some wrappings go go go sir in mercy go  rowland was extremely perturbed by the poor ladys vociferous folly for he deemed her anxiety superfluous he had offered his suggestion with sincerity nothing was more probable than that roderick had found shelter in a herdsmans cabin these were numerous on the neighboring mountains and the storm had given fair warning of its approach miss garland stood there very pale saying nothing but looking at him he expected that she would check her cousins importunity could you find him she suddenly asked would it be of use  the question seemed to him a flash intenser than the lightning that was raking the sky before them it shattered his dream that he weighed in the scale but before he could answer the full fury of the storm was upon them the rain descended in sounding torrents every one fell back into the house there had been no time to light lamps and in the little uncarpeted parlor in the unnatural darkness rowland felt marys hand upon his arm for a moment it had an eloquent pressure it seemed to retract her senseless challenge and to say that she believed for roderick what he believed but nevertheless thought rowland the cry had come her heart had spoken her first impulse had been to sacrifice him he had been uncertain before here at least was the comfort of certainty  it must be confessed however that the certainty in question did little to enliven the gloom of that formidable evening there was a noisy crowd about him in the roomnoisy even with the accompaniment of the continual thunderpeals lodgers and servants chattering shuffling and bustling and annoying him equally by making too light of the tempest and by vociferating their alarm in the disorder it was some time before a lamp was lighted and the first thing he saw as it was swung from the ceiling was the white face of mrs hudson who was being carried out of the room in a swoon by two stout maidservants with mary garland forcing a passage he rendered what help he could but when they had laid the poor woman on her bed miss garland motioned him away  i think you make her worse she said  rowland went to his own chamber the partitions in swiss mountaininns are thin and from time to time he heard mrs hudson moaning three rooms off considering its great fury the storm took long to expend itself it was upwards of three hours before the thunder ceased but even then the rain continued to fall heavily and the night which had come on was impenetrably black this lasted till near midnight rowland thought of mary garlands challenge in the porch but he thought even more that although the fetid interior of a highnestling chalet may offer a convenient refuge from an alpine tempest there was no possible music in the universe so sweet as the sound of rodericks voice at midnight through his dripping windowpane he saw a star and he immediately went downstairs and out into the gallery the rain had ceased the cloudmasses were dissevered here and there and several stars were visible in a few minutes he heard a step behind him and turning saw miss garland he asked about mrs hudson and learned that she was sleeping exhausted by her fruitless lamentations miss garland kept scanning the darkness but she said nothing to cast doubt on rodericks having found a refuge rowland noticed it this also have i guaranteed he said to himself there was something that mary wished to learn and a question presently revealed it  what made him start on a long walk so suddenly she asked i saw him at eleven oclock and then he meant to go to engelberg and sleep  on his way to interlaken rowland said  yes she answered under cover of the darkness  we had some talk said rowland and he seemed for the day to have given up interlaken  did you dissuade him  not exactly we discussed another question which for the time superseded his plan  miss garland was silent thenmay i ask whether your discussion was violent she said  i am afraid it was agreeable to neither of us  and roderick left you inin irritation  i offered him my company on his walk he declined it  miss garland paced slowly to the end of the gallery and then came back if he had gone to engelberg she said he would have reached the hotel before the storm began  rowland felt a sudden explosion of ferocity oh if you like he cried he can start for interlaken as soon as he comes back  but she did not even notice his wrath will he come back early she went on  we may suppose so  he will know how anxious we are and he will start with the first light  rowland was on the point of declaring that rodericks readiness to throw himself into the feelings of others made this extremely probable but he checked himself and said simply i expect him at sunrise  miss garland bent her eyes once more upon the irresponsive darkness and then in silence went into the house rowland it must be averred in spite of his resolution not to be nervous found no sleep that night when the early dawn began to tremble in the east he came forth again into the open air the storm had completely purged the atmosphere and the day gave promise of cloudless splendor rowland watched the early sunshafts slowly reaching higher and remembered that if roderick did not come back to breakfast there were two things to be taken into account one was the heaviness of the soil on the mountainsides saturated with the rain this would make him walk slowly the other was the fact that speaking without irony he was not remarkable for throwing himself into the sentiments of others breakfast at the inn was early and by breakfasttime roderick had not appeared then rowland admitted that he was nervous neither mrs hudson nor miss garland had left their apartment rowland had a mental vision of them sitting there praying and listening he had no desire to see them more directly there were a couple of men who hung about the inn as guides for the ascent of the titlis rowland sent each of them forth in a different direction to ask the news of roderick at every chalet door within a mornings walk then he called sam singleton whose peregrinations had made him an excellent mountaineer and whose zeal and sympathy were now unbounded and the two started together on a voyage of research by the time they had lost sight of the inn rowland was obliged to confess that decidedly roderick had had time to come back  he wandered about for several hours but he found only the sunny stillness of the mountainsides before long he parted company with singleton who to his suggestion that separation would multiply their resources assented with a silent frightened look which reflected too vividly his own rapidlydawning thought the day was magnificent the sun was everywhere the storm had lashed the lower slopes into a deeper flush of autumnal color and the snowpeaks reared themselves against the near horizon in glaring blocks and dazzling spires rowland made his way to several chalets but most of them were empty he thumped at their low foul doors with a kind of nervous savage anger he challenged the stupid silence to tell him something about his friend some of these places had evidently not been open in months the silence everywhere was horrible it seemed to mock at his impatience and to be a conscious symbol of calamity in the midst of it at the door of one of the chalets quite alone sat a hideous cretin who grinned at rowland over his goitre when hardly knowing what he did he questioned him the creatures family was scattered on the mountainsides he could give rowland no help to find them rowland climbed into many awkward places and skirted intently and peeringly many an ugly chasm and steepdropping ledge but the sun as i have said was everywhere it illumined the deep places over which not knowing where to turn next he halted and lingered and showed him nothing but the stony alpine voidnothing so human even as death at noon he paused in his quest and sat down on a stone the conviction was pressing upon him that the worst that was now possible was true he suspended his search he was afraid to go on he sat there for an hour sick to the depths of his soul without his knowing why several things chiefly trivial that had happened during the last two years and that he had quite forgotten became vividly present to his mind he was aroused at last by the sound of a stone dislodged near by which rattled down the mountain in a moment on a steep rocky slope opposite to him he beheld a figure cautiously descendinga figure which was not roderick it was singleton who had seen him and began to beckon to him  come downcome down cried the painter steadily making his own way down rowland saw that as he moved and even as he selected his foothold and watched his steps he was looking at something at the bottom of the cliff this was a great rugged wall which had fallen backward from the perpendicular and the descent though difficult was with care sufficiently practicable  what do you see cried rowland  singleton stopped looked across at him and seemed to hesitate then come downcome down he simply repeated  rowlands course was also a steep descent and he attacked it so precipitately that he afterwards marveled he had not broken his neck it was a ten minutes headlong scramble halfway down he saw something that made him dizzy he saw what singleton had seen in the gorge below them a vague white mass lay tumbled upon the stones he let himself go blindly fiercely singleton had reached the rocky bottom of the ravine before him and had bounded forward and fallen upon his knees rowland overtook him and his own legs collapsed the thing that yesterday was his friend lay before him as the chance of the last breath had left it and out of it rodericks face stared upward openeyed at the sky  he had fallen from a great height but he was singularly little disfigured the rain had spent its torrents upon him and his clothes and hair were as wet as if the billows of the ocean had flung him upon the strand an attempt to move him would show some hideous fracture some horrible physical dishonor but what rowland saw on first looking at him was only a strangely serene expression of life the eyes were dead but in a short time when rowland had closed them the whole face seemed to awake the rain had washed away all blood it was as if violence having done her work had stolen away in shame rodericks face might have shamed her it looked admirably handsome  he was a beautiful man said singleton  they looked up through their horror at the cliff from which he had apparently fallen and which lifted its blank and stony face above him with no care now but to drink the sunshine on which his eyes were closed and then rowland had an immense outbreak of pity and anguish at last they spoke of carrying him back to the inn there must be three or four men rowland said and they must be brought here quickly i have not the least idea where we are  we are at about three hours walk from home said singleton i will go for help i can find my way  remember said rowland whom you will have to face  i remember the excellent fellow answered there was nothing i could ever do for him in life i will do what i can now  he went off and rowland stayed there alone he watched for seven long hours and his vigil was forever memorable the most rational of men was for an hour the most passionate he reviled himself with transcendent bitterness he accused himself of cruelty and injustice he would have lain down there in rodericks place to unsay the words that had yesterday driven him forth on his lonely ramble roderick had been fond of saying that there are such things as necessary follies and rowland was now proving it at last he grew almost used to the dumb exultation of the cliff above him he saw that roderick was a mass of hideous injury and he tried to understand what had happened not that it helped him before that confounding mortality one hypothesis after another faltered and swooned away rodericks passionate walk had carried him farther and higher than he knew he had outstayed supposably the first menace of the storm and perhaps even found a defiant entertainment in watching it perhaps he had simply lost himself the tempest had overtaken him and when he tried to return it was too late he had attempted to descend the cliff in the darkness he had made the inevitable slip and whether he had fallen fifty feet or three hundred little mattered the condition of his body indicated the shorter fall now that all was over rowland understood how exclusively for two years roderick had filled his life his occupation was gone  singleton came back with four menone of them the landlord of the inn they had formed a sort of rude bier of the frame of a chaise a porteurs and by taking a very roundabout course homeward were able to follow a tolerably level path and carry their burden with a certain decency to rowland it seemed as if the little procession would never reach the inn but as they drew near it he would have given his right hand for a longer delay the people of the inn came forward to meet them in a little silent solemn convoy in the doorway clinging together appeared the two bereaved women mrs hudson tottered forward with outstretched hands and the expression of a blind person but before she reached her son mary garland had rushed past her and in the face of the staring pitying awestricken crowd had flung herself with the magnificent movement of one whose rights were supreme and with a loud tremendous cry upon the senseless vestige of her love  that cry still lives in rowlands ears it interposes persistently against the reflection that when he sometimesvery rarelysees her she is unreservedly kind to him against the memory that during the dreary journey back to america made of course with his assistance there was a great frankness in her gratitude a great gratitude in her frankness miss garland lives with mrs hudson at northampton where rowland visits his cousin cecilia more frequently than of old when he calls upon miss garland he never sees mrs hudson cecilia who having her shrewd impression that he comes to see miss garland as much as to see herself does not feel obliged to seem unduly flattered calls him whenever he reappears the most restless of mortals but he always says to her in answer no i assure you i am the most patient
