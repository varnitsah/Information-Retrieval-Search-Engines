19134767	a sappho of green springs   by bret harte     contents   a sappho of green springs  the chatelaine of burnt ridge  through the santa clara wheat  a maecenas of the pacific slope      a sappho of green springs   chapter i   come in said the editor  the door of the editorial room of the excelsior magazine began to creak painfully under the hesitating pressure of an uncertain and unfamiliar hand this continued until with a start of irritation the editor faced directly about throwing his leg over the arm of his chair with a certain youthful dexterity with one hand gripping its back the other still grasping a proofslip and his pencil in his mouth he stared at the intruder  the stranger despite his hesitating entrance did not seem in the least disconcerted he was a tall man looking even taller by reason of the long formless overcoat he wore known as a duster and by a long straight beard that depended from his chin which he combed with two reflective fingers as he contemplated the editor the red dust which still lay in the creases of his garment and in the curves of his soft felt hat and left a dusty circle like a precipitated halo around his feet proclaimed him if not a countryman a recent inland importation by coach busy he said in a grave but pleasant voice i kin wait dont mind me go on  the editor indicated a chair with his disengaged hand and plunged again into his proofslips the stranger surveyed the scant furniture and appointments of the office with a look of grave curiosity and then taking a chair fixed an earnest penetrating gaze on the editors profile the editor felt it and without looking up said  well go on  but youre busy i kin wait  i shall not be less busy this morning i can listen  i want you to give me the name of a certain person who writes in your magazine  the editors eye glanced at the second righthand drawer of his desk it did not contain the names of his contributors but what in the traditions of his office was accepted as an equivalenta revolver he had never yet presented either to an inquirer but he laid aside his proofs and with a slight darkening of his youthful discontented face said what do you want to know for  the question was so evidently unexpected that the strangers face colored slightly and he hesitated the editor meanwhile without taking his eyes from the man mentally ran over the contents of the last magazine they had been of a singularly peaceful character there seemed to be nothing to justify homicide on his part or the strangers yet there was no knowing and his questioners bucolic appearance by no means precluded an assault indeed it had been a legend of the office that a predecessor had suffered vicariously from a geological hammer covertly introduced into a scientific controversy by an irate professor  as we make ourselves responsible for the conduct of the magazine continued the young editor with mature severity we do not give up the names of our contributors if you do not agree with their opinions  but i do said the stranger with his former composure and i reckon thats why i want to know who wrote those verses called underbrush signed white violet in your last number theyre powful pretty  the editor flushed slightly and glanced instinctively around for any unexpected witness of his ludicrous mistake the fear of ridicule was uppermost in his mind and he was more relieved at his mistake not being overheard than at its groundlessness  the verses are pretty he said recovering himself with a critical air and i am glad you like them but even then you know i could not give you the ladys name without her permission i will write to her and ask it if you like  the actual fact was that the verses had been sent to him anonymously from a remote village in the coast rangethe address being the postoffice and the signature initials  the stranger looked disturbed then she aint about here anywhere he said with a vague gesture she dont belong to the office  the young editor beamed with tolerant superiority no i am sorry to say  i should like to have got to see her and kinder asked her a few questions continued the stranger with the same reflective seriousness you see it wasnt just the rhymin o them versesand they kinder sing themselves to ye dont theyit wasnt the chyce o wordsand i reckon they allus hit the idee in the centre shot every timeit wasnt the idees and moral she sort o drew out o what she was tellinbut it was the straight thing itselfthe truth  the truth repeated the editor  yes sir ive bin there ive seen all that shes seen in the brushthe little flicks and checkers o light and shadder down in the brown dust that you wonder how it ever got through the dark of the woods and that allus seems to slip away like a snake or a lizard if you grope ive heard all that shes heard therethe creepin the sighin and the whisperin through the bracken and the groundvines of all that lives there  you seem to be a poet yourself said the editor with a patronizing smile  im a lumberman up in mendocino returned the stranger with sublime naivete got a mill there you see sightin standin timber and selectin from the genral show of the trees in the ground and the lay of roots hez sorter made me take notice he paused then he added somewhat despondingly you dont know who she is  no said the editor reflectively not even if it is really a woman who writes  eh  well you see white violet may as well be the nom de plume of a man as of a woman especially if adopted for the purpose of mystification the handwriting i remember was more boyish than feminine  no returned the stranger doggedly it wasnt no man theres ideas and words there that only come from a woman babytalk to the birds you know and a kind of fearsome keer of bugs and creepin things that dont come to a man who wears boots and trousers well he added with a return to his previous air of resigned disappointment i suppose you dont even know what shes like  no responded the editor cheerfully then following an idea suggested by the odd mingling of sentiment and shrewd perception in the man before him he added probably not at all like anything you imagine she may be a mother with three or four children or an old maid who keeps a boardinghouse or a wrinkled schoolmistress or a chit of a schoolgirl ive had some fair verses from a redhaired girl of fourteen at the seminary he concluded with professional coolness  the stranger regarded him with the naive wonder of an inexperienced man having paid this tribute to his superior knowledge he regained his previous air of grave perception i reckon she aint none of them but im keepin you from your work goodby my names bowersjim bowers of mendocino if youre up my way give me a call and if you do write to this yer white violet and shes willin send me her address  he shook the editors hand warmlyeven in its literal significance of imparting a good deal of his own earnest caloric to the editors fingersand left the room his footfall echoed along the passage and died out and with it i fear all impression of his visit from the editors mind as he plunged again into the silent task before him  presently he was conscious of a melodious humming and a light leisurely step at the entrance of the hall they continued on in an easy harmony and unaffected as the passage of a bird both were pleasant and both familiar to the editor they belonged to jack hamlin by vocation a gambler by taste a musician on his way from his apartments on the upper floor where he had just risen to drop into his friends editorial room and glance over the exchanges as was his habit before breakfast  the door opened lightly the editor was conscious of a faint odor of scented soap a sensation of freshness and cleanliness the impression of a soft hand like a womans on his shoulder and like a womans momentarily and playfully caressing the passage of a graceful shadow across his desk and the next moment jack hamlin was ostentatiously dusting a chair with an open newspaper preparatory to sitting down  you ought to ship that officeboy of yours if he cant keep things cleaner he said suspending his melody to eye grimly the dust which mr bowers had shaken from his departing feet  the editor did not look up until he had finished revising a difficult paragraph by that time mr hamlin had comfortably settled himself on a cane sofa and possibly out of deference to his surroundings had subdued his song to a peculiarly low soft and heartbreaking whistle as he unfolded a newspaper clean and faultless in his appearance he had the rare gift of being able to get up at two in the afternoon with much of the dewy freshness and all of the moral superiority of an early riser  you ought to have been here just now jack said the editor  not a row old man eh inquired jack with a faint accession of interest  no said the editor smiling then he related the incidents of the previous interview with a certain humorous exaggeration which was part of his nature but jack did not smile  you ought to have booted him out of the ranch on sight he said what right had he to come here prying into a ladys affairsat least a lady as far as he knows of course shes some old blowzy with frumpled hair trying to rope in a greenhorn with a string of words and phrases concluded jack carelessly who had an equally cynical distrust of the sex and of literature  thats about what i told him said the editor  thats just what you shouldnt have told him returned jack you ought to have stuck up for that woman as if shed been your own mother lord you fellows dont know how to run a magazine you ought to let me sit on that chair and tackle your customers  what would you have done jack asked the editor much amused to find that his hitherto invincible hero was not above the ordinary human weakness of offering advice as to editorial conduct  done reflected jack well first sonny i shouldnt keep a revolver in a drawer that i had to open to get at  but what would you have said  i should simply have asked him what was the price of lumber at mendocino said jack sweetly and when he told me i should have said that the samples he was offering out of his own head wouldnt suit you see you dont want any trifling in such matters you write well enough my boy continued he turning over his paper but what youre lacking in is editorial dignity but go on with your work dont mind me  thus admonished the editor again bent over his desk and his friend softly took up his suspended song the editor had not proceeded far in his corrections when jacks voice again broke the silence  where are those dd verses anyway  without looking up the editor waved his pencil towards an uncut copy of the excelsior magazine lying on the table  you dont suppose im going to read them do you said jack aggrievedly why dont you say what theyre about thats your business as editor  but that functionary now wholly lost and wandering in the nonsequitur of an involved passage in the proof before him only waved an impatient remonstrance with his pencil and knit his brows jack with a sigh took up the magazine  a long silence followed broken only by the hurried rustling of sheets of copy and an occasional exasperated start from the editor the sun was already beginning to slant a dusty beam across his desk jacks whistling had long since ceased presently with an exclamation of relief the editor laid aside the last proofsheet and looked up  jack hamlin had closed the magazine but with one hand thrown over the back of the sofa he was still holding it his slim forefinger between its leaves to keep the place and his handsome profile and dark lashes lifted towards the window the editor smiling at this unwonted abstraction said quietly  well what do you think of them  jack rose laid the magazine down settled his white waistcoat with both hands and lounged towards his friend with audacious but slightly veiled and shining eyes they sort of sing themselves to you he said quietly leaning beside the editors desk and looking down upon him after a pause he said then you dont know what shes like  thats what mr bowers asked me remarked the editor  dn bowers  i suppose you also wish me to write and ask for permission to give you her address said the editor with great gravity  no said jack coolly i propose to give it to you within a week and you will pay me with a breakfast i should like to have it said that i was once a paid contributor to literature if i dont give it to you ill stand you a dinner thats all  done said the editor and you know nothing of her now  no said jack promptly nor you  no more than i have told you  thatll do so long and jack carefully adjusting his glossy hat over his curls at an ominously wicked angle sauntered lightly from the room the editor glancing after his handsome figure and hearing him take up his pretermitted whistle as he passed out began to think that the contingent dinner was by no means an inevitable prospect  howbeit he plunged once more into his monotonous duties but the freshness of the day seemed to have departed with jack and the later interruptions of foreman and publisher were of a more practical character it was not until the post arrived that the superscription on one of the letters caught his eye and revived his former interest it was the same hand as that of his unknown contributors manuscriptillformed and boyish he opened the envelope it contained another poem with the same signature but also a notemuch longer than the brief lines that accompanied the first contributionwas scrawled upon a separate piece of paper this the editor opened first and read the following with an amazement that for the moment dominated all other sense   mr editori see you have got my poetry in but i dont see the spondulix that oughter follow perhaps you dont know where to send it then ill tell you send the money to lock box 47 green springs p o per wells fargos express and ill get it there on account of my parents not knowing were very hightoned and they would think its low making poetry for papers send amount usually paid for poetry in your papers or may be you think i make poetry for nothing thats where you slip up  yours truly  white violet  p sif you dont pay for poetry send this back its as good as what you did put in and is just as hard to make you hear me thats meall the time  white violet   the editor turned quickly to the new contribution for some corroboration of what he felt must be an extraordinary blunder but no the few lines that he hurriedly read breathed the same atmosphere of intellectual repose gentleness and imagination as the first contribution and yet they were in the same handwriting as the singular missive and both were identical with the previous manuscript  had he been the victim of a hoax and were the verses not original no they were distinctly original local in color and even local in the use of certain old english words that were common in the southwest he had before noticed the apparent incongruity of the handwriting and the text and it was possible that for the purposes of disguise the poet might have employed an amanuensis but how could he reconcile the incongruity of the mercenary and slangy purport of the missive itself with the mental habit of its author was it possible that these inconsistent qualities existed in the one individual he smiled grimly as he thought of his visitor bowers and his friend jack he was startled as he remembered the purely imaginative picture he had himself given to the seriously interested bowers of the possible incongruous personality of the poetess  was he quite fair in keeping this from jack was it really honorable in view of their wager it is to be feared that a very human enjoyment of jacks possible discomfiture quite as much as any chivalrous friendship impelled the editor to ring eventually for the officeboy  see if mr hamlin is in his rooms  the editor then sat down and wrote rapidly as follows   dear madamyou are as right as you are generous in supposing that only ignorance of your address prevented the manager from previously remitting the honorarium for your beautiful verses he now begs to send it to you in the manner you have indicated as the verses have attracted deserved attention i have been applied to for your address should you care to submit it to me to be used at my discretion i shall feel honored by your confidence but this is a matter left entirely to your own kindness and better judgment meantime i take pleasure in accepting white violets present contribution and remain dear madam your obedient servant  the editor   the boy returned as he was folding the letter mr hamlin was not only not in his rooms but according to his negro servant pete had left town an hour ago for a few days in the country  did he say where asked the editor quickly  no sir he didnt know  very well take this to the manager he addressed the letter and scrawling a few hieroglyphics on a memorandumtag tore it off and handed it with the letter to the boy  an hour later he stood in the managers office the next number is pretty well made up he said carelessly and i think of taking a day or two off  certainly said the manager it will do you good where do you think youll go  i havent quite made up my mind   chapter ii   hullo said jack hamlin  he had halted his mare at the edge of an abrupt chasm it did not appear to be fifty feet across yet its depth must have been nearly two hundred to where the hidden mountainstream of which it was the banks alternately slipped tumbled and fell with murmuring and monotonous regularity one or two pinetrees growing on the opposite edge loosened at the roots had tilted their straight shafts like spears over the abyss and the top of one resting on the upper branches of a sycamore a few yards from him served as an aerial bridge for the passage of a boy of fourteen to whom mr hamlins challenge was addressed  the boy stopped midway in his perilous transit and looking down upon the horseman responded coolly hullo yourself  is that the only way across this infernal hole or the one you prefer for exercise continued hamlin gravely  the boy sat down on a bough allowing his bare feet to dangle over the dizzy depths and critically examined his questioner jack had on this occasion modified his usual correct conventional attire by a tasteful combination of a vaqueros costume and in loose white bullionfringed trousers red sash jacket and sombrero looked infinitely more dashing and picturesque than his original nevertheless the boy did not reply mr hamlins pride in his usual ascendency over women children horses and all unreasoning animals was deeply nettled he smiled however and said quietly  come here george washington i want to talk to you  without rejecting this august yet impossible title the boy presently lifted his feet and carelessly resumed his passage across the chasm until reaching the sycamore he began to let himself down squirrelwise leap by leap with an occasional trapeze swinging from bough to bough dropping at last easily to the ground here he appeared to be rather goodlooking albeit the sun and air had worked a miracle of brown tan and freckles on his exposed surfaces until the mottling of his oval cheeks looked like a polished birds egg indeed it struck mr hamlin that he was as intensely a part of that sylvan seclusion as the hidden brook that murmured the brown velvet shadows that lay like trappings on the white flanks of his horse the quivering heat and the stinging spice of bay mr hamlin had vague ideas of dryads and fauns but at that moment would have bet something on the chances of their survival  i did not hear what you said just now general he remarked with great elegance of manner but i know from your reputation that it could not be a lie i therefore gather that there is another way across  the boy smiled rather his very short upper lip apparently vanished completely over his white teeth and his very black eyes which showed a great deal of the white around them danced in their orbits  but you couldnt find it he said slyly  no more could you find the halfdollar i dropped just now unless i helped you  mr hamlin by way of illustration leaned deeply over his left stirrup and pointed to the ground at the same moment a bright halfdollar absolutely appeared to glitter in the herbage at the point of his finger it was a trick that had always brought great pleasure and profit to his young friends and some loss and discomfiture of wager to his older ones  the boy picked up the coin theres a dip and a level crossing about a mile over yerhe pointedbut its through the woods and theyre that high with thick bresh  with what  bresh repeated the boy thatpointing to a few fronds of bracken growing in the shadow of the sycamore  oh underbrush  yes i said bresh returned the boy doggedly you might get through ef you war spry but not your hoss where do you want to go anyway  do you know george said mr hamlin lazily throwing his right leg over the horn of his saddle for greater ease and deliberation in replying its very odd but thats just what id like to know now what would you in your broad statesmanlike views of things generally advise  quite convinced of the strangers mental unsoundness the boy glanced again at his halfdollar as if to make sure of its integrity pocketed it doubtfully and turned away  where are you going said hamlin resuming his seat with the agility of a circusrider and spurring forward  to green springs where i live two miles over the ridge on the far slopeindicating the direction  ah said jack with thoughtful gravity well kindly give my love to your sister will you  george washington didnt have no sister said the boy cunningly  can i have been mistaken said hamlin lifting his hand to his forehead with grieved accents then it seems you have kindly give her my love  which one asked the boy with a swift glance of mischief ive got four  the one thats like you returned hamlin with prompt exactitude now wheres the bresh you spoke of  keep along the edge until you come to the logslide foller that and itll lead you into the woods but ye wont go far i tell ye when you have to turn back instead o comin back here you kin take the trail that goes round the woods and thatll bring ye out into the stage road agin near the postoffice at the green springs crossin and the new hotel thatll be war yell turn up i reckon he added reflectively fellers that come yer gunnin and fishin ginrally do he concluded with a halfinquisitive air  ah said mr hamlin quietly shedding the inquiry green springs hotel is where the stage stops eh  yes and at the postoffice said the boy shell be along here soon he added  if you mean the santa cruz stage said hamlin shes here already i passed her on the ridge half an hour ago  the boy gave a sudden start and a quick uneasy expression passed over his face go long with ye he said with a forced smile it aint her time yet  but i saw her repeated hamlin much amused are you expecting company hullo where are you off to come back  but his companion had already vanished in the thicket with the undeliberate and impulsive act of an animal there was a momentary rustle in the alders fifty feet away and then all was silent the hidden brook took up its monotonous murmur the tapping of a distant woodpecker became suddenly audible and mr hamlin was again alone  wonder whether hes got parents in the stage and has been playing truant here he mused lazily looked as if hed been up to some devilment or more like as if he was primed for it if hed been a little older id have bet he was in league with some roadagents to watch the coach just my luck to have him light out as i was beginning to get some talk out of him he paused looked at his watch and straightened himself in his stirrups four oclock i reckon i might as well try the woods and what that imp calls the bresh i may strike a shanty or a native by the way  with this determination mr hamlin urged his horse along the faint trail by the brink of the watercourse which the boy had just indicated he had no definite end in view beyond the one that had brought him the day before to that localityhis quest of the unknown poetess his clue would have seemed to ordinary humanity the faintest he had merely noted the provincial name of a certain plant mentioned in the poem and learned that its habitat was limited to the southern local range while its peculiar nomenclature was clearly of french creole or gulf state origin this gave him a large though sparselypopulated area for locality while it suggested a settlement of louisianians or mississippians near the summit of whom through their native gambling proclivities he was professionally cognizant but he mainly trusted fortune secure in his faith in the feminine character of that goddess he relied a great deal on her wellknown weakness for scamps of his quality  it was not long before he came to the slidea lightlycut or shallow ditch it descended slightly in a course that was far from straight at times diverging to avoid the obstacles of trees or boulders at times shaving them so closely as to leave smooth abrasions along their sides made by the grinding passage of long logs down the incline the track itself was slippery from this and preoccupied all hamlins skill as a horseman even to the point of stopping his usual careless whistle at the end of half an hour the track became level again and he was confronted with a singular phenomenon  he had entered the wood and the trail seemed to cleave through a farstretching motionless sea of ferns that flowed on either side to the height of his horses flanks the straight shafts of the trees rose like columns from their hidden bases and were lost again in a roof of impenetrable leafage leaving a clear space of fifty feet between through which the surrounding horizon of sky was perfectly visible all the light that entered this vast sylvan hall came from the sides nothing permeated from above nothing radiated from below the height of the crest on which the wood was placed gave it this lateral illumination but gave it also the profound isolation of some temple raised by longforgotten hands in spite of the height of these clear shafts they seemed dwarfed by the expanse of the wood and in the farthest perspective the base of ferns and the capital of foliage appeared almost to meet as the boy had warned him the slide had turned aside skirting the wood to follow the incline and presently the little trail he now followed vanished utterly leaving him and his horse adrift breasthigh in this green and yellow sea of fronds but mr hamlin imperious of obstacles and touched by some curiosity continued to advance lazily taking the bearings of a larger redwood in the centre of the grove for his objective point the elastic mass gave way before him brushing his knees or combing his horses flanks with widespread elfin fingers and closing up behind him as he passed as if to obliterate any track by which he might return yet his usual luck did not desert him here being on horseback he found that he could detect what had been invisible to the boy and probably to all pedestrians namely that the growth was not equally dense that there were certain thinner and more open spaces that he could take advantage of by more circuitous progression always however keeping the bearings of the central tree this he at last reached and halted his panting horse here a new idea which had been haunting him since he entered the wood took fuller possession of him he had seen or known all this before there was a strange familiarity either in these objects or in the impression or spell they left upon him he remembered the verses yes this was the underbrush which the poetess had described the gloom above and below the light that seemed blown through it like the wind the suggestion of hidden life beneath this tangled luxuriance which she alone had penetratedall this was here but more than that here was the atmosphere that she had breathed into the plaintive melody of her verse it did not necessarily follow that mr hamlins translation of her sentiment was the correct one or that the ideas her verses had provoked in his mind were at all what had been hers in his easy susceptibility he was simply thrown into a corresponding mood of emotion and relieved himself with song one of the verses he had already associated in his mind with the rhythm of an old plantation melody and it struck his fancy to take advantage of the solitude to try its effect humming to himself at first softly he at last grew bolder and let his voice drift away through the stark pillars of the sylvan colonnade till it seemed to suffuse and fill it with no more effort than the light which strayed in on either side sitting thus his hat thrown a little back from his clustering curls the white neck and shoulders of his horse uplifting him above the crested mass of fern his red sash the one fleck of color in their olive depths i am afraid he looked much more like the real minstrel of the grove than the unknown poetess who transfigured it but this as has been already indicated was jack hamlins peculiar gift even as he had previously outshone the vaquero in his borrowed dress he now silenced and supplanted a few fluttering bluejaysrightful tenants of the woodwith a more graceful and airy presence and a far sweeter voice  the open horizon towards the west had taken a warmer color from the already slanting sun when mr hamlin having rested his horse turned to that direction he had noticed that the wood was thinner there and pushing forward he was presently rewarded by the sound of faroff wheels and knew he must be near the highroad that the boy had spoken of having given up his previous intention of crossing the stream there seemed nothing better for him to do than to follow the truants advice and take the road back to green springs yet he was loath to leave the wood halting on its verge and turning to look back into its charmed recesses once or twiceperhaps because he recalled the words of the poemthat yellowish sea of ferns had seemed instinct with hidden life and he had even fancied here and there a swaying of its plumed crests howbeit he still lingered long enough for the open sunlight into which he had obtruded to point out the bravery of his handsome figure then he wheeled his horse the light glanced from polished double bit and bridlefripperies caught his red sash and bullion buttons struck a parting flash from his silver spurs and he was gone  for a moment the light streamed unbrokenly through the wood and then it could be seen that the yellow mass of undergrowth had moved with the passage of another figure than his own for ever since he had entered the shade a woman shawled in a vague shapeless fashion had watched him wonderingly eagerly excitedly gliding from tree to tree as he advanced or else dropping breathlessly below the fronds of fern whence she gazed at him as between parted fingers when he wheeled she had run openly to the west albeit with hidden face and still clinging shawl and taken a last look at his retreating figure and then with a faint but lingering sigh she drew back into the shadow of the wood again and vanished also   chapter iii   at the end of twenty minutes mr hamlin reined in his mare he had just observed in the distant shadows of a bylane that intersected his road the vanishing flutter of two light print dresses without a moments hesitation he lightly swerved out of the highroad and followed the retreating figures  as he neared them they seemed to be two slim young girls evidently so preoccupied with the rustic amusement of edging each other off the grassy border into the dust of the track that they did not perceive his approach little shrieks slight scufflings and interjections of cynthy you limb quit that eunice now and i just call that real mean apparently drowned the sound of his canter in the soft dust checking his speed to a gentle trot and pressing his horse close beside the opposite fence he passed them with gravely uplifted hat and a serious preoccupied air but in that single seemingly conventional glance mr hamlin had seen that they were both pretty and that one had the short upper lip of his errant little guide a hundred yards farther on he halted as if irresolutely gazed doubtfully ahead of him and then turned back an expression of innocentalmost childlikeconcern was clouding the rascals face it was well as the two girls had drawn closely together having been apparently surprised in the midst of a glowing eulogium of this glorious passing vision by its sudden return at his nearer approach the one with the short upper lip hid that piquant feature and the rest of her rosy face behind the others shoulder which was suddenly and significantly opposed to the advance of this handsome intruder with a certain dignity half real half affected but wholly charming the protectress appearedpossibly from her defensive attitudethe superior of her companion  audacious as jack was to his own sex he had early learned that such rare but discomposing graces as he possessed required a certain apologetic attitude when presented to women and that it was only a plain man who could be always complacently selfconfident in their presence there was consequently a hesitating lowering of this hypocrites brown eyelashes as he said in almost pained accents  excuse me but i fear ive taken the wrong road im going to green springs  i reckon youve taken the wrong road wherever youre going returned the young lady having apparently made up her mind to resent each of jacks perfections as a separate impertinence this is a private road she drew herself fairly up here although gurgled at in the ear and pinched in the arm by her companion  i beg your pardon said jack meekly i see im trespassing on your grounds im very sorry thank you for telling me i should have gone on a mile or two farther i suppose until i came to your house he added innocently  a mile or two youd have run chock agin our gate in another minit said the shortlipped one eagerly but a sharp nudge from her companion sent her back again into cover where she waited expectantly for another crushing retort from her protector  but alas it did not come one cannot be always witty and jack looked distressed nevertheless he took advantage of the pause  it was so stupid in me as i think your brotherlooking at shortlipvery carefully told me the road  the two girls darted quick glances at each other oh bawb said the first speaker in wearied accentsthat limb he dont keer  but he did care said hamlin quietly and gave me a good deal of information thanks to him i was able to see that ferny wood thats so famousabout two miles up the road you knowthe one that theres a poem written about  the shot told shortlip burst into a display of dazzling little teeth and caught the other girl convulsively by the shoulders the superior girl bent her pretty brows and said eunice whats gone of ye quit that but as hamlin thought paled slightly  of course said hamlin quickly you knowthe poem everybodys talking about dear me let me see how does it go the rascal knit his brows said ah yes and then murmured the verse he had lately sung quite as musically  shortlip was shamelessly exalted and excited really she could scarcely believe it she already heard herself relating the whole occurrence here was the most beautiful young man she had ever seenan entire strangertalking to them in the most beautiful and natural way right in the lane and reciting poetry to her sister it was like a novelonly more so she thought that cynthia on the other hand looked distressed andshe must say itsilly  all of which jack noted and was wise he had got all he wantedat present he gathered up his reins  thank you so much and your brother too miss cynthia he said without looking up then adding with a parting glance and smile but dont tell bob how stupid i was he swiftly departed  in half an hour he was at the green springs hotel as he rode into the stable yard he noticed that the coach had only just arrived having been detained by a landslip on the summit road with the recollection of bob fresh in his mind he glanced at the loungers at the stage office the boy was not there but a moment later jack detected him among the waiting crowd at the postoffice opposite with a view of following up his inquiries he crossed the road as the boy entered the vestibule of the postoffice he arrived in time to see him unlock one of a row of numbered letterboxes rented by subscribers which occupied a partition by the window and take out a small package and a letter but in that brief glance mr hamlin detected the printed address of the excelsior magazine on the wrapper it was enough luck was certainly with him  he had time to get rid of the wicked sparkle that had lit his dark eyes and to lounge carelessly towards the boy as the latter broke open the package and then hurriedly concealed it in his jacketpocket and started for the door mr hamlin quickly followed him unperceived and as he stepped into the street gently tapped him on the shoulder the boy turned and faced him quickly but mr hamlins eyes showed nothing but lazy goodhumor  hullo bob where are you going  the boy again looked up suspiciously at this revelation of his name  home he said briefly  oh over yonder said hamlin calmly i dont mind walking with you as far as the lane  he saw the boys eyes glance furtively towards an alley that ran beside the blacksmiths shop a few rods ahead and was convinced that he intended to evade him there slipping his arm carelessly in the youths he concluded to open fire at once  bob he said with irresistible gravity i did not know when i met you this morning that i had the honor of addressing a poetnone other than the famous author of underbrush  the boy started back and endeavored to withdraw his arm but mr hamlin tightened his hold without however changing his careless expression  you see he continued the editor is a friend of mine and being afraid this package might not get into the right handsas you didnt give your namehe deputized me to come here and see that it was all square as youre rather young for all youre so gifted i reckon id better go home with you and take a receipt from your parents thats about square i think  the consternation of the boy was so evident and so far beyond mr hamlins expectation that he instantly halted him gazed into his shifting eyes and gave a long whistle  who said it was for me wot you talkin about lemme go gasped the boy with the short intermittent breath of mingled fear and passion  bob said mr hamlin in a singularly colorless voice which was very rare with him and an expression quite unlike his own what is your little game  the boy looked down in dogged silence  out with it who are you playing this on  its all among my own folks its nothin to you said the boy suddenly beginning to struggle violently as if inspired by this extenuating fact  among your own folks eh white violet and the rest eh but shes not in it  no reply  hand me over that package ill give it back to you again  the boy handed it to mr hamlin he read the letter and found the inclosure contained a twentydollar goldpiece a halfsupercilious smile passed over his face at this revelation of the inadequate emoluments of literature and the trifling inducements to crime indeed i fear the affair began to take a less serious moral complexion in his eyes  then white violetyour sister cynthia you know continued mr hamlin in easy parenthesiswrote for this holding the coin contemplatively in his fingers and you calculated to nab it yourself  the quick searching glance with which bob received the name of his sister mr hamlin attributed only to his natural surprise that this stranger should be on such familiar terms with her but the boy responded immediately and bluntly  no she didnt write for it she didnt want nobody to know who she was nobody wrote for it but me nobody knew folks was paid for potry but me i found it out from a feller i wrote for it i wasnt goin to let that skunk of an editor have it himself  and you thought you would take it said hamlin his voice resuming its old tone well georgei mean bob your conduct was praiseworthy although your intentions were bad still twenty dollars is rather too much for your trouble suppose we say five and call it square he handed the astonished boy five dollars now george washington he continued taking four other twentydollar pieces from his pocket and adding them to the inclosure which he carefully refolded im going to give you another chance to live up to your reputation youll take that package and hand it to white violet and say you found it just as it is in the lockbox ill keep the letter for it would knock you endways if it was seen and ill make it all right with the editor but as ive got to tell him that ive seen white violet myself and know shes got it i expect you to manage in some way to have me see her ill manage the rest of it and i wont blow on you either youll come back to the hotel and tell me what youve done and now george concluded mr hamlin succeeding at last in fixing the boys evasive eye with a peculiar look it may be just as well for you to understand that i know every nook and corner of this place that ive already been through that underbrush you spoke of once this morning and that ive got a mare that can go wherever you can and a dd sight quicker  ill give the package to white violet said the boy doggedly  and youll come back to the hotel  the boy hesitated and then said ill come back  all right then adios general  bob disappeared around the corner of a crossroad at a rapid trot and mr hamlin turned into the hotel  smart little chap that he said to the barkeeper  you bet returned the man who having recognized mr hamlin was delighted at the prospect of conversing with a gentleman of such decidedly dangerous reputation but hes been allowed to run a little wild since old man delatour died and the widders got enough to do i reckon lookin arter her four gals and takin keer of old delatours ranch over yonder i guess its pretty hard sleddin for her sometimes to get cloes and grub for the famerly without follerin bob around  sharp girls too i reckon one of them writes things for the magazines doesnt shecynthia eh said mr hamlin carelessly  evidently this fact was not a notorious one to the barkeeper he however said dunno mabbee her father was eddicated and the widder delatour too though shes sorter queer ive heard tell lord mr hamlin you oughter remember old man delatour from opelousas louisiany you know high old sport french style frilled bosomopenhanded and uster buck agin faro awful why he dropped a heap o money to you over in san jose two years ago at poker you must remember him  the slightest possible flush passed over mr hamlins brow under the shadow of his hat but did not get lower than his eyes he suddenly had recalled the spendthrift delatour perfectly and as quickly regretted now that he had not doubled the honorarium he had just sent to his portionless daughter but he only said coolly no and then raising his pale face and audacious eyes continued in his laziest and most insulting manner no the fact is my mind is just now preoccupied in wondering if the gas is leaking anywhere and if anything is ever served over this bar except elegant conversation when the gentleman who mixes drinks comes back perhaps youll be good enough to tell him to send a whisky sour to mr jack hamlin in the parlor meantime you can turn off your soda fountain i dont want any fizz in mine  having thus quite recovered himself mr hamlin lounged gracefully across the hall into the parlor as he did so a darkish young man with a slim boyish figure a thin face and a discontented expression rose from an armchair held out his hand and with a saturnine smile said  jack  fred  the two men remained gazing at each other with a halfamused halfguarded expression mr hamlin was first to begin i didnt think youd be such a fool as to try on this kind of thing fred he said half seriously  yes but it was to keep you from being a much bigger one that i hunted you up said the editor mischievously read that i got it an hour after you left and he placed a little triumphantly in jacks hand the letter he had received from white violet  mr hamlin read it with an unmoved face and then laid his two hands on the editors shoulders yes my young friend and you sat down and wrote her a pretty letter and sent her twenty dollarswhich permit me to say was dd poor pay but that isnt your fault i reckon its the meanness of your proprietors  but it isnt the question either just now jack however you have been able to answer it do you mean to say seriously that you want to know anything more of a woman who could write such a letter  i dont know said jack cheerfully she might be a devilish sight funnier than if she hadnt written itwhich is the fact  you mean to say she didnt write it  yes  who did then  her brother bob  after a moments scrutiny of his friends bewildered face mr hamlin briefly related his adventures from the moment of his meeting bob at the mountainstream to the barkeepers gossiping comment and sequel therefore he concluded the author of underbrush is miss cynthia delatour one of four daughters of a widow who lives two miles from here at the crossing i shall see her this evening and make sure but tomorrow morning you will pay me the breakfast you owe me shes goodlooking but i cant say i fancy the poetic style its a little too hightoned for me however i love my love with a c because she is your contributor i hate her with a c because of her connections i met her by chance and treated her with civility her name is cynthia and she lives on a crossroad  but you surely dont expect you will ever see bob again said the editor impatiently you have trusted him with enough to start him for the sandwich islands to say nothing of the ruinous precedent you have established in his mind of the value of poetry i am surprised that a man of your knowledge of the world would have faith in that imp the second time  my knowledge of the world returned mr hamlin sententiously tells me thats the only way you can trust anybody once doesnt make a habit nor show a character i could see by his bungling that he had never tried this on before just now the temptation to wipe out his punishment by doing the square thing and coming back a sort of hero is stronger than any other tisnt everybody that gets that chance he added with an odd laugh  nevertheless three hours passed without bringing bob the two men had gone to the billiardroom when a waiter brought a note which he handed to mr hamlin with some apologetic hesitation it bore no superscription but had been brought by a boy who described mr hamlin perfectly and requested that the note should be handed to him with the remark that bob had come back  and is he there now asked mr hamlin holding the letter unopened in his hand  no sir he run right off  the editor laughed but mr hamlin having perused the note put away his cue come into my room he said  the editor followed and mr hamlin laid the note before him on the table bobs all right he said for ill bet a thousand dollars that note is genuine  it was delicately written in a cultivated feminine hand utterly unlike the scrawl that had first excited the editors curiosity and ran as follows   he who brought me the bounty of your friendfor i cannot call a recompense so far above my deserts by any other namegives me also to understand that you wished for an interview i cannot believe that this is mere idle curiosity or that you have any motive that is not kindly and honorable but i feel that i must beg and pray you not to seek to remove the veil behind which i have chosen to hide myself and my poor efforts from identification i think i know youi know i know myselfwell enough to believe it would give neither of us any happiness you will say to your generous friend that he has already given the unknown more comfort and hope than could come from any personal compliment or publicity and you will yourself believe that you have all unconsciously brightened a sad womans fancy with a dream and a vision that before today had been unknown to  white violet   have you read it asked mr hamlin  yes  then you dont want to see it any more or even remember you ever saw it said mr hamlin carefully tearing the note into small pieces and letting them drift from the windows like blown blossoms  but i say jack look here i dont understand you say you have already seen this woman and yet  i havent seen her said jack composedly turning from the window  what do you mean  i mean that you and i fred are going to drop this fooling right here and leave this place for frisco by first stage tomorrow andthat i owe you that dinner   chapter iv   when the stage for san francisco rolled away the next morning with mr hamlin and the editor the latter might have recognized in the occupant of a dustcovered buggy that was coming leisurely towards them the tall figure long beard and straight duster of his late visitor mr james bowers for mr bowers was on the same quest that the others had just abandoned like mr hamlin he had been left to his own resources but mr bowerss resources were a lifelong experience and technical skill he too had noted the topographical indications of the poem and his knowledge of the sylva of upper california pointed as unerringly as mr hamlins luck to the cryptogamous haunts of the summit such abnormal growths were indicative of certain localities only but as they were not remunerative from a pecuniary point of view were to be avoided by the sagacious woodman it was clear therefore that mr bowerss visit to green springs was not professional and that he did not even figuratively accept the omen  he baited and rested his horse at the hotel where his bucolic exterior however did not elicit that attention which had been accorded to mr hamlins charming insolence or the editors cultivated manner but he glanced over a township map on the walls of the readingroom and took note of the names of the owners of different lots farms and ranches passing that of delatour with the others then he drove leisurely in the direction of the woods and reaching them tied his horse to a young sapling in the shade and entered their domain with a shambling but familiar woodmans step  it is not the purpose of this brief chronicle to follow mr bowers in his professional diagnosis of the locality he recognized nature in one of her moods of wasteful extravagancea waste that his experienced eye could tell was also sapping the vitality of those outwardly robust shafts that rose around him he knew without testing them that half of these fairseeming columns were hollow and rotten at the core he could detect the chill odor of decay through the hot balsamic spices stirred by the wind that streamed through their long aisleslike incense mingling with the exhalations of a crypt he stopped now and then to part the heavy fronds down to their roots in the dank moss seeing again as he had told the editor the weird second twilight through their miniature stems and the microcosm of life that filled it but even while paying this tribute to the accuracy of the unknown poetess he was like his predecessor haunted more strongly by the atmosphere and melody of her verse its spell was upon him too unlike mr hamlin he did not sing he only halted once or twice silently combing his straight narrow beard with his three fingers until the action seemed to draw down the lines of his face into limitless dejection and an inscrutable melancholy filled his small gray eyes the few birds which had hailed mr hamlin as their successful rival fled away before the grotesque and angular halflength of mr bowers as if the wind had blown in a scarecrow from the distant farms  suddenly he observed the figure of a woman with her back towards him leaning motionless against a tree and apparently gazing intently in the direction of green springs he had approached so near to her that it was singular she had not heard him mr bowers was a bashful man in the presence of the other sex he felt exceedingly embarrassed if he could have gone away without attracting her attention he would have done so neither could he remain silent a tacit spy of her meditation he had recourse to a polite but singularly artificial cough  to his surprise she gave a faint cry turned quickly towards him and then shrank back and lapsed quite helpless against the tree her evident distress overcame his bashfulness he ran towards her  im sorry i frighted ye maam but i was afraid i might skeer ye more if i lay low and said nothin  even then if she had been some fair young country girl he would have relapsed after this speech into his former bashfulness but the face and figure she turned towards him were neither young nor fair a woman past forty with gray threads and splashes in her brushedback hair which was turned over her ears in two curls like frayed strands of rope her forehead was rather high than broad her nose large but wellshaped and her eyes full but so singularly light in color as to seem almost sightless the short upper lip of her large mouth displayed her teeth in an habitual smile which was in turn so flatly contradicted by every other line of her careworn face that it seemed gratuitously artificial her figure was hidden by a shapeless garment that partook equally of the shawl cloak and wrapper  i am very foolish she began in a voice and accent that at once asserted a cultivated woman but i so seldom meet anybody here that a voice quite startled me that and the heat she went on wiping her face into which the color was returning violentlyfor i seldom go out as early as thisi suppose affected me  mr bowers had that innate farwestern reverence for womanhood which i fancy challenges the most polished politeness he remained patient undemonstrative selfeffacing and respectful before her his angular arm slightly but not obtrusively advanced the offer of protection being in the act rather than in any spoken word and requiring no response  like as not maam he said cheerfully looking everywhere but in her burning face the sun is powful hot at this time o day i felt it myself comin yer and though the damp of this timber kinder sets it back its likely to come out agin ye cant check it no more than the sap in that choked limb tharhe pointed ostentatiously where a fallen pine had been caught in the bent and twisted arm of another but which still put out a few green tassels beyond the point of impact do you live far from here maam he added  only as far as the first turning below the hill  ive got my buggy here and im goin that way and i can jist set ye down thar cool and comfortable ef he continued in the same assuring tone without waiting for a reply yell jist take a good grip of my arm thar curving his wrist and hand behind him like a shepherds crook ill go first and break away the brush for ye  she obeyed mechanically and they fared on through the thick ferns in this fashion for some moments he looking ahead occasionally dropping a word of caution or encouragement but never glancing at her face when they reached the buggy he lifted her into it carefullyand perpendicularly it struck her afterwards very much as if she had been a transplanted sapling with bared and sensitive rootsand then gravely took his place beside her  bein in the timber trade myself maam he said gathering up the reins i chanced to sight these woods and took a look around my name is bowers of mendocino i reckon there aint much that grows in the way o standin timber on the pacific slope that i dont know and cant locate though i do say it ive got ez big a mill and ez big a run in my district ez there is anywhere ef youre ever up my way you ask for bowersjim bowersand thats me  there is probably nothing more conducive to conversation between strangers than a wholesome and early recognition of each others foibles mr bowers believing his chance acquaintance a superior woman naively spoke of himself in a way that he hoped would reassure her that she was not compromising herself in accepting his civility and so satisfy what must be her inevitable pride on the other hand the woman regained her selfpossession by this exhibition of mr bowerss vanity and revived by the refreshing breeze caused by the rapid motion of the buggy along the road thanked him graciously  i suppose there are many strangers at the green springs hotel she said after a pause  i didnt get to see em as i only put up my hoss there he replied but i know the stage took some away this mornin it seemed pretty well loaded up when i passed it  the woman drew a deep sigh the act struck mr bowers as a possible return of her former nervous weakness her attention must at once be distracted at any costeven conversation  perhaps he began with sudden and appalling lightness im atalkin to mrs mcfadden  no said the woman abstractedly  then it must be mrs delatour there are only two township lots on that crossroad  my name is delatour she said somewhat wearily  mr bowers was conversationally stranded he was not at all anxious to know her name yet knowing it now it seemed to suggest that there was nothing more to say he would of course have preferred to ask her if she had read the poetry about the underbrush and if she knew the poetess and what she thought of it but the fact that she appeared to be an eddicated woman made him sensitive of displaying technical ignorance in his manner of talking about it she might ask him if it was subjective or objectivetwo words he had heard used at the debating society at mendocino on the question is poetry morally beneficial for a few moments he was silent but presently she took the initiative in conversation at first slowly and abstractedly and then as if appreciating his sympathetic reticence or mayhap finding some relief in monotonous expression talked mechanically deliberately but unostentatiously about herself so colorless was her intonation that at times it did not seem as if she was talking to him but repeating some conversation she had held with another  she had lived there ever since she had been in california her husband had bought the spanish title to the property when they first married the property at his death was found to be greatly involved she had been obliged to part with much of it to support her childrenfour girls and a boy she had been compelled to withdraw the girls from the convent at santa clara to help about the house the boy was too youngshe feared too shiftlessto do anything the farm did not pay the land was poor she knew nothing about farming she had been brought up in new orleans where her father had been a judge and she didnt understand country life of course she had been married too youngas all girls were lately she had thought of selling off and moving to san francisco where she would open a boardinghouse or a school for young ladies he could advise her perhaps of some good opportunity her own girls were far enough advanced to assist her in teaching one particularly cynthia was quite clever and spoke french and spanish fluently  as mr bowers was familiar with many of these counts in the feminine american indictment of life generally he was not perhaps greatly moved but in the last sentence he thought he saw an opening to return to his main object and looking up cautiously said  and mebbe write potry now and then to his great discomfiture the only effect of this suggestion was to check his companions speech for some moments and apparently throw her back into her former abstraction yet after a long pause as they were turning into the lane she said as if continuing the subject  i only hope that whatever my daughters may do they wont marry young  the yawning breaches in the delatour gates and fences presently came in view they were supposed to be reinforced by half a dozen dogs who however did their duty with what would seem to be the prevailing inefficiency retiring after a single perfunctory yelp to shameless stretching scratching and slumber their places were taken on the veranda by two negro servants two girls respectively of eight and eleven and a boy of fourteen who remained silently staring as mr bowers had accepted the widows polite invitation to enter she was compelled albeit in an equally dazed and helpless way to issue some preliminary orders  now chloei mean aunt dinahdo take eunicei mean victorine and unaaway andyou knowtidy them and you sarahits sarah isnt itlay some refreshment in the parlor for this gentleman and bob tell your sister cynthia to come here with eunice as bob still remained staring at mr bowers she added in weary explanation mr bowers brought me over from the summit woods in his buggyit was so hot thereshake hands and thank him and run awaydo  they crossed a broad but scantilyfurnished hall everywhere the same look of hopeless incompleteness temporary utility and premature decay most of the furniture was mismatched and misplaced many of the rooms had changed their original functions or doubled them a smell of cooking came from the library on whose shelves mingled with books were dresses and household linen and through the door of a room into which mrs delatour retired to remove her duster mr bowers caught a glimpse of a bed and of a table covered with books and papers at which a tall fair girl was writing in a few moments mrs delatour returned accompanied by this girl and eunice her shortlipped sister bob who joined the party seated around mr bowers and a table set with cake a decanter and glasses completed the group emboldened by the presence of the tall cynthia and his glimpse of her previous literary attitude mr bowers resolved to make one more attempt  i suppose these yer young ladies sometimes go to the wood too as his eye rested on cynthia she replied  oh yes  i reckon on account of the purty shadows down in the brush and the soft light eh and all that he continued with a playful manner but a serious accession of color  why the woods belong to us its mars property broke in eunice with a flash of teeth  well lordy i wanter know said mr bowers in some astonishment why thats right in my line too ive been sightin timber all along here and thats how i dropped in on yer mar then seeing a look of eagerness light up the faces of bob and eunice he was encouraged to make the most of his opportunity why maam he went on cheerfully i reckon youre holdin that wood at a pretty stiff figger now  why asked mrs delatour simply  mr bowers delivered a wink at bob and eunice who were still watching him with anxiety well not on account of the actool timber for the best of it aint sound he said but on account of its bein famous everybody that reads that powful pretty poem about it in the excelsior magazine wants to see it why it would pay the green springs hotelkeeper to buy it up for his customers but i spose you reckon to keep italong with the poetessin your famerly  although mr bowers long considered this speech as the happiest and most brilliant effort of his life its immediate effect was not perhaps all that could be desired the widow turned upon him a restrained and darkening face cynthia half rose with an appealing oh mar and bob and eunice having apparently pinched each other to the last stage of endurance retired precipitately from the room in a prolonged giggle  i have not yet thought of disposing of the summit woods mr bowers said mrs delatour coldly but if i should do so i will consult you you must excuse the children who see so little company they are quite unmanageable when strangers are present cynthia will you see if the servants have looked after mr bowerss horse you know bob is not to be trusted  there was clearly nothing else for mr bowers to do but to take his leave which he did respectfully if not altogether hopefully but when he had reached the lane his horse shied from the unwonted spectacle of bob swinging his hat and apparently awaiting him from the fork of a wayside sapling  hol up mister look here  mr bowers pulled up bob dropped into the road and after a backward glance over his shoulder said  drive longside the fence in the shadder as mr bowers obeyed bob approached the wheels of the buggy in a manner half shy half mysterious you wanter buy them summit woods mister  well peraps sonny why smiled mr bowers  coz ill tell ye suthin dont you be fooled into allowin that cynthia wrote that potry she didntno moren eunice nor me mar kinder let ye think it cos she dont want folks to think she did it but mar wrote that potry herself wrote it out o them thar woodsall by herself thars a heap more potry thar you bet and jist as good and shes the one that kin write ityou hear me thats my mar every time you buy that thar wood and get mar to run it for potry and youll make your pile sure i aint lyin youd better look spry thars another feller snoopin round yereonly he barked up the wrong tree and thought it was cynthia jist as you did  another feller repeated the astonished bowers  yes a riglar sport he was orful keen on that potry too you bet so youd better hump yourself afore somebody else cuts in mar got a hundred dollars for that pome from that editor feller and his pardner i reckon thats the riglar price eh he added with a sudden suspicious caution  i reckon so replied mr bowers blankly butlook here bob do you mean to say it was your motheryour mother bob who wrote that poem are you sure  dye think im lyin said bob scornfully dont i know dont i copy em out plain for her so as folks wont know her handwrite go way youre loony then possibly doubting if this latter expression were strictly diplomatic with the business in hand he added in halfreproach halfapology dont ye see i dont want ye to be fooled into losin yer chance o buying up that summit wood its the cold truth im tellin ye  mr bowers no longer doubted it disappointed as he undoubtedly was at firstand even selfdeceivedhe recognized in a flash the grim fact that the boy had stated he recalled the apparition of the sadfaced woman in the woodher distressed manner that to his inexperienced mind now took upon itself the agitated trembling of disturbed mystic inspiration a sense of sadness and remorse succeeded his first shock of disappointment  well are ye going to buy the woods said bob eying him grimly yed better say  mr bowers started i shouldnt wonder bob he said with a smile gathering up his reins anyhow im comin back to see your mother this afternoon and meantime bob you keep the first chance for me  he drove away leaving the youthful diplomatist standing with his bare feet in the dust for a minute or two the young gentleman amused himself by a few light saltatory steps in the road then a smile of scornful superiority mingled perhaps with a sense of previous slights and unappreciation drew back his little upper lip and brightened his mottled cheek  id like ter know he said darkly what this yer godforsaken famerly would do without me   chapter v   it is to be presumed that the editor and mr hamlin mutually kept to their tacit agreement to respect the impersonality of the poetess for during the next three months the subject was seldom alluded to by either yet in that period white violet had sent two other contributions and on each occasion mr hamlin had insisted upon increasing the honorarium to the amount of his former gift in vain the editor pointed out the danger of this form of munificence mr hamlin retorted by saying that if he refused he would appeal to the proprietor who certainly would not object to taking the credit of this liberality as to the risks concluded jack sententiously ill take them and as far as youre concerned you certainly get the worth of your money  indeed if popularity was an indiction this had become suddenly true for the poetesss third contribution without changing its strong local color and individuality had been an unexpected outburst of human passiona lovesong that touched those to whom the subtler meditative graces of the poetess had been unknown many people had listened to this impassioned but despairing cry from some remote and charmed solitude who had never read poetry before who translated it into their own limited vocabulary and more limited experience and were inexpressibly affected to find that they too understood it it was caught up and echoed by the feverish adventurous and unsatisfied life that filled that day and time even the editor was surprised and frightened like most cultivated men he distrusted popularity like all men who believe in their own individual judgment he doubted collective wisdom yet now that his protegee had been accepted by others he questioned that judgment and became her critic it struck him that her sudden outburst was strained it seemed to him that in this mere contortion of passion the sibyls robe had become rudely disarranged he spoke to hamlin and even approached the tabooed subject  did you see anything that suggested this sort of business ininthat womani mean inyour pilgrimage jack  no responded jack gravely but its easy to see shes got hold of some hayfooted fellow up there in the mountains with straws in his hair and is playing him for all hes worth you wont get much more poetry out of her i reckon  is was not long after this conversation that one afternoon when the editor was alone mr james bowers entered the editorial room with much of the hesitation and irresolution of his previous visit as the editor had not only forgotten him but even dissociated him with the poetess mr bowers was fain to meet his unresponsive eye and manner with some explanation  ye disremember my comin here mr editor to ask you the name o the lady who called herself white violet and how you allowed you couldnt give it but would write and ask for it  mr editor leaning back in his chair now remembered the occurrence but was distressed to add that the situation remained unchanged and that he had received no such permission  never mind that my lad said mr bowers gravely waving his hand i understand all that but ez ive known the lady ever since and am now visiting her at her house on the summit i reckon it dont make much matter  it was quite characteristic of mr bowerss smileless earnestness that he made no ostentation of this dramatic retort nor of the undisguised stupefaction of the editor  do you mean to say that you have met white violet the author of these poems repeated the editor  which her name is delatourthe widder delatourez she has herself give me permission to tell you continued mr bowers with a certain abstracted and automatic precision that dissipated any suggestion of malice in the reversed situation  delatoura widow repeated the editor  with five children continued mr bowers then with unalterable gravity he briefly gave an outline of her condition and the circumstances of his acquaintance with her  but i reckoned you might have known suthin o this though she never let on you did he concluded eying the editor with troubled curiosity  the editor did not think it necessary to implicate mr hamlin he said briefly i oh no  of course you might not have seen her said mr bowers keeping the same grave troubled gaze on the editor  of course not said the editor somewhat impatient under the singular scrutiny of mr bowers and im very anxious to know how she looks tell me what is she like  she is a fine powful eddicated woman said mr bowers with slow deliberation yes sira powful woman havin grand ideas of her own and holdin to em he had withdrawn his eyes from the editor and apparently addressed the ceiling in confidence  but what does she look like mr bowers said the editor smiling  well sir she lookslikeit yeswith deliberate cautioni should say just like it  after a pause apparently to allow the editor to materialize this ravishing description he said gently are you busy just now  not very what can i do for you  well not much for me i reckon he returned with a deeper respiration that was his nearest approach to a sigh but suthin perhaps for yourself andanother are you married  no said the editor promptly  nor engaged to anyyoung ladywith great politeness  no  well mebbe you think it a queer thing for me to saymebbe you reckon you know it ez well ez anybodybut its my opinion that white violet is in love with you  with me ejaculated the editor in a hopeless astonishment that at last gave way to an incredulous and irresistible laugh  a slight touch of pain passed over mr bowerss dejected face but left the deep outlines set with a rude dignity its so he said slowly though as a young man and a gay feller ye may think its funny  no not funny but a terrible blunder mr bowers for i give you my word i know nothing of the lady and have never set eyes upon her  no but she has on you i cant say continued mr bowers with sublime naivete that id ever recognize you from her description but a woman o that kind dont see with her eyes like you and me but with all her senses to onct and a heap more that aint senses as we know em the same eyes that seed down through the brush and ferns in the summit woods the same ears that heerd the music of the wind trailin through the pines dont see you with my eyes or hear you with my ears and when she paints you its natril for a woman with that powful mind and grand idees to dip her brush into her hearts blood for warmth and color yer smilin young man well go on and smile at me my lad but not at her for you dont know her when you know her story as i do when you know she was made a wife afore she ever knew what it was to be a young woman when you know that the man she married never understood the kind o critter he was tied to no more than ef hed been a steer yoked to a morgan colt when ye know she had children growin up around her afore she had given over bein a sort of child herself when ye know she worked and slaved for that man and those children about the househer heart her soul and all her powful mind bein all the time in the woods along with the flickering leaves and the shadderswhen ye mind she couldnt get the small ways o the ranch because she had the big ways o natur that made itthen youll understand her  impressed by the sincerity of his visitors manner touched by the unexpected poetry of his appeal and yet keenly alive to the absurdity of an incomprehensible blunder somewhere committed the editor gasped almost hysterically  but why should all this make her in love with me  because ye are both gifted returned mr bowers with sad but unconquerable conviction because yere both so to speak in a line o idees and business that draws ye togetherto lean on each other and trust each other ez pardners not that ye are ezakly her ekal he went on with a return to his previous exasperating naivete though ive heerd promisin things of ye and yere still young but in matters o this kind there is allers one ez hez to be looked up to by the otherand ginrally the wrong one she looks up to you mr editorits part of her potryez she looks down inter the brush and sees more than is plain to you and me not he continued with a courteously deprecating wave of the hand ez you haint bin kind to hermebbe too kind for thars the purty letter you writ her thars the perlite easy captivatin way you had with her gals and that boyhold onas the editor made a gesture of despairing renunciationi aint sayin you aint right in keepin it to yourselfand thars the extry money you sent her every time stop she knows it was extry for she made a pint o gettin me to find out the market price o potry in papers and magazines and she reckons youve bin payin her four hundred per cent above them figgershold on i aint sayin it aint free and liberal in you and id have done the same thing yet she thinks  but the editor had risen hastily to his feet with flushing cheeks  one moment mr bowers he said hurriedly this is the most dreadful blunder of all the gift is not mine it was the spontaneous offering of another who really admired our friends worka gentleman whohe stopped suddenly  the sound of a familiar voice lightly humming was borne along the passage the light tread of a familiar foot was approaching the editor turned quickly towards the open doorso quickly that mr bowers was fain to turn also  for a charming instant the figure of jack hamlin handsome careless and confident was framed in the doorway his dark eyes with their habitual scorn of his average fellowman swept superciliously over mr bowers and rested for an instant with caressing familiarity on the editor  well sonny any news from the old girl at the summit  noo hastily stammered the editor with a halfhysterical laugh no jack excuse me a moment  all right busy i see hasta manana  the picture vanished the frame was empty  you see continued the editor turning to mr bowers there has been a mistake ibut he stopped suddenly at the ashen face of mr bowers still fixed in the direction of the vanished figure  are you ill  mr bowers did not reply but slowly withdrew his eyes and turned them heavily on the editor then drawing a longer deeper breath he picked up his soft felt hat and moulding it into shape in his hands as if preparing to put it on he moistened his dry grayish lips and said gently  friend o yours  yes said the editorjack hamlin of course you know him  yes  mr bowers here put his hat on his head and after a pause turned round slowly once or twice as if he had forgotten it and was still seeking it finally he succeeded in finding the editors hand and shook it albeit his own trembled slightly then he said  i reckon youre right theres bin a mistake i see it now goodby if youre ever up my way drop in and see me he then walked to the doorway passed out and seemed to melt into the afternoon shadows of the hall  he never again entered the office of the excelsior magazine neither was any further contribution ever received from white violet to a polite entreaty from the editor addressed first to white violet and then to mrs delatour there was no response the thought of mr hamlins cynical prophecy disturbed him but that gentleman preoccupied in filling some professional engagements in sacramento gave him no chance to acquire further explanations as to the past or the future the youthful editor was at first in despair and filled with a vague remorse of some unfulfilled duty but to his surprise the readers of the magazine seemed to survive their talented contributor and the feverish life that had been thrilled by her song in two months had apparently forgotten her nor was her voice lifted from any alien quarter the domestic and foreign press that had echoed her lays seemed to respond no longer to her utterance  it is possible that some readers of these pages may remember a previous chronicle by the same historian wherein it was recorded that the volatile spirit of mr hamlin slightly assisted by circumstances passed beyond these voices at the ranch of the blessed fisherman some two years later as the editor stood beside the body of his friend on the morning of the funeral he noticed among the flowers laid upon his bier by loving hands a wreath of white violets touched and disturbed by a memory long since forgotten he was further embarrassed as the cortege dispersed in the mission graveyard by the apparition of the tall figure of mr james bowers from behind a monumental column the editor turned to him quickly  i am glad to see you here he said awkwardly and he knew not why then after a pause i trust you can give me some news of mrs delatour i wrote to her nearly two years ago but had no response  thars bin no mrs delatour for two years said mr bowers contemplatively stroking his beard and mebbe thats why shes bin for two years mrs bowers  i congratulate you said the editor but i hope there still remains a white violet and that for the sake of literature she has not given up  mrs bowers interrupted mr bowers with singular deliberation found that makin potry and tendin to the cares of a growinup famerly was irritatin to the narves they didnt jibe so to speak what mrs bowers wantedand what potry or no potry ive bin tryin to give herwas rest shes bin havin it comforbly up at my ranch at mendocino with her children and me yes sirhis eye wandered accidentally to the newmade graveyoull excuse my sayin it to a man in your profession but its what most folks will find is a heap better than readin or writin or actin potryand thats rest     the chatelaine of burnt ridge   chapter i   it had grown dark on burnt ridge seen from below the whole serrated crest that had glittered in the sunset as if its interstices were eaten by consuming fires now closed up its ranks of blackened shafts and became again harsh and sombre chevaux de frise against the sky a faint glow still lingered over the red valley road as if it were its own reflection rather than any light from beyond the darkened ridge night was already creeping up out of remote canyons and along the furrowed flanks of the mountain or settling on the nearer woods with the sound of homecoming and innumerable wings at a point where the road began to encroach upon the mountainside in its slow winding ascent the darkness had become so real that a young girl cantering along the rising terrace found difficulty in guiding her horse with eyes still dazzled by the sunset fires  in spite of her precautions the animal suddenly shied at some object in the obscured roadway and nearly unseated her the accident disclosed not only the fact that she was riding in a mans saddle but also a foot and ankle that her ordinary walkingdress was too short to hide it was evident that her equestrian exercise was extempore and that at that hour and on that road she had not expected to meet company but she was apparently a good horsewoman for the mischance which might have thrown a less practical or more timid rider seemed of little moment to her with a strong hand and determined gesture she wheeled her frightened horse back into the track and rode him directly at the object but here she herself slightly recoiled for it was the body of a man lying in the road  as she leaned forward over her horses shoulder she could see by the dim light that he was a miner and that though motionless he was breathing stertorously drunk no doubtan accident of the locality alarming only to her horse but although she cantered impatiently forward she had not proceeded a hundred yards before she stopped reflectively and trotted back again he had not moved she could now see that his head and shoulders were covered with broken clods of earth and gravel and smaller fragments lay at his side a dozen feet above him on the hillside there was a foot trail which ran parallel with the bridleroad and occasionally overhung it it seemed possible that he might have fallen from the trail and been stunned  dismounting she succeeded in dragging him to a safer position by the bank the act discovered his face which was young and unknown to her wiping it with the silk handkerchief which was loosely slung around his neck after the fashion of his class she gave a quick feminine glance around her and then approached her own and rather handsome face near his lips there was no odor of alcohol in the thick and heavy respiration mounting again she rode forward at an accelerated pace and in twenty minutes had reached a higher tableland of the mountain a cleared opening in the forest that showed signs of careful cultivation and a large rambling yet picturesquelooking dwelling whose unpainted redwood walls were hidden in roses and creepers pushing open a swinging gate she entered the inclosure as a brownfaced man dressed as a vaquero came towards her as if to assist her to alight but she had already leaped to the ground and thrown him the reins  miguel she said with a mistresss quiet authority in her boyish contralto voice put glory in the covered wagon and drive down the road as far as the valley turning theres a man lying near the right bank drunk or sick may be or perhaps crippled by a fall bring him up here unless somebody has found him already or you happen to know who he is and where to take him  the vaquero raised his shoulders half in disappointed expectation of some other command and your brother senora he has not himself arrived  a light shadow of impatience crossed her face no she said bluntly come be quick  she turned towards the house as the man moved away already a gauntlooking old man had appeared in the porch and was awaiting her with his hand shadowing his angry suspicious eyes and his lips moving querulously  of course youve got to stand out there and give orders and tend to your own business afore you think o speaking to your own flesh and blood he said aggrievedly thats all you care  there was a sick man lying in the road and ive sent miguel to look after him returned the girl with a certain contemptuous resignation  oh yes struck in another voice which seemed to belong to the female of the first speakers species and to be its equal in age and temper and i reckon you saw a jay bird on a tree or a squirrel on the fence and either of em was more important to you than your own brother  steve didnt come by the stage and didnt send any message continued the young girl with the same coldly resigned manner no one had any news of him and as i told you before i didnt expect any  why dont you say right out you didnt want any said the old man sneeringly much you inquired no i orter hev gone myself and i would if i was master here instead of me and your mother bein the dust of the yearth beneath your feet  the young girl entered the house followed by the old man passing an old woman seated by the window who seemed to be nursing her resentment and a large bible which she held clasped against her shawled bosom at the same moment going to the wall she hung up her large hat and slightly shook the red dust from her skirts as she continued her explanation in the same deep voice with a certain monotony of logic and possibly of purpose and practice also  you and mother know as well as i do father that stephen is no more to be depended upon than the wind that blows its three years since he has been promising to come and even getting money to come and yet he has never showed his face though he has been a dozen times within five miles of this house he doesnt come because he doesnt want to come as to your going over to the stageoffice i went there myself at the last moment to save you the mortification of asking questions of strangers that they know have been a dozen times answered already  there was such a ring of absolute truthfulness albeit worn by repetition in the young girls deep honest voice that for one instant her two more emotional relatives quailed before it but only for a moment  thats right shrilled the old woman go on and abuse your own brother its only the fear you have that hell make his fortune yet and shame you before the father and mother you despise  the young girl remained standing by the window motionless and apparently passive as if receiving an accepted and usual punishment but here the elder woman gave way to sobs and some incoherent snuffling at which the younger went away whether she recognized in her mothers tears the ordinary deliquescence of emotion or whether as a woman herself she knew that this mere feminine conventionality could not possibly be directed at her and that the actual conflict between them had ceased she passed slowly on to an inner hall leaving the male victim her unfortunate father to succumb as he always did sooner or later to their influence crossing the hall which was decorated with a few elk horns indian trophies and mountain pelts she entered another room and closed the door behind her with a gesture of relief  the room which looked upon a porch presented a singular combination of masculine business occupations and feminine taste and adornment a desk covered with papers a shelf displaying a ledger and accountbooks another containing works of reference a table with a vase of flowers and a ladys ridingwhip upon it a map of california flanked on either side by an embroidered silken workbag and an oval mirror decked with grasses a calendar and interesttable hanging below two schoolgirl crayons of classic heads with the legend josephine forsyth fecitwere part of its incongruous accessories the young girl went to her desk but presently moved and turned towards the window thoughtfully the last gleam had died from the steelblue sky a few lights like star points began to prick out the lower valley the expression of monotonous restraint and endurance had not yet faded from her face  yet she had been accustomed to scenes like the one she had just passed though since her girlhood five years ago alexander forsyth her uncle had brought her to this spotthen a mere log cabin on the hillsideas a refuge from the impoverished and shiftless home of his elder brother thomas and his illtempered wife here alexander forsyth by reason of his more dominant character and business capacity had prospered until he became a rich and influential ranch owner notwithstanding her fathers jealousy of alexanders fortune and the open rupture that followed between the brothers josephine retained her position in the heart and home of her uncle without espousing the cause of either and her father was too prudent not to recognize the near and prospective advantages of such a mediator accustomed to her parents extravagant denunciations and her uncles more repressed but practical contempt of them the unfortunate girl early developed a cynical disbelief in the virtues of kinship in the abstract and a philosophical resignation to its effects upon her personally believing that her father and uncle fairly represented the fraternal principle she was quite prepared for the early defection and distrust of her vagabond and dissipated brother stephen and accepted it calmly true to an odd standard of justice which she had erected from the crumbling ruins of her own domestic life she was tolerant of everything but human perfection this quality however fatal to her higher growth had given her a peculiar capacity for business which endeared her to her uncle familiar with the strong passions and prejudices of men she had none of those feminine meannesses a wholesome distrust of which had kept her uncle a bachelor it was not strange therefore that when he died two years ago it was found that he had left her his entire property real and personal limited only by a single condition she was to undertake the vocation of a sole trader and carry on the business under the name of j forsyth if she married the estate and property was to be held distinct from her husbands inalienable under the married womans property act and subject during her life only to her own control and personal responsibilities as a trader  the intense disgust and discomfiture of her parents who had expected to more actively participate in their brothers fortune may be imagined but it was not equal to their fury when josephine instead of providing for them a separate maintenance out of her abundance simply offered to transfer them and her brother to her own house on a domestic but not a business equality there being no alternative but their former precarious shiftless life in their playedout claim in the valley they wisely consented reserving the sacred right of daily protest and objurgation in the economy of burnt ridge ranch they alone took it upon themselves to represent the shattered domestic altar and its outraged lares and penates and so conscientiously did they perform their task as even occasionally to impede the business visitor to the ranch and to cause some of the more practical neighbors seriously to doubt the young girls commercial wisdom but she was firm whether she thought her parents a necessity of respectable domesticity or whether she regarded their presence in the light of a penitential atonement for some previous disregard of them no one knew public opinion inclined to the latter  the black line of ridge faded out with her abstraction and she turned from the window and lit the lamp on her desk the yellow light illuminated her face and figure in their womanly graces there was no trace of what some people believed to be a masculine character except a singularly frank look of critical inquiry and patient attention in her dark eyes her long brown hair was somewhat rigidly twisted into a knot on the top of her head as if more for security than ornament brown was also the prevailing tint of her eyebrows thicklyset eyelashes and eyes and was even suggested in the slight sallowness of her complexion but her lips were wellcut and freshcolored and her hands and feet small and finely formed she would have passed for a pretty girl had she not suggested something more  she sat down and began to examine a pile of papers before her with that concentration and attention to detail which was characteristic of her eyes pausing at times with prettily knit brows and her penholder between her lips in the semblance of a pout that was pleasant enough to see suddenly the rattle of hoofs and wheels struck her with the sense of something forgotten and she put down her work quickly and stood up listening the sound of rough voices and her fathers querulous accents was broken upon by a cultivated and more familiar utterance all right ill speak to her at once wait there and the door opened to the wellknown physician of burnt ridge dr duchesne  look here he said with an abruptness that was only saved from being brusque by a softer intonation and a reassuring smile i met miguel helping an accident into your buggy your orders eh  oh yes said josephine quietly a man i saw on the road  well its a bad case and wants prompt attention and as your house is the nearest i came with him here  certainly she said gravely take him to the second room beyondsteves roomits ready she explained to two dusky shadows in the hall behind the doctor  and look here said the doctor partly closing the door behind him and regarding her with critical eyes you always said youd like to see some of my queer cases well this is onea serious one too in fact its just touch and go with him theres a piece of the bone pressing on the brain no bigger than that but as much as if all burnt ridge was atop of him im going to lift it i want somebody here to stand by some one who can lend a hand with a sponge ehsome one who isnt going to faint or scream or even shake a hairsbreadth eh  the color rose quickly to the girls cheek and her eyes kindled ill come she said thoughtfully who is he  the doctor stared slightly at the unessential query dont knowone of the river miners i reckon its an urgent case ill go and get everything ready youd better he added with an ominous glance at her gray frock put something over your dress the suggestion made her grave but did not alter her color  a moment later she entered the room it was the one that had always been set apart for her brother the very bed on which the unconscious man lay had been arranged that morning with her own hands something of this passed through her mind as she saw that the doctor had wheeled it beneath the strong light in the centre of the room stripped its outer coverings with professional thoughtfulness and rearranged the mattresses but it did not seem like the same room there was a pungent odor in the air from some freshlyopened phial an almost feminine neatness and luxury in an open morocco case like a jewel box on the table shining with spotless steel at the head of the bed one of her own servants the powerful mill foreman was assisting with the mingled curiosity and blase experience of one accustomed to smashed and lacerated digits at first she did not look at the central unconscious figure on the bed whose sufferings seemed to her to have been vicariously transferred to the concerned eager and drawn faces that looked down upon its immunity then she femininely recoiled before the bared white neck and shoulders displayed above the quilt until forcing herself to look upon the face halfconcealed by bandages and the head from which the dark tangles of hair had been ruthlessly sheared she began to share the doctors unconcern in his personality what mattered who or what he was it wasa case  the operation began with the same earnest intelligence that she had previously shown she quickly and noiselessly obeyed the doctors whispered orders and even half anticipated them she was conscious of a singular curiosity that far from being mean or ignoble seemed to lift her not only above the ordinary weaknesses of her own sex but made her superior to the men around her almost before she knew it the operation was over and she regarded with equal curiosity the ostentatious solicitude with which the doctor seemed to be wiping his fateful instrument that bore an odd resemblance to a silverhandled centrebit the stertorous breathing below the bandages had given way to a fainter but more natural respiration there was a moment of suspense the doctors hand left the pulse and lifted the closed eyelid of the sufferer a slight movement passed over the figure the sluggish face had cleared life seemed to struggle back into it before even the dull eyes participated in the glow dr duchesne with a sudden gesture waved aside his companions but not before josephine had bent her head eagerly forward  he is coming to she said  at the sound of that deep clear voicethe first to break the hush of the roomthe dull eyes leaped up and the head turned in its direction the lips moved and uttered a single rapid sentence the girl recoiled  youre all right now said the doctor cheerfully intent only upon the form before him  the lips moved again but this time feebly and vacantly the eyes were staring vaguely around  whats matter whats all about said the man thickly  youve had a fall think a moment where do you live  again the lips moved but this time only to emit a confused incoherent murmur dr duchesne looked grave but recovered himself quickly  that will do leave him alone now he said brusquely to the others  but josephine lingered  he spoke well enough just now she said eagerly did you hear what he said  not exactly said the doctor abstractedly gazing at the man  he said youll have to kill me first said josephine slowly  humph said the doctor passing his hand backwards and forwards before the mans eyes to note any change in the staring pupils  yes continued josephine gravely i suppose she added cautiously he was thinking of the operationof what you had just done to him  what i had done to him oh yes   chapter ii   before noon the next day it was known throughout burnt ridge valley that dr duchesne had performed a difficult operation upon an unknown man who had been picked up unconscious from a fall and carried to burnt ridge ranch but although the unfortunate mans life was saved by the operation he had only momentarily recovered consciousnessrelapsing into a semiidiotic state which effectively stopped the discovery of any clue to his friends or his identity as it was evidently an accident which in that rude communityand even in some more civilized onesconveyed a vague impression of some contributary incapacity on the part of the victim or some providential interference of a retributive character burnt ridge gave itself little trouble about it it is unnecessary to say that mr and mrs forsyth gave themselves and josephine much more they had a theory and a grievance satisfied from the first that the alleged victim was a drunken tramp who submitted to have a hole bored in his head in order to foist himself upon the ranch they were loud in their protests even hinting at a conspiracy between josephine and the stranger to supplant her brother in the property as he had already in the spare bedroom didnt all that yer happen the very night she pretended to go for stepheneh said mrs forsyth tell me that and didnt she have it all arranged with the buggy to bring him here as that sneaking doctor let outeh looks mighty curious dont it she muttered darkly to the old man but although that gentleman even from his own selfish view would scarcely have submitted to a surgical operation and later idiocy as the price of insuring comfortable dependency he had no doubt others were base enough to do it and lent a willing ear to his wifes suspicions  josephines personal knowledge of the stranger went little further doctor duchesne had confessed to her his professional disappointment at the incomplete results of the operation he had saved the mans life but as yet not his reason there was still hope however for the diagnosis revealed nothing that might prejudice a favorable progress it was a most interesting case he would watch it carefully and as soon as the patient could be removed would take him to the county hospital where under his own eyes the poor fellow would have the benefit of the latest science and the highest specialists physically he was doing remarkably well indeed he must have been a fine young chap free from blood taint or vicious complication whose flesh had healed like an infants it should be recorded that it was at this juncture that mrs forsyth first learnt that a silver plate let into the artful strangers skull was an adjunct of the healing process convinced that this infamous extravagance was part and parcel of the conspiracy and was only the beginning of other assimilations of the forsyths metallic substance that the plate was probably polished and burnished with a fulsome inscription to the doctors skill and would pass into the possession and adornment of a perfect stranger her rage knew no bounds he or his friends ought to be made to pay for it or work it out in vain it was declared that a few dollars were all that was found in the mans pocket and that no memoranda gave any indication of his name friends or history beyond the suggestion that he came from a distance this was clearly a part of the conspiracy even josephines practical good sense was obliged to take note of this singular absence of all record regarding him and the apparent obliteration of everything that might be responsible for his ultimate fate  homeless friendless helpless and even nameless the unfortunate man of twentyfive was thus left to the tender mercies of the mistress of burnt ridge ranch as if he had been a newborn foundling laid at her door but this mere claim of weakness was not all it was supplemented by a singular personal appeal to josephines nature from the time that he turned his head towards her voice on that fateful night his eyes had always followed her around the room with a wondering yearning canine halfintelligence without being able to convince herself that he understood her better than his regular attendant furnished by the doctor she could not fail to see that he obeyed her implicitly and that whenever any difficulty arose between him and his nurse she was always appealed to her pride in this proof of her practical sovereignty was flattered and when doctor duchesne finally admitted that although the patient was now physically able to be removed to the hospital yet he would lose in the change that very strong factor which josephine had become in his mental recovery the young girl as frankly suggested that he should stay as long as there was any hope of restoring his reason doctor duchesne was delighted with all his enthusiasm for science he had a professional distrust of some of its disciples and perhaps was not sorry to keep this most interesting case in his own hands to him her suggestion was only a womanly kindness tempered with womanly curiosity but the astonishment and stupefaction of her parents at this evident corroboration of suspicions they had as yet only half believed was tinged with superstitious dread had she fallen in love with this helpless stranger or more awful to contemplate was he really no stranger but a surreptitious lover thus strategically brought under her roof for once they refrained from open criticism the very magnitude of their suspicions left them dumb  it was thus that the virgin chatelaine of burnt ridge ranch was left to gaze untrammeled upon her pale and handsome guest whose silken bearded lips and sad childlike eyes might have suggested a more exalted sufferer in their absence of any suggestion of a grosser material manhood but even this imaginative appeal did not enter into her feelings she felt for her goodlooking helpless patient a profound and honest pity i do not know whether she had ever heard that pity was akin to love she would probably have resented that utterly untenable and atrocious commonplace there was no suggestion real or illusive of any previous masterful quality in the man which might have made his present dependent condition picturesque by contrast he had come to her handicapped by an unromantic accident and a practical want of energy and intellect he would have to touch her interest anew if indeed he would ever succeed in dispelling the old impression his beauty in a community of picturesquely handsome men had little weight with her except to accent the contrast with their fuller manhood  her life had given her no illusions in regard to the other sex she had found them however more congenial and safer companions than women and more accessible to her own sense of justice and honor in return they had respected and admired rather than loved her in spite of her womanly graces if she had at times contemplated eventual marriage it was only as a possible practical partnership in her business but as she lived in a country where men thought it dishonorable and a proof of incompetency to rise by their wives superior fortune she had been free from that kind of mercenary persecution even from men who might have worshiped her in hopeless and silent honor  for this reason there was nothing in the situation that suggested a single compromising speculation in the minds of the neighbors or disturbed her own tranquillity there seemed to be nothing in the future except a possible relief to her curiosity some day the unfortunate mans reason would be restored and he would tell his simple history perhaps he might explain what was in his mind when he turned to her the first evening with that singular sentence which had often recurred strangely to her she knew not why it did not strike her until later that it was because it had been the solitary indication of an energy and capacity that seemed unlike him nevertheless after that explanation she would have been quite willing to have shaken hands with him and parted  and yetfor there was an unexpressed remainder in her thoughtshe was never entirely free or uninfluenced in his presence the flickering vacancy of his sad eyes sometimes became fixed with a resolute immobility under the gentle questioning with which she had sought to draw out his faculties that both piqued and exasperated her he could say yes and no as she thought intelligently but he could not utter a coherent sentence nor write a word except like a child in imitation of his copy she taught him to repeat after her the names of the inanimate objects in the room then the names of the doctor his attendant the servant and finally her own under her christian prenomen with frontier familiarity but when she pointed to himself he waited for her to name him in vain she tried him with all the masculine names she knew his was not one of them or he would not or could not speak it for at times she rejected the professional dictum of the doctor that the faculty of memory was wholly paralyzed or held in abeyance even to the halfautomatic recollection of his letters yet she inconsistently began to teach him the alphabet with the same method andin her sublime unconsciousness of his manhoodwith the same discipline as if he were a very child when he had recovered sufficiently to leave his room she would lead him to the porch before her window and make him contented and happy by allowing him to watch her at work at her desk occasionally answering his wondering eyes with a word or stirring his faculties with a question i grieve to say that her parents had taken advantage of this publicity and his supposed helpless condition to show their disgust of his assumption to the extreme of making faces at himan act which he resented with such a furious glare that they retreated hurriedly to their own veranda a fresh though somewhat inconsistent grievance was added to their previous indictment of him if we aint found dead in our bed with our throats cut by that womans crazy husband they had settled by this time that there had been a clandestine marriage well be lucky groaned mrs forsyth  meantime the mountain summer waxed to its fullness of fire and fruition there were days when the crowded forest seemed choked and impeded with its own foliage and pungent and stifling with its own rank maturity when the long hillside ranks of wild oats thickset and impassable filled the air with the heated dust of germination in this quickening irritation of life it would be strange if the unfortunate mans torpid intellect was not helped in its awakening and he was allowed to ramble at will over the ranch but with the instinct of a domestic animal he always returned to the house and sat in the porch where josephine usually found him awaiting her when she herself returned from a visit to the mill coming thence one day she espied him on the mountainside leaning against a projecting ledge in an attitude so rapt and immovable that she felt compelled to approach him he appeared to be dumbly absorbed in the prospect which might have intoxicated a saner mind  half veiled by the heat that rose quiveringly from the fiery canyon below the domain of burnt ridge stretched away before him until lifted in successive terraces hearsed and plumed with pines it was at last lost in the ghostly snowpeaks but the practical josephine seized the opportunity to try once more to awaken the slumbering memory of her pupil following his gaze with signs and questions she sought to draw from him some indication of familiar recollection of certain points of the map thus unrolled behind him but in vain she even pointed out the fateful shadow of the overhanging ledge on the road where she had picked him upthere was no response in his abstracted eyes she bit her lips she was becoming irritated again then it occurred to her that instead of appealing to his hopeless memory she had better trust to some unreflective automatic instinct independent of it and she put the question a little forward when you leave us where will you go from here he stirred slightly and turned towards her she repeated her query slowly and patiently with signs and gestures recognized between them a faint glow of intelligence struggled into his eyes he lifted his arm slowly and pointed  ah those white peaksthe sierras she asked eagerly no reply beyond them  yes  the states no reply further still  he remained so patiently quiet and still pointing that she leaned forward and following with her eyes the direction of his hand saw that he was pointing to the sky  then a great quiet fell upon them the whole mountainside seemed to her to be hushed as if to allow her to grasp and realize for the first time the pathos of the ruined life at her side which it had known so long but which she had never felt till now the tears came to her eyes in her swift revulsion of feeling she caught the thin uplifted hand between her own it seemed to her that he was about to raise them to his lips but she withdrew them hastily and moved away she had a strange fear that if he had kissed them it might seem as if some dumb animal had touched themorit might not the next day she felt a consciousness of this in his presence and a wish that he was wellcured and away she determined to consult dr duchesne on the subject when he next called  but the doctor secure in the welfare of his patient had not visited him lately and she found herself presently absorbed in the business of the ranch which at this season was particularly trying there had also been a quarrel between dick shipley her mill foreman and miguel her ablest and most trusted vaquero and in her strict sense of impartial justice she was obliged to side on the merits of the case with shipley against her oldest retainer this troubled her as she knew that with the mexican nature fidelity and loyalty were not unmixed with quick and unreasoning jealousy for this reason she was somewhat watchful of the two men when work was over and there was a chance of their being thrown together once or twice she had remained up late to meet miguel returning from the posada at san ramon filled with aguardiente and a recollection of his wrongs and to see him safely bestowed before she herself retired it was on one of those occasions however that she learned that dick shipley hearing that miguel had disparaged him freely at the posada had broken the discipline of the ranch and absented himself the same night that miguel had leave with a view of facing his antagonist on his own ground to prevent this the fearless girl at once secretly set out alone to overtake and bring back the delinquent  for two or three hours the house was thus left to the sole occupancy of mr and mrs forsyth and the invalida fact only dimly suspected by the latter who had become vaguely conscious of josephines anxiety and had noticed the absence of light and movement in her room for this reason therefore having risen again and mechanically taken his seat in the porch to await her return he was startled by hearing her voice in the shadow of the lower porch accompanied by a hurried tapping against the door of the old couple the halfreasoning man arose and would have moved towards it but suddenly he stopped rigidly with white and parted lips and vacantly distended eyeballs  meantime the voice and muffled tapping had brought the tremulous fingers of old forsyth to the doorlatch he opened the door partly a slight figure that had been lurking in the shadow of the porch pushed rapidly through the opening there was a faint outcry quickly hushed and the door closed again the rays of a single candle showed the two old people hysterically clasping in their arms the figure that had entereda slight but viciouslooking young fellow of fiveandtwenty  there dn it he said impatiently in a voice whose rich depth was like josephines but whose querulous action was that of the two old people before him let me go and quit that i didnt come here to be strangled i want some moneymoney you hear devilish quick too for ive got to be off again before daylight so look sharp will you  but stevy dear when you didnt come that time three months ago but wrote from los angeles you said youd made a strike at last and  what are you talking about he interrupted violently that was just my lyin to keep you from worryin me three months agothree months ago why you must have been crazy to have swallowed it i hadnt a cent  nor have we said the old woman shrilly that hellish sister of yours still keeps us like beggars our only hope was you our own boy and now you only come toto go again  but she has money shes doing well and she shall give it to me he went on angrily she cant bully me with her business airs and morality who else has got a right to share if it is not her own brother  alas for the fatuousness of human malevolence had the unhappy couple related only the simple facts they knew about the new guest of burnt ridge ranch and the manner of his introduction they might have spared what followed  but the old woman broke into a vindictive cry who else stevewho else why the slut has brought a man herea sneaking deceitful underhanded crazy lover  oh has she said the young man fiercely yet secretly pleased at this promising evidence of his sisters human weakness where is she ill go to her shes in her room i suppose and before they could restrain him he had thrown off their impeding embraces and darted across the hall  the two old people stared doubtfully at each other for even this powerful ally whose strength however they were by no means sure of might succumb before the determined josephine prudence demanded a middle course aint they brother and sister said the old man with an air of virtuous toleration let em fight it out  the young man impatiently entered the room he remembered to have been his sisters by the light of the moon that streamed upon the window he could see she was not there he passed hurriedly to the door of her bedroom it was open the room was empty the bed unturned she was not in the houseshe had gone to the mill ah what was that they had said an infamous thought passed through the scoundrels mind then in what he half believed was an access of virtuous fury he began by the dim light to rummage in the drawers of the desk for such loose coin or valuables as in the perfect security of the ranch were often left unguarded suddenly he heard a heavy footstep on the threshold and turned  an awful visiona recollection so unexpected so ghostlike in that weird light that he thought he was losing his sensesstood before him it moved forwards with staring eyeballs and white and open lips from which a horrible inarticulate sound issued that was the speech of no living man with a single desperate almost superhuman effort stephen forsyth bounded aside leaped from the window and ran like a madman from the house then the apparition trembled collapsed and sank in an undistinguishable heap to the ground  when josephine forsyth returned an hour later with her mill foreman she was startled to find her helpless patient in a fit on the floor of her room with the assistance of her now converted and penitent employee she had the unfortunate man conveyed to his roombut not until she had thoughtfully rearranged the disorder of her desk and closed the open drawers without attracting dick shipleys attention in the morning hearing that the patient was still in the semiconscious exhaustion of his late attack but without seeing him she sent for dr duchesne the doctor arrived while she was absent at the mill where after a careful examination of his patient he sought her with some little excitement  well she said with eager gravity  well it looks as if your wish would be gratified your friend has had an epileptic fit but the physical shock has started his mental machinery again he has recovered his faculties his memory is returning he thinks and speaks coherently he is as sane as you and i  andsaid josephine questioning the doctors knitted eyebrows  i am not yet sure whether it was the result of some shock he doesnt remember or an irritation of the brain which would indicate that the operation had not been successful and that there was still some physical pressure or obstruction therein which case he would be subject to these attacks all his life  do you think his reason came before the fit or after asked the girl anxiously  i couldnt say had anything happened  i was away and found him on the floor on my return she answered half uneasily after a pause she said then he has told you his name and all about himself  yes its nothing at all he was a stranger just arrived from the states going to the minesthe old story had no near relations of course wasnt missed or asked after remembers walking along the ridge and falling over name john baxter of maine he paused and relaxing into a slight smile added i havent spoiled your romance have i  no she said with an answering smile then as the doctor walked briskly away she slightly knitted her pretty brows hung her head patted the ground with her little foot beyond the hem of her gown and said to herself the man was lying to him   chapter iii   on her return to the house josephine apparently contented herself with receiving the bulletin of the strangers condition from the servant for she did not enter his room she had obtained no theory of last nights incident from her parents who beyond a querulous agitation that was quickened by the news of his return to reason refrained from even that insidious comment which she half feared would follow when another day passed without her seeing him she nevertheless was conscious of a little embarrassment when his attendant brought her the request that she would give him a moments speech in the porch whither he had been removed  she found him physically weaker indeed so much so that she was fain even in her embarrassment to assist him back to the bench from which he had ceremoniously risen but she was so struck with the change in his face and manner a change so virile and masterful in spite of its gentle sadness of manner that she recoiled with a slight timidity as if he had been a stranger although she was also conscious that he seemed to be more at his ease than she was he began in a low exhausted voice but before he had finished his first sentence she felt herself in the presence of a superior  my thanks come very late miss forsyth he said with a faint smile but no one knows better than yourself the reason why or can better understand that they mean that the burden you have so generously taken on yourself is about to be lifted i know all miss forsyth since yesterday i have learned how much i owe you even my life i believe though i am afraid i must tell you in the same breath that that is of little worth to any one you have kindly helped and interested yourself in a poor stranger who turns out to be a nobody without friends without romance and without even mystery you found me lying in the road down yonder after a stupid accident that might have happened to any other careless tramp and which scarcely gave me a claim to a bed in the county hospital much less under this kindly roof it was not my fault as you know that all this did not come out sooner but while it doesnt lessen your generosity it doesnt lessen my debt and although i cannot hope to ever repay you i can at least keep the score from running on pardon my speaking so bluntly but my excuse for speaking at all was to say goodby and god bless you dr duchesne has promised to give me a lift on my way in his buggy when he goes  there was a slight touch of consciousness in his voice in spite of its sadness which struck the young girl as a weak and even ungentlemanly note in his otherwise selfabnegating and undemonstrative attitude if he was a common tramp he wouldnt talk in that way and if he wasnt why did he lie her practical good sense here asserted itself  but you are far from strong yet in fact the doctor says you might have a relapse at any moment and you havethat is you seem to have no money she said gravely  thats true he said quickly i remember i was quite played out when i entered the settlement and i think i had parted from even some little trifles i carried with me i am afraid i was a poor find to those who picked me up and you ought to have taken warning but the doctor has offered to lend me enough to take me to san francisco if only to give a fair trial to the machine he has set once more agoing  then you have friends in san francisco said the young girl quickly those who know you why not write to them first and tell them you are here  i dont think your postmaster here would be preoccupied with letters for john baxter if i did he said quietly but here is the doctor waiting goodby  he stood looking at her in a peculiar yet halfresigned way and held out his hand for a moment she hesitated had he been less independent and strong she would have refused to let him gohave offered him some slight employment at the ranch for oddly enough in spite of the suspicion that he was concealing something she felt that she would have trusted him and he would have been a help to her but he was not only determined but she was all the time conscious that he was a totally different man from the one she had taken care of and merely ordinary prudence demanded that she should know something more of him first she gave him her hand constrainedly he pressed it warmly  dr duchesne drove up helped him into the buggy smiled a goodnatured but halfperfunctory assurance that he would look after her patient and drove away  the whole thing was over but so unexpectedly so suddenly so unromantically so unsatisfactorily that although her common sense told her that it was perfectly natural proper businesslike and reasonable and above all final and complete she did not know whether to laugh or be angry yet this was her parting from the man who had but a few days ago moved her to tears with a single hopeless gesture well this would teach her what to expect well what had she expected nothing  yet for the rest of the day she was unreasonably irritable and if the conjointure be not paradoxical severely practical and inhumanly just falling foul of some presumption of miguels based upon his prescriptive rights through long service on the estate with the recollection of her severity towards his antagonist in her mind she rated that trusted retainer with such pitiless equity and unfeminine logic that his hot latin blood chilled in his veins and he stood livid on the road then informing dick shipley with equally relentless calm that she might feel it necessary to change all her foremen unless they could agree in harmony she sought the dignified seclusion of her castle but her respected parents whose triumphant relief at the strangers departure had emboldened them to await her return in their porch with bended bows of invective and lifted javelins of aggression recoiled before the resistless helm of this coldbrowed minerva who galloped contemptuously past them  nevertheless she sat late that night at her desk the cold moon looked down upon her window and lit up the empty porch where her silent guest had mutely watched her for a moment she regretted that he had recovered his reason excusing herself on the practical ground that he would never have known his dependence and he would have been better cared for by her she felt restless and uneasy this slight divergence from the practical groove in which her life had been set had disturbed her in many other things and given her the first views of the narrowness of it  suddenly she heard a step in the porch the lateness of the hour perhaps some other reason seemed to startle her and she half rose the next moment the figure of miguel appeared at the doorway and with a quick hurried look around him and at the open window he approached her he was evidently under great excitement his hollow shaven cheek looked like a waxen effigy in the mission church his yellow tobaccostained eye glittered like phosphorescent amber his lank gray hair was damp and perspiring but more striking than this was the evident restraint he had put upon himself pressing his broadbrimmed sombrero with both of his trembling yellow hands against his breast the young girl cast a hurried glance at the open window and at the gun which stood in the corner and then confronted him with clear and steady eyes but a paler cheek  ah he began in spanish which he himself had taught her as a child it was a strange thing his coming there tonight but then mother of god it was a strange a terrible thing that she had done to himold miguel her uncles servant he that had known her as a muchacha he that had lived all his life at the ranchay and whose fathers before him had lived there all their lives and driven the cattle over the very spot where she now stood before the thieving americans came here but he would be calm yes the senora should find him calm even as she was when she told him to go he would not speak no hemiguelwould contain himself yes he had mastered himself but could he restrain others ah yes othersthat was it could he keep manuel and pepe and dominguez from talking to the milkmanthat leaking sieve that gabbling brute of a shipley for whose sake she had cast off her old servant that very day  she looked at him with cold astonishment but without fear was he drunk with aguardiente or had his jealousy turned his brain he continued gasping but still pressing his hat against his breast  ah he saw it all yes it was today the day he left yes she had thought it safe to cast miguel off nownow that he was gone  without in the least understanding him the color had leaped to her cheek and the consciousness of it made her furious  how dare you she said passionately what has that stranger to do with my affairs or your insolence  he stopped and gazed at her with a certain admiring loyalty ah so he said with a deep breath the senora is the niece of her uncle she does well not to fear hima dogwith a slight shrugwho is more than repaid by the senoras condescension he dare not speak  who dare not speak are you mad she stopped with a sudden terrible instinct of apprehension miguel she said in her deepest voice answer me i command you do you know anything of this man  it was miguels turn to recoil from his mistress ah my god is it possible the senora has not suspect  suspect said josephine haughtily albeit her proud heart was beating quickly i suspect nothing i command you to tell me what you know  miguel turned with a rapid gesture and closed the door then drawing her away from the window he said in a hurried whisper  i know that that man has not the name of baxter i know that he has the name of randolph a young gambler who have won a large sum at sacramento and fearing to be robbed by those he won of have walk to himself through the road in disguise of a miner i know that your brother esteban have decoyed him here and have fallen on him  stop said the young girl her eyes which had been fixed with the agony of conviction suddenly flashing with the energy of despair and you call yourself the servant of my uncle and dare say this of his nephew  yes senora broke out the old man passionately it is because i am the servant of your uncle that i and i alone dare say it to you it is because i perjured my soul and have perjured my soul to deny it elsewhere that i now dare to say it it is because i your servant knew it from one of my countrymen who was of the gangbecause i miguel knew that your brother was not far away that night and because i whom you would dismiss have picked up this pocketbook of randolphs and your brothers ring which he have dropped and i have found beneath the body of the man you sent me to fetch  he drew a packet from his bosom and tossed it on the desk before her  and why have you not told me this before said josephine passionately  miguel shrugged his shoulders  what good possibly this dog randolph would die possibly he would liveas a lunatic possibly would happen what has happened the senora is beautiful the american has eyes if the dona josephines beauty shall finish what the silly don estebans arm have begunwhat matter  stop cried josephine pressing her hands across her shuddering eyes then uncovering her white and set face she said rapidly saddle my horse and your own at once then take your choice come with me and repeat all that you have said in the presence of that man or leave this ranch forever for if i live i shall go to him tonight and tell the whole story  the old man cast a single glance at his mistress shrugged his shoulders and without a word left the room but in ten minutes they were on their way to the county town  day was breaking over the distant burnt ridgea faint ghostly level like a funeral pall in the dim horizonas they drew up before the gaunt whitepainted pile of the hospital building josephine uttered a cry dr duchesnes buggy was before the door on its very threshold they met the doctor dark and irritated then you heard the news he said quickly  josephine turned her white face to the doctors what news she asked in a voice that seemed strangely deep and resonant  the poor fellow had another attack last night and died of exhaustion about an hour ago i was too late to save him  did he say anything was he conscious asked the girl hoarsely  no incoherent now i think of it he harped on the same string as he did the night of the operation what was it he said you remember  youll have to kill me first repeated josephine in a choking voice  yes something about his dying before hed tell well he came back to it before he went offthey often do you seem a little hoarse with your morning ride you should take care of that voice of yours by the way its a good deal like your brothers    the chatelaine of burnt ridge never married     through the santa clara wheat   chapter i   it was an enormous wheatfield in the santa clara valley stretching to the horizon line unbroken the meridian sun shone upon it without glint or shadow but at times when a stronger gust of the trade winds passed over it there was a quick slanting impression of the whole surface that was however as unlike a billow as itself was unlike a sea even when a lighter zephyr played down its long level the agitation was superficial and seemed only to momentarily lift a veil of greenish mist that hung above its immovable depths occasional puffs of dust alternately rose and fell along an imaginary line across the field as if a current of air were passing through it but were otherwise inexplicable  suddenly a faint shout apparently somewhere in the vicinity of the line brought out a perfectly clear response followed by the audible murmur of voices which it was impossible to localize yet the whole field was so devoid of any suggestion of human life or motion that it seemed rather as if the vast expanse itself had become suddenly articulate and intelligible  wot say  wheel off  whare  in the road  one of the voices here indicated itself in the direction of the line of dust and said comin and a man stepped out from the wheat into a broad and dusty avenue  with his presence three things became apparent  first that the puffs of dust indicated the existence of the invisible avenue through the unlimited and unfenced field of grain secondly that the stalks of wheat on either side of it were so tall as to actually hide a passing vehicle and thirdly that a vehicle had just passed had lost a wheel and been dragged partly into the grain by its frightened horse which a dusty man was trying to restrain and pacify  the horse given up to equine hysterics and evidently convinced that the ordinary buggy behind him had been changed into some dangerous and appalling creation still plunged and kicked violently to rid himself of it the man who had stepped out of the depths of the wheat quickly crossed the road unhitched the traces drew back the vehicle and glancing at the travelers dusty and disordered clothes said with curt sympathy  spilt too but not hurt eh  no neither of us i went over with the buggy when the wheel cramped but she jumped clear  he made a gesture indicating the presence of another the man turned quickly there was a second figure a young girl standing beside the grain from which he had emerged embracing a few stalks of wheat with one arm and a hand in which she still held her parasol while she grasped her gathered skirts with the other and trying to find a secure foothold for her two neat narrow slippers on a crumbling cake of adobe above the fathomless dust of the roadway her face although annoyed and discontented was pretty and her light dress and slim figure were suggestive of a certain superior condition  the mans manner at once softened with western courtesy he swung his broadbrimmed hat from his head and bent his body with the ceremoniousness of the country ballroom i reckon the lady had better come up to the shanty out o the dust and sun till we kin help you get these things fixed he said to the driver ill send round by the road for your hoss and have one of mine fetch up your wagon  is it far asked the girl slightly acknowledging his salutation without waiting for her companion to reply  only a step this way he answered motioning to the field of wheat beside her  what in there i never could go in there she said decidedly  its a heap shorter than by the road and not so dusty ill go with you and pilot you  the young girl cast a vexed look at her companion as the probable cause of all this trouble and shook her head but at the same moment one little foot slipped from the adobe into the dust again she instantly clambered back with a little feminine shriek and ejaculated well of all things and then fixing her blue annoyed eyes on the stranger asked impatiently why couldnt i go there by the road n the wagon i could manage to hold on and keep in  because i reckon youd find it too powful hot waitin here till we got round to ye  there was no doubt it was very hot the radiation from the baking roadway beating up under her parasol and pricking her cheekbones and eyeballs like needles she gave a fastidious little shudder furled her parasol gathered her skirts still tighter faced about and said go on then the man slipped backwards into the ranks of stalks parting them with one hand and holding out the other as if to lead her but she evaded the invitation by holding her tightlydrawn skirt with both hands and bending her head forward as if she had not noticed it the next moment the road and even the whole outer world disappeared behind them and they seemed floating in a choking green translucent mist  but the effect was only momentary a few steps further she found that she could walk with little difficulty between the ranks of stalks which were regularly spaced and the resemblance now changed to that of a long pillared conservatory of greenish glass that touched all objects with its pervading hue she also found that the close air above her head was continually freshened by the interchange of currents of lower temperature from belowas if the whole vast field had a circulation of its ownand that the adobe beneath her feet was gratefully cool to her tread there was no dust as he had said what had at first half suffocated her seemed to be some stimulating aroma of creation that filled the narrow green aisles and now imparted a strange vigor and excitement to her as she walked along meantime her guide was not conversationally idle now no doubt she had never seen anything like this before it was ordinary wheat only it was grown on adobe soilthe richest in the valley these stalks she could see herself were ten and twelve feet high that was the trouble they all ran too much to stalk though the grain yield was suthen powful she could tell that to her friends for he reckoned she was the only young lady that had ever walked under such a growth perhaps she was new to californy he thought so from the start well this was californy and this was not the least of the ways it could lay over every other country on gods yearth many folks thought it was the gold and the climate but she could see for herself what it could do with wheat he wondered if her brother had ever told her of it no the stranger wasnt her brother nor cousin nor company no only the hired driver from a san jose hotel who was takin her over to major randolphs yes he knew the old major the ranch was a pretty place nigh unto three miles further on now that he knew the driver was no relation of hers he didnt mind telling her that the buggy was a rather old consarn and the driver didnt know his business yes it might be fixed up so as to take her over to the majors there was one of their own mena young fellowwho could do anything that could be done with wood and irona reglar geniusand hed tackle it it might take an hour but shed find it quite cool waiting in the shanty it was a rough place for they only camped out there during the season to look after the crop and lived at their own homes the rest of the time was she going to stay long at the majors he noticed she had not brought her trunk with her had she known the majors wife long perhaps she thought of settling in the neighborhood  all this naive goodhumored questioningso often cruelly misunderstood as mere vulgar curiosity but as often the courteous instinct of simple unaffected people to entertain the stranger by inviting him to talk of what concerns himself rather than their own selveswas nevertheless i fear met only by monosyllables from the young lady or an impatient question in return she scarcely raised her eyes to the broad jeanshirted back that preceded her through the grain until the man abruptly ceased talking and his manner without losing its halfpaternal courtesy became graver she was beginning to be conscious of her incivility and was trying to think of something to say when he exclaimed with a slight air of relief here we are and the shanty suddenly appeared before them  it certainly was very rougha mere shell of unpainted boards that scarcely rose above the level of the surrounding grain and a few yards distant was invisible its slightly sloping roof already warped and shrunken into long fissures that permitted glimpses of the steelblue sky above was evidently intended only as a shelter from the cloudless sun in those two months of rainless days and dewless nights when it was inhabited through the open doors and windows she could see a row of bunks or rude sleeping berths against the walls furnished with coarse mattresses and blankets as the young girl halted the man with an instinct of delicacy hurried forward entered the shanty and dragging a rude bench to the doorway placed it so that she could sit beneath the shade of the roof yet with her back to these domestic revelations two or three men who had been apparently lounging there rose quietly and unobtrusively withdrew her guide brought her a tin cup of deliciously cool water exchanged a few hurried words with his companions and then disappeared with them leaving her alone  her first sense of relief from their company was i fear stronger than any other feeling after a hurried glance around the deserted apartment she arose shook out her dress and mantle and then going into the darkest corner supported herself with one hand against the wall while with the other she drew off one by one her slippers from her slim stripedstockinged feet shook and blew out the dust that had penetrated within and put them on again then perceiving a triangular fragment of lookingglass nailed against the wall she settled the strings of her bonnet by the aid of its reflection patted the fringe of brown hair on her forehead with her separated five fingers as if playing an imaginary tune on her brow and came back with maidenly abstraction to the doorway  everything was quiet and her seclusion seemed unbroken a smile played for an instant in the soft shadows of her eyes and mouth as she recalled the abrupt withdrawal of the men then her mouth straightened and her brows slightly bent it was certainly very unmannerly in them to go off in that way good heavens couldnt they have stayed around without talking surely it didnt require four men to go and bring up that wagon she picked up her parasol from the bench with an impatient little jerk then she held out her ungloved hand into the hot sunshine beyond the door with the gesture she would have used had it been raining and withdrew it as quicklyher hand quite scorched in the burning rays nevertheless after another impatient pause she desperately put up her parasol and stepped from the shanty  presently she was conscious of a faint sound of hammering not far away perhaps there was another shed but hidden like everything else in this monotonous ridiculous grain some stalks however were trodden down and broken around the shanty she could move more easily and see where she was going to her delight a few steps further brought her into a current of the tradewind and a cooler atmosphere and a short distance beyond them certainly was the shed from which the hammering proceeded she approached it boldly  it was simply a roof upheld by rude uprights and crossbeams and open to the breeze that swept through it at one end was a small blacksmiths forge some machinery and what appeared to be part of a small steamengine midway of the shed was a closet or cupboard fastened with a large padlock occupying its whole length on the other side was a workbench and at the further end stood the workman she had heard  he was apparently only a year or two older than herself and clad in blue jean overalls blackened and smeared with oil and coaldust even his youthful face which he turned towards her had a black smudge running across it and almost obliterating a small auburn moustache the look of surprise that he gave her however quickly passed he remained patiently and in a halfpreoccupied way holding his hammer in his hand as she advanced this was evidently the young fellow who could do anything that could be done with wood and iron  she was very sorry to disturb him but could he tell her how long it would be before the wagon could be brought up and mended he could not say that until he himself saw what was to be done if it was only a matter of the wheel he could fix it up in a few moments if as he had been told it was a case of twisted or bent axle it would take longer but it would be here very soon ah then would he let her wait here as she was very anxious to know at once and it was much cooler than in the shed certainly he would go over and bring her a bench but here she begged he wouldnt trouble himself she could sit anywhere comfortably  the lower end of the workbench was covered with clean and odorous shavings she lightly brushed them aside and with a youthful movement swung herself to a seat upon it supporting herself on one hand as she leaned towards him she could thus see that his eyes were of a lightyellowish brown like clarified honey with a singular look of clear concentration in them which however was the same whether turned upon his work the surrounding grain or upon her this and his sublime unconsciousness of the smudge across his face and his blackened hands made her wonder if the man who could do everything with wood and iron was above doing anything with water she had half a mind to tell him of it particularly as she noticed also that his throat below the line of sunburn disclosed by his open collar was quite white and his grimy hands well made she was wondering whether he would be affronted if she said in her politest way i beg your pardon but do you know you have quite accidentally got something on your face and offer her handkerchief which of course he would decline when her eye fell on the steamengine  how odd do you use that on the farm  nohe smiled here the smudge accenting it and setting off his white teeth in a christy minstrel fashion that exasperated herno although it could be used and had been but it was his first effort made two years ago when he was younger and more inexperienced it was a rather rough thing she could seebut he had to make it at odd times with what iron he could pick up or pay for and at different forges where he worked  she begged his pardonwhere  where he worked  ah then he was the machinist or engineer here  no he worked here just like the others only he was allowed to put up a forge while the grain was green and have his bench in consideration of the odd jobs he could do in the way of mending tools etc there was a heap of mending and welding to doshe had no idea how quickly agricultural machines got out of order he had done much of his work on the steamengine on moonlit nights yes she had no idea how perfectly clear and light it was here in the valley on such nights although of course the shadows were very dark and when he dropped a screw or a nut it was difficult to find he had worked there because it saved time and because it didnt cost anything and he had nobody to look on or interfere with him no it was not lonely the coyotes and wild cats sometimes came very near but were always more surprised and frightened than he was and once a horseman who had strayed off the distant road yonder mistook him for an animal and shot at him twice  he told all this with such freedom from embarrassment and with such apparent unconsciousness of the blue eyes that were following him and the light graceful figurewhich was so near his own that in some of his gestures his grimy hands almost touched its delicate garmentsthat accustomed as she was to a certain masculine aberration in her presence she was greatly amused by his naive acceptance of her as an equal suddenly looking frankly in her face he said  ill show you a secret if you care to see it  nothing would please her more  he glanced hurriedly around took a key from his pocket and unlocked the padlock that secured the closet she had noticed then reaching within with infinite care he brought out a small mechanical model  theres an invention of my own a reaper and thresher combined im going to have it patented and have a big one made from this model this will work as you see  he then explained to her with great precision how as it moved over the field the double operation was performed by the same motive power that it would be a saving of a certain amount of labor and time which she could not remember she did not understand a word of his explanations she saw only a clean and pretty but complicated toy that under the manipulation of his grimy fingers rattled a number of fraillike staves and worked a number of wheels and drums yet there was no indication of her ignorance in her sparkling eyes and smiling breathless attitude perhaps she was interested in his own absorption the revelation of his preoccupation with this model struck her as if he had made her a confidante of some boyish passion for one of her own sex and she regarded him with the same sympathizing superiority  you will make a fortune out of it she said pleasantly  well he might make enough to be able to go on with some other inventions he had in his mind they cost money and time no matter how careful one was  this was another interesting revelation to the young girl he not only did not seem to care for the profit his devotion brought him but even his one beloved ideal might be displaced by another so like a man after all  her reflections were broken upon by the sound of voices the young man carefully replaced the model in its closet with a parting glance as if he was closing a shrine and said there comes the wagon the young girl turned to face the men who were dragging it from the road with the halfcomplacent air of having been victorious over their late rude abandonment but they did not seem to notice it or to be surprised at her companion who quickly stepped forward and examined the broken vehicle with workmanlike deliberation  i hope you will be able to do something with it she said sweetly appealing directly to him i should thank you so much  he did not reply presently he looked up to the man who had brought her to the shanty and said the axles strained but its safe for five or six miles more of this road ill put the wheel on easily he paused and without glancing at her continued you might send her on by the cart  pray dont trouble yourselves interrupted the young girl with a pink uprising in her cheeks i shall be quite satisfied with the buggy as it stands send her on in the cart indeed really they were a rude setall of them  without taking the slightest notice of her remark the man replied gravely to the young mechanic yes but well be wanting the cart before it can get back from taking her  her again i assure you the buggy will serve perfectly wellif thisgentlemanwill only be kind enough to put on the wheel again she returned hotly  the young mechanic at once set to work the young girl walked apart silently until the wheel was restored to its axle but to her surprise a different horse was led forward to be harnessed  we thought your horse wasnt safe in case of another accident said the first man with the same smileless consideration this one wouldnt cut up if he was harnessed to an earthquake or a worse driver than youve got  it occurred to her instantly that the more obvious remedy of sending another driver had been already discussed and rejected by them yet when her own driver appeared a moment afterwards she ascended to her seat with some dignity and a slight increase of color  i am very much obliged to you all she said without glancing at the young inventor  dont mention it miss  good afternoon  good afternoon they all took off their hats with the same formal gravity as the horse moved forward but turned back to their work again before she was out of the field   chapter ii   the ranch of major randolph lay on a rich falda of the coast range and overlooked the great wheat plains that the young girl had just left the house of wood and adobe buried to its first story in rosetrees and passion vines was large and commodious yet it contained only the major his wife her son and daughter and the few occasional visitors from san francisco whom he entertained and she tolerated  for the majors household was not entirely harmonious while a young infantry subaltern at a gulf station he had been attracted by the piquant foreign accent and dramatic gestures of a french creole widow andbelieving them in the first flush of his youthful passion more than an offset to the encumbrance of her two children who with the memory of various marital infidelities were all her late husband had left herhad proposed been accepted and promptly married to her before he obtained his captaincy she had partly lost her accent and those dramatic gestures which had accented the passion of their brief courtship began to intensify domestic altercation and the bursts of idle jealousy to which she was subject whether she was revenging herself on her second husband for the faults of her first is not known but it was certain that she brought an unhallowed knowledge of the weaknesses cheap cynicism and vanity of a foreign predecessor to sit in judgment upon the simpleminded and chivalrous american soldier who had succeeded him and who was in fact the most loyal of husbands the natural result of her skepticism was an espionage and criticism of the wives of the majors brother officers that compelled a frequent change of quarters when to this was finally added a racial divergence and antipathy the public disparagement of the customs and education of her female colleagues and the sudden insistence of a foreign and french dominance in her household beyond any ordinary creole justification randolph presumably to avoid later international complications resigned while he was as yet a major luckily his latest banishment to an extreme western outpost had placed him in california during the flood of a speculation epoch he purchased a valuable spanish grant to three leagues of land for little over a three months pay following that yearning which compels retired shipcaptains and rovers of all degrees to buy a farm in their old days the major professionally and socially inured to border strife sought surcease and arcadian repose in ranching  it was here that mrs randolph late relict of the late scipion lhommadieu devoted herself to bringing up her children after the extremest of french methods and in resurrecting a de from her own family to give a distinct and aristocratic character to their name the de fontanges lhommadieu were however only known to their neighbors after the western fashion by their stepfathers namewhen they were known at allwhich was seldom for the boy was unpleasantly conceited as a precocious worldling and the girl as unpleasantly complacent in her role of ingenue the household was completely dominated by mrs randolph a punctilious catholic she attended all the functions of the adjacent mission and the shadow of a black soutane at twilight gliding through the wild oatfields behind the ranch had often been mistaken for a coyote the peaceloving major did not object to a piety which while it left his own conscience free imparted a respectable religious air to his household and kept him from the equally distasteful approaches of the puritanism of his neighbors and was blissfully unconscious that he was strengthening the antagonistic foreign element in his family with an alien church  meantime as the repaired buggy was slowly making its way towards his house major randolph entered his wifes boudoir with a letter which the san francisco post had just brought him a look of embarrassment on his goodhumored face strengthened the hard lines of hers she felt some momentary weakness of her natural enemy and prepared to give battle  im afraid heres something of a muddle josephine he began with a deprecating smile mallory who was coming down here with his daughter you know  this is the first intimation i have had that anything has been settled upon interrupted the lady with appalling deliberation  however my dear you know i told you last week that he thought of bringing her here while he went south on business you know being a widower he has no one to leave her with  and i suppose it is the american fashion to intrust ones daughters to any old boon companions  mallory is an old friend interrupted the major impatiently he knows im married and although he has never seen you he is quite willing to leave his daughter here  thank you  come you know what i mean the man naturally believes that my wife will be a proper chaperone for his daughter but that is not the present question he intended to call here i expected to take you over to san jose to see her and all that you know but the fact of it isthat isit seems from this letter thathes been called away sooner than he expected and thatwellhang it the girl is actually on her way here now  alone  i suppose so you know one thinks nothing of that here  or any other propriety for that matter  for heavens sake josephine dont be ridiculous of course its stupid her coming in this way and mallory ought to have brought herbut shes coming and we must receive her by jove here she is now he added starting up after a hurried glance through the window but what kind of a dd turnout is that anyhow  it certainly was an oddlooking conveyance that had entered the gates and was now slowly coming up the drive towards the house a large draught horse harnessed to a dustcovered buggy whose strained foreaxle bent by the last mile of heavy road had slanted the tops of the forewheels towards each other at an alarming angle the light graceful dress and elegant parasol of the young girl who occupied half of its single seat looked ludicrously pronounced by the side of the slouching figure and grimy duster of the driver who occupied the other half  mrs randolph gave a gritty laugh i thought you said she was alone is that an escort she has picked up american fashion on the road  thats her hired driver no doubt hang it she cant drive here by herself retorted the major impatiently hurrying to the door and down the staircase but he was instantly followed by his wife she had no idea of permitting a possible understanding to be exchanged in their first greeting the late m lhommadieu had been able to impart a whole plan of intrigue in a single word and glance  happily rose mallory already in the hall in a few words detailed the accident that had befallen her to the honest sympathy of the major and the coldlypolite concern of mrs randolph who in deliberately chosen sentences managed to convey to the young girl the conviction that accidents of any kind to young ladies were to be regarded as only a shade removed from indiscretions rose was impressed and even flattered by the fastidiousness of this foreignappearing woman and after the fashion of youthful natures accorded to her the respect due to recognized authority when to this authority which was evident she added a depreciation of the major i fear that some common instinct of feminine tyranny responded in roses breast and that on the very threshold of the honest soldiers home she tacitly agreed with the wife to look down upon him mrs randolph departed to inform her son and daughter of their guests arrival as a matter of fact however they had already observed her approach to the house through the slits of their drawn windowblinds and those even narrower prejudices and limited comprehensions which their education had fostered the girl adele had only grasped the fact that rose had come to their house in fine clothes alone with a man in a brokendown vehicle and was moved to easy mirth and righteous wonder the young man emile had agreed with her with the mental reservation that the guest was pretty and must eventually fall in love with him they both however welcomed her with a trained politeness and a superficial attention that while the indifference of her own countrymen in the wheatfield was still fresh in her recollection struck her with grateful contrast the majors quiet and unobtrusive kindliness naturally made less impression or was accepted as a matter of course  well said the major cheerfully but tentatively to his wife when they were alone again she seems a nice girl after all and a good deal of pluck and character by jove to push on in that broken buggy rather than linger or come in a farm cart eh  she was alone in that wheatfield said mrs randolph with grim deliberation for half an hour she confesses it herselftalking with a young man  yes but the others had gone for the buggy and in the name of heaven what would you have her dohide herself in the grain said the major desperately besides he added with a recklessness he afterwards regretted that mechanical chap theyve got there is really intelligent and worth talking to  i have no doubt she thought so said mrs randolph with a mirthless smile in fact i have observed that the american freedom generally means doing what you want to do indeed i wonder she didnt bring him with her only i beg major that you will not again in the presence of my daughterand i may even say of my sontalk lightly of the solitary meetings of young ladies with mechanics even though their faces were smutty and their clothes covered with oil  the major here muttered something about there being less danger in a young lady listening to the intelligence of a coarselydressed laborer than to the compliments of a rosescented fop but mrs randolph walked out of the room before he finished the evident platitude  that night rose mallory retired to her room in a state of sellsatisfaction that she even felt was to a certain extent a virtue she was delighted with her reception and with her hostess and family it was strange her father had not spoken more of mrs randolph who was clearly the superior of his old friend what fine manners they all had so different from other people she had known there was quite an old world civilization about them really it was like going abroad she would make the most of her opportunity and profit by her visit she would begin by improving her french they spoke it perfectly and with such a pure accent she would correct certain errors she was conscious of in her own manners and copy mrs randolph as much as possible certainly there was a great deal to be said of mrs randolphs way of looking at things now she thought of it calmly there was too much informality and freedom in american ways there was not enough respect due to position and circumstances take those men in the wheatfield for example yet here she found it difficult to formulate an indictment against them for freedom she would like to go there some day with the randolphs and let them see what company manners were she was thoroughly convinced now that her father had done wrong in sending her alone it certainly was most disrespectful to them and careless of him she had quite forgotten that she had herself proposed to her father to go alone rather than wait at the hotel and she must have looked very ridiculous in her fine clothes and the brokendown buggy when her trunk came by express tomorrow she would look out something more sober she must remember that she was in a catholic and religious household now ah yes how very fine it was to see that priest at dinner in his soutane sitting down like one of the family and making them all seem like a picture of some historical and aristocratic romance and then they were actually de fontanges lhommadieu how different he was from that shabby methodist minister who used to come to see her father in a black cravat with a hideous bow really there was something to say for a religion that contained so much picturesque refinement and for her partbut that will do i beg to say that i am not writing of any particular snob or feminine monstrosity but of a very charming creature who was quite able to say her prayers afterwards like a good girl and lay her pretty cheek upon her pillow without a blush  she opened her window and looked out the moon a great silver dome was uplifting itself from a bluishgray level which she knew was the distant plain of wheat somewhere in its midst appeared a dull star at times brightening as if blown upon or drawn upwards in a cometlike trail by some odd instinct she felt that it was the solitary forge of the young inventor and pictured him standing before it with his abstracted hazel eyes and a face more begrimed in the moonlight than ever when did he wash himself perhaps not until sunday how lonely it must be out there she slightly shivered and turned from the window as she did so it seemed to her that something knocked against her door from without opening it quickly she was almost certain that the sound of a rustling skirt retreated along the passage it was very late perhaps she had disturbed the house by shutting her window no doubt it was the motherly interest of mrs randolph that impelled her to come softly and look after her and for once her simple surmises were correct for not only the inspecting eyes of her hostess but the amatory glances of the youthful emile had been fastened upon her window until the light disappeared and even the holy mission church of san jose had assured itself of the dear childs safety with a large and supple ear at her keyhole  the next morning major randolph took her with adele in a light cariole over the ranch although his domain was nearly as large as the adjoining wheat plain it was not like that monopolized by one enormous characteristic yield but embraced a more diversified product there were acres and acres of potatoes in rows of endless and varying succession there were miles of wild oats and barley which overtopped them as they drove in narrow lanes of dry and dusty monotony there were orchards of pears apricots peaches and nectarines and vineyards of grapes so comparatively dwarfed in height that they scarcely reached to the level of their eyes yet laden and breaking beneath the weight of their ludicrously disproportionate fruit what seemed to be a vast green plateau covered with tiny patches that headed the northern edge of the prospect was an enormous bed of strawberry plants but everywhere crossing the track bounding the fields orchards and vineyards intersecting the paths of the whole domain were narrow irrigating ducts and channels of running water  those said the major poetically are the veins and arteries of the ranch come with me now and ill show you its pulsating heart descending from the wagon into pedestrian prose again he led rose a hundred yards further to a shed that covered a wonderful artesian well in the centre of a basin a column of water rose regularly with the even flow and volume of a brook it is one of the largest in the state said the major and is the life of all that grows here during six months of the year  pleased as the young girl was with those evidences of the prosperity and position of her host she was struck however with the fact that the farmlaborers winegrowers nurserymen and all field hands scattered on the vast estate were apparently of the same independent unpastoral and unprofessional character as the men of the wheatfield there were no cottages or farm buildings that she could see nor any apparent connection between the household and the estate far from suggesting tenantry or retainers the men who were working in the fields glanced at them as they passed with the indifference of strangers or replied to the majors greetings or questionings with perfect equality of manner or even businesslike reserve and caution her host explained that the ranch was worked by a company on shares that those laborers were in fact the bulk of the company and that he the major only furnished the land the seed and the implements that man who was driving the long roller and with whom you were indignant because he wouldnt get out of our way is the president of the company  that neednt make him so uncivil said rose poutingly for if it comes to that youre the landlord she added triumphantly  no said the major goodhumoredly i am simply the man driving the lighter and more easilymanaged team for pleasure and hes the man driving the heavier and more difficult machine for work its for me to get out of his way and looked at in the light of my being the landlord it is still worse for as were working on shares im interrupting his work and reducing his profits merely because i choose to sacrifice my own  i need not say that those atrociously leveling sentiments were received by the young ladies with that feminine scorn which is only qualified by misconception rose who under the influence of her hostess had a vague impression that they sounded something like the french revolution and that adele must feel like the princess elizabeth rushed to her relief like a good girl but major now youre a gentleman and if you had been driving that roller you know you would have turned out for us  i dont know about that said the major mischievously but if i had i should have known that the other fellow who accepted it wasnt a gentleman  but rose having sufficiently shown her partisanship in the discussion after the feminine fashion did not care particularly for the logical result after a moments silence she resumed and the wheat ranch belowis that carried on in the same way  yes but their landlord is a bank who advances not only the land but the money to work it and doesnt ride around in a buggy with a couple of charmingly distracting young ladies  and do they all share alike continued rose ignoring the pleasantry big and littlethat young inventor with the rest  she stopped she felt the ingenues usually complacent eyes suddenly fixed upon her with an unhallowed precocity and as quickly withdrawn without knowing why she felt embarrassed and changed the subject  the next day they drove to the convent of santa clara and the mission college of san jose their welcome at both places seemed to rose to be a mingling of caste greeting and spiritual zeal and the austere seclusion and reserve of those cloisters repeated that suggestion of an old world civilization that had already fascinated the young western girl they made other excursions in the vicinity but did not extend it to a visit to their few neighbors with their reserved and exclusive ideas this fact did not strike rose as peculiar but on a later shopping expedition to the town of san jose a certain reticence and aggressive sensitiveness on the part of the shopkeepers and tradespeople towards the randolphs produced an unpleasant impression on her mind she could not help noticing too that after the first stare of astonishment which greeted her appearance with her hostess she herself was included in the antagonism with her youthful prepossession for her friends this distinction she regarded as flattering and aristocratic and i fear she accented it still more by discussing with mrs randolph the merits of the shopkeepers wares in schoolgirl french before them she was unfortunate enough however to do this in the shop of a polyglot german  oxcoos me mees he said gravelybut dot lady speeks engeleesh so goot mit yourselluf and ven you dells to her dot silk is hallf gotton in english she onderstand you mooch better and it dont make nodings to me the laugh which would have followed from her own countrywomen did not however break upon the trained faces of the de fontanges lhommadieus yet while rose would have joined in it albeit a little ruefully she felt for the first time mortified at their civil insincerity  at the end of two weeks major randolph received a letter from mr mallory when he had read it he turned to his wife he thanks you he said for your kindness to his daughter and explains that his sudden departure was owing to the necessity of his taking advantage of a great opportunity for speculation that had offered as mrs randolph turned away with a slight shrug of the shoulders the major continued but you havent heard all that opportunity was the securing of a half interest in a cinnabar lode in sonora which has already gone up a hundred thousand dollars in his hands by jove a man can afford to drop a little social ceremony on those termseh josephine he concluded with a triumphant chuckle  hes as likely to lose his hundred thousand tomorrow while his manners will remain said mrs randolph ive no faith in these sudden california fortunes  youre wrong as regards mallory for hes as careful as he is lucky he dont throw money away for appearance sake or hed have a rich home for that daughter he could afford it  mrs randolph was silent she is his only daughter i believe she continued presently  yeshe has no other kith or kin returned the major  she seems to be very much impressed by emile said mrs randolph  major randolph faced his wife quickly  in the name of all thats ridiculous my dear you are not already thinking ofhe gasped  i should be very loth to give my sanction to anything of the kind knowing the difference of her birth education and religionalthough the latter i believe she would readily change said mrs randolph severely but when you speak of my already thinking of such things do you suppose that your friend mr mallory didnt consider all that when he sent that girl here  never said the major vehemently and if it entered his head now by jove hed take her away tomorrowalways supposing i didnt anticipate him by sending her off myself  mrs randolph uttered her mirthless laugh and you suppose the girl would go really major you dont seem to understand this boasted liberty of your own countrywoman what does she care for her fathers control why shed make him do just what she wanted but she added with an expression of dignity perhaps we had better not discuss this until we know something of emiles feelings in the matter that is the only question that concerns us with this she swept out of the room leaving the major at first speechless with honest indignation and then after the fashion of all guileless natures a little uneasy and suspicious of his own guilelessness for a day or two after he found himself not without a sensation of meanness watching rose when in emiles presence but he could distinguish nothing more than the frank satisfaction she showed equally to the others yet he found himself regretting even that so subtle was the contagion of his wifes suspicions   chapter iii   it had been a warm morning an unusual mist which the sun had not dissipated had crept on from the great grainfields beyond and hung around the house charged with a dry dusty closeness that seemed to be quite independent of the suns rays and more like a heated exhalation or emanation of the soil itself in its acrid irritation rose thought she could detect the breath of the wheat as on the day she had plunged into its pale green shadows by the afternoon this mist had disappeared apparently in the same mysterious manner but not scattered by the usual tradewind whichanother unusual circumstancethat day was not forthcoming there was a breathlessness in the air like the hush of listening expectancy which filled the young girl with a vague restlessness and seemed to even affect a scattered company of crows in the field beyond the house which rose suddenly with startled but aimless wings and then dropped vacantly among the grain again  major randolph was inspecting a distant part of the ranch mrs randolph was presumably engaged in her boudoir and rose was sitting between adele and emile before the piano in the drawingroom listlessly turning over the leaves of some music there had been an odd mingling of eagerness and abstraction in the usual attentions of the young man that morning and a certain nervous affectation in his manner of twisting the ends of a small black moustache which resembled his mothers eyebrows that had affected rose with a halfamused halfuneasy consciousness but which she had however referred to the restlessness produced by the weather it occurred to her also that the vacuously amiable adele had once or twice regarded her with the same precocious childlike curiosity and infantine cunning she had once before exhibited all this did not however abate her admiration for bothperhaps particularly for this picturesquely gentlemanly young fellow with his gentle audacities of compliment his caressing attentions and his unfailing and equal address and when discovering that she had mislaid her fan for the fifth time that morning he started up with equal and undiminished fire to go again and fetch it the look of grateful pleasure and pleading perplexity in her pretty eyes might have turned a less conceited brain than his  but you dont know where it is  i shall find it by instinct  you are spoiling meyou two the parenthesis was a hesitating addition but she continued with fresh sincerity i shall be quite helpless when i leave hereif i am ever able to go by myself  dont ever go then  but just now i want my fan it is so close everywhere today  i fly mademoiselle  he started to the door  she called after him  let me help your instinct then i had it last in the majors study  that was where i was going  he disappeared rose got up and moved uneasily towards the window how queer and quiet it looks outside its really too bad that he should be sent after that fan again hell never find it she resumed her place at the piano adele following her with round expectant eyes after a pause she started up again ill go and fetch it myself she said with a halfembarrassed laugh and ran to the door  scarcely understanding her own nervousness but finding relief in rapid movement rose flew lightly up the staircase the majors study where she had been writing letters during his absence that morning was at the further end of a long passage and near her own bedroom the door of which as she passed she noticed halfabstractedly was open but she continued on and hurriedly entered the study at the same moment emile with a smile on his face turned towards her with the fan in his hand  oh youve found it she said with nervous eagerness i was so afraid youd have all your trouble for nothing  she extended her hand with a halfbreathless smile for the fan but he caught her outstretched little palm in his own and held it  ah but you are not going to leave us are you  in a flash of consciousness she understood him and as it seemed to her her own nervousness and all and everything and with it came a swift appreciation of all it meant to her and her future to be always with him and like him a part of this refined and restful seclusionakin to all that had so attracted her in this house not to be obliged to educate herself up to it but to be in it on equal terms at once to know that it was no wild foolish youthful fancy but a wise thoughtful and prudent resolve that her father would understand and her friends respect these were the thoughts that crowded quickly upon her more like an explanation of her feelings than a revelation in the brief second that he held her hand it was not perhaps love as she had dreamed it and even believed it before she was not ashamed or embarrassed she even felt with a slight pride that she was not blushing she raised her eyes frankly what she would have said she did not know for the door which he had closed behind her began to shake violently  it was not the fear of some angry intrusion or interference surely that made him drop her hand instantly it was nother second thoughtthe idea that some one had fallen in a fit against it that blanched his face with abject and unreasoning terror it must have been something else that caused him to utter an inarticulate cry and dash out of the room and down the stairs like a madman what had happened  in her own selfpossession she knew that all this was passing rapidly that it was not the door now that was still shaking for it had swung almost shut againbut it was the windows the bookshelves the floor beneath her feet that were all shaking she heard a hurried scrambling the trampling of feet below and the quick rustling of a skirt in the passage as if some one had precipitately fled from her room yet no one had called to hereven he had said nothing whatever had happened they clearly had not cared for her to know  the jarring and rattling ceased as suddenly but the house seemed silent and empty she moved to the door which had now swung open a few inches but to her astonishment it was fixed in that position and she could not pass as yet she had been free from any personal fear and even now it was with a half smile at her imprisonment in the majors study that she rang the bell and turned to the window a man whom she recognized as one of the ranch laborers was standing a hundred feet away in the garden looking curiously at the house he saw her face as she tried to raise the sash uttered an exclamation and ran forward but before she could understand what he said the sash began to rattle in her hand the jarring recommenced the floor shook beneath her feet a hideous sound of grinding seemed to come from the walls a thin seam of dustlike smoke broke from the ceiling and with the noise of falling plaster a dozen books followed each other from the shelves in what in the frantic hurry of that moment seemed a grimly deliberate succession a picture hanging against the wall to her dazed wonder swung forward and appeared to stand at right angles from it she felt herself reeling against the furniture a deadly nausea overtook her as she glanced despairingly towards the window the outlying fields beyond the garden seemed to be undulating like a sea for the first time she raised her voice not in fear but in a pathetic little cry of apology for her awkwardness in tumbling about and not being able to grapple this new experience and then she found herself near the door which had once more swung free she grasped it eagerly and darted out of the study into the deserted passage here some instinct made her follow the line of the wall rather than the shaking balusters of the corridor and staircase but before she reached the bottom she heard a shout and the farm laborer she had seen coming towards her seized her by the arm dragged her to the open doorway of the drawingroom and halted beneath its arch in the wall another thrill but lighter than before passed through the building then all was still again  its over i reckon thats all just now said the man coolly its quite safe to cut and run for the garden now through this window he half led half lifted her through the french window to the veranda and the ground and locking her arm in his ran quickly forward a hundred feet from the house stopping at last beneath a large post oak where there was a rustic seat into which she sank youre safe now i reckon he said grimly  she looked towards the house the sun was shining brightly a cool breeze seemed to have sprung up as they ran she could see a quantity of rubbish lying on the roof from which a dozen yards of zinc gutter were perilously hanging the broken shafts of the further cluster of chimneys a pile of bricks scattered upon the ground and among the battered down beams of the end of the verandabut that was all she lifted her now whitened face to the man and with the apologetic smile still lingering on her lips asked  what does it all mean what has happened  the man stared at her dye mean to say ye dont know  how could i they must have all left the house as soon as it began i was talking toto m lhommadieu and he suddenly left  the man brought his face angrily down within an inch of her own dye mean to say that them dd french halfbreeds stampeded and left yer there alone  she was still too much stupefied by the reaction to fully comprehend his meaning and repeated feebly with her smile still faintly lingering but you dont tell me what it was  an earthquake said the man roughly and if it had lasted ten seconds longer it would have shook the whole shanty down and left you under it yer kin tell that to them if they dont know it but from the way they made tracks to the fields i reckon they did theyre coming now  without another word he turned away half surlily half defiantly passing scarce fifty yards away mrs randolph and her daughter who were hastening towards their guest  oh here you are said mrs randolph with the nearest approach to effusion that rose had yet seen in her manner we were wondering where you had run to and were getting quite concerned emile was looking for you everywhere  the recollection of his blank and abject face his vague outcry and blind fright came back to rose with a shock that sent a flash of sympathetic shame to her face the ingenious adele noticed it and dutifully pinched her mothers arm  emile echoed rose faintlylooking for me  mother and daughter exchanged glances  yes said mrs randolph cheerfully he says he started to run with you but you got ahead and slipped out of the garden dooror something of the kind she added with the air of making light of roses girlish fears you know one scarcely knows what one does at such times and it must have been frightfully strange to youand hes been quite distracted lest you should have wandered away adele run and tell him miss mallory has been here under the oak all the time  rose startedand then fell hopelessly back in her seat perhaps it was true perhaps he had not rushed off with that awful face and without a word perhaps she herself had been halffrightened out of her reason in the simple weak kindness of her nature it seemed less dreadful to believe that the fault was partly her own  and you went back into the house to look for us when all was over said mrs randolph fixing her black beady magnetic eyes on rose and that stupid yokel zake brought you out again he neednt have clutched your arm so closely my deari must speak to the major about his excessive familiaritybut i suppose i shall be told that that is american freedom i call it a liberty  it struck rose that she had not even thanked the manin the same flash that she remembered something dreadful that he had said she covered her face with her hands and tried to recall herself  mrs randolph gently tapped her shoulder with a mixture of maternal philosophy and discipline and continued of course its an upsetand youre confused still thats nothing they say dear its perfectly well known that no two peoples recollections of these things ever are the same its really ridiculous the contradictory stories one hears isnt it emile  rose felt that the young man had joined them and was looking at her in the fear that she should still see some trace of the startled selfish animal in his face she did not dare to raise her eyes to his but looked at his mother mrs randolph was standing then collected but impatient  its all over now said emile in his usual voice and except the chimneys and some fallen plaster theres really no damage done but im afraid they have caught it pretty badly at the mission and at san francisco in those tall flashy rattletrap buildings theyre putting up ive just sent off one of the men for news  her father was in san francisco by that time and she had never thought of him in her quick remorse she now forgot all else and rose to her feet  i must telegraph to my father at once she said hurriedly he is there  you had better wait until the messenger returns and hear his news said emile if the shock was only a slight one in san francisco your father might not understand you and would be alarmed  she could see his face nowthere was no record of the past expression upon it but he was watching her eagerly mrs randolph and adele had moved away to speak to the servants emile drew nearer  you surely will not desert us now he said in a low voice  please dont she said vaguely im so worried and pushing quickly past him she hurriedly rejoined the two women  they were superintending the erection of a long tent or marquee in the garden hastily extemporized from the awnings of the veranda and other cloth mrs randolph explained that although all danger was over there was the possibility of the recurrence of lighter shocks during the day and night and that they would all feel much more secure and comfortable to camp out for the next twentyfour hours in the open air  only imagine youre picnicking and youll enjoy it as most people usually enjoy those horrid al fresco entertainments i dont believe theres the slightest real necessity for it but she added in a lower voice the irish and chinese servants are so demoralized now they wouldnt stay indoors with us its a common practice here i believe for a day or two after the shock and it gives time to put things right again and clear up the old onestoried spanish houses with walls three feet thick and built round a courtyard or patio were much safer its only when the americans try to improve upon the old order of things with their pinchbeck shams and stucco that providence interferes like this to punish them  it was the fact however that rose was more impressed by what seemed to her the absolute indifference of providence in the matter and the cool resumption by nature of her ordinary conditions the sky above their heads was as rigidly blue as ever and as smilingly monotonous the distant prospect with its clear wellknown silhouettes had not changed the crows swung on lazy deliberate wings over the grain as before and the tradewind was again blowing in its quiet persistency and yet she knew that something had happened that would never again make her enjoyment of the prospect the samethat nothing would ever be as it was yesterday i think at first she referred only to the material and larger phenomena and did not confound this revelation of the insecurity of the universe with her experience of man yet the fact also remained that to the conservative correct and as she believed secure condition to which she had been approximating all her relations were rudely shaken and upset it really seemed to this simpleminded young woman that the revolutionary disturbance of settled conditions might have as providential an origin as the divine right of which she had heard so much   chapter iv   in her desire to be alone and to evade the now significant attentions of emile she took advantage of the bustle that followed the hurried transfer of furniture and articles from the house to escape through the garden to the outlying fields striking into one of the dusty lanes that she remembered she wandered on for half an hour until her progress and meditation were suddenly arrested she had come upon a long chasm or crack in the soil full twenty feet wide and as many in depth crossing her path at right angles she did not remember having seen it before the track of wheels went up to its precipitous edge she could see the track on the other side but the hiatus remained unbridged and uncovered it was not there yesterday she glanced right and left the fissure seemed to extend like a moat or ditch from the distant road to the upland between her and the great wheat valley below from which she was shut off an odd sense of being in some way a prisoner confronted her she drew back with an impatient start and perhaps her first real sense of indignation a voice behind her which she at once recognized scarcely restored her calmness  you cant get across there miss  she turned it was the young inventor from the wheat ranch on horseback and with a clean face he had just ridden out of the grain on the same side of the chasm as herself  but you seem to have got over she said bluntly  yes but it was further up the field i reckoned that the split might be deeper but not so broad in the rock outcrop over there than in the adobe here i found it so and jumped it  he looked as if he mightalert intelligent and selfcontained he lingered a moment and then continued  im afraid you must have been badly shaken and a little frightened up there before the chimneys came down  no she was glad to say briefly and she believed truthfully i wasnt frightened i didnt even know it was an earthquake  ah he reflected that was because you were a stranger its oddtheyre all like that i suppose its because nobody really expects or believes in the unlookedfor thing and yet thats the thing that always happens and then of course that other affair which really is serious startled you the more  she felt herself ridiculously and angrily blushing i dont know what you mean she said icily what other affair  why the well  the well she repeated vacantly  yes the artesian well has stopped didnt the major tell you  no said the girl he was away i havent seen him yet  well the flow of water has ceased completely thats what im here for the major sent for me and ive been to examine it  and is that stoppage so very important she said dubiously  it was his turn to look at her wonderingly  if its lost entirely it means ruin for the ranch he said sharply he wheeled his horse nodded gravely and trotted off  major randolphs figure of the lifeblood of the ranch flashed across her suddenly she knew nothing of irrigation or the costly appliances by which the californian agriculturist opposed the long summer droughts she only vaguely guessed that the dreadful earthquake had struck at the prosperity of those people whom only a few hours ago she had been proud to call her friends the underlying goodness of her nature was touched should she let a momentary faultif it were not really after all only a misunderstandingrise between her and them at such a moment she turned and hurried quickly towards the house  hastening onward she found time however to wonder also why these common menshe now included even the young inventor in that categorywere all so rude and uncivil to her she had never before been treated in this way she had always been rather embarrassed by the admiring attentions of young men clerks and collegians in her atlantic home and of professional men merchants and stockbrokers in san francisco it was true that they were not as continually devoted to her and to the nice art and etiquette of pleasing as emilethey had other things to think about being in business and not being gentlemenbut then they were greatly superior to these clowns who took no notice of her and rode off without lingering or formal leavetaking when their selfish affairs were concluded it must be the contact of the vulgar earththis wretched cracking material and yet ungovernable and lawless earththat so depraved them she felt she would like to say this to some onenot her father for he wouldnt listen to her nor to the major who would laughingly argue with her but to mrs randolph who would understand her and perhaps say it some day in her own sharp sneering way to these very clowns with those gentle sentiments irradiating her blue eyes and putting a pink flush upon her fair cheeks rose reached the garden with the intention of rushing sympathetically into mrs randolphs arms but it suddenly occurred to her that she would be obliged to state how she became aware of this misfortune and with it came an instinctive aversion to speak of her meeting with the inventor she would wait until mrs randolph told her but although that lady was engaged in a lowvoiced discussion in french with emile and adele which instantly ceased at her approach there was no allusion made to the new calamity you need not telegraph to your father she said as rose approached he has already telegraphed to you for news as you were out and the messenger was waiting an answer we opened the dispatch and sent one telling him that you were all right and that he need not hurry here on your account so you are satisfied i hope a few hours ago this would have been true and rose would have probably seen in the action of her hostess only a flattering motherly supervision there was in fact still a lingering trace of trust in her mind yet she was conscious that she would have preferred to answer the dispatch herself and to have let her father come to a girl brought up with a belief in the right of individual independence of thought and action there was something in mrs randolphs practical ignoring of that right which startled her in spite of her new conservatism while as the daughter of a business man her instincts revolted against mrs randolphs unbusinesslike action with the telegram however vulgar and unrefined she may have begun to consider a life of business the result was a certain constraint and embarrassment in her manner which however had the laudable effect of limiting emiles attention to significant glances and was no doubt variously interpreted by the others but she satisfied her conscience by determining to make a confidence of her sympathy to the major on the first opportunity  this she presently found when the others were preoccupied the major greeting her with a somewhat careworn face but a voice whose habitual kindness was unchanged when he had condoled with her on the terrifying phenomenon that had marred her visit to the ranchand she could not help impatiently noticing that he too seemed to have accepted his wifes theory that she had been half deliriously frightenedhe regretted that her father had not concluded to come down to the ranch as his practical advice would have been invaluable in this emergency she was about to eagerly explain why when it occurred to her that mrs randolph had only given him a suppressed version of the telegram and that she would be betraying her or again taking sides in this partisan divided home with some hesitation she at last alluded to the accident to the artesian well the major did not ask her how she had heard of it it was a bad business he thought but it might not be a total loss the water may have been only diverted by the shock and might be found again at the lower level or in some lateral fissure he had sent hurriedly for tom bentthat clever young engineer at the wheat ranch who was always studying up these things with his inventionsand that was his opinion no tom was not a welldigger but it was generally known that he had located one or two and had long ago advised the tapping of that flow by a second boring in case of just such an emergency he was coming again tomorrow by the way he had asked how the young lady visitor was and hoped she had not been alarmed by the earthquake  rose felt herself again blushing and what was more singular with an unexpected and it seemed to her ridiculous pleasure although outwardly she appeared to ignore the civility completely and she had no intention of being so easily placated if this young man thought by mere perfunctory civilities to her host to make up for his clownishness to her he was mistaken she would let him see it when he called tomorrow she quickly turned the subject by assuring the major of her sympathy and her intention of sending for her father for the rest of the afternoon and during their al fresco dinner she solved the difficulty of her strained relations with mrs randolph and emile by conversing chiefly with the major tacitly avoiding however any allusion to this mr bent but mrs randolph was less careful  you dont really mean to say major she began in her dryest grittiest manner that instead of sending to san francisco for some skilled mastermechanic you are going to listen to the vagaries of a conceited halfeducated farmlaborer and employ him you might as well call in some of those wizards or waterwitches at once but the major like many other wellmanaged husbands who are goodhumoredly content to suffer in the sunshine of prosperity had no idea of doing so in adversity and the prospect of being obliged to go back to youthful struggles had recalled some of the independence of that period he looked up quietly and said  if his conclusions are as clear and satisfactory tomorrow as they were today i shall certainly try to secure his services  then i can only say i would prefer the waterwitch he at least would not represent a class of neighbors who have made themselves systematically uncivil and disagreeable to us  i am afraid josephine we have not tried to make ourselves particularly agreeable to them said the major  if that can only be done by admitting their equality i prefer they should remain uncivil only let it be understood major that if you choose to take this tomtheploughboy to mend your well you will at least keep him there while he is on the property  with what retort the major would have kept up this conjugal discussion already beginning to be awkward to the discreet visitor is not known as it was suddenly stopped by a bullet from the rosebud lips of the ingenuous adele  why hes very handsome when his face is clean and his hands are small and not at all hard and he doesnt talk the least bit queer or common  there was a dead silence and pray where did you see him and what do you know about his hands asked mrs randolph in her most desiccated voice or has the major already presented you to him i shouldnt be surprised  no buthesitated the young girl with a certain mouselike audacitywhen you sent me to look after miss mallory i came up to him just after he had spoken to her and he stopped to ask me how we all were and if miss mallory was really frightened by the earthquake and he shook hands for good afternoonthats all  and who taught you to converse with common strangers and shake hands with them continued mrs randolph with narrowing lips  nobody mamma but i thought if miss mallory who is a young lady could speak to him so could i who am not out yet  we wont discuss this any further at present said mrs randolph stiffly as the major smiled grimly at rose the earthquake seems to have shaken down in this house more than the chimneys  it certainly had shaken all power of sleep from the eyes of rose when the household at last dispersed to lie down in their clothes on the mattresses which had been arranged under the awnings she was continually starting up from confused dreams of the ground shaking under her or she seemed to be standing on the brink of some dreadful abyss like the great chasm on the grainfield when it began to tremble and crumble beneath her feet it was near morning when unable to endure it any longer she managed without disturbing the sleeping adele who occupied the same curtained recess with her to slip out from the awning wrapped in a thick shawl she made her way through the encompassing trees and bushes of the garden that had seemed to imprison and suffocate her to the edge of the grainfield where she could breathe the fresh air beneath an open starlit sky there was no moon and the darkness favored her she had no fears that weighed against the horror of seclusion with her own fancies besides they were camping out of the house and if she chose to sit up or walk about no one could think it strange she wished her father were here that she might have some one of her own kin to talk to yet she knew not what to say to him if he had come she wanted somebody to sympathize with her feelingsor rather perhaps some one to combat and even ridicule the uneasiness that had lately come over her she knew what her father would saydo you want to go or do you want to stay here do you like these people or do you not she remembered the one or two glowing and enthusiastic accounts she had written him of her visit here and felt herself blushing again what would he think of mrs randolphs opening and answering the telegram wouldnt he find out from the major if she had garbled the sense of his dispatch  away to the right in the midst of the distant and invisible wheatfield there was the same intermittent star which like a living breathing thing seemed to dilate in glowing respiration as she had seen it the first night of her visit mr bents forge it must be nearly daylight now the poor fellow had been up all night or else was stealing this early march on the day she recalled adeles sudden eulogium of him the first natural smile that had come to her lips since the earthquake broke up her nervous restraint and sent her back more like her old self to her couch  but she had not proceeded far towards the tent when she heard the sound of low voices approaching her it was the major and his wife who like herself had evidently been unable to sleep and were up betimes a new instinct of secretiveness which she felt was partly the effect of her artificial surrounding checked her first natural instinct to call to them and she drew back deeper in the shadow to let them pass but to her great discomfiture the major in a conversational emphasis stopped directly in front of her  you are wrong i tell you a thousand times wrong the girl is simply upset by this earthquake its a great pity her father didnt come instead of telegraphing and by jove rather than hear any more of this ill send for him myself said the major in an energetic but suppressed voice  and the girl wont thank you and youll be a fool for your pains returned mrs randolph with dry persistency  but according to your own ideas of propriety mallory ought to be the first one to be consultedand by me too  not in this case of course before any actual engagement is on you can speak of emiles attentions  but suppose mallory has other views suppose he declines the honor the man is no fool  thank you but for that very reason he must listen to me major if he doesnt care to please his daughter for her own sake he will have to do so for the sake of decency yes i tell you she has thoroughly compromised herselfquite enough if it is ever known to spoil any other engagement her father may make why ask adele the day of the earthquake she absolutely had the audacity to send him out of the room upstairs into your study for her fan and then follow him up there alone the servants knew it i knew it for i was in her room at the time with father antonio the earthquake made it plain to everybody decline it no mr mallory will think twice about it before he does that whats that whos there  there was a sudden rustle in the bushes like the passage of some frightened animaland then all was still again   chapter v   the sun an hour high but only just topping the greenish crests of the wheat was streaming like the morning breeze through the open length of tom bents workshed an exaggerated and prolonged shadow of the young inventor himself at work beside his bench was stretching itself far into the brokendown ranks of stalks towards the invisible road and falling at the very feet of rose mallory as she emerged from them  she was very pale very quiet and very determined the traveling mantle thrown over her shoulders was dusty the ribbons that tied her hat under her round chin had become unloosed she advanced walking down the line of shadow directly towards him  i am afraid i will have to trouble you once more she said with a faint smile which did not however reach her perplexed eyes could you give me any kind of a conveyance that would take me to san jose at once  the young man had started at the rustling of her dress in the shavings and turned eagerly the faintest indication of a loss of interest was visible for an instant in his face but it quickly passed into a smile of recognition yet she felt that he had neither noticed any change in her appearance nor experienced any wonder at seeing her there at that hour  i did not take a buggy from the house she went on quickly for i left early and did not want to disturb them in fact they dont know that i am gone i was worried at not hearing news from my father in san francisco since the earthquake and i thought i would run down to san jose to inquire without putting them to any trouble anything will do that you have ready if i can take it at once  still without exhibiting the least surprise bent nodded affirmatively put down his tools begged her to wait a moment and ran off in the direction of the cabin as he disappeared behind the wheat she lapsed quite suddenly against the work bench but recovered herself a moment later leaning with her back against it her hands grasping it on either side and her knit brows and determined little face turned towards the road then she stood erect again shook the dust out of her skirts lifted her veil wiped her cheeks and brow with the corner of a small handkerchief and began walking up and down the length of the shed as bent reappeared  he was accompanied by the man who had first led her through the wheat he gazed upon her with apparently all the curiosity and concern that the other had lacked  you want to get to san jose as quick as you can he said interrogatively  yes she said quickly if you can help me  you walked all the way from the majors here he continued without taking his eyes from her face  yes she answered with an affectation of carelessness she had not shown to bent but i started very early it was cool and pleasant and didnt seem far  ill put you down in san jose inside the hour you shall have my horse and trotting sulky and ill drive you myself will that do  she looked at him wonderingly she had not forgotten his previous restraint and gravity but now his face seemed to have relaxed with some humorous satisfaction she felt herself coloring slightly but whether with shame or relief she could not tell  i shall be so much obliged to you she replied hesitatingly and so will my father i know  i reckon said the man with the same look of amused conjecture then with a quick assuring nod he turned away and dived into the wheat again  youre all right now miss mallory said bent complacently dawson will fix it hes got a good horse and hes a good driver too he paused and then added pleasantly i suppose theyre all well up at the house  it was so evident that his remark carried no personal meaning to herself that she was obliged to answer carelessly oh yes  i suppose you see a good deal of miss randolphmiss adele i think you call her he remarked tentatively and with a certain boyish enthusiasm which she had never conceived possible to his nature  yes she replied a little dryly she is the only young lady there she stopped remembering adeles naive description of the man before her and said abruptly you know her then  a little replied the young man modestly i see her pretty often when i am passing the upper end of the ranch shes very well brought up and her manners are very refineddont you think soand yet shes just as simple and natural as a country girl theres a great deal in education after all isnt there he went on confidentially and althoughhe lowered his voice and looked cautiously around himi believe that some of us here dont fancy her mother much theres no doubt that mrs randolph knows how to bring up her children some people think that kind of education is all artificial and dont believe in it but i do  with the consciousness that she was running away from these people and the shameful disclosure she had heard last nightwith the recollection of adeles scandalous interpretation of her most innocent actions and her sudden and complete revulsion against all that she had previously admired in that household to hear this man who had seemed to her a living protest against their ideas and principles now expressing them and holding them up for emulation almost took her breath away  i suppose that means you intend to fix major randolphs well for him she said dryly  yes he returned without noticing her manner and i think i can find that water again ive been studying it up all night and do you know what im going to do i am going to make the earthquake that lost it help me to find it again he paused and looked at her with a smile and a return of his former enthusiasm do you remember the crack in the adobe field that stopped you yesterday  yes said the girl with a slight shiver  i told you then that the same crack was a split in the rock outcrop further up the plain and was deeper i am satisfied now from what i have seen that it is really a rupture of the whole strata all the way down thats the one weak point that the imprisoned water is sure to find and thats where the borer will tap itin the new well that the earthquake itself has sunk  it seemed to her now that she understood his explanation perfectly and she wondered the more that he had been so mistaken in his estimate of adele she turned away a little impatiently and looked anxiously towards the point where dawson had disappeared bent followed her eyes  hell be here in a moment miss mallory he has to drive slowly through the grain but i hear the wheels he stopped and his voice took up its previous note of boyish hesitation by the wayillill be going up to the rancho this afternoon to see the major have you any message for mrs randolphor forfor miss adele  nosaid rose hesitatingly andand  i see interrupted bent carelessly you dont want anything said about your coming here i wont  it struck her that he seemed to have no ulterior meaning in the suggestion but before she could make any reply dawson reappeared driving a handsome mare harnessed to a light spiderlike vehicle he had also assumed evidently in great haste a black frock coat buttoned over his waistcoatless and cravatless shirt and a tall black hat that already seemed to be cracking in the sunlight he drove up at once assisted her to the narrow perch beside him and with a nod to bent drove off his breathless expedition relieved the leavetaking of these young people of any ceremony  i suppose said mr dawson giving a half glance over his shoulder as they struck into the dusty highwayi suppose you dont care to see anybody before you get to san jose  nooo said rose timidly  and i reckon you wouldnt mind my racin a bit if anybody kem up  no  the mares sort o fastidious about takin anybodys dust  is she said rose with a faint smile  awful responded her companion and the queerest thing of all is she cant bear to have any one behind her either  he leaned forward with his expression of humorous enjoyment of some latent joke and did something with the reinsrose never could clearly understand what though it seemed to her that he simply lifted them with ostentatious lightness but the mare suddenly seemed to lengthen herself and lose her height and the stalks of wheat on either side of the dusty track began to melt into each other and then slipped like a flash into one long continuous shimmering green hedge so perfect was the mares action that the girl was scarcely conscious of any increased effort so harmonious the whole movement that the light skeleton wagon seemed only a prolonged process of that long slim body and free collarless neck both straight as the thin shafts on each side and straighter than the delicate ribbonlike traces which in what seemed a mere affectation of conscious power hung at times almost limp between the whiffletree and the narrow breast band which was all that confined the animals powerful forequarters so superb was the reach of its long easy stride that rose could scarcely see any undulations in the brown shining back on which she could have placed her foot nor felt the soft beat of the delicate hoofs that took the dust so firmly and yet so lightly  the rapidity of motion which kept them both with heads bent forward and seemed to force back any utterance that rose to their lips spared rose the obligation of conversation and her companion was equally reticent but it was evident to her that he half suspected she was running away from the randolphs and that she wished to avoid the embarrassment of being overtaken even in persuasive pursuit it was not possible that he knew the cause of her flight and yet she could not account for his evident desire to befriend her nor above all for his apparently humorous enjoyment of the situation had he taken it gravely she might have been tempted to partly confide in him and ask his advice was she doing right after all ought she not to have stayed long enough to speak her mind to mrs randolph and demand to be sent home no she had not only shrunk from repeating the infamous slander she had overheard but she had a terrible fear that if she had done so mrs randolph was capable of denying it or even charging her of being still under the influence of the earthquake shock and of walking in her sleep no she could not trust hershe could trust no one there had not even the major listened to those infamous lies had she not seen that he was helpless in the hands of this cabal in his own householda cabal that she herself had thoughtlessly joined against him  they had reached the first slight ascent her companion drew out his watch looked at it with satisfaction and changed the position of his hands on the reins without being able to detect the difference she felt they were slackening speed she turned inquiringly towards him he nodded his head with a half smile and a gesture to her to look ahead the spires of san jose were already faintly uplifting from the distant fringe of oaks  so soon in fifteen minutes she would be thereand then she remembered suddenly she had not yet determined what to do should she go on at once to san francisco or telegraph to her father and await him at san jose in either case a new fear of the precipitancy of her action and the inadequacy of her reasons had sprung up in her mind would her father understand her would he underrate the cause and be mortified at the insult she had given the family of his old friend or more dreadful still would he exaggerate her wrongs and seek a personal quarrel with the major he was a man of quick temper and had the western ideas of redress perhaps even now she was precipitating a duel between them her cheeks grew wan again her breath came quickly tears gathered in her eyes oh she was a dreadful girl she knew it she was an utterly miserable one and she knew that too  the reins were tightened the pace lessened and at last fell to a walk conscious of her telltale eyes and troubled face she dared not turn to her companion to ask him why but glanced across the fields  when you first came i didnt get to know your name miss mallory but i reckon i know your father  her father what made him say that she wanted to speak but she felt she could not in another moment if he went on she must do somethingshe would cry  i reckon youll be wanting to go to the hotel first anyway  thereshe knew it he would keep on and now she had burst into tears  the mare was still walking slowly the man was lazily bending forward over the shafts as if nothing had occurred then suddenly illogically and without a moments warning the pride that had sustained her crumbled and became as the dust of the road  she burst out and told himthis strangerthis man she had dislikedall and everything how she had felt how she had been deceived and what she had overheard  i thought as much said her companion quietly and thats why i sent for your father  you sent for my fatherwhenwhere echoed rose in astonishment  yesterday he was to come today and if we dont find him at the hotel it will be because he has already started to come here by the upper and longer road but you leave it to me and dont you say anything to him of this now if hes at the hotel ill say i drove you down there to show off the mare sabe if he isnt ill leave you there and come back here to find him ive got something to tell him that will set you all right he smiled grimly lifted the reins the mare started forward again and the vehicle and its occupants disappeared in a vanishing dust cloud   chapter vi   it was nearly noon when mr dawson finished rubbing down his sweating mare in the little stable shed among the wheat he had left rose at the hotel for they found mr mallory had previously started by a circuitous route for the wheat ranch he had resumed not only his working clothes but his working expression he was now superintending the unloading of a wain of stores and implements when the light carryall of the randolphs rolled into the field it contained only mrs randolph and the driver a slight look of intelligence passed between the latter and the nearest one of dawsons companions succeeded however by a dull look of stupid vacancy on the faces of all the others including dawson mrs randolph noticed it and was forewarned she reflected that no human beings ever looked naturally as stupid as that and were able to work she smiled sarcastically and then began with dry distinctness and narrowing lips  miss mallory a young lady visiting us went out for an early walk this morning and has not returned it is possible she may have lost her way among your wheat have you seen anything of her  dawson raised his eyes from his work and glanced slowly around at his companions as if taking the heavy sense of the assembly one or two shook their heads mechanically and returned to their suspended labor he said coolly  nobody here seems to  she felt that they were lying she was only a woman against five men she was only a petty domestic tyrant she might have been a larger one but she had all the courage of that possibility  major randolph and my son are away she went on drawing herself erect but i know that the major will pay liberally if these men will search the field besides making it all right with youremployersfor the loss of time  dawson uttered a single word in a low voice to the man nearest him who apparently communicated it to the others for the four men stopped unloading and moved away one after the othereven the driver joining in the exodus mrs randolph smiled sarcastically it was plain that these people with all their boasted independence were quite amenable to pecuniary considerations nevertheless as dawson remained looking quietly at her she said  then i suppose theyve concluded to go and see  no ive sent them away so that they couldnt hear  hear what  what ive got to say to you  she looked at him suddenly then she said with a disdainful glance around her i see i am helpless here andthanks to your trickeryalone have a care sir i warn you that you will have to answer to major randolph for any insolence  i reckon you wont tell major randolph what i have to say to you he returned coolly  her lips were nearly a grayish hue but she said scornfully and why not do you know who you are talking to  the man came lazily forward to the carryall carelessly brushed aside the slack reins and resting his elbows on the horses back laid his chin on his hands as he looked up in the womans face  yes i know who im talking to he said coolly but as the major dont i reckon you wont tell him  stand away from that horse she said her whole face taking the grayish color of her lips but her black eyes growing smaller and brighter hand me those reins and let me pass what canaille are you to stop me  i thought so returned the man without altering his position you dont know me you never saw me before well im jim dawson the nephew of lhommadieu your old master  she gripped the iron rail of the seat as if to leap from it but checked herself suddenly and leaned back with a set smile on her mouth that seemed stamped there it was remarkable that with that smile she flung away her old affectation of superciliousness for an older and ruder audacity and that not only the expression but the type of her face appeared to have changed  i dont say continued the man quietly that he didnt marry you before he died but you know as well as i do that the laws of his state didnt recognize the marriage of a master with his octoroon slave and you know as well as i do that even if he had freed you he couldnt change your blood why if id been willing to stay at avoyelles to be a niggerdriver like him the plantation of de fontangeswhose name you have takenwould have been left to me if you had stayed there you might have been my property instead of your owning a square man like randolph you didnt think of that when you came here did you he said composedly  oh mon dieu she said dropping rapidly into a different accent with her white teeth and fixed mirthless smile so it is a claim for property eh youre wanting moneyyou tres bien you forget we are in california where one does not own a slave and you have a fine story there my poor friend very pretty but very hard to prove msieu and these peasants are in it eh working it on shares like the farm eh  well said dawson slightly changing his position and passing his hand over the horses neck with a halfwearied contempt one of these men is from plaquemine and the other from coupee they know all the lhommadieus history and they know a streak of the tar brush when they see it they took your measure when they came here last year and sized you up fairly so had i for the matter of that when i first saw you and we compared notes but the major is a square man for all he is your husband and we reckoned he had a big enough contract on his hands to take care of you and lhommadieus halfbreeds and sohe tossed the reins contemptuously asidewe kept this to ourselves  and now you wantwhateh  we want an end to this foolery he broke out roughly stepping back from the vehicle and facing her suddenly with his first angry gesture we want an end to these airs and grimaces and all this dandy nigger business we want an end to this cakewalking through the wheat and flouting of the honest labor of your betters we want you and your de fontanges to climb down and we want an end to this ropingin of white folks to suit your little game we want an end to your trying to mix your nigger blood with any one here and we intend to stop it we draw the line at the major  lashed as she had been by those words apparently out of all semblance of her former social arrogance a lower and more stubborn resistance seemed to have sprung up in her as she sat sideways watching him with her set smile and contracting eyes  ah she said dryly so she is here i thought so which of you is it eh its a good specmallorys a rich man shes not particular  the man had stopped as if listening his head turned towards the road then he turned carelessly and facing her again waved his hand with a gesture of tired dismissal and said go youll find your driver over there by the toolshed he has heard nothing yetbut ive given you fair warning go  he walked slowly back towards the shed as the woman snatching up the reins drove violently off in the direction where the men had disappeared but she turned aside ignoring her waiting driver in her wild and reckless abandonment of all her old conventional attitudes and lashing her horse forward with the same set smile on her face the same odd relaxation of figure and the same squaring of her elbows  avoiding the main road she pushed into a narrow track that intersected another nearer the scene of the accident to roses buggy three weeks before she had nearly passed it when she was hailed by a strange voice and looking up perceived a horseman floundering in the mazes of the wheat to one side of the track whatever mean thought of her past life she was flying from whatever mean purpose she was flying to she pulled up suddenly and as suddenly resumed her erect aggressive stiffness the stranger was a middleaged man in dress and appearance a dweller of cities he lifted his hat as he perceived the occupant of the wagon to be a lady  i beg your pardon but i fear ive lost my way in trying to make a short cut to the excelsior companys ranch  you are in it now said mrs randolph quickly  thank you but where can i find the farmhouse  there is none she returned with her old superciliousness unless you choose to give that name to the shanties and sheds where the laborers and servants live near the road  the stranger looked puzzled im looking for a mr dawson he said reflectively but i may have made some mistake do you know major randolphs house hereabouts  i do i am mrs randolph she said stiffly  the strangers brow cleared and he smiled pleasantly then this is a fortunate meeting he said raising his hat again as he reined in his horse beside the wagon for i am mr mallory and i was looking forward to the pleasure of presenting myself to you an hour or two later the fact is an old acquaintance mr dawson telegraphed me yesterday to meet him here on urgent business and i felt obliged to go there first  mrs randolphs eyes sparkled with a sudden gratified intelligence but her manner seemed rather to increase than abate its grim precision  our meeting this morning mr mallory is both fortunate and unfortunate for i regret to say that your daughter who has not been quite herself since the earthquake was missing early this morning and has not yet been found though we have searched everywhere understand me she said as the stranger started i have no fear for her personal safety i am only concerned for any indiscretion that she may commit in the presence of these strangers whose company she would seem to prefer to ours  but i dont understand you madam said mallory sternly you are speaking of my daughter and  excuse me mr mallory said mrs randolph lifting her hand with her driest deprecation and her most desiccating smile im not passing judgment or criticism i am of a foreign race and consequently do not understand the freedom of american young ladies and their familiarity with the opposite sex i make no charges i only wish to assure you that she will no doubt be found in the company and under the protection of her own countrymen there is she added with ironical distinctness a young mechanic or field hand or quack welldoctor whom she seems to admire and with whom she appears to be on equal terms  mallory regarded her for a moment fixedly and then his sternness relaxed to a mischievously complacent smile that must be young bent of whom ive heard he said with unabated cheerfulness and i dont know but what she may be with him after all for now i think of it a chuckleheaded fellow of whom a moment ago i inquired the way to your house told me id better ask the young man and young woman who were philandering through the wheat yonder suppose we look for them from what ive heard of bent hes too much wrapped up in his inventions for flirtation but it would be a good joke to stumble upon them  mrs randolphs eyes sparkled with a mingling of gratified malice and undisguised contempt for the fatuous father beside her but before she could accept or decline the challenge it had become useless a murmur of youthful voices struck her ear and she suddenly stood upright and transfixed in the carriage for lounging down slowly towards them out of the dim green aisles of the arbored wheat lost in themselves and the shimmering veil of their seclusion came the engineer thomas bent and on his arm gazing ingenuously into his face the figure of adeleher own perfect daughter   i dont think my dear said mr mallory as the anxious rose flew into his arms on his return to san jose a few hours later that it will be necessary for you to go back again to major randolphs before we leave i have said goodby for you and thanked them and your trunks are packed and will be sent here the fact is my dear you see this affair of the earthquake and the disaster to the artesian well have upset all their arrangements and i am afraid that my little girl would be only in their way just now  and you have seen mr dawsonand you know why he sent for you asked the young girl with nervous eagerness  ah yes said mr mallory thoughtfully that was really important you see my child he continued taking her hand in one of his own and patting the back of it gently with the other we think dawson and i of taking over the majors ranch and incorporating it with the excelsior in one to be worked on shares like the excelsior and as mrs randolph is very anxious to return to the atlantic states with her children it is quite possible mrs randolph as you have possibly noticed mr mallory went on still patting his daughters hand does not feel entirely at home here and will consequently leave the major free to rearrange by himself the ranch on the new basis in fact as the change must be made before the crops come in she talks of going next week but if you like the place rose ive no doubt the major and dawson will always find room for you and me when we run down there for a little fresh air  and did you have all that in your mind papa when you came down here and was that what you and mr dawson wanted to talk about said the astonished rose  mainly my dear mainly you see im a capitalist now and the real value of capital is to know how and when to apply it to certain conditions  and this mrmr bentdo you thinkhe will go on and find the water papa said rose hesitatingly  ah benttom bentoh yes said mallory with great heartiness capital fellow bent and mighty ingenious glad you met him well thoughtfully but still heartily he may not find it exactly where he expected but hell find it or something better we cant part with him and he has promised dawson to stay well utilize him you may be sure  it would seem that they did and from certain interviews and conversations that took place between mr bent and miss mallory on a later visit it would also appear that her father had exercised a discreet reticence in regard to a certain experiment of the young inventor of which he had been an accidental witness     a maecenas of the pacific slope   chapter i   as mr robert rushbrook known to an imaginative press as the maecenas of the pacific slope drove up to his country seat equally referred to as a palatial villa he cast a quick but practical look at the pillared pretensions of that enormous shell of wood and paint and plaster the statement also a reportorial one that its site the canyon of los osos some three years ago was disturbed only by the passing tread of bear and wildcat had lost some of its freshness as a picturesque apology and already successive improvements on the original building seemingly cast the older part of the structure back to a hoary antiquity to many it stood as a symbol of everything robert rushbrook did or had donean improvement of all previous performances it was like his own lifean exciting though irritating state of transition to something better yet the visible architectural result as here shown was scarcely harmonious indeed some of his friendsand maecenas had manyprofessed to classify the various improvements by the successive fortunate ventures in their owners financial career which had led to new additions under the names of the comstock lode period the union pacific renaissance the great wheat corner and water front gable style a humorous trifling that did not however prevent a few who were artists from accepting maecenass liberal compensation for their services in giving shape to those ideas  relinquishing to a groom his fasttrotting team the second relay in his two hours drive from san francisco he leaped to the ground to meet the architect already awaiting his orders in the courtyard with his eyes still fixed upon the irregular building before him he mingled his greeting and his directions  look here barker well have a wing thrown out here and a hundredfoot ballroom something to hold a crowd something that can be used for musicsabea concert or a show  have you thought of any style mr rushbrook suggested the architect  no said rushbrook ive been thinking of the timethirty days and everything to be in youll stop to dinner ill have you sit near jack somers you can talk style to him say i told you  you wish it completed in thirty days repeated the architect dubiously  well i shouldnt mind if it were less you can begin at once theres a telegraph in the house patrick will take any message and you can send up to san francisco and fix things before dinner  before the man could reply rushbrook was already giving a hurried interview to the gardener and others on his way to the front porch in another moment he had entered his own halla wonderful temple of white and silver plaster formal yet friable like the sugared erection of a wedding cakewhere his majordomo awaited him  well whos here asked rushbrook still advancing towards his apartments  dinner is set for thirty sir said the functionary keeping step demurely with his master but mr appleby takes ten over to san mateo and some may sleep there the charabanc is still out and five saddlehorses to a picnic in green canyon and i cant positively say but i should think you might count on seeing about fortyfive guests before you go to town tomorrow the opera troupe seem to have not exactly understood the invitation sir  how i gave it myself  the chorus and supernumeraries thought themselves invited too sir and have come i believe sir at least signora pegrelli and madame denise said so and that they would speak to you about it but that meantime i could put them up anywhere  and you made no distinction of course  no sir i put them in the corresponding rooms opposite sir i dont think the prima donnas like it  ah  yes sir  whatever was in their minds the two men never changed their steady practical gravity of manner the majordomos appeared to be a subdued imitation of his masters worn as he might have worn his masters clothes had he accepted or mr rushbrook permitted such a degradation by this time they had reached the door of mr rushbrooks room and the man paused i didnt include some guests of mr leytons sir that he brought over here to show around the place but he told me to tell you he would take them away again or leave them as you liked theyre some eastern strangers stopping with him  all right said rushbrook quietly as he entered his own apartment it was decorated as garishly as the hall as staring and vivid in color but wholesomely new and clean for all its paint veneering and plaster it was filled with heterogeneous splendorall new and well kept yet with so much of the attitude of the showroom still lingering about it that one almost expected to see the various articles of furniture ticketed with their prices a luxurious bed with satin hangings and indian carved posts standing ostentatiously in a corner kept up this resemblance for in a curtained recess stood a worn camp bedstead rushbrooks real couch spartan in its simplicity  mr rushbrook drew his watch from his pocket and deliberately divested himself of his boots coat waistcoat and cravat then rolling himself in a fleecy blanketlike rug with something of the habitual dexterity of a frontiersman he threw himself on his couch closed his eyes and went instantly to sleep lying there he appeared to be a man comfortably middleaged with thick irongray hair that might have curled had he encouraged such inclination a skin roughened and darkened by external hardships and exposure but free from taint of inner vice or excess and indistinctive features redeemed by a singularly handsome mouth as the lower part of the face was partly hidden by a dense but closelycropped beard it is probable that the delicate outlines of his lips had gained something from their framing  he slept through what seemed to be the unnatural stillness of the large housea quiet that might have come from the lingering influence of the still virgin solitude around it as if nature had forgotten the intrusion or were stealthily retaking her own and later through the rattle of returning wheels or the sound of voices which were however promptly absorbed in that deep and masterful silence which was the unabdicating genius of the canyon for it was remarkable that even the various artists musicians orators and poets whom maecenas had gathered in his cool business fashion under that roof all seemed to become by contrast with surrounding nature as new and artificial as the house and as powerless to assert themselves against its influence  he was still sleeping when james reentered the room but awoke promptly at the sound of his voice in a few moments he had rearranged his scarcely disordered toilette and stepped out refreshed and observant into the hall the guests were still absent from that part of the building and he walked leisurely past the carelessly opened doors of the rooms they had left everywhere he met the same glaring ornamentation and color the same garishness of treatment the same inharmonious extravagance of furniture and everywhere the same troubled acceptance of it by the inmates or the same sense of temporary and restricted tenancy dresses were hung over cheval glasses clothes piled up on chairs to avoid the use of doubtful and over ornamented wardrobes and in some cases more practical guests had apparently encamped in a corner of their apartment a gentleman from siskyousole proprietor of a mill patent now being considered by maecenashad confined himself to a rockingchair and clotheshorse as being trustworthy and familiar a bolder spirit from yrekain treaty for capital to start an independent journal devoted to maecenass interestshad got a good deal out of and indeed all he had into a louis xvi armoire while a young painter from sacramento had simply retired into his adjoining bathroom leaving the glories of his bedroom untarnished suddenly he paused  he had turned into a smaller passage in order to make a shorter cut through one of the deserted suites of apartments that should bring him to that part of the building where he designed to make his projected improvement when his feet were arrested on the threshold of a sittingroom although it contained the same decoration and furniture as the other rooms it looked totally different it was tasteful luxurious comfortable and habitable the furniture seemed to have fallen into harmonious position even the staring decorations of the walls and ceiling were toned down by sprays of laurel and redstained manzanito boughs with their berries apparently fresh plucked from the near canyon but he was more unexpectedly impressed to see that the room was at that moment occupied by a tall handsome girl who had paused to take breath with her hand still on the heavy centretable she was moving standing there graceful glowing and animated she looked the living genius of the recreated apartment   chapter ii   mr rushbrook glanced rapidly at his unknown guest excuse me he said with respectful business brevity but i thought every one was out and he stepped backward quickly  ive only just come she said without embarrassment and would you mind as you are here giving me a lift with this table  certainly replied rushbrook and under the young girls direction the millionaire moved the table to one side  during the operation he was trying to determine which of his unrecognized guests the fair occupant was possibly one of the leyton party that james had spoken of as impending  then you have changed all the furniture and put up these things he asked pointing to the laurel  yes the room was really something too awful it looks better now dont you think  a hundred per cent said rushbrook promptly look here ill tell you what youve done youve set the furniture to work it was simply lying stillwith no return to anybody on the investment  the young girl opened her gray eyes at this and then smiled the intruder seemed to be characteristic of california as for rushbrook he regretted that he did not know her better he would at once have asked her to rearrange all the rooms and have managed in some way liberally to reward her for it a girl like that had no nonsense about her  yes she said i wonder mr rushbrook dont look at it in that way it is a shame that all these pretty thingsand you know they are really good and valuableshouldnt show what they are but i suppose everybody here accepts the fact that this man simply buys them because they are valuable and nobody interferes and is content to humor him laugh at him and feel superior it dont strike me as quite fair does it you  rushbrook was pleased without the vanity that would be either annoyed at this revelation of his reputation or gratified at her defense of it he was simply glad to discover that she had not recognized him as her host and could continue the conversation unreservedly have you seen the ladies boudoir he asked you know the room fitted with knickknacks and pretty thingssome of em bought from old collections in europe by fellows who knew what they were but perhaps he added looking into her eyes for the first time didnt know exactly what ladies cared for  i merely glanced in there when i first came for there was such a queer lot of womenim told he isnt very particular in that waythat i didnt stay  and you didnt think they might be just as valuable and good as some of the furniture if they could have been pulled around and put into shape or set in a corner eh  the young girl smiled she thought her fellowguest rather amusing none the less so perhaps for catching up her own ideas but nevertheless she slightly shrugged her shoulders with that hopeless skepticism which women reserve for their own sex some of them looked as if they had been pulled around as you say and hadnt been improved by it  theres no one there now said rushbrook with practical directness come and take a look at it she complied without hesitation walking by his side tall easy and selfpossessed apparently accepting without selfconsciousness his half paternal half comradelike informality the boudoir was a large room repeating on a bigger scale the incongruousness and ill fitting splendor of the others when she had of her own accord recognized and pointed out the more admirable articles he said gravely looking at his watch weve just about seven minutes yet if youd like to pull and haul these things around ill help you  the young girl smiled im quite content with what ive done in my own room where i have no ones taste to consult but my own i hardly know how mr rushbrook or his lady friends might like my operating here then recognizing with feminine tact the snub that might seem implied in her refusal she said quickly tell me something about our hostbut first look isnt that pretty  she had stopped before the window that looked upon the dim blue abyss of the canyon and was leaning out to gaze upon it rushbrook joined her  there isnt much to be changed down there is there he said half interrogatively  no not unless mr rushbrook took it into his head to roof it in and somebody was ready with a contract to do it but what do you know of him remember im quite a stranger here  you came with charley leyton  with mrs leytons party said the young girl with a halfsmiling emphasis but it seems that we dont know whether mr rushbrook wants us here or not till he comes and the drollest thing about it is that theyre all so perfectly frank in saying so  charley and he are old friends and youll do well to trust to their judgment  this was hardly the kind of response that the handsome and clever society girl before him had been in the habit of receiving but it amused her her fellowguest was decidedly original but he hadnt told her about rushbrook and it struck her that his opinion would be independent at least she reminded him of it  look here said rushbrook youll meet a man here tonightor hell be sure to meet youwholl tell you all about rushbrook hes a smart chap knows everybody and talks well his name is jack somers he is a great ladies man he can talk to you about these sort of things tooindicating the furniture with a half tolerant half contemptuous gesture that struck her as inconsistent with what seemed to be his previous interestjust as well as he can talk of people been in europe too  the young girls eye brightened with a quick vivacity at the name but a moment after became reflective and slightly embarrassed i know himi met him at mr leytons he has already talked of mr rushbrook but she added avoiding any conclusion with a pretty pout id like to have the opinion of others yours now i fancy would be quite independent  you stick to what jack somers has said good or bad and you wont be far wrong he said assuringly he stopped his quick ear had heard approaching voices he returned to her and held out his hand as it seemed to her that in california everybody shook hands with everybody else on the slightest occasions sometimes to save further conversation she gave him her own he shook it less forcibly than she had feared and abruptly left her for a moment she was piqued at this superior and somewhat brusque way of ignoring her request but reflecting that it might be the awkwardness of an untrained man she dismissed it from her mind the voices of her friends in the already resounding passages also recalled her to the fact that she had been wandering about the house with a stranger and she rejoined them a little selfconsciously  well my dear said mrs leyton gayly it seems we are to stay leyton says rushbrook wont hear of our going  does that mean that your husband takes the whole opera troupe over to your house in exchange  dont be satirical but congratulate yourself on your opportunity of seeing an awfully funny gathering i wouldnt have you miss it for the world its the most characteristic thing out  characteristic of what  of rushbrook of course nobody else would conceive of getting together such a lot of queer people  but dont it strike you that were a part of the lot  perhaps returned the lively mrs leyton no doubt thats the reason why jack somers is coming over and is so anxious that you should stay i cant imagine why else he should rave about miss grace nevil as he does come grace no new york or philadelphia airs here consider your uncles interests with this capitalist to say nothing of ours because youre a millionaire and have been accustomed to riches from your birth dont turn up your nose at our unpampered appetites besides jack somers is rushbrooks particular friend and he may think your criticisms unkind  but is mr somers such a great friend of mr rushbrooks asked grace nevil  why of course rushbrook consults him about all these things gives him carte blanche to invite whom he likes and order what he likes and trusts his taste and judgment implicitly  then this gathering is mr somerss selection  how preposterous you are grace of course not only somerss idea of what is pleasing to rushbrook gotten up with a taste and discretion all his own you know somers is a gentleman educated at west pointtraveled all over europeyou might have met him there and rushbrookwell you have only to see him to know what he is dont you understand  a slight seriousness the same shadow that once before darkened the girls charming face gave way to a mischievous knitting of her brows as she said naively no   chapter iii   grace nevil had quite recovered her equanimity when the indispensable mr somers handsome wellbred and selfrestrained approached her later in the crowded drawingroom blended with his subdued personal admiration was a certain ostentation of respectas of a tribute to a distinguished guestthat struck her i am to have the pleasure of taking you in miss nevil he said its my one compensation for the dreadful responsibility just thrust upon me our host has been suddenly called away and i am left to take his place  miss nevil was slightly startled nevertheless she smiled graciously from what i hear this is no new function of yours that is if there really is a mr rushbrook i am inclined to think him a myth  you make me wish he were retorted somers gallantly but as i couldnt reign at all except in his stead i shall look to you to lend your rightful grace to my borrowed dignity  the more general announcement to the company was received with a few perfidious regrets from the more polite but with only amused surprise by the majority indeed many considered it characteristicso like bob rushbrook and a few enthusiastic friends looked upon it as a crowning and intentional stroke of humor it remained however for the gentleman from siskyou to give the incident a subtlety that struck miss nevils fancy it reminds me he said in her hearing of ole kernel frisbee of robertson county one of the purlitest men i ever struck when he knew a feller was very dry hed jest set the decanter afore him and managed to be called outer the room on busness now bob rushbrooks about as white a man as that hes jest the feller who knowing you and me might feel kinder restrained about indulging our appetites afore him kinder drops out easy and leaves us alone and she was impressed by an instinct that the speaker really felt the delicacy he spoke of and that it left no sense of inferiority behind  the dinner served in a large brilliantlylit saloon that in floral decoration and gilded columns suggested an ingenious blending of a steamboat table dhote and harvest home was perfect in its cuisine even if somewhat extravagant in its proportions  i should be glad to receive the salary that rushbrook pays his chef and still happier to know how to earn it as fairly said somers to his fair companion  but is his skill entirely appreciated here she asked  perfectly responded somers our friend from siskyou over there appreciates that pate which he cannot name as well as i do rushbrook himself is the only exception yet i fancy that even his simplicity and regularity in feeding is as much a matter of business with him as any defect in his earlier education in his eyes his chefs greatest qualification is his promptness and fertility have you noticed that ornament before you pointing to an elaborate confection it bears your initials you see it was conceived and executed since you arrivedrather i should say since it was known that you would honor us with your company the greatest difficulty encountered was to find out what your initials were  and i suppose mischievously added the young girl to her acknowledgments that the same fertile mind which conceived the design eventually provided the initials  that is our secret responded somers with affected gravity  the wines were of characteristic expensiveness and provoked the same general comment rushbrook seldom drank wine somers had selected it but the barbaric opulence of the entertainment culminated in the californian fruits piled in pyramids on silver dishes gorgeous and unreal in their size and painted beauty and the two divas smiled over a basket of grapes and peaches as outrageous in dimensions and glaring color as any pasteboard banquet at which they had professionally assisted as the courses succeeded each other under the exaltation of wine conversation became more general as regarded participation but more local and private as regarded the subject until miss nevil could no longer follow it the interests of that one the hopes of another the claims of a third in affairs that were otherwise uninteresting were all discussed with singular youthfulness of trust that to her alone seemed remarkable not that she lacked entertainment from the conversation of her clever companion whose confidences and criticisms were very pleasant to her but she had a gentlewomans instinct that he talked to her too much and more than was consistent with his duties as the general host she looked around the table for her singular acquaintance of an hour before but she had not seen him since she would have spoken about him to somers but she had an instinctive idea that the latter would be antipathetic in spite of the strangers flattering commendation so she found herself again following somerss cynical but goodhumored description of the various guests and i fear seeing with his eyes listening with his ears and occasionally participating in his superior attitude the fearful joy she had found in the novelty of the situation and the originality of the actors seemed now quite right from this critical point of view so she learned how the guest with the long hair was an unknown painter to whom rushbrook had given a commission for three hundred yards of painted canvas to be cut up and framed as occasion and space required in rushbrooks new hotel in san francisco how the graybearded foreigner near him was an accomplished bibliophile who was furnishing mr rushbrooks library from spoils of foreign collections and had suffered unheardof agonies from the millionaires insisting upon a handsome uniform binding that should deprive certain precious but musty tomes of their crumbling wormeaten coverings how the very gentle clericallooking stranger mildest of a noisy disputing crowd at the other table was a notorious duelist and dead shot how the only gentleman at the table who retained a flannel shirt and high boots was not a latecoming mountaineer but a wellknown english baronet on his travels how the man who told a somewhat florid and emphatic anecdote was a popular eastern clergyman how the one querulous discontented face in a laughing group was the famous humorist who had just convulsed it and how a pale handsome young fellow who ate and drank sparingly and disregarded the coquettish advances of the prettiest diva with the cold abstraction of a student was a notorious roue and gambler but there was a sudden and unlookedfor change of criticism and critic  the festivity had reached that stage when the guests were more or less accessible to emotion and more or less touched by the astounding fact that every one was enjoying himself this phenomenon which is apt to burst into song or dance among other races is constrained to voice itself in an anglosaxon gathering by some explanation apology or moralknown as an afterdinner speech thus it was that the gentleman from siskyou who had been from time to time casting glances at somers and his fair companion at the head of the table now rose to his feet albeit unsteadily pushed back his chair and began  pears to me ladies and gentlemen and feller pardners that on an occasion like this suthin oughter be said of the man who got it upwhose money paid for it and who aint here to speak for himself except by deputy yet you all know thats bob rushbrooks stylehe aint here because hes full of some other plan or improvementsand its like him to start suthin of this kind give it its aim and purpose and then stand aside to let somebody else run it for him there aint no man livin ez hez so to speak more fast horses ready saddled for riding and more fast men ready spurred to ride emwhether to win his races or run his errands there aint no man livin ez knows better how to make other mens games his or his game seem to be other mens and from jack somers smilin over there ez knows where to get the best wine that bob pays for and knows how to run this yer show for bob at bobs expensewere all contented ladies and gentlemen were all contented we stand so to speak on the cards hes dealt us what may be his little game it aint for us to say but whatever it is were in it gentlemen and ladies well drink bobs health  there was a somewhat sensational pause followed by goodnatured laughter and applause in which somers joined yet not without a certain constraint that did not escape the quick sympathy of the shocked and unsmiling miss nevil it was with a feeling of relief that she caught the chaperoning eye of mrs leyton who was entreating her in the usual mysterious signal to the other ladies to rise and follow her when she reached the drawingroom a little behind the others she was somewhat surprised to observe that the stranger whom she had missed during the evening was approaching her with mrs leyton  mr rushbrook returned sooner than he expected but unfortunately as he always retires early he has only time to say goodnight to you before he goes  for an instant grace nevil was more angry than disconcerted then came the conviction that she was stupid not to have suspected the truth before who else would that brusque stranger develop into but this rude host she bowed formally  mr rushbrook looked at her with the faintest smile on his handsome mouth well miss nevil i hope jack somers satisfied your curiosity  with a sudden recollection of the siskyou gentlemans speech and a swift suspicion that in some way she had been made use of with the others by this forcefullooking man before her she answered pertly  yes but there was a speech by a gentleman from siskyou that struck me as being nearer to the purpose  thats soi heard it as i came in said mr rushbrook calmly i dont know but youre right   chapter iv   six months had passed the villa of maecenas was closed at los osos canyon and the southwest tradewinds were slanting the rains of the wet season against its shut windows and barred doors within that hollow deserted shell its aspectsave for a single exceptionwas unchanged the furniture and decorations preserved their eternal youth undimmed by time the rigidlyarranged rooms now closed to life and light developed more than ever their resemblance to a furniture warehouse the single exception was the room which grace nevil had rearranged for herself and that oddly enough was stripped and bareeven to its paper and mouldings  in other respects the sealed treasures of rushbrooks villa far from provoking any sentimentality seemed only to give truth to the current rumor that it was merely waiting to be transformed into a gorgeous wateringplace hotel under rushbrooks direction that with its new ballroom changed into an elaborate dininghall it would undergo still further improvement the inevitable end and object of all rushbrooks enterprise and that its former proprietor had already begun another villa whose magnificence should eclipse the last there certainly appeared to be no limit to the millionaires success in all that he personally undertook or in his fortunate complicity with the enterprise and invention of others his name was associated with the oldest and safest schemes as well as the newest and boldestwith an equal guarantee of security a few it was true looked doubtingly upon this one man power but could not refute the fact that others had largely benefited by association with him and that he shared his profits with a royal hand some objected on higher grounds to his brutalizing the influence of wealth by his material and extravagantly practical processes instead of the gentler suggestions of education and personal example and were impelled to point out the fact that he and his patronage were vulgar it was felt however by those who received his benefits that a proper sense of this inferiority was all that ethics demanded of them one could still accept rushbrooks barbaric gifts by humorously recognizing the fact that he didnt know any better and that it pleased him as long as they resented any higher pretensions  the rainbeaten windows of rushbrooks town house however were cheerfully lit that december evening mr rushbrook seldom dined alone in fact it was popularly alleged that very often the unfinished business of the day was concluded over his bountiful and perfect board he was dressing as james entered the room  mr leyton is in your study sir he will stay to dinner  all right  i think sir added james with respectful suggestiveness he wants to talk at least sir he asked me if you would likely come downstairs before your company arrived  ah well tell the others im dining on business and set dinner for two in the blue room  yes sir  meanwhile mr leytona man of rushbrooks age but not so fresh and vigorouslookinghad thrown himself in a chair beside the study fire after a glance around the handsome and familiar room for the house had belonged to a brother millionaire it had changed hands with certain shares of water frontas some of rushbrooks dealings had the true barbaric absence of money detailand was elegantly and tastefully furnished the cuckoo had however already laid a few characteristic eggs in this adopted nest and a white marble statue of a nude and illfed virtue sent over by rushbrooks paris agent and unpacked that morning stood in one corner and materially brought down the temperature a japanese prayingthrone of pure ivory and above it a few yards of improper colored exposure by an old master equalized each other  and what is all this affair about the dinner suddenly asked a tartlypitched female voice with a foreign accent  mr leyton turned quickly and was just conscious of a faint shriek the rustle of a skirt and the swift vanishing of a womans figure from the doorway mr leyton turned red rushbrook lived en garcon with feminine possibilities leyton was a married man and a deacon the incident which to a man of the world would have brought only a smile fired the inexperienced leyton with those exaggerated ideas and intense credulity regarding vice common to some very good men he walked on tiptoe to the door and peered into the passage at that moment rushbrook entered from the opposite door of the room  well said rushbrook with his usual practical directness what do you think of her  leyton still flushed and with eyebrows slightly knit said awkwardly that he had scarcely seen her  she cost me already ten thousand dollars and i suppose ill have to eventually fix up a separate room for her somewhere continued rushhrook  i should certainly advise it said leyton quickly for really rushbrook you know that something is due to the respectable people who come here and any of them are likely to see  ah interrupted rushbrook seriously you think she hasnt got on clothes enough why look here old manshes one of the virtues and thats the rig in which they always travel shes a temperance or a charity or a resignation or something of that kind youll find her name there in french somewhere at the foot of the marble  leyton saw his mistake but feltas others sometimes felta doubt whether this smileless man was not inwardly laughing at him he replied with a keen rapid glance at his host  i was referring to some woman who stood in that doorway just now and addressed me rather familiarly thinking it was you  oh the signora said rushbrook with undisturbed directness well you saw her at los osos last summer likely she did think you were me  the cool ignoring of any ulterior thought in leytons objection forced the guest to be equally practical in his reply  yes but the fact is that miss nevil had talked of coming here with me this evening to see you on her own affairs and it wouldnt have been exactly the thing for her to meet that woman  she wouldnt said rushbrook promptly nor would you if you had gone into the parlor as miss nevil would have done but look here if thats the reason why you didnt bring her send for her at once my coachman can take a card from you the broughams all ready to fetch her and there you are shell see only you and me he was already moving towards the bell when leyton stopped him  no matter now i can tell you her business i fancy and in fact i came here to speak of it quite independently of her  that wont do leyton interrupted rushbrook with crisp decision one or the other interview is unnecessary it wastes time and isnt business better have her present even if she dont say a word  yes but not in this matter responded leyton its about somers you know hes been very attentive to her ever since her uncle left her here to recruit her health and i think she fancies him well although shes independent and her own mistress as you know mrs leyton and i are somewhat responsible for her acquaintance with somersand for that matter so are you and as my wife thinks it means a marriage we ought to know something more positive about somerss prospects now all we really know is that hes a great friend of yours that you trust a good deal to him that he manages your social affairs that you treat him as a son or nephew and its generally believed that hes as good as provided for by youeh did you speak  no said rushbrook quietly regarding the statue as if taking its measurement for a suitable apartment for it go on  well said leyton a little impatiently thats the belief everybody has and youve not contradicted it and on that weve taken the responsibility of not interfering with somerss attentions  well said rushbrook interrogatively  well replied leyton emphatically you see i must ask you positively if you have done anything or are you going to do anything for him  well replied rushbrook with exasperating coolness what do you call this marriage  i dont understand you said leyton  look here leyton said rushbrook suddenly and abruptly facing him jack somers has brains knowledge of society tact accomplishments and good looks thats his capital as much as mine is money i employ him thats his advertisement recommendation and credit now on the strength of this as you say miss nevil is willing to invest in him i dont see what more can be done  but if her uncle dont think it enough  shes independent and has money for both  but if she thinks shes been deceived and changes her mind  leyton you dont know miss nevil whatever that girl undertakes shes weighed fully and goes through with if shes trusted him enough to marry him money wont stop her if she thinks shes been deceived youll never know it  the enthusiasm and conviction were so unlike rushbrooks usual cynical toleration of the sex that leyton stared at him  thats odd he returned thats what she says of you  of me you mean somers  no of you come rushbrook dont pretend you dont know that miss nevil is a great partisan of yours swears by you says youre misunderstood by people and whats infernally odd in a woman who dont belong to the class you fancy dont talk of your habits thats why she wants to consult you about somers i suppose and thats why knowing you might influence her i came here first to warn you  and ive told you that whatever i might say or do wouldnt influence her so well drop the subject  not yet for youre bound to see miss nevil sooner or later now if she knows that youve done nothing for this man your friend and her lover wont she be justified in thinking that you would have a reason for it  yes i should give it  what reason  that i knew shed be more contented to have him speculate with her money than mine  then you think that he isnt a business man  i think that she thinks so or she wouldnt marry him its part of the attraction but come james has been for five minutes discreetly waiting outside the door to tell us dinner is ready and the coast clear of all other company but look here he said suddenly stopping with his arm in leytons youre through your talk i suppose perhaps youd rather wed dine with the signora and the others than alone  for an instant leyton thrilled with the fascination of what he firmly believed was a guilty temptation rushbrook perceiving his hesitation added  by the way somers is of the party and one or two others you know  mr leyton opened his eyes widely at this either the temptation had passed or the idea of being seen in doubtful company by a younger man was distasteful for he hurriedly disclaimed any preference but he added with halfsignificant politeness perhaps im keeping you from them  it makes not the slightest difference to me calmly returned rushbrook with such evident truthfulness that leyton was both convinced and chagrined  preceded by the grave and ubiquitous james they crossed the large hall and entered through a smaller passage a charming apartment hung with blue damask which might have been a boudoir study or small receptionroom yet had the air of never having been anything continuously it would seem that rushbrooks habit of camping out in different parts of his mansion obtained here as at los osos and with the exception of a small closet which contained his spartan bed the rooms were used separately or in suites as occasion or his friends required it is recorded that an eastern guest newly arrived with letters to rushbrook after a tedious journey expressed himself pleased with this same blue room in which he had sumptuously dined with his host and subsequently fell asleep in his chair without disturbing his guest rushbrook had the table removed a bed washstand and bureau brought in the sleeping man delicately laid upon the former and left to awaken to an arabian nights realization of his wish   chapter v   james had barely disposed of his master and mr leyton and left them to the ministrations of two of his underlings before he was confronted with one of those difficult problems that it was part of his functions to solve the porter informed him that a young lady had just driven up in a carriage ostensibly to see mr rushbrook and james descending to the outer vestibule found himself face to face with miss grace nevil happily that young lady with her usual tact spared him some embarrassment  oh james she said sweetly do you think that i could see mr rushbrook for a few moments if i waited for the opportunity you understand i dont wish to disturb him or his company by being regularly announced  the young girls practical intelligence appeared to increase the usual respect which james had always shown her i understand miss he thought for a moment and said would you mind then following me where you could wait quietly and alone as she quickly assented he preceded her up the staircase past the study and drawingroom which he did not enter and stopped before a small door at the end of the passage then handing her a key which he took from his pocket he said this is the only room in the house that is strictly reserved for mr rushbrook and even he rarely uses it you can wait here without anybody knowing it until i can communicate with him and bring you to his study unobserved and he hesitated if you wouldnt mind locking the door when you are in miss you would be more secure and i will knock when i come for you  grace nevil smiled at the mans prudence and entered the room but to her great surprise she had scarcely shut the door when she was instantly struck with a singular memory which the apartment recalled it was exactly like the room she had altered in rushbrooks villa at los osos more than that on close examination it proved to be the very same furniture arranged as she remembered to have arranged it even to the flowers and grasses now alas faded and withered on the walls there could be no mistake there was the open ebony escritoire with the satin blotter open and its leaves still bearing the marks of her own handwriting so complete to her mind was the idea of her own tenancy in this bachelors mansion that she looked around with a half indignant alarm for the photograph or portrait of herself that might further indicate it but there was no other exposition the only thing that had been added was a gilt legend on the satin case of the blotterlos osos august 20 186 the day she had occupied the room  she was pleased astonished but more than all disturbed the only man who might claim a right to this figurative possession of her tastes and habits was the one whom she had quietly reflectively and understandingly half accepted as her lover and on whose account she had come to consult rushbrook but somers was not a sentimentalist in fact as a young girl forced by her independent position to somewhat critically scrutinize masculine weaknesses this had always been a point in his favor yet even if he had joined with his friend rushbrook to perpetuate the memory of their first acquaintanceship his taste merely would not have selected a chambre de garcon in mr rushbrooks home for its exhibition her conception of the opposite characters of the two men was singularly distinct and real and this momentary confusion of them was disagreeable to her womans sense but at this moment james came to release her and conduct her to rushbrooks study where he would join her at once everything had been arranged as she had wished  even a more practical man than rushbrook might have lingered over the picture of the tall graceful figure of miss nevil quietly enthroned in a large armchair by the fire her scarlet satinlined cloak thrown over its back and her chin resting on her hand but the millionaire walked directly towards her with his usual frankness of conscious but restrained power and she felt as she always did perfectly at her ease in his presence even as she took his outstretched hand its straightforward grasp seemed to endow her with its own confidence  youll excuse my coming here so abruptly she smiled but i wanted to get before mr leyton who i believe wishes to see you on the same business as myself  he is here already and dining with me said rushbrook  ah does he know i am here asked the girl quietly  no as he said you had thought of coming with him and didnt i presumed you didnt care to have him know you had come alone  not exactly that mr rushbrook she said fixing her beautiful eyes on him in bright and trustful confidence but i happen to have a fuller knowledge of this business than he has and yet as it is not altogether my own secret i was not permitted to divulge it to him nor would i tell it to you only i cannot bear that you should think that i had anything to do with this wretched inquisition into mr somerss prospects knowing as well as you do how perfectly independent i am you would think it strange wouldnt you but you would think it still more surprising when you found out that i and my uncle already know how liberally and generously you had provided for mr somers in the future  how i had provided for mr somers in the future repeated mr rushbrook looking at the fire eh  yes said the young girl indifferently how you were to put him in to succeed you in the water front trust and all that he told it to me and my uncle at the outset of our acquaintance confidentially of course and i dare say with an honorable delicacy that was like him buti suppose now you will think me foolishall the while id rather he had not  youd rather he had not repeated mr rushbrook slowly  yes continued grace leaning forward with her rounded elbows on her knees and her slim arched feet on the fender now you are going to laugh at me mr rushbrook but all this seemed to me to spoil any spontaneous feeling i might have towards him and limit my independence in a thing that should be a matter of free will alone it seemed too much like a business proposition there my kind friend she added looking up and trying to read his face with a half girlish pout followed however by a maturer sigh im bothering you with a womans foolishness instead of talking business andanother sighi suppose it is business for my uncle who has it seems bought into this trust on these possible contingencies has perhaps been asking questions of mr leyton but i dont want you to think that i approve of them or advise your answering them but you are not listening  i had forgotten something said rushbrook with an odd preoccupation excuse me a momenti will return at once  he left the room quite as abstractedly and when he reached the passage he apparently could not remember what he had forgotten as he walked deliberately to the end window where with his arms folded behind his back he remained looking out into the street a passerby glancing up might have said he had seen the pale stern ghost of mr rushbrook framed like a stony portrait in the window but he presently turned away and reentered the room going up to grace who was still sitting by the fire in his usual strong and direct fashion  well now let me see what you want i think this would do  he took a seat at his open desk and rapidly wrote a few lines  there he continued when you write to your uncle inclose that  grace took it and read   dear miss nevilpray assure your uncle from me that i am quite ready to guarantee in any form that he may require the undertaking represented to him by mr john somers yours very truly  robert rushbrook   a quick flush mounted to the young girls cheeks but this is a security mr rushbrook she said proudly handing him back the paper and my uncle does not require that nor shall i insult him or you by sending it  it is business miss nevil said rushbrook gravely he stopped and fixed his eyes upon her animated face and sparkling eyes you can send it to him or not as you like buta rare smile came to his handsome mouthas this is a letter to you you must not insult me by not accepting it  replying to his smile rather than the words that accompanied it miss nevil smiled too nevertheless she was uneasy and disturbed the interview whatever she might have vaguely expected from it had resolved itself simply into a business indorsement of her lover which she had not sought and which gave her no satisfaction yet there was the same potent and indefinably protecting presence before her which she had sought but whose omniscience and whose help she seemed to have lost the spell and courage to put to the test he relieved her in his abrupt but not unkindly fashion well when is it to be  it  your marriage  oh not for some time theres no hurry  it might have struck the practical mr rushbrook that even considered as a desirable business affair the prospective completion of this contract provoked neither frank satisfaction nor conventional dissimulation on the part of the young lady for he regarded her calm but slightly wearied expression fixedly but he only said then i shall say nothing of this interview to mr leyton  as you please it really matters little indeed i suppose i was rather foolish in coming at all and wasting your valuable time for nothing  she had risen as if taking his last question in the significance of a parting suggestion and was straightening her tall figure preparatory to putting on her cloak as she reached it he stepped forward and lifted it from the chair to assist her the act was so unprecedented as mr rushbrook never indulged in those minor masculine courtesies that she was momentarily as confused as a younger girl at the gallantry of a younger man in their previous friendship he had seldom drawn near her except to shake her handa circumstance that had always recurred to her when his free and familiar life had been the subject of gossip but she now had a more frightened consciousness that her nerves were strangely responding to his powerful propinquity and she involuntarily contracted her pretty shoulders as he gently laid the cloak upon them yet even when the act was completed she had a superstitious instinct that the significance of this rare courtesy was that it was final and that he had helped her to interpose something that shut him out from her forever  she was turning away with a heightened color when the sound of light hurried footsteps and the rustle of a womans dress was heard in the hall a swift recollection of her companions infelicitous reputation now returned to her and grace nevil with a slight stiffening of her whole frame became coldly herself again mr rushbrook betrayed neither surprise nor agitation begging her to wait a moment until he could arrange for her to pass to her carriage unnoticed he left the room  yet it seemed that the cause of the disturbance was unsuspected by mr rushbrook mr leyton although left to the consolation of cigars and liquors in the blue room had become slightly weary of his companions prolonged absence satisfied in his mind that rushbrook had joined the gayer party and that he was even now paying gallant court to the signora he became again curious and uneasy at last the unmistakable sound of whispering voices in the passage got the better of his sense of courtesy as a guest and he rose from his seat and slightly opened the door as he did so the figures of a man and woman conversing in earnest whispers passed the opening the mans arm was round the womans waist the woman wasas he had suspectedthe one who had stood in the doorway the signorabutthe man was not rushbrook mr leyton drew back this time in unaffected horror it was none other than jack somers  some warning instinct must at that moment have struck the woman for with a stifled cry she disengaged herself from somerss arm and dashed rapidly down the hall somers evidently unaware of the cause stood irresolute for a moment and then more silently but swiftly disappeared into a side corridor as if to intercept her it was the rapid passage of the signora that had attracted the attention of grace and rushbrook in the study and it was the moment after it that mr rushbrook left   chapter vi   vaguely uneasy and still perplexed with her previous agitation as mr rushbrook closed the door behind him grace following some feminine instinct rather than any definite reason walked to the door and placed her hand upon the lock to prevent any intrusion until he returned her caution seemed to be justified a moment later for a heavier but stealthier footstep halted outside the handle of the door was turned but she resisted it with the fullest strength of her small hand until a voice which startled her called in a hurried whisper  open quick tis i  she stepped back quickly flung the door open and beheld somers on the threshold  the astonishment agitation and above all the awkward confusion of this usually selfpossessed and ready man was so unlike him and withal so painful that grace hurried to put an end to it and for an instant forgot her own surprise at seeing him she smiled assuringly and extended her hand  gracemiss nevili beg your pardoni didnt imaginehe began with a forced laugh i mean of coursei cannotbuthe stopped and then assuming a peculiar expression said but what are you doing here  at any other moment the girl would have resented the tone which was as new to her as his previous agitation but in her present selfconsciousness her situation seemed to require some explanation i came here she said to see mr rushbrook on business your businessour business she added with a charming smile using for the first time the pronoun that seemed to indicate their unity and interest and yet fully aware of a vague insincerity in doing so  our business he repeated ignoring her gentler meaning with a changed emphasis and a look of suspicion  yes said grace a little impatiently mr leyton thought he ought to write to my uncle something positive as to your prospects with mr rushbrook and  you came here to inquire said the young man sharply  i came here to stop any inquiry said grace indignantly i came here to say i was satisfied with what you had confided to me of mr rushbrooks generosity and that was enough  with what i had confided to you you dared say that  grace stopped and instantly faced him but any indignation she might have felt at his speech and manner was swallowed up in the revulsion and horror that overtook her with the sudden revelation she saw in his white and frightened face leytons strange inquiry rushbrooks cold composure and scornful acceptance of her own credulousness came to her in a flash of shameful intelligence somers had lied the insufferable meanness of it a lie whose very uselessness and ignobility had defeated its purposea lie that implied the basest suspicion of her own independence and truthfulnesssuch a lie now stood out as plainly before her as his guilty face  forgive my speaking so rudely he said with a forced smile and attempt to recover his selfcontrol but you have ruined me unless you deny that i told you anything it was a jokean extravagance that i had forgotten at least it was a confidence between you and me that you have foolishly violated say that you misunderstood methat it was a fancy of your own say anythinghe trusts youhell believe anything you say  he has believed me said grace almost fiercely turning upon him with the paper that rushbrook had given her in her outstretched hand read that  he read it had he blushed had he stammered had he even kept up his former frantic and pitiable attitude she might at that supreme moment have forgiven him but to her astonishment his face changed his handsome brow cleared his careless happy smile returned his graceful confidence came backhe stood before her the elegant courtly and accomplished gentleman she had known he returned her the paper and advancing with extended hand said triumphantly  superb splendid no one but a woman could think of that and only one woman achieve it you have tricked the great rushbrook you are indeed worthy of being a financiers wife  no she said passionately tearing up the paper and throwing it at his feet not as you understand itand never yours you have debased and polluted everything connected with it as you would have debased and polluted me out of my presence that you are insultingout of the room of the man whose magnanimity you cannot understand  the destruction of the guarantee apparently stung him more than the words that accompanied it he did not relapse again into his former shamefaced terror but as a malignant glitter came into his eyes he regained his coolness  it may not be so difficult for others to understand miss nevil he said with polished insolence and as bob rushbrooks generosity to pretty women is already a matter of suspicion perhaps you are wise to destroy that record of it  coward said grace stand aside and let me pass she swept by him to the door but it opened upon rushbrooks reentrance he stood for an instant glancing at the pair and then on the fragments of the paper that strewed the floor then still holding the door in his hand he said quietly  one moment before you go miss nevil if this is the result of any misunderstanding as to the presence of another woman here in company with mr somers it is only fair to him to say that that woman is here as a friend of mine not of his and i alone am responsible  grace halted and turned the cold steel of her proud eyes on the two men as they rested on rushbrook they quivered slightly i can already bear witness she said coldly to the generosity of mr rushbrook in a matter which then touched me but there certainly is no necessity for him to show it now in a matter in which i have not the slightest concern  as she swept out of the room and was received in the respectable shadow of the waiting james rushbrook turned to somers  and im afraid it wont dofor leyton saw you he said curtly now then shut that door for you and i jack somers have a word to say to each other  what that word was and how it was said and received is not a part of this record but it is told that it was the beginning of that mighty iliad still remembered of men which shook the financial camps of san francisco and divided them into bitter contending parties for when it became known the next day that somers had suddenly abandoned rushbrook and carried over to a powerful foreign capitalist the secret methods and even it was believed the luck of his late employer it was certain that there would be war to the knife and that it was no longer a struggle of rival enterprise but of vindictive men   chapter vii   for a year the battle between the somers faction and the giant but solitary rushbrook raged fiercely with varying success i grieve to say that the proteges and parasites of maecenas deserted him in a body nay they openly alleged that it was the true artistic nature and refinement of somers that had always attracted them and that a man like rushbrook who bought pictures by the yardequally of the unknown struggling artist and the famous masterswas no true patron of art rushbrook made no attempt to recover his lost prestige and once when squeezed into a tight corner and forced to realize on his treasures he put them up at auction and the people called them daubs their rage knew no bounds it was then that an unfettered press discovered that rushbrook never was a maecenas at all grimly deprecated his assumption of that title and even doubted if he were truly a millionaire it was at this time that a few stood by himnotably the mill inventor from siskyou grown plethoric with success but eventually ground between the upper and nether millstone of the somers and rushbrook party miss nevil had returned to the atlantic states with mrs leyton while rumors had played freely with the relations of somers and the signora as the possible cause of the rupture between him and rushbrook no mention had ever been made of the name of miss nevil  it was raining heavily one afternoon when mr rushbrook drove from his office to his san francisco house the fierce struggle in which he was engaged left him little time for hospitality and for the last two weeks his house had been comparatively deserted he passed through the empty rooms changed in little except the absence of some valuable monstrosities which had gone to replenish his capital when he reached his bedroom he paused a moment at the open door  james  yes sir said james appearing out of the shadow  what are you waiting for  i thought you might be wanting something sir  you were waiting there this morning you were in the anteroom of my study while i was writing you were outside the blue room while i sat at breakfast you were at my elbow in the drawingroom late last night now james continued mr rushbrook with his usual grave directness i dont intend to commit suicide i cant afford it so keep your time and your rest for yourselfyou want itthats a good fellow  yes sir  james  yes sir  rushbrook extended his hand there was that faint rare smile on his handsome mouth for which james would at any time have laid down his life but he only silently grasped his masters hand and the two men remained looking into each others eyes without a word then mr rushbrook entered his room lay down and went to sleep and james vanished in the shadow  at the end of an hour mr rushbrook awoke refreshed and even james who came to call him appeared to have brightened in the interval i have ordered a fire sir in the reserved room the one fitted up from los osos as your study has had no chance of being cleaned these two weeks it will be a change for you sir i hope youll excuse my not waking you to consult you about it  rushbrook remained so silent that james fancying he had not heard him was about to repeat himself when his master said quickly very well come for me there when dinner is ready and entered the passage leading to the room james did not follow him and when mr rushbrook opening the door started back with an exclamation no one but the inmate heard the word that rose to his lips  for there seated before the glow of the blazing fire was miss grace nevil she had evidently just arrived for her mantle was barely loosened around her neck and upon the fringe of brown hair between her bonnet and her broad low forehead a few drops of rain still sparkled as she lifted her long lashes quickly towards the door it seemed as if they too had caught a little of that moisture rushbrook moved impatiently forward and then stopped grace rose unhesitatingly to her feet and met him halfway with frankly outstretched hands first of all she said with a half nervous laugh dont scold james its all my fault i forbade him to announce me lest you should drive me away for i heard that during this excitement you came here for rest and saw no one even the intrusion into this room is all my own i confess now that i saw it the last night i was here i was anxious to know if it was unchanged and made james bring me here i did not understand it then i do nowandthank you  her face must have shown that she was conscious that he was still holding her hand for he suddenly released it with a heightened color and a half girlish naivete that was the more charming for its contrast with her tall figure and air of thoroughbred repose she turned back to her chair and lightly motioned him to take the one before her i am here on business otherwise i should not have dared to look in upon you at all  she stopped drew off her gloves with a provoking deliberation which was none the less fascinating that it implied a demure consciousness of inducing some impatience in the breast of her companion stretched them out carefully by the fingers laid them down neatly on the table placed her elbows on her knees slightly clasped her hands together and bending forward lifted her honest handsome eyes to the man before her  mr rushbrook i have got between four and five hundred thousand dollars that i have no use for i can control securities which can be converted if necessary into a hundred thousand more in ten days i am free and my own mistress it is generally considered that i know what i am aboutyou admitted as much when i was your pupil i have come here to place this sum in your hands at your free disposal you know why and for what purpose  but what do you know of my affairs asked rushbrook quickly  everything and i know you which is better call it an investment if you likefor i know you will succeedand let me share your profits call itif you pleaserestitution for i am the miserable cause of your rupture with that man or call it revenge if you like she said with a faint smile and let me fight at your side against our common enemy please mr rushbrook dont deny me this i have come three thousand miles for it i could have sent it to youor writtenbut i feared you would not understand it you are smilingyou will take it  i cannot said rushbrook gravely  then you force me to go into the stock market myself and fight for you and unaided by your genius perhaps lose it without benefiting you  rushbrook did not reply  at least then tell me why you cannot  rushbrook rose and looking into her face said quietly with his old directness  because i love you miss nevil  a sudden instinct to rise and move away a greater one to remain and hear him speak again and a still greater one to keep back the blood that she felt was returning all too quickly to her cheek after the first shock kept her silent but she dropped her eyes  i loved you ever since i first saw you at los osos he went on quickly i said to myself even then that if there was a woman that would fill my life and make me what she wished me to be it was you i even fancied that day that you understood me better than any woman or even any man that i had ever met before i loved you through all that miserable business with that man even when my failure to make you happy with another brought me no nearer to you i have loved you always i shall love you always i love you more for this foolish kindness that brings you beneath my roof once more and gives me a chance to speak my heart to you if only once and for the last time than all the fortune that you could put at my disposal but i could not accept what you would offer me from any woman who was not my wifeand i could not marry any woman that did not love me i am perhaps past the age when i could inspire a young girls affection but i have not reached the age when i would accept anything less he stopped abruptly grace did not look up there was a tear glistening upon her long eyelashes albeit a faint smile played upon her lips  do you call this business mr rushbrook she said softly  business  to assume a proposal declined before it has been offered  gracemy darlingtell meis it possible  it was too late for her to rise now as his hands held both hers and his handsome mouth was smiling level with her own so it really seemed to a dispassionate spectator that it was possible and before she had left the room it even appeared to be the most probable thing in the world    the union of grace nevil and robert rushbrook was recorded by local history as the crown to his victory over the ring but only he and his wife knew that it was the cause
