empty takes the lemons from the bottom of it and squeezes them into a still larger brew so does the sagacious author after having sold his material to the magazines and been paid for it clap it into

readers are requested to note that this novel has taken our special prize of a cheque for a thousand guineas this alone guarantees for all intelligent readers a palpitating interest in every line of it among the thousands of mss which reached usmany of them coming in carts early in the morning and moving in a dense phalanx indistinguishable from the covent garden market waggons others pouring down our coalchute during the working hours of the day and others again being slipped surreptitiously into our letterbox by pale timid girls scarcely more than children after nightfall in fact many of them came in their nightgownsthis manuscript alone was the sole onein fact the only oneto receive the prize of a cheque of a thousand guineas to other competitors we may have given inadvertently perhaps a bag of sovereigns or a string of pearls but to this story alone is awarded the first prize by the unanimous decision of our judges  when we say that the latter body included two members of the cabinet two lords of the admiralty and two bishops with power in case of dispute to send all the mss to the czar of russia our readers will breathe a sigh of relief to learn that the decision was instant and unanimous each one of them in reply to our telegram answered immediately spoof  this novel represents the last word in uptodate fiction it is well known that the modern novel has got far beyond the point of mere storytelling the childish attempt to interest the reader has long since been abandoned by all the best writers they refuse to do it  the modern novel must convey a message or else it must paint a picture or remove a veil or open a new chapter in human psychology otherwise it is no good spoof does all of these things the reader rises from its perusal perplexed troubled and yet so filled with information that rising itself is a difficulty  we cannot for obvious reasons insert the whole of the first chapter but the portion here presented was praised by the saturday afternoon review as giving one of the most graphic and at the same time realistic pictures of america ever written in fiction  of the characters whom our readers are to imagine seated on the deckon one of the many decks all connected by elevatorsof the gloritania one word may be said vere de lancy is as the reviewers have under oath declared a typical young englishman of the upper class he is nephew to the duke of but of this fact no one on the ship except the captain the purser the steward and the passengers are or is aware  in order entirely to conceal his identity vere de lancy is travelling under the assumed name of lancy de vere in order the better to hide the object of his journey lancy de vere as we shall now call him though our readers will be able at any moment to turn his name backwards has given it to be understood that he is travelling merely as a gentleman anxious to see america this naturally baffles all those in contact with him  the girl at his sidebut perhaps we may best let her speak for herself  somehow as they sat together on the deck of the great steamer in the afterglow of the sunken sun listening to the throbbing of the propeller a rare sound which neither of them of course had ever heard before de vere felt that he must speak to her something of the mystery of the girl fascinated him what was she doing here alone with no one but her mother and her maid on the bosom of the atlantic why was she here why was she not somewhere else the thing puzzled perplexed him it would not let him alone it fastened upon his brain somehow he felt that if he tried to drive it away it might nip him in the ankle  in the end he spoke  and you too he said leaning over her deckchair are going to america  he had suspected this ever since the boat left liverpool now at length he framed his growing conviction into words  yes she assented and then timidly it is 3213 miles wide is it not  yes he said and 1781 miles deep it reaches from the fortyninth parallel to the gulf of mexico  oh cried the girl what a vivid picture  i seem to see it  its major axis he went on his voice sinking almost to a caress is formed by the rocky mountains which are practically a prolongation of the cordilleran range it is drained he continued  how splendid said the girl  yes is it not it is drained by the mississippi by the st lawrence anddare i say itby the upper colorado  somehow his hand had found hers in the half gloaming but she did not check him  go on she said very simply i think i ought to hear it  the great central plain of the interior he continued is formed by a vast alluvial deposit carried down as silt by the mississippi east of this the range of the alleghanies nowhere more than eight thousand feet in height forms a secondary or subordinate axis from which the watershed falls to the atlantic  he was speaking very quietly but earnestly  no man had ever spoken to her like this before  what a wonderful picture she murmured half to herself half aloud and half not aloud and half not to herself  through the whole of it de vere went on there run railways most of them from east to west though a few run from west to east  the pennsylvania system alone has twentyone thousand miles of track  twentyone thousand miles she repeated already she felt her will strangely subordinate to his  he was holding her hand firmly clasped in his and looking into her face  dare i tell you he whispered how many employees it has  yes she gasped unable to resist  a hundred and fourteen thousand he said  there was silence they were both thinking presently she spoke timidly  are there any cities there  cities he said enthusiastically ah yes  let me try to give you a wordpicture of them  vast citieswith tall buildings reaching to the very sky why for instance the new woolworth building in new york  yes yes she broke in quickly how high is it  seven hundred and fifty feet  the girl turned and faced him  dont she said i cant bear it some other time perhaps but not now  she had risen and was gathering up her wraps and you she said why are you going to america  why he answered because i want to see to know to learn and when i have learned and seen and known i want other people to see and to learn and to know i want to write it all down all the vast palpitating picture of it ah if i only couldi want to see and here he passed his hand through his hair as if trying to remember something of the relations of labour and capital of the extraordinary development of industrial machinery of the new and intricate organisation of corporation finance and in particular i want to try to analyseno one has ever done it yetthe men who guide and drive it all i want to set down the psychology of the multimillionaire  he paused the girl stood irresolute she was thinking apparently for if not why stand there  perhaps she faltered i could help you  you  yes i might she hesitated iicome from america  you said de vere in astonishment  with a face and voice like yours it is impossible  the boldness of the compliment held her speechless for a moment  i do she said my people lived just outside of cohoes  they couldnt have he said passionately  i shouldnt speak to you like this the girl went on but its because i feel from what you have said that you know and love america  and i think i can help you  you mean he said divining her idea that you can help me to meet a multimillionaire  yes she answered still hesitating  you know one  yes still hesitating i know one  she seemed about to say more her lips had already opened when suddenly the dull raucous blast of the foghorn they used a raucous one on this ship on purpose cut the night air wet fog rolled in about them wetting everything  the girl shivered  i must go she said good night  for a moment de vere was about to detain her the wild thought leaped to his mind to ask her her name or at least her mothers  with a powerful effort he checked himself  good night he said  she was gone    chapter ii  limits of space forbid the insertion of the whole of this chapter its opening contains one of the most vivid wordpictures of the inside of an american customs house ever pictured in words from the customs wharf de vere is driven in a taxi to the belmont  here he engages a room here too he sleeps here also though cautiously at first he eats  all this is so admirably described that only those who have driven in a taxi to an hotel and slept there can hope to appreciate it  limits of space also forbid our describing in full de veres vain quest in new york of the beautiful creature whom he had met on the steamer and whom he had lost from sight in the aigrette department of the customs house a thousand times he cursed his folly in not having asked her name  meanwhile no word comes from her till suddenly mysteriously unexpectedly on the fourth day a note is handed to de vere by the third assistant head waiter of the belmont  it is addressed in a ladys hand he tears it open it contains only the written words call on mr j superman overgold he is a multimillionaire he expects you  to leap into a taxi from the third story of the belmont was the work of a moment  to drive to the office of mr overgold was less  the portion of the novel which follows is perhaps the most notable part of it it is this part of the chapter which the hibbert journal declares to be the best piece of psychological analysis that appears in any novel of the season we reproduce it here  exactly exactly said de vere writing rapidly in his notebook as he sat in one of the deep leather armchairs of the luxurious office of mr overgold so you sometimes feel as if the whole thing were not worth while  i do said mr overgold i cant help asking myself what it all means is life after all merely a series of immaterial phenomena selfdeveloping and based solely on sensation and reaction or is it something else  he paused for a moment to sign a cheque for 10000 and throw it out of the window and then went on speaking still with the terse brevity of a man of business  is sensation everywhere or is there perception too on what grounds if any may the hypothesis of a selfexplanatory consciousness be rejected in how far are we warranted in supposing that innate ideas are inconsistent with pure materialism  de vere listened fascinated fortunately for himself he was a university man fresh from the examination halls of his alma mater  he was able to respond at once  i think he said modestly i grasp your thought you meanto what extent are we prepared to endorse hegels dictum of immaterial evolution  exactly said mr overgold how far if at all do we substantiate the kantian hypothesis of the transcendental  precisely said de vere eagerly and for what reasons naming them must we reject spencers theory of the unknowable  entirely so continued mr overgold  and why if at all does bergsonian illusionism differ from pure nothingness  they both paused  mr overgold had risen there was great weariness in his manner  it saddens one does it not he said  he had picked up a bundle of panama two per cent gold bonds and was looking at them in contempt  the emptiness of it all he muttered he extended the bonds to de vere  do you want them he said or shall i throw them away  give them to me said de vere quietly they are not worth the throwing  no no said mr overgold speaking half to himself as he replaced the bonds in his desk  it is a burden that i must carry alone i have no right to ask any one to share it but come he continued i fear i am sadly lacking in the duties of international hospitality i am forgetting what i owe to angloamerican courtesy i am neglecting the new obligations of our common indochinese policy my motor is at the door pray let me take you to my house to lunch  de vere assented readily telephoned to the belmont not to keep lunch waiting for him and in a moment was speeding up the magnificent riverside drive towards mr overgolds home  on the way mr overgold pointed out various objects of interestgrants tomb lincolns tomb edgar allan poes grave the ticket office of the new york subway and various other points of historic importance  on arriving at the house de vere was ushered up a flight of broad marble steps to a hall fitted on every side with almost priceless objets dart and others ushered to the cloakroom and out of it butlered into the lunchroom and footmanned to a chair  as they entered a lady already seated at the table turned to meet them  one glance was enoughplenty  it was shethe object of de veres impassioned quest a rich lunchgown was girdled about her with a twelveoclock band of pearls  she reached out her hand smiling  dorothea said the multimillionaire this is mr de vere mr de veremy wife    chapter iii  of this next chapter we need only say that the blue review adults only declares it to be the most daring and yet conscientious handling of the sexproblem ever attempted and done the fact that the congregational times declares that this chapter will undermine the whole foundations of english society and let it fall we pass over we hold certificates in writing from a great number of the anglican clergy to the effect that they have carefully read the entire novel and see nothing in it          they stood looking at one another  so you didnt know she murmured  in a flash de vere realised that she hadnt known that he didnt know and knew now that he knew  he found no words  the situation was a tense one nothing but the womans innate tact could save it dorothea overgold rose to it with the dignity of a queen  she turned to her husband  take your soup over to the window she said and eat it there  the millionaire took his soup to the window and sat beneath a little palm tree eating it  you didnt know she repeated  no said de vere how could i  and yet she went on you loved me although you didnt know that i was married  yes answered de vere simply i loved you in spite of it  how splendid she said  there was a moments silence mr overgold had returned to the table the empty plate in his hand his wife turned to him again with the same unfailing tact  take your asparagus to the billiardroom she said and eat it there  does he know too asked de vere  mr overgold she said carelessly i suppose he does eh apres mon ami  french another mystery where and how had she learned it de vere asked himself  not in france certainly  i fear that you are very young amico mio dorothea went on carelessly after all what is there wrong in it piccolo pochito to a mans mind perhapsbut to a woman love is love  she beckoned to the butler  take mr overgold a cutlet to the musicroom she said and give him his gorgonzola on the inkstand in the library  and now she went on in that caressing way which seemed so natural to her dont let us think about it any more after all what is is isnt it  i suppose it is said de vere half convinced in spite of himself  or at any rate said dorothea nothing can at the same time both be and not be but come she broke off gaily dipping a macaroon in a glass of creme de menthe and offering it to him with a pretty gesture of camaraderie dont lets be gloomy any more i want to take you with me to the matinee  is he coming asked de vere pointing at mr overgolds empty chair  silly boy laughed dorothea of course john is coming you surely dont want to buy the tickets yourself          the days that followed brought a strange new life to de vere  dorothea was ever at his side at the theatre at the polo ground in the park everywhere they were together and with them was mr overgold  the three were always together at times at the theatre dorothea and de vere would sit downstairs and mr overgold in the gallery at other times de vere and mr overgold would sit in the gallery and dorothea downstairs at times one of them would sit in row a another in row b and a third in row c at other times two would sit in row b and one in row c at the opera at times one of the three would sit listening the others talking at other times two listening and one talking and at other times three talking and none listening  thus the three formed together one of the most perplexing maddening triangles that ever disturbed the society of the metropolis          the denouement was bound to come  it came  it was late at night  de vere was standing beside dorothea in the brilliantly lighted hall of the grand palaver hotel where they had had supper mr overgold was busy for a moment at the cashiers desk  dorothea de vere whispered passionately i want to take you away away from all this  i want you  she turned and looked him full in the face  then she put her hand in his smiling bravely  i will come she said  listen he went on the gloritania sails for england tomorrow at midnight i have everything ready will you come  yes she answered i will and then passionately dearest i will follow you to england to liverpool to the end of the earth  she paused in thought a moment and then added  come to the house just before midnight  william the second chauffeur he is devoted to me shall be at the door with the third car the fourth footman will bring my thingsi can rely on him the fifth housemaid can have them all readyshe would never betray me i will have the undergardenerthe sixthwaiting at the iron gate to let you in he would die rather than fail me  she paused againthen she went on  there is only one thing dearest that i want to ask it is not much i hardly think you would refuse it at such an hour may i bring my husband with me  de veres face blanched  must you he said  i think i must said dorothea you dont know how ive grown to value to lean upon him at times i have felt as if i always wanted him to be near me i like to feel wherever i amat the play at a restaurant anywhere that i can reach out and touch him  i know she continued that its only a wild fancy and that others would laugh at it but you can understand can you notcarino caruso mio and think darling in our new life how busy he too will bemaking money for all of usin a new money market its just wonderful how he does it  a great light of renunciation lit up de veres face  bring him he said  i knew that you would say that she murmured and listen pochito pocketedition may i ask one thing more one weeny thing william the second chauffeuri think he would fade away if i were gonemay i bring him too yes o my darling how can i repay you and the second footman and the third housemaidif i were gone i fear that none of  bring them all said de vere half bitterly we will all elope together  and as he spoke mr overgold sauntered over from the cashiers desk his open purse still in his hand and joined them there was a dreamy look upon his face  i wonder he murmured whether personality survives or whether it too when up against the irresistible dissolves and resolves itself into a series of negative reactions  de veres empty heart echoed the words  then they passed out and the night swallowed them up    chapter iv  at a little before midnight on the next night two motors filled with muffled human beings might have been perceived or seen moving noiselessly from riverside drive to the steamer wharf where lay the gloritania  a night of intense darkness enveloped the hudson outside the inside of the dockside a dense fog wrapped the statue of liberty beside the steamer customs officers and deportation officials moved silently to and fro in long black cloaks carrying little deportation lanterns in their hands  to these mr overgold presented in silence his deportation certificates granting his party permission to leave the united states under the imbecility clause of the interstate commerce act  no objection was raised  a few moments later the huge steamer was slipping away in the darkness  on its deck a little group of people standing beside a pile of firstclass cabin luggage directed a last sad look through their heavy black disguise at the rapidly vanishing shore which they could not see  de vere who stood in the midst of them clasping their hands thus stood and gazed his last at america  spoof he said  we admit that this final panorama weird in its midnight mystery and filling the mind of the reader with a sense of something like awe is only appended to spoof in order to coax him to read our forthcoming sequel spiff    iithe reading public a book store study  wish to look about the store oh oh by all means sir he said  then as he rubbed his hands together in an urbane fashion he directed a piercing glance at me through his spectacles  youll find some things that might interest you he said in the back of the store on the left we have there a series of reprintsuniversal knowledge from aristotle to arthur balfourat seventeen cents or perhaps you might like to look over the pantheon of dead authors at ten cents mr sparrow he called just show this gentleman our classical reprintsthe tencent series  with that he waved his hand to an assistant and dismissed me from his thought  in other words he had divined me in a moment there was no use in my having bought a sagegreen fedora in broadway and a sporting tie done up crosswise with spots as big as nickels these little adornments can never hide the soul within i was a professor and he knew it or at least as part of his business he could divine it on the instant  the sales manager of the biggest book store for ten blocks cannot be deceived in a customer  and he knew of course that as a professor i was no good i had come to the store as all professors go to book stores just as a wasp comes to an open jar of marmalade he knew that i would hang around for two hours get in everybodys way and finally buy a cheap reprint of the dialogues of plato or the prose works of john milton or locke on the human understanding or some trash of that sort  as for real taste in literaturethe ability to appreciate at its worth a dollarfifty novel of last month in a spring jacket with a tango frontispiecei hadnt got it and he knew it  he despised me of course but it is a maxim of the book business that a professor standing up in a corner buried in a book looks well in a store the real customers like it  so it was that even so uptodate a manager as mr sellyer tolerated my presence in a back corner of his store and so it was that i had an opportunity of noting something of his methods with his real customersmethods so successful i may say that he is rightly looked upon by all the publishing business as one of the mainstays of literature in america  i had no intention of standing in the place and listening as a spy in fact to tell the truth i had become immediately interested in a new translation of the moral discourses of epictetus the book was very neatly printed quite well bound and was offered at eighteen cents so that for the moment i was strongly tempted to buy it though it seemed best to take a dip into it first  i had hardly read more than the first three chapters when my attention was diverted by a conversation going on in the front of the store  youre quite sure its his latest a fashionably dressed lady was saying to mr sellyer  oh yes mrs rasselyer answered the manager i assure you this is his very latest  in fact they only came in yesterday  as he spoke he indicated with his hand a huge pile of books gayly jacketed in white and blue i could make out the title in big gilt letteringgolden dreams  oh yes repeated mr sellyer this is mr slushs latest book its having a wonderful sale  thats all right then said the lady you see one sometimes gets taken in so i came in here last week and took two that seemed very nice and i never noticed till i got home that they were both old books published i think six months ago  oh dear me mrs rasselyer said the manager in an apologetic tone im extremely sorry pray let us send for them and exchange them for you  oh it does not matter said the lady of course i didnt read them i gave them to my maid she probably wouldnt know the difference anyway  i suppose not said mr sellyer with a condescending smile but of course madam he went on falling into the easy chat of the fashionable bookman such mistakes are bound to happen sometimes we had a very painful case only yesterday one of our oldest customers came in in a great hurry to buy books to take on the steamer and before we realised what he had doneselecting the books i suppose merely by the titles as some gentlemen are apt to dohe had taken two of last years books we wired at once to the steamer but im afraid its too late  but now this book said the lady idly turning over the leaves is it good what is it about  its an extremely powerful thing said mr sellyer in fact masterly the critics are saying that its perhaps the most powerful book of the season it has a and here mr sellyer paused and somehow his manner reminded me of my own when i am explaining to a university class something that i dont know myselfit has aapower so to speaka very exceptional power in fact one may say without exaggeration it is the most powerful book of the month indeed he added getting on to easier ground its having a perfectly wonderful sale  you seem to have a great many of them said the lady  oh we have to answered the manager  theres a regular rush on the book indeed you know its a book that is bound to make a sensation in fact in certain quarters they are saying that its a book that ought not to and here mr sellyers voice became so low and ingratiating that i couldnt hear the rest of the sentence  oh really said mrs rasselyer well i think ill take it then one ought to see what these talkedof things are about anyway  she had already begun to button her gloves and to readjust her feather boa with which she had been knocking the easter cards off the counter then she suddenly remembered something  oh i was forgetting she said will you send something to the house for mr rasselyer at the same time hes going down to virginia for the vacation you know the kind of thing he likes do you not  oh perfectly madam said the manager  mr rasselyer generally reads works oferi think he buys mostly books oner  oh travel and that sort of thing said the lady  precisely i think we have here and he pointed to the counter on the left what mr rasselyer wants  he indicated a row of handsome booksseven weeks in the sahara seven dollars six months in a waggon sixfifty net afternoons in an oxcart two volumes fourthirty with twenty off  i think he has read those said mrs rasselyer  at least there are a good many at home that seem like that  oh very possiblybut here now among the cannibals of corfuyes that i think he has hadamong thethat too i thinkbut this i am certain he would like just in this morningamong the monkeys of new guineaten dollars net  and with this mr sellyer laid his hand on a pile of new books apparently as numerous as the huge pile of golden dreams  among the monkeys he repeated almost caressingly  it seems rather expensive said the lady  oh very much soa most expensive book the manager repeated in a tone of enthusiasm  you see mrs rasselyer its the illustrations actual photographshe ran the leaves over in his fingersof actual monkeys taken with the cameraand the paper you noticein fact madam the book costs the mere manufacture of it nine dollars and ninety centsof course we make no profit on it but its a book we like to handle  everybody likes to be taken into the details of technical business and of course everybody likes to know that a bookseller is losing money  these i realised were two axioms in the methods of mr sellyer  so very naturally mrs rasselyer bought among the monkeys and in another moment mr sellyer was directing a clerk to write down an address on fifth avenue and was bowing deeply as he showed the lady out of the door  as he turned back to his counter his manner seemed much changed  that monkey book i heard him murmur to his assistant is going to be a pretty stiff proposition  but he had no time for further speculation  another lady entered  this time even to an eye less trained than mr sellyers the deep expensive mourning and the pensive face proclaimed the sentimental widow  something new in fiction repeated the manager yes madamheres a charming thinggolden dreamshe hung lovingly on the wordsa very sweet story singularly sweet in fact madam the critics are saying it is the sweetest thing that mr slush has done  is it good said the lady i began to realise that all customers asked this  a charming book said the manager its a love storyvery simple and sweet yet wonderfully charming indeed the reviews say its the most charming book of the month my wife was reading it aloud only last night she could hardly read for tears  i suppose its quite a safe book is it asked the widow i want it for my little daughter  oh quite safe said mr sellyer with an almost parental tone in fact written quite in the old style like the dear old books of the pastquite likehere mr sellyer paused with a certain slight haze of doubt visible in his eyelike dickens and fielding and sterne and so on we sell a great many to the clergy madam  the lady bought golden dreams received it wrapped up in green enamelled paper and passed out  have you any good light reading for vacation time called out the next customer in a loud breezy voicehe had the air of a stock broker starting on a holiday  yes said mr sellyer and his face almost broke into a laugh as he answered heres an excellent thinggolden dreamsquite the most humorous book of the seasonsimply screamingmy wife was reading it aloud only yesterday she could hardly read for laughing  whats the price one dollar onefifty  all right wrap it up there was a clink of money on the counter and the customer was gone i began to see exactly where professors and college people who want copies of epictetus at 18 cents and sections of world reprints of literature at 12 cents a section come in in the book trade  yes judge said the manager to the next customer a huge dignified personage in a wideawake hat sea stories certainly excellent reading no doubt when the brain is overcharged as yours must be here is the very latestamong the monkeys of new guinea ten dollars reduced to fourfifty the manufacture alone costs sixeighty were selling it out thank you judge send it yes good morning  after that the customers came and went in a string i noticed that though the store was filled with booksten thousand of them at a guessmr sellyer was apparently only selling two every woman who entered went away with golden dreams every man was given a copy of the monkeys of new guinea to one lady golden dreams was sold as exactly the reading for a holiday to another as the very book to read after a holiday another bought it as a book for a rainy day and a fourth as the right sort of reading for a fine day the monkeys was sold as a sea story a land story a story of the jungle and a story of the mountains and it was put at a price corresponding to mr sellyers estimate of the purchaser  at last after a busy two hours the store grew empty for a moment  wilfred said mr sellyer turning to his chief assistant i am going out to lunch keep those two books running as hard as you can  well try them for another day and then cut them right out and ill drop round to dockem  discount the publishers and make a kick about them and see what theyll do  i felt that i had lingered long enough i drew near with the epictetus in my hand  yes sir said mr sellyer professional again in a moment epictetus a charming thing eighteen cents thank you perhaps we have some other things there that might interest you we have a few secondhand things in the alcove there that you might care to look at theres an aristotle two volumesa very fine thingpractically illegible that you might like and a cicero came in yesterdayvery choicedamaged by dampand i think we have a machiavelli quite exceptionalpractically torn to pieces and the covers gonea very rare old thing sir if youre an expert  no thanks i said and then from a curiosity that had been growing in me and that i couldnt resist that bookgolden dreams i said you seem to think it a very wonderful work  mr sellyer directed one of his shrewd glances at me he knew i didnt want to buy the book and perhaps like lesser people he had his off moments of confidence  he shook his head  a bad business he said the publishers have unloaded the thing on us and we have to do what we can theyre stuck with it i understand and they look to us to help them  theyre advertising it largely and may pull it off of course theres just a chance one cant tell its just possible we may get the church people down on it and if so were all right but short of that well never make it  i imagine its perfectly rotten  havent you read it i asked  dear me no said the manager his air was that of a milkman who is offered a glass of his own milk a pretty time id have if i tried to read the new books its quite enough to keep track of them without that  but those people i went on deeply perplexed who bought the book wont they be disappointed  mr sellyer shook his head oh no he said you see they wont read it they never do  but at any rate i insisted your wife thought it a fine story  mr sellyer smiled widely  i am not married sir he said    afternoon adventures at my club   1the anecdotes of dr so and so  that is not really his name i merely call him that from his manner of talking  his specialty is telling me short anecdotes of his professional life from day to day  they are told with wonderful dash and power except for one slight omission which is that you never know what the doctor is talking about beyond this his little stories are of unsurpassed interestbut let me illustrate          he came into the semisilence room of the club the other day and sat down beside me  have something or other he said  no thanks i answered  smoke anything he asked  no thanks  the doctor turned to me he evidently wanted to talk  ive been having a rather peculiar experience he said man came to me the other daythree or four weeks agoand said doctor i feel out of sorts i believe ive got so and so ah i said taking a look at him been eating so and so eh yes he said  very good i said take so and so  well off the fellow wenti thought nothing of itsimply wrote such and such in my notebook such and such a date symptoms such and suchprescribed such and such and so forth you understand  oh yes perfectly doctor i answered  very good three days latera ring at the bell in the eveningmy servant came to the surgery mr so and so is here very anxious to see you all right i went down  there he was with every symptom of so and so written all over himevery symptom of itthis and this and this  awful symptoms doctor i said shaking my head  are they not he said quite unaware that he hadnt named any there he was with every symptom heart so and so eyes so and so pulse thisi looked at him right in the eye and i saiddo you want me to tell you the truth yes he said very good i answered i will youve got so and so he fell back as if shot so and so he repeated dazed i went to the sideboard and poured him out a drink of such and such drink this i said he drank it now i said listen to what i say youve got so and so theres only one chance i said you must limit your eating and drinking to such and such you must sleep such and such avoid every form of such and suchill give you a cordial so many drops every so long but mind you unless you do so and so it wont help you all right very good fellow promised off he went  the doctor paused a minute and then resumed  would you believe ittwo nights later i saw the fellowafter the theatre in a restaurantwhole party of peoplebig plate of so and so in front of himquart bottle of so and so on icesuch and such and so forth i stepped over to himtapped him on the shoulder  see here i said if you wont obey my instructions you cant expect me to treat you i walked out of the place  and what happened to him i asked  died said the doctor in a satisfied tone  died ive just been filling in the certificate  so and so aged such and such died of so and so  an awful disease i murmured    2the shattered health of mr podge  how are you podge i said as i sat down in a leather armchair beside him  i only meant howdoyoudo but he rolled his big eyes sideways at me in his flabby face it was easier than moving his face and he answered  im not as well today as i was yesterday afternoon last week i was feeling pretty good part of the time but yesterday about four oclock the air turned humid and i dont feel so well  have a cigarette i said  no thanks i find they affect the bronchial toobes  whose i asked  mine he answered  oh yes i said and i lighted one so you find the weather trying i continued cheerfully  yes its too humid its up to a saturation of sixtysix im all right till it passes sixtyfour yesterday afternoon it was only about sixtyone and i felt fine but after that it went up i guess it must be a contraction of the epidermis pressing on some of the sebaceous glands dont you  im sure it is i said but why dont you just sleep it off till its over  i dont like to sleep too much he answered  im afraid of it developing into hypersomnia there are cases where its been known to grow into a sort of lethargy that pretty well stops all brain action altogether  that would be too bad i murmured  what do you do to prevent it  i generally drink from half to threequarters of a cup of black coffee or nearly black every morning at from eleven to five minutes past so as to keep off hypersomnia its the best thing the doctor says  arent you afraid i said of its keeping you awake  i am answered podge and a spasm passed over his big yellow face im always afraid of insomnia thats the worst thing of all the other night i went to bed about halfpast ten or twentyfive minutes afteri forget whichand i simply couldnt sleep i couldnt i read a magazine story and i still couldnt and i read another and still i couldnt sleep it scared me bad  oh pshaw i said i dont think sleep matters as long as one eats properly and has a good appetite  he shook his head very dubiously i ate a plate of soup at lunch he said and i feel it still  you feel it  yes repeated podge rolling his eyes sideways in a pathetic fashion that he had i still feel it i oughtnt to have eaten it it was some sort of a bean soup and of course it was full of nitrogen i oughtnt to touch nitrogen he added shaking his head  not take any nitrogen i repeated  no the doctorboth doctorshave told me that i can eat starches and albumens all right but i have to keep right away from all carbons and nitrogens ive been dieting that way for two years except that now and again i take a little glucose or phosphates  that must be a nice change i said cheerfully  it is he answered in a grateful sort of tone  there was a pause i looked at his big twitching face and listened to the heavy wheezing of his breath and i felt sorry for him  see here podge i said i want to give you some good advice  about what  about your health  yes yes do he said advice about his health was right in his line he lived on it  well then cut out all this fool business of diet and drugs and nitrogen dont bother about anything of the sort forget it eat everything you want to just when you want it drink all you like smoke all you canand youll feel a new man in a week  say do you think so he panted his eyes filled with a new light  i know it i answered and as i left him i shook hands with a warm feeling about my heart of being a benefactor to the human race  next day sure enough podges usual chair at the club was empty  out getting some decent exercise i thought thank heaven  nor did he come the next day nor the next nor for a week  leading a rational life at last i thought  out in the open getting a little air and sunlight instead of sitting here howling about his stomach  the day after that i saw dr slyder in black clothes glide into the club in that peculiar manner of his like an amateur undertaker  hullo slyder i called to him you look as solemn as if you had been to a funeral  i have he said very quietly and then added poor podge  what about him i asked with sudden apprehension  why he died on tuesday answered the doctor hadnt you heard strangest case ive known in years came home suddenly one day pitched all his medicines down the kitchen sink ordered a couple of cases of champagne and two hundred havanas and had his housekeeper cook a dinner like a roman banquet after being under treatment for two years lived you know on the narrowest margin conceivable i told him and silk told himwe all told himhis only chance was to keep away from every form of nitrogenous ultrastimulants i said to him often podge if you touch heavy carbonized food youre lost  dear me i thought to myself there are such things after all  it was a marvel continued slyder that we kept him alive at all and of coursehere the doctor paused to ring the bell to order two manhattan cocktailsas soon as he touched alcohol he was done  so that was the end of the valetudinarianism of mr podge  i have always considered that i killed him  but anyway he was a nuisance at the club    3the amazing travels of mr yarner  there was no fault to be found with mr yarner till he made his trip around the world  it was that i think which disturbed his brain and unfitted him for membership in the club  well he would say as he sat ponderously down with the air of a man opening an interesting conversation i was just figuring it out that eleven months ago today i was in pekin  thats odd i said i was just reckoning that eleven days ago i was in poughkeepsie  they dont call it pekin over there he said its sounded peichang  i know i said its the same way with poughkeepsie they pronounce it pkeepsie  the chinese he went on musingly are a strange people  so are the people in pkeepsie i added awfully strange  that kind of retort would sometimes stop him but not always he was especially dangerous if he was found with a newspaper in his hand because that meant that some item of foreign intelligence had gone to his brain  not that i should have objected to yarner describing his travels any man who has bought a ticket round the world and paid for it is entitled to that  but it was his manner of discussion that i considered unpermissible  last week for example in an unguarded moment i fell a victim i had been guilty of the imprudencei forget in what connectionof speaking of lions i realized at once that i had done wronglions giraffes elephants rickshaws and natives of all brands are topics to avoid in talking with a traveller  speaking of lions began yarner  he was right of course i had spoken of lions  i shall never forget he went on of course i knew he never would a rather bad scrape i got into in the upcountry of uganda  imagine yourself in a wild rolling country covered here and there with kwas along the sides of the nullahs  i did so  well continued yarner we were sitting in our tent one hot nighttoo hot to sleepwhen all at once we heard not ten feet in front of us the most terrific roar that ever came from the throat of a lion  as he said this yarner paused to take a gulp of bubbling whiskey and soda and looked at me so ferociously that i actually shivered  then quite suddenly his manner cooled down in the strangest way and his voice changed to a commonplace tone as he said  perhaps i ought to explain that we hadnt come up to the upcountry looking for big game  in fact we had been down in the down country with no idea of going higher than mombasa  indeed our going even to mombasa itself was more or less an afterthought our first plan was to strike across from aden to singapore  but our second plan was to strike direct from colombo to karuchi  and what was your third plan i asked  our third plan said yarner deliberately feeling that the talk was now getting really interesting let me see our third plan was to cut across from socotra to tananarivo  oh yes i said  however all that was changed and changed under the strangest circumstances  we were sitting gallon and i on the piazza of the galle face hotel in colomboyou know the galle face  no i do not i said very positively  very good well i was sitting on the piazza watching a snake charmer who was seated with a boa immediately in front of me  poor gallon was actually within two feet of the hideous reptile all of a sudden the beast whirled itself into a coil its eyes fastened with hideous malignity on poor gallon and with its head erect it emitted the most awful hiss i have heard proceed from the mouth of any living snake  here yarner paused and took a long hissing drink of whiskey and soda and then as the malignity died out of his face  i should explain he went on very quietly that gallon was not one of our original party  we had come down to colombo from mongolia going by the pekin hankow and the nippon yushen keisha  that i suppose is the best way i said  yes and oddly enough but for the accident of gallon joining us we should have gone by the amoy cochin singapore route which was our first plan in fact but for gallon we should hardly have got through china at all  the boxer insurrection had taken place only fourteen years before our visit so you can imagine the awful state of the country  our meeting with gallon was thus absolutely providential looking back on it i think it perhaps saved our lives we were in mongolia this you understand was before we reached china and had spent the night at a small yak about four versts from kharbin when all of a sudden just outside the miserable hut that we were in we heard a perfect fusillade of shots followed immediately afterwards by one of the most bloodcurdling and terrifying screams i have ever imagined  oh yes i said and that was how you met gallon well i must be off  and as i happened at that very moment to be rescued by an incoming friend who took but little interest in lions and even less in yarner i have still to learn why the lion howled so when it met yarner but surely the lion had reason enough   4the spiritual outlook of mr doomer  one generally saw old mr doomer looking gloomily out of the windows of the library of the club if not there he was to be found staring sadly into the embers of a dying fire in a deserted sittingroom  his gloom always appeared out of place as he was one of the richest of the members  but the cause of itas i came to knowwas that he was perpetually concerned with thinking about the next world in fact he spent his whole time brooding over it  i discovered this accidentally by happening to speak to him of the recent death of podge one of our fellow members  very sad i said podges death  ah returned mr doomer very shocking  he was quite unprepared to die  do you think so i said im awfully sorry to hear it  quite unprepared he answered i had reason to know it as one of his executorseverything is confusionnothing signedno proper power of attorneycodicils drawn up in blank and never witnessedin short sir no sense apparently of the nearness of his death and of his duty to be prepared  i suppose i said poor podge didnt realise that he was going to die  ah thats just it resumed mr doomer with something like sternness a man ought to realise it every man ought to feel that at any momentone cant tell whenday or nighthe may be called upon to meet hismr doomer paused here as if seeking a phraseto meet his financial obligations face to face at any time sir he may be hurried before the judgeor rather his estate may bebefore the judge of the probate court it is a solemn thought sir and yet when i come here i see about me men laughing talking and playing billiards as if there would never be a day when their estate would pass into the hands of their administrators and an account must be given of every cent  but after all i said trying to fall in with his mood death and dissolution must come to all of us  thats just it he said solemnly theyve dissolved the tobacco people and theyve dissolved the oil people and you cant tell whose turn it may be next  mr doomer was silent a moment and then resumed speaking in a tone of humility that was almost reverential  and yet there is a certain preparedness for death a certain fitness to die that we ought all to aim at any man can at least think solemnly of the inheritance tax and reflect whether by a contract inter vivos drawn in blank he may not obtain redemption any man if he thinks death is near may at least divest himself of his purely speculative securities and trust himself entirely to those gold bearing bonds of the great industrial corporations whose value will not readily diminish or pass away mr doomer was speaking with something like religious rapture  and yet what does one see he continued  men affected with fatal illness and men stricken in years occupied still with idle talk and amusements instead of reading the financial newspapersand at the last carried away with scarcely time perhaps to send for their brokers when it is already too late  it is very sad i said  very he repeated and saddest of all perhaps is the sense of the irrevocability of death and the changes that must come after it  we were silent a moment  you think of these things a great deal mr doomer i said  i do he answered it may be that it is something in my temperament i suppose one would call it a sort of spiritual mindedness  but i think of it all constantly often as i stand here beside the window and see these cars go byhe indicated a passing street cari cannot but realise that the time will come when i am no longer a managing director and wonder whether they will keep on trying to hold the dividend down by improving the rolling stock or will declare profits to inflate the securities these mysteries beyond the grave fascinate me sir death is a mysterious thing  who for example will take my seat on the exchange what will happen to my majority control of the power company i shudder to think of the changes that may happen after death in the assessment of my real estate  yes i said it is all beyond our control isnt it  quite answered mr doomer especially of late years one feels that all said and done we are in the hands of a higher power and that the state legislature is after all supreme  it gives one a sense of smallness it makes one feel that in these days of drastic legislation with all ones efforts the individual is lost and absorbed in the controlling power of the state legislature consider the words that are used in the text of the income tax case folio two or the text of the transmissouri freight decision and think of the revelation they contain  i left mr doomer still standing beside the window musing on the vanity of life and on things such as the future control of freight rates that lay beyond the grave  i noticed as i left him how broken and aged he had come to look it seemed as if the chafings of the spirit were wearing the body that harboured it  it was about a month later that i learned of mr doomers death  dr slyder told me of it in the club one afternoon over two cocktails in the sittingroom  a beautiful bedside he said one of the most edifying that i have ever attended i knew that doomer was failing and of course the time came when i had to tell him  mr doomer i said all that i all that any medical can do for you is done you are going to die i have to warn you that it is time for other ministrations than mine  very good he said faintly but firmly send for my broker  they sent out and fetched jarvisyou know him i thinkmost sympathetic man and yet most businesslikehe does all the firms business with the dyingand we two sat beside doomer holding him up while he signed stock transfers and blank certificates  once he paused and turned his eyes on jarvis  read me from the text of the state inheritance tax statute he said jarvis took the book and read aloud very quietly and simply the part at the beginningwhenever and wheresoever it shall appear down to the words shall be no longer a subject of judgment or appeal but shall remain in perpetual possession  doomer listened with his eyes closed the reading seemed to bring him great comfort  when jarvis ended he said with a sign that covers it ill put my faith in that after that he was silent a moment and then said i wish i had already crossed the river oh to have already crossed the river and be safe on the other side we knew what he meant he had always planned to move over to new jersey  the inheritance tax is so much more liberal  presently it was all done  there i said it is finished now  no he answered there is still one thing  doctor youve been very good to me i should like to pay your account now without it being a charge on the estate i will pay it ashe paused for a moment and a fit of coughing seized him but by an effort of will he found the power to saycash  i took the account from my pocket i had it with me fearing the worst and we laid his chequebook before him on the bed jarvis thinking him too faint to write tried to guide his hand as he filled in the sum but he shook his head  the room is getting dim he said i can see nothing but the figures  never mind said jarvismuch moved thats enough  is it four hundred and thirty he asked faintly  yes i said and i could feel the tears rising in my eyes and fifty cents  after signing the cheque his mind wandered for a moment and he fell to talking with his eyes closed of the new federal banking law and of the prospect of the reserve associations being able to maintain an adequate gold supply  just at the last he rallied  i want he said in quite a firm voice to do something for both of you before i die  yes yes we said  you are both interested are you not he murmured in city traction  yes yes we said we knew of course that he was the managing director  he looked at us faintly and tried to speak  give him a cordial said jarvis but he found his voice  the value of that stock he said is going to take a sudden  his voice grew faint  yes yes i whispered bending over him there were tears in both our eyes tell me is it going up or going down  it is goinghe murmuredthen his eyes closedit is going  yes yes i said which  it is goinghe repeated feebly and then quite suddenly he fell back on the pillows and his soul passed and we never knew which way it was going it was very sad later on of course after he was dead we knew as everybody knew that it went down    5the reminiscences of mr apricot  rather a cold day isnt it i said as i entered the club  the man i addressed popped his head out from behind a newspaper and i saw it was old mr apricot so i was sorry that i had spoken  not so cold as the winter of 1866 he said beaming with benevolence  he had an eggshaped head bald with some white hair fluffed about the sides of it he had a pink face with large blue eyes behind his spectacles benevolent to the verge of imbecility  was that a cold winter i asked  bitter cold he said i have never told you have i of my early experiences in life  i think i have heard you mention them i murmured but he had already placed a detaining hand on my sleeve sit down he said  then he continued yes it was a cold winter  i was going to say that it was the coldest i have ever experienced but that might be an exaggeration but it was certainly colder than any winter that you have ever seen or that we ever have now or are likely to have in fact the winters now are a mere nothinghere mr apricot looked toward the club window where the driven snow was beating in eddies against the panessimply nothing one doesnt feel them at allhere he turned his eyes towards the glowing fire that flamed in the open fireplace but when i was a boy things were very different i have probably never mentioned to you have i the circumstances of my early life  he had many times but he had turned upon me the full beam of his benevolent spectacles and i was too weak to interrupt  my father went on mr apricot settling back in his chair and speaking with a faraway look in his eyes had settled on the banks of the wabash river  oh yes i know it well i interjected  not as it was then said mr apricot very quickly at present as you or any other thoughtless tourist sees it it appears a broad river pouring its vast flood in all directions  at the time i speak of it was a mere stream scarcely more than a few feet in circumference the life we led there was one of rugged isolation and of sturdy selfreliance and effort such as it is of course quite impossible for you or any other member of this club to understandi may give you some idea of what i mean when i say that at that time there was no town nearer to pittsburgh than chicago or to st paul than minneapolis  impossible i said  mr apricot seemed not to notice the interruption  there was no place nearer to springfield than st louis he went on in a peculiar singsong voice and there was nothing nearer to denver than san francisco nor to new orleans than rio janeiro  he seemed as if he would go on indefinitely  you were speaking of your father i interrupted  my father said mr apricot had settled on the banks both banks of the wabash  he was like so many other men of his time a disbanded soldier a veteran  of the mexican war or of the civil war i asked  exactly answered mr apricot hardly heeding the questionof the mexican civil war  was he under lincoln i asked  over lincoln corrected mr apricot gravely and he addedit is always strange to me the way in which the present generation regards abraham lincoln to us of course at the time of which i speak lincoln was simply one of ourselves  in 1866 i asked  this was 1856 said mr apricot he came often to my fathers cabin sitting down with us to our humble meal of potatoes and whiskey we lived with a simplicity which of course you could not possibly understand and would spend the evening talking with my father over the interpretation of the constitution of the united states we children used to stand beside them listening openmouthed beside the fire in our plain leather nightgowns i shall never forget how i was thrilled when i first heard lincoln lay down his famous theory of the territorial jurisdiction of congress as affected by the supreme court decision of 1857  i was only nine years old at the time but it thrilled me  is it possible i exclaimed how ever could you understand it  ah my friend said mr apricot almost sadly in those days the youth of the united states were educated in the real sense of the word we children followed the decisions of the supreme court with breathless interest our books were few but they were good we had nothing to read but the law reports the agriculture reports the weather bulletins and the almanacs but we read them carefully from cover to cover how few boys have the industry to do so now and yet how many of our greatest men were educated on practically nothing else except the law reports and the almanacs  franklin jefferson jackson johnsonmr apricot had relapsed into his singsong voice and his eye had a sort of misty perplexity in it as he went onharrison thomson peterson emerson  i thought it better to stop him  but you were speaking i said of the winter of eighteen fiftysix  of eighteen fortysix corrected mr apricot  i shall never forget it how distinctly i rememberi was only a boy then in fact a mere ladfighting my way to school the snow lay in some places as deep as ten feet mr apricot pausedand in others twenty  but we made our way to school in spite of it  no boys of todaynor for the matter of that even men such as youwould think of attempting it but we were keen anxious to learn our school was our delight our teacher was our friend our books were our companions we gladly trudged five miles to school every morning and seven miles back at night did chores till midnight studied algebra by candlelighthere mr apricots voice had fallen into its characteristic singsong and his eyes were vacantrose before daylight dressed by lamplight fed the hogs by lanternlight fetched the cows by twilight  i thought it best to stop him  but you did eventually get off the farm did you not i asked  yes he answered my opportunity presently came to me as it came in those days to any boy of industry and intelligence who knocked at the door of fortune till it opened  i shall never forget how my first chance in life came to me a man an entire stranger struck no doubt with the fact that i looked industrious and willing offered me a dollar to drive a load of tan bark to the nearest market  where was that i asked  minneapolis seven hundred miles but i did it i shall never forget my feelings when i found myself in minneapolis with one dollar in my pocket and with the world all before me  what did you do i said  first said mr apricot i laid out seventyfive cents for a suit of clothes things were cheap in those days for fifty cents i bought an overcoat for twentyfive i got a hat for ten cents a pair of boots and with the rest of my money i took a room for a month with a swedish family paid a months board with a german family arranged to have my washing done by an irish family and  but surely mr apricot i began  but at this point the young man who is generally in attendance on old mr apricot when he comes to the club appeared on the scene  i am afraid he said to me aside as mr apricot was gathering up his newspapers and his belongings that my uncle has been rather boring you with his reminiscences  not at all i said hes been telling me all about his early life in his fathers cabin on the wabash  i was afraid so said the young man too bad you see he wasnt really there at all  not there i said  no he only fancies that he was he was brought up in new york and has never been west of philadelphia in fact he has been very well to do all his life but he found that it counted against him it hurt him in politics so he got into the way of talking about the middle west and early days there and sometimes he forgets that he wasnt there  i see i said  meantime mr apricot was ready  goodbye goodbye he said very cheerilya delightful chat we must have another talk over old times soon i must tell you about my first trip over the plains at the time when i was surveying the line of the union pacific you who travel nowadays in your pullman coaches and observation cars can have no idea  come along uncle said the young man    6the last man out of europe  he came into the club and shook hands with me as if he hadnt seen me for a year in reality i had seen him only eleven months ago and hadnt thought of him since  how are you parkins i said in a guarded tone for i saw at once that there was something special in his manner  have a cig he said as he sat down on the edge of an armchair dangling his little boot  any young man who calls a cigarette a cig i despise no thanks i said  try one he went on theyre hungarian  theyre some i managed to bring through with me out of the war zone  as he said war zone his face twisted up into a sort of scowl of selfimportance  i looked at parkins more closely and i noticed that he had on some sort of foolish little coat short in the back and the kind of bowtie that they wear in the hungarian bands of the sixth avenue restaurants  then i knew what the trouble was he was the last man out of europe that is to say the latest last man there had been about fourteen others in the club that same afternoon in fact they were sitting all over it in italian suits and viennese overcoats striking german matches on the soles of dutch boots these were the war zone men and they had just got out in the clothes they stood up in naturally they hated to change  so i knew all that this young man parkins was going to say and all about his adventures before he began  yes he said we were caught right in the war zone by jove i never want to go through again what i went through  with that he sank back into the chair in the pose of a man musing in silence over the recollection of days of horror  i let him muse in fact i determined to let him muse till he burst before i would ask him what he had been through i knew it anyway  presently he decided to go on talking  we were at izzl he said in the carpathians loo jones and i wed just made a walking tour from izzl to fryzzl and back again  why did you come back i asked  back where  back to izzl i explained after youd once got to fryzzl it seems unnecessary but never mind go on  that was in july he continued there wasnt a sign of war not a sign we heard that russia was beginning to mobilize at this word be blew a puff from his cigarette and then repeated beginning to mobilize but we thought nothing of it  of course not i said  then we heard that hungary was calling out the honveds but we still thought nothing of it  certainly not i said  and then we heard  yes i know i said you heard that italy was calling out the trombonari and that germany was calling in all the landesgeschutzshaft  he looked at me  how did you know that he said  we heard it over here i answered  well he went on next thing we knew we heard that the russians were at fryzzl  great heavens i exclaimed  yes at fryzzl not a hundred miles away  the very place wed been at only two weeks before  think of it i said if youd been where you were two weeks after you were there or if the russians had been a hundred miles away from where they were or even if fryzzl had been a hundred miles nearer to izzl  we both shuddered  it was a close call said parkins however i said to loo jones loo its time to clear out and then i tell you our trouble began first of all we couldnt get any money  we went to the bank at izzl and tried to get them to give us american dollars for hungarian paper money we had nothing else  and wouldnt they  absolutely refused they said they hadnt any  by george i exclaimed isnt war dreadful what on earth did you do  took a chance said parkins went across to the railway station to buy our tickets with the hungarian money  did you get them i said  yes assented parkins they said theyd sell us tickets but they questioned us mighty closely asked where we wanted to go to what class we meant to travel by how much luggage we had to register and so on i tell you the fellow looked at us mighty closely  were you in those clothes i asked  yes said parkins but i guess he suspected we werent hungarians you see we couldnt either of us speak hungarian in fact we spoke nothing but english  that would give him a clue i said  however he went on he was civil enough in a way we asked when was the next train to the sea coast and he said there wasnt any  no trains i repeated  not to the coast the man said the reason was because there wasnt any railway to the coast but he offered to sell us tickets to vienna we asked when the train would go and he said there wouldnt be one for two hours so there we were waiting on that wretched little platformno place to sit down no shade unless one went into the waiting room itselffor two mortal hours and even then the train was an hour and a half late  an hour and a half late i repeated  yep said parkins thats what things were like over there so when we got on board the train we asked a man when it was due to get to vienna and he said he hadnt the faintest idea  good heavens  not the faintest idea he told us to ask the conductor or one of the porters no sir ill never forget that journey through to viennanine mortal hours nothing to eat not a bite except just in the middle of the day when they managed to hitch on a diningcar for a while and they warned everybody that the diningcar was only on for an hour and a half commandeered i guess after that added parkins puffing his cigarette  well he continued we got to vienna at last ill never forget the scene there station full of people trains coming and going men even women buying tickets big piles of luggage being shoved on trucks it gave one a great idea of the reality of things  it must have i said  poor old loo jones was getting pretty well used up with it all however we determined to see it through somehow  what did you do next  tried again to get money couldntthey changed our hungarian paper into italian gold but they refused to give us american money  hoarding it i hinted  exactly said parkins hoarding it all for the war well anyhow we got on a train for italy and there our troubles began all over againtrain stopped at the frontierofficials fellows in italian uniforms went all through it opening hand baggage  not hand baggage i gasped  yes sir even the hand baggage opened it all or a lot of it anyway and scribbled chalk marks over it yes and worse than thati saw them take two fellows and sling them clear off the trainthey slung them right out on to the platform  what for i asked  heaven knows said parkinsthey said they had no tickets in war time you know when theyre mobilizing they wont let a soul ride on a train without a ticket  infernal tyranny i murmured  isnt it however we got to genoa at last only to find that not a single one of our trunks had come with us  confiscated i asked  i dont know said parkins the head baggage man he wears a uniform you know in italy just like a soldier said it was because wed forgotten to check them in vienna however there we were waiting for twentyfour hours with nothing but our valises  right at the station i asked  no at a hotel we got the trunks later  they telegraphed to vienna for them and managed to get them through somehowin a baggage car i believe  and after that i suppose you had no more trouble  trouble said parkins i should say we had couldnt get a steamer they said there was none sailing out of genoa for new york for three days all cancelled i guess or else rigged up as cruisers  what on earth did you do  stuck it out as best we could stayed right there in the hotel poor old jones was pretty well collapsed couldnt do anything but sleep and eat and sit on the piazza of the hotel  but you got your steamer at last i asked  yes he admitted we got it but i never want to go through another voyage like that again no sir  what was wrong with it i asked bad weather  no calm but a peculiar calm glassy with little ripples on the wateruncanny sort of feeling  what was wrong with the voyage  oh just the feeling of iteverything under strict rule you knowno lights anywhere except just the electric lightssmokingroom closed tight at eleven oclockdecks all washed down every nightofficers up on the bridge all day looking out over the seano sir i want no more of it poor old loo jones i guess hes quite used up he cant speak of it at all just sits and broods in fact i doubt  at this moment parkinss conversation was interrupted by the entry of two newcomers into the room one of them had on a little hungarian suit like the one parkins wore and was talking loudly as they came in  yes he was saying we were caught there fair and square right in the war zone we were at izzl in the carpathians poor old parkins and i  we looked round  it was loo jones describing his escape from europe    7the war mania of mr jinks and mr blinks  they were sitting face to face at a lunch table at the club so near to me that i couldnt avoid hearing what they said in any case they are both stout men with gurgling voices which carry  what kitchener ought to dojinks was saying in a loud voice  so i knew at once that he had the prevailing hallucination he thought he was commanding armies in europe  after which i watched him show with three bits of bread and two olives and a dessert knife the way in which the german army could be destroyed  blinks looked at jinks diagram with a stern impassive face modelled on the sunday supplement photogravures of lord kitchener  your flank would be too much exposed he said pointing to jinks bread he spoke with the hard taciturnity of a joffre  my reserves cover it said jinks moving two pepper pots to the support of the bread  mind you jinks went on i dont say kitchener will do this i say this is what he ought to do its exactly the tactics of kuropatkin outside of mukden and its precisely the same turning movement that grant used before richmond  blinks nodded gravely anybody who has seen the grand duke nicholoevitch quietly accepting the advice of general ruski under heavy artillery fire will realize blinks manner to a nicety  and oddly enough neither of them i am certain has ever had any larger ideas about the history of the civil war than what can be got from reading uncle toms cabin and seeing gillette play secret service but this is part of the mania jinks and blinks had suddenly developed the hallucination that they knew the history of all wars by a sort of instinct  they rose soon after that dusted off their waistcoats with their napkins and waddled heavily towards the door i could hear them as they went talking eagerly of the need of keeping the troops in hard training they were almost brutal in their severity as they passed out of the doorone at a time to avoid crowdingthey were still talking about it jinks was saying that our whole generation is overfed and soft if he had his way he would take every man in the united states up to forty seven years of age jinks is fortyeight and train him to a shadow blinks went further  he said they should be trained hard up to fifty he is fiftyone  after that i used to notice jinks and blinks always together in the club and always carrying on the european war  i never knew which side they were on they seemed to be on both one day they commanded huge armies of russians and there was one week when blinks and jinks at the head of vast levies of cossacks threatened to overrun the whole of western europe it was dreadful to watch them burning churches and monasteries and to see jinks throw whole convents full of white robed nuns into the flames like so much waste paper  for a time i feared they would obliterate civilization itself then suddenly blinks decided that jinks cossacks were no good not properly trained he converted himself on the spot into a prussian field marshal declared himself organised to a pitch of organisation of which jinks could form no idea and swept jinks army off the earth without using any men at all by sheer organisation  in this way they moved to and fro all winter over the map of europe carrying death and destruction everywhere and revelling in it  but i think i liked best the wild excitement of their naval battles  jinks generally fancied himself a submarine and blinks acted the part of a firstclass battleship jinks would pop his periscope out of the water take a look at blinks merely for the fraction of a second and then like a flash would dive under water again and start firing his torpedoes he explained that he carried six  but he was never quick enough for blinks  one glimpse of his periscope miles and miles away was enough blinks landed him a contact shell in the side sunk him with all hands and then lined his yards with men and cheered i have known blinks sink jinks at two miles six milesand oncein the club billiard room just after the battle of the falkland islandshe got him fair and square at ten nautical miles  jinks of course claimed that he was not sunk  he had dived he was two hundred feet under water quietly smiling at blinks through his periscope in fact the number of things that jinks has learned to do through his periscope passes imagination  whenever i see him looking across at blinks with his eyes half closed and with a baffling quizzical expression in them i know that he is looking at him through his periscope  now is the time for blinks to watch out if he relaxes his vigilance for a moment hell be torpedoed as he sits and sent flying whiskey and soda and all through the roof of the club while jinks dives into the basement  indeed it has come about of late i dont know just how that jinks has more or less got command of the sea a sort of tacit understanding has been reached that blinks whichever army he happens at the moment to command is invincible on land but jinks whether as a submarine or a battleship controls the sea no doubt this grew up in the natural evolution of their conversation it makes things easier for both jinks even asks blinks how many men there are in an army division and what a sotnia of cossacks is and what the army service corps means and jinks in return has become a recognized expert in torpedoes and has taken to wearing a blue serge suit and referring to lord beresford as charley  but what i noticed chiefly about the war mania of jinks and blinks was their splendid indifference to slaughter they had gone into the war with a grim resolution to fight it out to a finish if blinks thought to terrify jinks by threatening to burn london he little knew his man all right said jinks taking a fresh light for his cigar burn it by doing so you destroy let us say two million of my women and children very good am i injured by that no you merely stimulate me to recruiting  there was something awful in the grimness of the struggle as carried on by blinks and jinks  the rights of neutrals and noncombatants red cross nurses and regimental clergymen they laughed to scorn as for movingpicture men and newspaper correspondents jinks and blinks hanged them on every tree in belgium and poland  with combatants in this frame of mind the war i suppose might have lasted forever  but it came to an end accidentallyfortuitously as all great wars are apt to and by accident also i happened to see the end of it  it was late one evening jinks and blinks were coming down the steps of the club and as they came they were speaking with some vehemence on their favourite topic  i tell you jinks was saying war is a great thing we needed it blinks we were all getting too soft too scared of suffering and pain we wilt at a bayonet charge we shudder at the thought of wounds bah he continued what does it matter if a few hundred thousands of human beings are cut to pieces  we need to get back again to the old viking standard the old pagan ideas of suffering  and as he spoke he got it  the steps of the club were slippery with the evenings rainnot so slippery as the frozen lakes of east prussia or the hills where jinks and blinks had been campaigning all winter but slippery enough for a stout man whose nation has neglected his training as jinks waved his stick in the air to illustrate the glory of a bayonet charge he slipped and fell sideways on the stone steps his shin bone smacked against the edge of the stone in a way that was pretty well up to the old viking standard of such things blinks with the shock of the collision fell alsobackwards on the top step his head striking first he lay to all appearance as dead as the most insignificant casualty in servia  i watched the waiters carrying them into the club with that new field ambulance attitude towards pain which is getting so popular they had evidently acquired precisely the old pagan attitude that blinks and jinks desired  and the evening after that i saw blinks and jinks both more or less bandaged sitting in a corner of the club beneath a rubber tree making peace  jinks was moving out of montenegro and blinks was foregoing all claims to polish prussia jinks was offering alsacelorraine to blinks and blinks in a fit of chivalrous enthusiasm was refusing to take it they were disbanding troops blowing up fortresses sinking their warships and offering indemnities which they both refused to take then as they talked jinks leaned forward and said something to blinks in a low voicea final proposal of terms evidently  blinks nodded and jinks turned and beckoned to a waiter with the words  one scotch whiskey and soda and one stein of wurtemburger bier  and when i heard this i knew that the war was over    8the ground floor  i hadnt seen ellesworth since our college days twenty years before at the time when he used to borrow two dollars and a half from the professor of public finance to tide him over the week end  then quite suddenly he turned up at the club one day and had afternoon tea with me  his big clean shaven face had lost nothing of its impressiveness and his spectacles had the same glittering magnetism as in the days when he used to get the college bursar to accept his note of hand for his fees  and he was still talking european politics just as he used to in the days of our earlier acquaintance  mark my words he said across the little teatable with one of the most piercing glances i have ever seen the whole balkan situation was only a beginning we are on the eve of a great panslavonic upheaval and then he added in a very quiet casual tone by the way could you let me have twentyfive dollars till tomorrow  a panslavonic movement i ejaculated  do you really think it possible no i couldnt  you must remember ellesworth went on russia means to reach out and take all she can get and he added how about fifteen till friday  she may reach for it i said but i doubt if shell get anything im sorry i havent got it  youre forgetting the bulgarian element he continued his animation just as eager as before the slavs never forget what they owe to one another  here ellesworth drank a sip of tea and then said quietly could you make it ten till saturday at twelve  i looked at him more closely i noticed now his frayed cuffs and the dinginess of his overbrushed clothes not even the magnetism of his spectacles could conceal it perhaps i had been forgetting something whether the bulgarian element or not  i compromised at ten dollars till saturday  the slav said ellesworth as he pocketed the money is peculiar he never forgets  what are you doing now i asked him  are you still in insurance i had a vague recollection of him as employed in that business  no he answered i gave it up i didnt like the outlook it was too narrow the atmosphere cramped me i want he said a bigger horizon  quite so i answered quietly i had known men before who had lost their jobs it is generally the cramping of the atmosphere that does it some of them can use up a tremendous lot of horizon  at present ellesworth went on i am in finance im promoting companies  oh yes i said i had seen companies promoted before  just now continued ellesworth im working on a thing that i think will be rather a big thing i shouldnt want it talked about outside but its a matter of taking hold of the cod fisheries of the grand bankspractically amalgamating themand perhaps combining with them the entire herring output and the whole of the sardine catch of the mediterranean  if it goes through he added i shall be in a position to let you in on the ground floor  i knew the ground floor of old i have already many friends sitting on it and others who have fallen through it into the basement  i said thank you and he left me  that was ellesworth wasnt it said a friend of mine who was near me poor devil  i knew him slightlyalways full of some new and wild idea of making money he was talking to me the other day of the possibility of cornering all the huckleberry crop and making refined sugar isnt it amazing what fool ideas fellows like him are always putting up to business men  we both laughed  after that i didnt see ellesworth for some weeks  then i met him in the club again how he paid his fees there i do not know  this time he was seated among a litter of foreign newspapers with a cup of tea and a tencent package of cigarettes beside him  have one of these cigarettes he said i get them specially they are milder than what we have in the club here  they certainly were  note what i say ellesworth went on  the french republic is going to gain from now on a stability that it never had he seemed greatly excited about it but his voice changed to a quiet tone as he added could you without inconvenience let me have five dollars  so i knew that the codfish and the sardines were still unamalgamated  what about the fisheries thing i asked  did it go through  the fisheries no i gave it up i refused to go forward with it the new york people concerned were too shy too timid to tackle it i finally had to put it to them very straight that they must either stop shillyshallying and declare themselves or the whole business was off  did they declare themselves i questioned  they did said ellesworth but i dont regret it im working now on a much bigger thingsomething with greater possibilities in it when the right moment comes ill let you in on the ground floor  i thanked him and we parted  the next time i saw ellesworth he told me at once that he regarded albania as unable to stand by itself so i gave him five dollars on the spot and left him  a few days after that he called me up on the telephone to tell me that the whole of asia minor would have to be redistributed the redistribution cost me five dollars more  then i met him on the street and he said that persia was disintegrating and took from me a dollar and a half  when i passed him next in the street he was very busy amalgamating chinese tramways it appeared that there was a ground floor in china but i kept off it  each time i saw ellesworth he looked a little shabbier than the last then one day he called me up on the telephone and made an appointment  his manner when i joined him was full of importance  i want you at once he said in a commanding tone to write me your cheque for a hundred dollars  whats the matter i asked  i am now able said ellesworth to put you in on the ground floor of one of the biggest things in years  thanks i said the ground floor is no place for me  dont misunderstand me said ellesworth  this is a big thing its an idea ive been working on for some timemaking refined sugar from the huckleberry crop its a certainty  i can get you shares now at five dollars theyll go to five hundred when we put them on the marketand i can run you in for a block of stock for promotion services as well  all you have to do is to give me right now a hundred dollarscash or your chequeand i can arrange the whole thing for you  i smiled  my dear ellesworth i said i hope you wont mind if i give you a little bit of good advice why not drop all this idea of quick money theres nothing in it the business world has grown too shrewd for it take an ordinary decent job and stick to it let me use my influence i added to try and get you into something with a steady salary and with your brains youre bound to get on in time  ellesworth looked pained a steady job sounded to him like a ground floor to me  after that i saw nothing of him for weeks  but i didnt forget him i looked about and secured for him a job as a canvassing agent for a book firm at a salary of five dollars a week and a commission of onetenth of one per cent  i was waiting to tell him of his good luck when i chanced to see him at the club again  but he looked transformed  he had on a long frock coat that reached nearly to his knees he was leading a little procession of very heavy men in morning coats upstairs towards the private luncheon rooms  they moved like a funeral puffing as they went i had seen company directors before and i knew what they were at sight  its a small club and rather inconvenient ellesworth was saying and the horizon of some of its members rather narrow here he nodded to me as he passedbut i can give you a fairly decent lunch  i watched them as they disappeared upstairs  thats ellesworth isnt it said a man near me it was the same man who had asked about him before  yes i answered  giving a lunch to his directors i suppose said my friend lucky dog  his directors i asked  yes hadnt you heard hes just cleaned up half a million or moresome new scheme for making refined sugar out of huckleberries  isnt it amazing what shrewd ideas these big business men get hold of they say theyre unloading the stock at five hundred dollars it only cost them about five to organize if only one could get on to one of these things early enough eh  i assented sadly  and the next time i am offered a chance on the ground floor i am going to take it even if its only the barley floor of a brewery  it appears that there is such a place after all    9the hallucination of mr butt  it is the hallucination of mr butts life that he lives to do good at whatever cost of time or trouble to himself he does it whether people appear to desire it or not he insists on helping them along  his time his company and his advice are at the service not only of those who seek them but of those who in the mere appearances of things are not asking for them  you may see the beaming face of mr butt appear at the door of all those of his friends who are stricken with the minor troubles of life whenever mr butt learns that any of his friends are moving house buying furniture selling furniture looking for a maid dismissing a maid seeking a chauffeur suing a plumber or buying a pianohe is at their side in a moment  so when i met him one night in the cloak room of the club putting on his raincoat and his galoshes with a peculiar beaming look on his face i knew that he was up to some sort of benevolence  come upstairs i said and play billiards i saw from his general appearance that it was a perfectly safe offer  my dear fellow said mr butt i only wish i could i wish i had the time i am sure it would cheer you up immensely if i could  but im just going out  where are you off to i asked for i knew he wanted me to say it  im going out to see the everleighjonesesyou know them nojust come to the city you know moving into their new house out on seldom avenue  but i said thats away out in the suburbs is it not a mile or so beyond the car tracks  something like that answered mr butt  and its going on for ten oclock and its starting to rain  pooh pooh said mr butt cheerfully adjusting his galoshes i never mind the raindoes one good as to their house ive not been there yet but i can easily find it ive a very simple system for finding a house at night by merely knocking at the doors in the neighborhood till i get it  isnt it rather late to go there i protested  my dear fellow said mr butt warmly i dont mind that a bit the way i look at it is here are these two young people only married a few weeks just moving into their new house everything probably upside down no one there but themselves no one to cheer them uphe was wriggling into his raincoat as he spoke and working himself into a frenzy of benevolencegood gracious i only learned at dinner time that they had come to town or id have been out there days agodays ago  and with that mr butt went bursting forth into the rain his face shining with good will under the street lamps  the next day i saw him again at the club at lunch time  well i asked did you find the joneses  i did said mr butt and by george i was glad that id gonequite a lot of trouble to find the house though i didnt mind that i expected ithad to knock at twenty houses at least to get itvery dark and wet out there no street lights yethowever i simply pounded at the doors until some one showed a lightat every house i called out the same things do you know where the everleigh joneses live they didnt all right i said go back to bed dont bother to come down  but i got to the right spot at last i found the house all dark jones put his head out of an upper window hullo i called out its butt im awfully sorry he said weve gone to bed my dear boy i called back dont apologize at all throw me down the key and ill wait while you dress i dont mind a bit  just think of it continued mr butt those two poor souls going to bed at half past ten through sheer dullness by george i was glad id come now then i said to myself lets cheer them up a little lets make things a little brighter here  well down they came and we sat there on furniture cases and things and had a chat  mrs jones wanted to make me some coffee  my dear girl i said i knew them both when they were children i absolutely refuse let me make it they protested i insisted i went at itkitchen all upsethad to open at least twenty tins to get the coffee however i made it at last now i said drink it they said they had some an hour or so ago nonsense i said drink it well we sat and chatted away till midnight they were dull at first and i had to do all the talking but i set myself to it i can talk you know when i try  presently about midnight they seemed to brighten up a little jones looked at his watch  by jove he said in an animated way its after midnight i think he was pleased at the way the evening was going after that we chatted away more comfortably every little while jones would say by jove its half past twelve or its one oclock and so on  i took care of course not to stay too late  but when i left them i promised that id come back today to help straighten things up they protested but i insisted  that same day mr butt went out to the suburbs and put the joneses furniture to rights  i worked all afternoon he told me afterwardshard at it with my coat offgot the pictures up firsttheyd been trying to put them up by themselves in the morning i had to take down every one of themnot a single one rightdown they come i said and went at it with a will  a few days later mr butt gave me a further report yes he said the furniture is all unpacked and straightened out but i dont like it theres a lot of it i dont quite like i half feel like advising jones to sell it and get some more but i dont want to do that till im quite certain about it  after that mr butt seemed much occupied and i didnt see him at the club for some time  how about the everleighjoneses i asked are they comfortable in their new house  mr butt shook his head it wont do he said i was afraid of it from the first im moving jones in nearer to town ive been out all morning looking for an apartment when i get the right one i shall move him i like an apartment far better than a house  so the joneses in due course of time were moved after that mr butt was very busy selecting a piano and advising them on wall paper and woodwork  they were hardly settled in their new home when fresh trouble came to them  have you heard about everleighjones said mr butt one day with an anxious face  no i answered  hes illsome sort of feverpoor chapbeen ill three days and they never told me or sent for mejust like their gritmeant to fight it out alone im going out there at once  from day to day i had reports from mr butt of the progress of joness illness  i sit with him every day he said poor chaphe was very bad yesterday for a whilemind wanderedquite deliriousi could hear him from the next roomseemed to think some one was hunting himis that damn old fool gone i heard him say  i went in and soothed him there is no one here my dear boy i said no one only butt he turned over and groaned mrs  jones begged me to leave him you look quite used up she said go out into the open air my dear mrs jones i said what does it matter about me  eventually thanks no doubt to mr butts assiduous care everleighjones got well  yes said mr butt to me a few weeks later jones is all right again now but his illness has been a long hard pull i havent had an evening to myself since it began but im paid sir now more than paid for anything ive donethe gratitude of those two peopleits unbelievable you ought to see it why do you know that dear little woman is so worried for fear that my strength has been overtaxed that she wants me to take a complete rest and go on a long trip somewheresuggested first that i should go south my dear mrs jones i said laughing thats the one place i will not go heat is the one thing i cant stand she wasnt nonplussed for a moment  then go north she said go up to canada or better still go to labradorand in a minute that kind little woman was hunting up railway maps to see how far north i could get by rail after that she said you can go on snowshoes shes found that theres a steamer to ungava every spring and she wants me to run up there on one steamer and come back on the next  it must be very gratifying i said  oh it is it is said mr butt warmly its well worth anything i do it more than repays me im alone in the world and my friends are all i have i cant tell you how it goes to my heart when i think of all my friends here in the club and in the town always glad to see me always protesting against my little kindnesses and yet never quite satisfied about anything unless they can get my advice and hear what i have to say  take jones for instance he continueddo you know really now as a factthe hall porter assures me of itevery time everleighjones enters the club here the first thing he does is to sing out is mr butt in the club it warms me to think of it mr butt paused one would have said there were tears in his eyes but if so the kindly beam of his spectacles shone through them like the sun through april rain he left me and passed into the cloak room  he had just left the hall when a stranger entered a narrow meek man with a hunted face he came in with a furtive step and looked about him apprehensively  is mr butt in the club he whispered to the hall porter  yes sir hes just gone into the cloak room sir shall i  but the man had turned and made a dive for the front door and had vanished  who is that i asked  thats a new member sir mr everleighjones said the hall porter    ivram spudd the new world singer is he divinely inspired or is he not at any rate we discovered him  footnote mr spudd was discovered by the author for the new york life he is already recognized as superior to tennyson and second only as a writer of imagination to the sultan of turkey  the discovery of a new poet is always a joy to the cultivated world  it is therefore with the greatest pleasure that we are able to announce that we ourselves acting quite independently and without aid from any of the english reviews of the day have discovered one in the person of mr ram spudd of whose work we give specimens below we feel that we reveal to our readers a genius of the first order unlike one of the most recently discovered english poets who is a bengalee and another who is a fullblooded yak mr spudd is we believe a navajo indian we believe this from the character of his verse  mr spudd himself we have not seen but when he forwarded his poems to our office and offered with characteristic modesty to sell us his entire works for seventyfive cents we felt in closing with his offer that we were dealing not only with a poet but with one of natures gentlemen  mr spudd we understand has had no education other newly discovered poets have had apparently some mr spudd has had evidently none we lay stress on this point  without it we claim it is impossible to understand his work  what we particularly like about ram spudd and we do not say this because we discovered him but because we believe it and must say it is that he belongs not to one school but to all of them as a nature poet we doubt very much if he has his equal as a psychologist we are sure he has not as a clear lucid thinker he is undoubtedly in the first rank while as a mystic he is a long way in front of it the specimens of mr spudds verse which we append herewith were selected we are happy to assure our readers purely at random from his work we first blindfolded ourselves and then standing with our feet in warm water and having one hand tied behind our back we groped among the papers on our desk before us and selected for our purpose whatever specimens first came to hand  as we have said or did we say it it is perhaps as a nature poet that ram spudd excels  others of our modern school have carried the observation of natural objects to a high degree of very nice precision but with mr spudd the observation of nature becomes an almost scientific process nothing escapes him the green of the grass he detects as in an instant the sky is no sooner blue than he remarks it with unerring certainty every bird note every bee call is familiar to his trained ear perhaps we cannot do better than quote the opening lines of a singularly beautiful sample of ram spudds genius which seems to us the last word in nature poetry it is called with characteristic daintiness        spring thaw in the    ahuntsic woods near paspebiac       passamoquoddy county  we would like to say that to our ears at least there is a music in this title like the sound of falling water or of chopped ice but we must not interrupt ourselves we now begin  listen   the thermometer is standing this morning at thirty    three decimal one  as a consequence it is freezing in the shade but    it is thawing in the sun  there is a certain amount of snow on the ground    but of course not too much  the air is what you would call humid but not    disagreeable to the touch  where i am standing i find myself practically    surrounded by trees  it is simply astonishing the number of the different    varieties one sees  ive grown so wise i can tell each different tree    by seeing it glisten  but if that test fails i simply put my ear to the    tree and listen  and well i suppose it is only a silly fancy of    mine perhaps  but do you know im getting to tell different trees    by the sound of their saps  after i have noticed all the trees and named those    i know in words  i stand quite still and look all round to see if    there are any birds  and yesterday close where i was standing sitting    in some brush on the snow  i saw what i was practically absolutely certain was    an early crow  i sneaked up ever so close and was nearly beside    it when say  it turned and took one look at me and flew away  but we should not wish our readers to think that ram spudd is always and only the contemplative poet of the softer aspects of nature  oh by no means there are times when waves of passion sweep over him in such prodigious volume as to roll him to and fro like a pebble in the surf gusts of emotion blow over him with such violence as to hurl him pro and con with inconceivable fury in such moods if it were not for the relief offered by writing verse we really do not know what would happen to him his verse written under the impulse of such emotions marks him as one of the greatest masters of passion wild and yet restrained objectionable and yet printable that have appeared on this side of the atlantic we append herewith a portion or half portion of his little gem entitled     you     you  with your warm full rich red ripe lips  and your beautifully manicured fingertips    you  with your heaving panting rapidly expanding and    contracting chest  lying against my perfectly ordinary shirtfront and    dinnerjacket vest       it is too much       your touch       as such       it and       your hand    can you not understand  last night an ostrich feather from your fragrant hair       unnoticed fell       i guard it       well       yestereen    from your tiara i have slid       unseen       a single diamond       and i keep it       hid  last night you left inside the vestibule upon the sill       a quarter dollar       and i have it       still  but even those who know ram spudd as the poet of nature or of passion still only know a part of his genius some of his highest flights rise from an entirely different inspiration and deal with the public affairs of the nation they are in every sense comparable to the best work of the poets laureate of england dealing with similar themes as soon as we had seen ram spudds work of this kind we cried that is we said to our stenographer what a pity that in this republic we have no laureateship here is a man who might truly fill it of the poem of this kind we should wish to quote if our limits of space did not prevent it mr spudds exquisite     ode on the reduction of the       united states tariff   it is a matter of the very gravest concern to at least    ninetenths of the business interests in the    united states  whether an allround reduction of the present tariff    either on an ad valorem or a specific basis  could be effected without a serious disturbance of the    general industrial situation of the country  but no we must not quote any more no we really mustnt yet we cannot refrain from inserting a reference to the latest of these laureate poems of ram spudd it appears to us to be a matchless specimen of its class and to settle once and for all the vexed question though we ourselves never vexed it of whether true poetry can deal with national occasions as they arise it is entitled     the bankers euthanasia or    the federal reserve currency       act of 1914  and though we do not propose to reproduce it here our distinct feeling is that it will take its rank beside mr spudds elegy on the interstate commerce act and his thoughts on the proposal of a uniform pure food law  but our space does not allow us to present ram spudd in what is after all his greatest aspect that of a profound psychologist a questioner of the very meaning of life itself his poem death and gloom from which we must refrain from quoting at large contains such striking passages as the following     why do i breathe or do i    what am i for and whither do i go    what skills it if i live and if i die       what boots it  any one knowing ram spudd as we do will realize that these questions especially the last are practically unanswerable    varistocratic anecdotes or little stories of great people  i have been much struck lately by the many excellent little anecdotes of celebrated people that have appeared in recent memoirs and found their way thence into the columns of the daily press there is something about them so deliciously pointed their humour is so exquisite that i think we ought to have more of them to this end i am trying to circulate on my own account a few anecdotes which seem somehow to have been overlooked  here for example is an excellent thing which comes if i remember rightly from the vivacious memoir of lady ranelagh de chit chat   anecdote of the duke of strathythan  lady ranelagh writes   the duke of strathythan i am writing of course of the  seventeenth duke not of his present grace was as  everybody knows famous for his hospitality  it was not  perhaps generally known that the duke was as witty as he  was hospitable i recall a most amusing incident that  happened the last time but two that i was staying at  strathythan towers as we sat down to lunch we were a  very small and intimate party there being only fortythree  of us the duke who was at the head of the table looked  up from the roast of beef that he was carving and running  his eye about the guests was heard to murmur im afraid  there isnt enough beef to go round   there was nothing to do of course but to roar with  laughter and the incident passed off with perfect savoir  faire  here is another story which i think has not had all the publicity that it ought to i found it in the book shot shell and shrapnell or sixty years as a war correspondent recently written by mr maxim catling whose exploits are familiar to all readers   anecdote of lord kitchener   i was standing writes mr maxim immediately between  lord kitchener and lord wolsley with lord roberts a  little to the rear of us and we were laughing and  chatting as we always did when the enemy were about to  open fire on us suddenly we found ourselves the object  of the most terrific hail of bullets for a few moments  the air was black with them as they went past i could  not refrain from exchanging a quiet smile with lord  kitchener and another with lord wolsley indeed i have  never except perhaps on twenty or thirty occasions  found myself exposed to such an awful fusillade   kitchener who habitually uses an eyeglass among his  friends watched the bullets go singing by and then  with that inimitable sangfroid which he reserves for his  intimates said   im afraid if we stay here we may get hit   we all moved away laughing heartily   to add to the joke lord roberts aidedecamp was shot  in the pit of the stomach as we went  the next anecdote which i reproduce may be already too well known to my readers the career of baron snorch filled so large a page in the history of european diplomacy that the publication of his recent memoirs was awaited with profound interest by half the chancelleries of europe even the other half were half excited over them the tangled skein in which the politics of europe are enveloped was perhaps never better illustrated than in this fascinating volume even at the risk of repeating what is already familiar i offer the following for what it is worthor even less   new light on the life of cavour   i have always regarded count cavour writes the baron  as one of the most impenetrable diplomatists whom it  has been my lot to meet i distinctly recall an incident  in connection with the famous congress of paris of 1856  which rises before my mind as vividly as if it were  yesterday i was seated in one of the large salons of  the elysee palace i often used to sit there playing  vingtetun together with count cavour the duc de magenta  the marquese di casa mombasa the conte di piccolo pochito  and others whose names i do not recollect the stakes  had been as usual very high and there was a large pile  of gold on the table no one of us however paid any  attention to it so absorbed were we all in the thought  of the momentous crises that were impending at intervals  the emperor napoleon iii passed in and out of the room  and paused to say a word or two with wellfeigned  eloignement to the players who replied with such  degagement as they could   while the play was at its height a servant appeared with  a telegram on a silver tray he handed it to count cavour  the count paused in his play opened the telegram read  it and then with the most inconceivable nonchalance put  it in his pocket we stared at him in amazement for a  moment and then the duc with the infinite ease of a  trained diplomat quietly resumed his play   two days afterward meeting count cavour at a reception  of the empress eugenie i was able unobserved to whisper  in his ear what was in the telegram nothing of any  consequence he answered  from that day to this i have  never known what it contained my readers concludes  baron snorch may believe this or not as they like but  i give them my word that it is true   probably they will not believe it  i cannot resist appending to these anecdotes a charming little story from that wellknown book sorrows of a queen the writer lady de weary was an english gentlewoman who was for many years mistress of the robes at one of the best known german courts her affection for her royal mistress is evident on every page of her memoirs   tenderness of a queen  lady de w writes   my dear mistress the late queen of saxecoviaslitz  inmein was of a most tender and sympathetic disposition  the goodness of her heart broke forth on all occasions  i well remember how one day on seeing a cabman in the  poodel platz kicking his horse in the stomach she stopped  in her walk and said oh poor horse if he goes on  kicking it like that hell hurt it  i may say in conclusion that i think if people would only take a little more pains to resuscitate anecdotes of this sort there might be a lot more of them found    vieducation made agreeable or the diversions of a professor  a few days ago during a pause in one of my college lectures my class being asleep i sat reading drapers intellectual development of europe  quite suddenly i came upon the following sentence  eratosthenes cast everything he wished to teach into poetry by this means he made it attractive and he was able to spread his system all over asia minor  this came to me with a shock of an intellectual discovery i saw at once how i could spread my system or parts of it all over the united states and canada to make education attractive there it is to call in the help of poetry of music of grand opera if need be to aid in the teaching of the dry subjects of the college class room  i set to work at once on the project and already i have enough results to revolutionize education  in the first place i have compounded a blend of modern poetry and mathematics which retains all the romance of the latter and loses none of the dry accuracy of the former here is an example        the poem of    lord ullins daughter       expressed as    a problem in trigonometry  introduction a party of three persons a scotch nobleman a young lady and an elderly boatman stand on the banks of a river r which for private reasons they desire to cross their only means of transport is a boat of which the boatman if squared is able to row at a rate proportional to the square of the distance the boat however has a leak s through which a quantity of water passes sufficient to sink it after traversing an indeterminate distance d  given the square of the boatman and the mean situation of all concerned to find whether the boat will pass the river safely or sink     a chieftain to the highlands bound       cried boatman do not tarry    and ill give you a silver pound       to row me oer the ferry    before them raged the angry tide    x2  y from side to side     outspake the hardy highland wight       ill go my chief im ready    it is not for your silver bright       but for your winsome lady    and yet he seemed to manifest       a certain hesitation    his head was sunk upon his breast       in puzzled calculation     suppose the river x  y    and call the distance q    then dare we thus the gods defy    i think we dare dont you       our floating power expressed in words       is x  473     oh haste thee haste the lady cries    though tempests round us gather    ill face the raging of the skies    but please cut out the algebra     the boat has left the stormy shore s    a stormy c before her    c1 c2 c3 c4    the tempest gathers oer her       the thunder rolls the lightning smites em       and the rain falls ad infinitum     in vain the aged boatman strains    his heaving sides reveal his pains    the angry water gains apace    both of his sides and half his base       till as he sits he seems to lose       the square of his hypotenuse     the boat advanced to x  2    lord ullin reached the fixed point q       then the boat sank from human eye    oy oy2 ogy  but this is only a sample of what can be done i have realised that all our technical books are written and presented in too dry a fashion they dont make the most of themselves  very often the situation implied is intensely sensational and if set out after the fashion of an uptodate newspaper would be wonderfully effective  here for example you have euclid writing in a perfectly prosaic way all in small type such an item as the following  a perpendicular is let fall on a line bc so as to bisect it at the point c etc etc just as if it were the most ordinary occurrence in the world every newspaper man will see at once that it ought to be set up thus        awful catastrophe    perpendicular falls headlong       on a given point     the line at c said to be completely bisected    president of the line makes statement       etc etc etc  but i am not contenting myself with merely describing my system i am putting it to the test i am preparing a new and very special edition of my friend professor daniel murrays work on the calculus this is a book little known to the general public i suppose one may say without exaggeration that outside of the class room it is hardly read at all  yet i venture to say that when my new edition is out it will be found on the tables of every cultivated home and will be among the best sellers of the year all that is needed is to give to this really monumental book the same chance that is given to every other work of fiction in the modern market  first of all i wrap it in what is called technically a jacket this is of white enamelled paper and on it is a picture of a girl a very pretty girl in a summer dress and sunbonnet sitting swinging on a bough of a cherry tree  across the cover in big black letters are the words     the calculus  and beneath them the legend the most daring book of the day this you will observe is perfectly true the reviewers of the mathematical journals when this book first came out agreed that professor murrays views on the calculus were the most daring yet published they said too that they hoped that the professors unsound theories of infinitesimal rectitude would not remain unchallenged yet the public somehow missed it all and one of the most profitable scandals in the publishing trade was missed for the lack of a little business enterprise  my new edition will give this book its first real chance  i admit that the inside has to be alteredbut not very much the real basis of interest is there the theories in the book are just as interesting as those raised in the modern novel  all that is needed is to adopt the device familiar in novels of clothing the theories in personal form and putting the propositions advanced into the mouths of the characters instead of leaving them as unsupported statements of the author take for example dr  murrays beginning it is very goodany one will admit itfascinatingly clever but it lacks heart  it runs   if two magnitudes one of which is determined by a straight  line and the other by a parabola approach one another  the rectangle included by the revolution of each will be  equal to the sum of a series of indeterminate rectangles  now this isquite franklydull the situation is there the idea is good and whether one agrees or not is at least as brilliantly original as even the best of our recent novels but i find it necessary to alter the presentation of the plot a little bit as i reedit it the opening of the calculus runs thus   on a bright morning in june along a path gay with the  opening efflorescence of the hibiscus and entangled here  and there with the wild blossoms of the convolvulustwo  magnitudes might have been seen approaching one another  the one magnitude who held a tennisracket in his hand  carried himself with a beautiful erectness and moved  with a firmness such as would have led professor murray  to exclaim in despairlet it be granted that a b  for such was our heros name is a straight line the  other magnitude which drew near with a step at once  elusive and fascinating revealed as she walked a figure  so exquisite in its every curve as to call from her  geometrical acquaintances the ecstatic exclamation let  it be granted that m is a parabola   the beautiful magnitude of whom we have last spoken  bore on her arm as she walked a tiny dog over which  her fair head was bent in endearing caresses indeed  such was her attention to the dog vi his full name was  velocity but he was called vi for short that her wayward  footsteps carried her not in a straight line but in a  direction so constantly changing as to lead that acute  observer professor murray to the conclusion that her  path could only be described by the amount of attraction  ascribable to vi   guided thus along their respective paths the two  magnitudes presently met with such suddenness that they  almost intersected   i beg your pardon said the first magnitude very  rigidly   you ought to indeed said the second rather sulkily  youve knocked vi right out of my arms   she looked round despairingly for the little dog which  seemed to have disappeared in the long grass   wont you please pick him up she pleaded   not exactly in my line you know answered the other  magnitude but i tell you what ill do if youll stand  still perfectly still where you are and let me take  hold of your hand ill describe a circle   oh arent you clever cried the girl clapping her  hands what a lovely idea you describe a circle all  around me and then well look at every weeny bit of it  and well be sure to find vi   she reached out her hand to the other magnitude who  clasped it with an assumed intensity sufficient to retain  it   at this moment a third magnitude broke on the scenea  huge oblong angular figure very difficult to describe  came revolving towards them   m it shouted emily what are you doing   my goodness said the second magnitude in alarm its  mama  i may say that the second instalment of dr  murrays fascinating romance will appear in the next number of the illuminated bookworm the great adultjuvenile vehicle of the newer thought in which these theories of education are expounded further    viian everyday experience  he came across to me in the semisilence room of the club  i had a rather queer hand at bridge last night he said  had you i answered and picked up a newspaper  yes it would have interested you i think he went on  would it i said and moved to another chair  it was like this he continued following me i held the king of hearts  half a minute i said i want to go and see what time it is i went out and looked at the clock in the hall i came back  and the queen and the ten he was saying  excuse me just a second i want to ring for a messenger  i did so the waiter came and went  and the nine and two small ones he went on  two small what i asked  two small hearts he said i dont remember which anyway i remember very well indeed that i had the king and the queen and the jack the nine and two little ones  half a second i said i want to mail a letter  when i came back to him he was still murmuring  my partner held the ace of clubs and the queen the jack was out but i didnt know where the king was  you didnt i said in contempt  no he repeated in surprise and went on murmuring  diamonds had gone round once and spades twice and so i suspected that my partner was leading from weakness  i can well believe it i saidsheer weakness  well he said on the sixth round the lead came to me now what should i have done finessed for the ace or led straight into my opponent  you want my advice i said and you shall have it openly and fairly in such a case as you describe where a man has led out at me repeatedly and with provocation as i gather from what you say though i myself do not play bridge i should lead my whole hand at him  i repeat i do not play bridge but in the circumstances i should think it the only thing to do    viiitruthful oratory or what our speakers ought to say   i  truthful speech giving the real thoughts of a distinguished guest at the fiftieth anniversary banquet of a society  mr chairman and gentlemen  if there is one thing i abominate more than another it is turning out on a cold night like this to eat a huge dinner of twelve courses and know that i have to make a speech on top of it gentlemen i just feel stuffed  thats the plain truth of it by the time we had finished that fish i could have gone home satisfied honestly i could thats as much as i usually eat  and by the time i had finished the rest of the food i felt simply waterlogged and i do still  more than that the knowledge that i had to make a speech congratulating this society of yours on its fiftieth anniversary haunted and racked me all through the meal i am not in plain truth the ready and brilliant speaker you take me for that is a pure myth if you could see the desperate home scene that goes on in my family when i am working up a speech your minds would be at rest on that point  ill go further and be very frank with you  how this society has lived for fifty years i dont know if all your dinners are like this heaven help you ive only the vaguest idea of what this society is anyway and what it does i tried to get a constitution this afternoon but failed i am sure from some of the faces that i recognise around this table that there must be good business reasons of some sort for belonging to this society theres money in itmark my wordsfor some of you or you wouldnt be here of course i quite understand that the president and the officials seated here beside me come merely for the selfimportance of it that gentlemen is about their size i realized that from their talk during the banquet i dont want to speak bitterly but the truth is they are small men and it flatters them to sit here with two or three blue ribbons pinned on their coats but as for me im done with it it will be fifty years please heaven before this event comes round again i hope i earnestly hope that i shall be safely under the ground   ii  the speech that ought to be made by a state governor after visiting the fall exposition of an agricultural society  well gentlemen this annual fall fair of the skedink county agricultural association has come round again i dont mind telling you straight out that of all the disagreeable jobs that fall to me as governor of this state my visit to your fall fair is about the toughest  i want to tell you gentlemen right here and now that i dont know anything about agriculture and i dont want to my parents were rich enough to bring me up in the city in a rational way i didnt have to do chores in order to go to the high school as some of those present have boasted that they did my only wonder is that they ever got there at all  they show no traces of it  this afternoon gentlemen you took me all round your livestock exhibit i walked past and through nearly a quarter of a mile of hogs  what was it that they were calledtamworthsberkshires i dont remember but all i can say gentlemen isphew just that  some of you will understand readily enough  that word sums up my whole idea of your agricultural show and im done with it  no let me correct myself there was just one feature of your agricultural exposition that met my warm approval you were good enough to take me through the section of your exposition called your midway pleasance let me tell you sirs that there was more real merit in that than all the rest of the show put together you apologized if i remember rightly for taking me into the large tent of the syrian dancing girls oh believe me gentlemen you neednt have syria is a country which commands my profoundest admiration  some day i mean to spend a vacation there  and believe me gentlemen when i do goand i say this with all the emphasis of which i am capablei should not wish to be accompanied by such a set of flatheads as the officials of your agricultural society  and now gentlemen as i have just received a fake telegram by arrangement calling me back to the capital of the state i must leave this banquet at once one word in conclusion  if i had known as fully as i do now how it feels to drink half a bucket of sweet cider i should certainly never have come   iii  truthful speech of a district politician to a ladies suffrage society  ladies my own earnest heartfelt conviction is that you are a pack of cats i use the word cats advisedly and i mean every letter of it i want to go on record before this gathering as being strongly and unalterably opposed to woman suffrage until you get it after that i favour it my reasons for opposing the suffrage are of a kind that you couldnt understand but all menexcept the few that i see at this meetingunderstand them by instinct  as you may however succeed as a result of the fuss that you are makingin getting votes i have thought it best to come alsoi am free to confessi wanted to see what you looked like  on this last head i am disappointed personally i like women a good deal fatter than most of you are and better looking as i look around this gathering i see one or two of you that are not so bad but on the whole not many but my own strong personal predilection is and remains in favour of a woman who can cook mend clothes talk when i want her to and give me the kind of admiration to which i am accustomed  let me however say in conclusion that i am altogether in sympathy with your movement to this extent if you ever do get votesand the indications are that you will blast youi want your votes and i want all of them    ixour literary bureau  footnote this literary bureau was started by the author in the new york century it leaped into such immediate prominence that it had to be closed at once   novels

idea a recent number of a wellknown magazine contains an account of an american multimillionaire who on account of the pressure of his brain power and the rush of his business found it impossible to read the fiction of the day for himself  he therefore caused his secretaries to look through any new and likely novel and make a rapid report on its contents indicating for his personal perusal the specially interesting parts  realizing the possibilities coiled up in this plan we have opened a special agency or bureau for doing work of this sort any overbusy multimillionaire or superman who becomes our client may send us novels essays or books of any kind and will receive a report explaining the plot and pointing out such parts as he may with propriety read if he can once find time to send us a postcard or a postal cablegram night or day we undertake to assume all the further effort of reading our terms for ordinary fiction are one dollar per chapter for works of travel 10 cents

boiled down by one of the business experts of your office  awaiting your commands  we remain etc etc    xspeeding up business  we were sitting at our editorial desk in our inner room quietly writing up our weeks poetry when a stranger looked in upon us  he came in with a burstlike the entry of the hero of western drama coming in out of a snowstorm his manner was all excitement  sit down we said in our grave courteous way sit down he exclaimed certainly not are you aware of the amount of time and energy that are being wasted in american business by the practice of perpetually sitting down and standing up again do you realize that every time you sit down and stand up you make a dead lift ofhe looked at ustwo hundred and fifty pounds did you ever reflect that every time you sit down you have to get up again never we said quietly we never thought of it you didnt he sneered no youd rather go on lifting 250 pounds through two feetan average of 500 footpounds practically 62 kilowatts of wasted power do you know that by merely hitching a pulley to the back of your neck you could generate enough power to light your whole office  we hung our heads simple as the thing was we had never thought of it very good said the stranger now all american business men are like you they dont thinkdo you understand me they dont think  we realized the truth of it at once we had never thought perhaps we didnt even know how  now i tell you continued our visitor speaking rapidly and with a light of wild enthusiasm in his face im out for a new campaignefficiency in businessspeeding things upbetter organization  but surely we said musingly we have seen something about this lately in the papers seen it sir he exclaimed i should say so  its everywhere its a new movement its in the air has it never struck you how a thing like this can be seen in the air  here again we were at fault in all our lives we had never seen anything in the air we had never even looked there now continued the stranger i want your paper to help i want you to join in i want you to give publicity  assuredly we said with our oldfashioned politeness anything which concerns the welfare the progress if one may so phrase it stop said the visitor you talk too much  youre prosy dont talk listen to me try and fix your mind on what i am about to say  we fixed it the strangers manner became somewhat calmer i am heading he said the new american efficiency movement  i have sent our circulars to fifty thousand representative firms explaining my methods i am receiving ten thousand answers a dayhere he dragged a bundle of letters out of his pocketfrom maine from new hampshire from vermontmassachusetts rhode island connecticut we murmured  exactly he said from every state in the unionfrom the philippines from porto rico and last week i had one from canada marvellous we said and may one ask what your new methods are  you may he answered its a proper question its a typical business question fair plain clean and even admitting of an answer  the great art of answering questions he continued is to answer at once without loss of time friction or delay in moving from place to place ill answer it  do we said  i will said the stranger my method is first to stimulate business to the highest point by infusing into it everywhere the spirit of generous rivalry of wholesome competition by inviting each and every worker to outdo each and every other  and can they do it we asked puzzled and yet fascinated can they all do it  they do and they can said the stranger  the proof of it is that they are doing it  listen here is an answer to my circular no 6 efficiency and recompense that came in this morning it is from a steel firm listen the stranger picked out a letter and read it  dear sir  our firm is a steel corporation we roll rails  as soon as we read your circular on the stimulus of competition we saw that there were big things in it  at once we sent one of our chief managers to the rolling mill he carried a paper bag in his hand now boys he said every man who rolls a rail gets a gumdrop the effect was magical the good fellows felt a new stimulus they now roll out rails like dough  work is a joy to them every saturday night the man who has rolled most gets a blue ribbon the man who has rolled the next most a green ribbon the next most a yellow ribbon and so on through the spectroscope  the man who rolls least gets only a red ribbon  it is a real pleasure to see the brave fellows clamouring for their ribbons our output after defraying the entire cost of the ribbons and the gumdrops has increased forty per cent we intend to carry the scheme further by allowing all the men who get a hundred blue ribbons first to exchange them for the grand efficiency prize of the firma pink ribbon  this the winner will be entitled to wear whenever and wherever he sees fit to wear it  the stranger paused for breath  marvellous we said there is no doubt the stimulus of keen competition  shut up he said impatiently let me explain it further competition is only part of it an item just as big that makes for efficiency is to take account of the little things its the little things that are never thought of  here was another wonder we realized that we had never thought of them take an example the stranger continued i went into a hotel the other day what did i see bellboys being summoned upstairs every minute and flying up in the elevators yesand every time they went up they had to come down again i went up to the manager i said i can understand that when your guests ring for the bellboys they have to go up but why should they come down why not have them go up and never come down he caught the idea at once that hotel is transformed i have a letter from the manager stating that they find it fifty per cent cheaper to hire new bellboys instead of waiting for the old ones to come down  these results we said are certainly marvellous you are most assuredly to be congratulated on  you talk too much said the stranger  dont do it learn to listen if a young man comes to me for advice in businessand they do in hundreds lots of themalmost in tears over their inefficiencyid say young man never talk listen answer but dont speak but even all this is only part of the method  another side of it is technique  technique we said pleased but puzzled  yes the proper use of machine devices  take the building trade ive revolutionized it till now all the bricks even for a high building were carried up to the mason in hods  madness think of the waste of it by my method instead of carrying the bricks to the mason we take the mason to the bricklower him on a wire rope give him a brick and up he goes again as soon as he wants another brick he calls down i want a brick and down he comes like lightning  this we said is little short of  cut it out even that is not all another thing bigger than any is organization half the business in this country is not organized  as soon as i sent out my circular no 4 have you organized your business  i got answers in thousands heartbroken many of them they had never thought of it here for example is a letter written by a plain man a gardener just an ordinary man a plain man  yes we said quite so  well here is what he writes  dear sir  as soon as i got your circular i read it all through from end to end and i saw that all my failure in the past had come from my not being organized i sat and thought a long while and i decided that i would organize myself i went right in to the house and i said to my wife jane im going to organize myself she said oh johnand not another word but you should have seen the look on her face so the next morning i got up early and began to organize myself it was hard at first but i stuck to it there were times when i felt as if i couldnt do it it seemed too hard but bit by bit i did it and now thank god i am organized i wish all men like me could know the pleasure i feel in being organized  touching isnt it said the stranger  but i get lots of letters like that heres another also from a man a plain man working on his own farm hear what he says  dear sir  as soon as i saw your circular on how to speed up the employee i felt that it was a big thing i dont have any hired help here to work with me but only father he cuts the wood and does odd chores about the place so i realized that the best i could do was to try to speed up father i started in to speed him up last tuesday and i wish you could see him before this he couldnt split a cord of wood without cutting a slice off his boots now he does it in half the time  but there the stranger said getting impatient even with his own reading i neednt read it all it is the same thing all along the line ive got the method introduced into the department stores before this every customer who came in wasted time trying to find the counters now we install a patent springboard with a mechanism like a catapault as soon as a customer comes in an attendant puts him on the board blindfolds him and says where do you want to go glove counter oh all right hes fired at it through the air  no time lost same with the railways  theyre installing the method too every engineer who breaks the record from new york to buffalo gets a glass of milk when he gets a hundred glasses he can exchange them for a glass of beer so with the doctors on the new method instead of giving a patient one pill a day for fourteen days they give him fourteen pills in one day doctors lawyers everybodyin time sir said the stranger in tones of rising excitement youll see even the plumbers  but just at this moment the door opened  a sturdylooking man in blue entered the strangers voice was hushed at once the excitement died out of his face his manner all of a sudden was meekness itself  i was just coming he said  thats right sir said the man better come along and not take up the gentlemans time  goodbye then said the stranger with meek affability and he went out  the man in blue lingered behind for a moment  a sad case sir he said and he tapped his forehead  you mean i asked  exactly cracked sir quite cracked but harmless im engaged to look after him but he gave me the slip downstairs  he is under delusions we inquired  yes sir hes got it into his head that business in this country has all gone to piecesthinks it must be reorganized he writes letters about it all day and sends them to the papers with imaginary names you may have seen some of them good day sir  we looked at our watch we had lost just half an hour over the new efficiency we turned back with

he turned towards her was taut as a tieline  you dont love me he hoarsed thick with agony she had angled into a seat and sat sensingratherthanseeing him  for a time she silenced then presently as he still stood and enveloped her  dont she thinned her voice fining to a thread  answer me he gloomed still gazing intoandthrough her  she halfheard halfdidnthear him  night was falling about them as they sat thus beside the river a molten afterglow of iridescent saffron shot with incandescent carmine lit up the waters of the hudson till they glowed like electrified uranium  for a while they both sat silentlooming  it had to be she glumped  why why he barked why should it have had to have been or more hopefully even be to be surely you dont mean because of money  she shuddered into herself  the thing seemed to sting her it hadnt really  money she almostbutnotquitemoaned  you might have spared me that  he sank down and grassed  and after they had sat thus for another halfhour grassing and

summer  we were sitting on the verandah of the sopleys summer cottage  how lovely it is here i said to my host and hostess and how still  it was at this moment that weejee the pet dog took a sharp nip at the end of my tennis trousers  weejee exclaimed his mistress with great emphasis bad dog how dare you sir bad dog  i hope he hasnt hurt you said my host  oh its nothing i answered cheerfully  he hardly scratched me  you know i dont think he means anything by it said mrs sopley  oh im sure he doesnt i answered  weejee was coming nearer to me again as i spoke  weejee cried my hostess naughty dog bad  funny thing about that dog said sopley the way he knows people its a sort of instinct he knew right away that you were a strangernow yesterday when the butcher came there was a new driver on the cart and weejee knew it right awaygrabbed the man by the leg at oncewouldnt let go i called out to the man that it was all right or he might have done weejee some harm  at this moment weejee took the second nip at my other trouser leg there was a short gurrr and a slight mixup  weejee weejee called mrs sopley  how dare you sir youre just a bad dog  go and lie down sir im so sorry i think you know its your white trousers for some reason weejee simply hates white trousers i do hope he hasnt torn them  oh no i said its nothing only a slight tear  here weege weege said sopley anxious to make a diversion and picking up a little chip of woodchase it fetch it out and he made the motions of throwing it into the lake  dont throw it too far charles said his wife he doesnt swim awfully well she continued turning to me and im always afraid he might get out of his depth last week he was ever so nearly drowned mr van toy was in swimming and he had on a dark blue suit dark blue seems simply to infuriate weejee and weejee just dashed in after him he dont mean anything you know it was only the suit made him angryhe really likes mr van toybut just for a minute we were quite alarmed if mr van toy hadnt carried weejee in i think he might have been drowned  by jove i said in a tone to indicate how appalled i was  let me throw the stick charles continued mrs sopley now weejee look weejeehere good doglook look now sometimes weejee simply wont do what one wants here weejee now good dog  weejee had his tail sideways between his legs and was moving towards me again  hold on said sopley in a stern tone let me throw him in  do be careful charles said his wife  sopley picked weejee up by the collar and carried him to the edge of the waterit was about six inches deepand threw him inwith much the same force as let us say a pen is thrown into ink or a brush dipped into a pot of varnish  thats enough thats quite enough charles exclaimed mrs sopley i think hed better not swim the water in the evening is always a little cold good dog good doggie good weejee  meantime good weejee had come out of the water and was moving again towards me  he goes straight to you said my hostess  i think he must have taken a fancy to you  he had  to prove it weejee gave himself a rotary whirl like a twirled mop  oh im so sorry said mrs sopley i am hes wetted you weejee lie down down sir good dog bad dog lie down  its all right i said ive another white suit in my valise  but you must be wet through said mrs  sopley perhaps wed better go in its getting late anyway isnt it and then she added to her husband i dont think weejee ought to sit out here now that hes wet  so we went in  i think youll find everything you need said sopley as he showed me to my room and by the way dont mind if weejee comes into your room at night we like to let him run all over the house and he often sleeps on this bed  all right i said cheerfully ill look after him  that night weejee came  and when it was far on in the dead of nightso that even the lake and the trees were hushed in sleep i took weejee out andbut there is no need to give the details of it  and the sopleys are still wondering where weejee has gone to and waiting for him to come back because he is so clever at finding his way  but from where weejee is no one finds his way back    xivsidelights on the supermen an interview with general bernhardi  he came into my room in that modest prussian way that he has clicking his heels together his head very erect his neck tightly gripped in his fortytwo centimeter collar he had on a pickelhaube or prussian helmet which he removed with a sweeping gesture and laid on the sofa  so i knew at once that it was general bernhardi  in spite of his age he lookedi am bound to admit ita fine figure of a man there was a splendid fullness about his chest and shoulders and a suggestion of rugged power all over him i had not heard him on the stairs  he seemed to appear suddenly beside me  how did you get past the janitor i asked  for it was late at night and my room at college is three flights up the stairs  the janitor he answered carelessly i killed him  i gave a gasp  his resistance the general went on was very slight apparently in this country your janitors are unarmed  you killed him i asked  we prussians said bernhardi when we wish an immediate access anywhere always kill the janitor it is quicker and it makes for efficiency it impresses them with a sense of our furchtbarkeit you have no word for that in english i believe  not outside of a livery stable i answered  there was a pause i was thinking of the janitor it seemed in a sort of wayi admit that i have a sentimental streak in mea deplorable thing  sit down i said presently  thank you answered the general but remained standing  all right i said do it  thank you he repeated without moving  i forgot i said perhaps you cant sit down  not very well he answered in fact we prussian officershere he drew himself up higher stillnever sit down our uniforms do not permit of it this inspires us with a kind of rastlosigkeit here his eyes glittered  it must i said  in fact with an unsittlichkeitan unverschamtheitwith an einfurallemalundurchaus  exactly i said for i saw that he was getting excited but pray tell me general to what do i owe the honour of this visit  the generals manner changed at once  highly learned and highwellbornprofessor he said i come to you as to a fellow author known and honoured not merely in england for that is nothing but in germany herself and in turkey the very home of culture  i knew that it was mere flattery i knew that in this same way lord haldane had been so captivated as to come out of the emperors presence unable to say anything but sittlichkeit for weeks that good old john burns had been betrayed by a single dinner at potsdam and that the sultan of turkey had been told that his answers to ultimatums were the wittiest things written since kants critique of pure reason yet i was pleased in spite of myself  what i exclaimed they know my works of humour in germany  do they know them said the general  ach himmel how they laugh that work of yours i think i see it on the shelf behind you the elements of political science how the kaiser has laughed over it and the crown prince it nearly killed him  i will send him the new edition i said  but tell me general what is it that you want of me  it is about my own book he answered  you have read it  i pointed to a copy of germany and the next war in its glaring yellow coverthe very hue of furchtbarkeitlying on the table  you have read it you have really read it asked the general with great animation  no i said i wont go so far as to say that but i have tried to read it and i talk about it as if i had read it  the generals face fell  you are as the others he said they buy the book they lay it on the table they talk of it at dinnerthey say bernhardi has prophesied this bernhardi foresaw that but read itnevermore  still i said you get the royalties  they are cut off the perfidious british government will not allow the treacherous publisher to pay them but that is not my complaint  what is the matter then i asked  my book is misunderstood you english readers have failed to grasp its intention it is not meant as a book of strategy it is what you call a work of humour the book is to laugh it is one big joke  you dont say so i said in astonishment  assuredly answered the general hereand with this he laid hold of the copy of the book before me and began rapidly turning over the leaveslet me set it out asunder for you the humour of it listen though to this where i speak of germanys historical mission on page 73no nation on the face of the globe is so able to grasp and appropriate all the elements of culture as germany is what do you say to that is it not a joke ach himmel how our officers have laughed over that in belgium  with their booted feet on the mantelpiece as they read and with bottles of appropriated champagne beside them as they laugh  you are right general i said you will forgive my not laughing out loud but you are a great humorist  am i not and listen further still how i deal with the theme of the german charactermoral obligations such as no nation had ever yet made the standard of conduct are laid down by the german philosophers  good i said gloriously funny read me some more  this then you will likehere i deal with the permissible rules of war it is on page 236 that i am reading it i wrote this chiefly to make laugh our naval men and our zeppelin crewsa surprise attack in order to be justified must be made only on the armed forces of the state and not on its peaceful inhabitants otherwise the attack becomes a treacherous crime eh what  here the general broke into roars of laughter  wonderful i said your book ought to sell well in scarborough and in yarmouth  read some more  i should like to read you what i say about neutrality and how england is certain to violate our strategical right by an attack on belgium and about the sharp measures that ought to be taken against neutral ships laden with contrabandthe passages are in chapters vii and viii but for the moment i fail to lay the thumb on them  give me the book general i said now that i understand what you meant by it i think i can show you also some very funny passages in it these things for example that you say about canada and the coloniesyes here it is page 148in the event of war the looselyjoined british empire will break into pieces and the colonies will consult their own interestsexcellently funnyand this againcanada will not permanently retain any trace of the english spiritand this toothe colonies can be completely ignored so far as the european theatre of war is concernedand here againegypt and south africa will at once revolt and break away from the empire really general your ideas of the british colonies are superbly funny mark twain wasnt a circumstance on you  not at all said bernhardi and his voice reverted to his habitual prussian severity these are not jokes they are facts it is only through the folly of the canadians in not reading my book that they are not more widely known even as it is they are exactly the views of your great leader heinrich bauratze  who i said  heinrich bauratze your great canadian leader  leader of what  that i do not know said bernhardi our intelligence office has not yet heard what he leads but as soon as he leads anything we shall know it meantime we can see from his speeches that he has read my book ach if only your other leaders in canadasir robert laurier sir osler sifton sir williams bordenyou smile you do not realize that in germany we have exact information of everything  all that happens we know it  meantime i had been looking over the leaves of the book  here at least i said is some splendidly humorous stuffthis about the navy the completion of the kiel canal you write in chapter xii is of great importance as it will enable our largest battleships to appear unexpectedly in the baltic and in the north sea appear unexpectedly if they only would  how exquisitely absurd  sir said the general that is not to laugh you err yourself that is furchtbarkeit  i did not say the book is all humour  that would be false art part of it is humour and part is furchbarkeit that passage is specially designed to frighten admiral jellicoe and he wont read it potztausand he wont read itrepeated the general his eyes flashing and his clenched fist striking in the airwhat sort of combatants are these of the british navy who refuse to read our warbooks the kaisers heligoland speech  they never read a word of it the furchtbarkeitproklamation of augustthey never looked at it the reichstagsrede with the printed picture of the kaiser shaking hands with everybodythey used it to wrap up sandwiches what are they then jellicoe and his men they sit there in their ships and they read nothing how can we get at them if they refuse to read how can we frighten them away if they havent culture enough to get frightened beim himmel shouted the general in great excitement  but what more he said can never be known  for at this second a sudden catastrophe happened  in his frenzy of excitement the general struck with his fist at the table missed it lost his balance and fell over sideways right on the point of his pickelhaube which he had laid on the sofa there was a sudden sound as of the ripping of cloth and the bursting of pneumatic cushions and to my amazement the general collapsed on the sofa his uniform suddenly punctured in a dozen places  schnapps he cried fetch brandy  great heavens general i said what has happened  my uniform he moaned it has burst  give me schnapps  he seemed to shrink visibly in size his magnificent chest was gone he was shrivelling into a tattered heap he appeared as he lay there a very allegory and illustration of prussian furchtbarkeit with the wind going out of it  fetch schnappshe moaned  there are no schnapps here i said this is mcgill university  then call the janitor he said  you killed him i said  i didnt i was lying i gave him a look that should have killed him but i dont think it did rouse yourself from your chair and call him  i will i said and started up from my seat  but as i did so the form of general bernhardi which i could have sworn had been lying in a tattered heap on the sofa on the other side of the room seemed suddenly to vanish from my eyes  there was nothing before me but the empty room with the fire burned low in the grate and in front of me an open copy of bernhardis book  i mustlike many another readerhave fallen asleep over it    xvthe survival of the fittest  a bell tinkled over the door of the little drug store as i entered it which seemed strange in a lighted street of a great city  but the little store itself dim even in the centre and dark in the corners was gloomy enough for a country crossroads  i have to have the bell said the man behind the counter reading my thought im alone here just now  a toothbrush he said in answer to my question yes i guess ive got some somewhere round here he was stooping under and behind his counter and his voice came up from below ive got some somewhere and then as if talking to himself he murmured from behind a pile of cardboard boxes i saw some tuesday  had i gone across the street to the brilliant premises of the cut rate pharmaceutical where they burn electric light by the meterfull i should no sooner have said tooth brush than one of the ten clerks in white hospital jackets would have poured a glittering assortment over the counterprophylactic lactic and every other sort  but i had turned in i dont know why to the little store across the way  here i guess these must be tooth brushes he said reappearing at the level of the counter with a flat box in his hand they must have been presumably or have once beenat some time long ago  theyre tooth brushes all right he said and started looking over them with an owners interest  what is the price of them i asked  well the man said musingly i dontjestknow i guess its written on them likely and he began to look at the handles  over at the pharmaceutical across the way the words what price would have precipitated a ready avalanche of figures  this one seems to be seventyfive cents he said and handed me one  is it a good tooth brush i asked  it ought to be he said youd think at that price  he had no shop talk no patter whatever  then he looked at the brush again more closely  i dont believe it is seventyfive he muttered i think it must be fifteen dont you  i took it from his hand and looked and saidfor it is well to take an occasional step towards the kingdom of heaventhat i was certain it was seventyfive  well said the man perhaps it is my sight is not so good now ive had too much to do here and the works been using me up some  i noticed now as he said this how frail he looked as he bent over his counter wrapping up the tooth brush  ive no sealing wax he said or not handy  that doesnt matter i answered just put it in the paper  over the way of course the tooth brush would have been done up almost instantaneously in white enamel paper sealed at the end and stamped with a label as fast as the money paid for it went rattling along an automatic carrier to a cashier  youve been very busy eh i asked  well not so much with customers he said but with fixing up the placehere he glanced about him heaven only knows what he had fixed there were no visible signs of it  you see ive only been in here a couple of months it was a pretty tough looking place when i came to it but ive been getting things fixed first thing i did i put those two carboys in the window with the lights behind them  they show up fine dont they  fine i repeated so fine indeed that the dim yellow light in them reached three or four feet from the jar but for the streaming light from the great store across the street the windows of the little shop would have been invisible  its a good location here he said any one could have told him that it was the worst location within two miles  ill get it going presently he went on  of course its uphill just at first being such a good location the rent is high the first two weeks i was here i was losing five dollars a day but i got those lights in the window and got the stock overhauled a little to make it attractive and last month i reckon i was only losing three dollars a day  thats better i said  oh yes he went on and there was a clear glint of purpose in his eye that contrasted with his sunken cheeks ill get it going this last two weeks im not losing more than say two and a half a day or something like that the custom is bound to come you get a place fixed up and made attractive like this and people are sure to come sooner or later  what it was that was fixed up and wherein lay the attractiveness i do not know it could not be seen with the outward eye perhaps after two months work of piling dusty boxes now this way now that and putting little candles behind the yellow carboys to try the effect some inward vision came that lighted the place up with an attractiveness wanting even in the glass and marble glitter of the pharmacy across the way  yes sir continued the man i mean to stay with it ill get things into shape here fix it up a little more and soon ill have ithere his face radiated with a vision of hopeso that i wont lose a single cent  i looked at him in surprise so humble an ambition it had never been my lot to encounter  all that bothers me he went on is my health its a nice business the drug business  i like it but it takes it out of you youve got to be alert and keen all the time thinking out plans to please the custom when it comes  often i dont sleep well nights for the rush of it  i looked about the little shop as gloomy and sleepful as the mausoleum of an eastern king and wondered by what alchemy of the mind the little druggist found it a very vortex of activity  but i can fix my health he returnedi may have to get some one in here and go away for a spell perhaps ill do it the doctor was saying he thought i might take a spell off and think out a few more wrinkles while im away  at the word doctor i looked at him more warmly and i saw then what was plain enough to see but for the dim light of the little placethe thin flush on the cheek the hopeful mind the contrast of the will to live and the need to die gods little irony on man it was all there plain enough to read the spell for which the little druggist was going is that which is written in letters of sorrow over the sunlit desolation of arizona and the mountains of colorado  a month went by before i passed that way again i looked across at the little store and i read the story in its drawn blinds and the padlock on its door  the little druggist had gone away for a spell and they told me on enquiry that his journey had been no further than to the cemetery behind the town where he lies now musing if he still can on the law of the survival of the fittest in this welladjusted world  and they say that the shock of the addition of his whole business to the great pharmacy across the way scarcely disturbed a soda siphon    xvithe first newspaper a sort of allegory  how likes it you master brenton said the brawny journeyman spreading out the news sheet on a smooth oaken table where it lay under the light of a leaded window  a marvellous fair sheet murmured brenton caxton seventh of the name let me but adjust my glasses and peruse it further lest haply there be still aught in it that smacks of error  it needs not said the journeyman tis the fourth time already from the press  nay nay answered master brenton softly as he adjusted his great hornrimmed spectacles and bent his head over the broad damp news sheet before him let us grudge no care in this the venture is a new one and meseems a very parlous thing withal tis a venture that may easily fail and carry down our fortunes with it but at least let it not be said that it failed for want of brains in the doing  fail quotha said a third man who had not yet spoken old tall and sour of visage and wearing a printers leather apron he had moved over from the further side of the room where a little group of apprentices stood beside the wooden presses that occupied the corner and he was looking over the shoulder of master brenton caxton  how can it do aught else tis a mad folly mark you master brenton and master nick i have said it from the first and let the blame be none of mine tis a mad thing you do here see then he went on turning and waving his hand this vast room these great presses yonder benches and tools all new yonder vats of ink straight out of flanders how think you you can recover the cost of all this out of yonder poor sheets five and forty years have i followed this mystery of printing ever since thy grandfathers day master brenton and never have i seen the like what needed this great chamber when your grandfather and father were content with but a garret place and yonder presses that can turn off four score copies in the compass of a single hourtis mad folly i say  the moment was an interesting one the speakers were in a great room with a tall ceiling traversed by blackened beams from the street below there came dimly through the closed casements the sound of rumbling traffic and the street cries of the london of the seventeenth century two vast presses of such colossal size that their wooden levers would tax the strength of the stoutest apprentice were ranged against the further wall about the room spread out on oaken chairs and wooden benches were flat boxes filled with leaden type freshly molten and a great pile of paper larger than a man could lift stood in a corner  the first english newspaper in history was going to press those who in later ageseditors printers and workershave participated in the same scene can form some idea of the hopes and fears the doubts and the difficulties with which the first newspaper was ushered into the world  master brenton caxton turned upon the last speaker the undisturbed look of the eye that sees far across the present into the years to come  nay edward he said you have laboured over much in the past and see not into the future you think this chamber too great for our purpose i tell you the time will come when not this room alone but three or four such will be needed for our task already i have it in my mind that i will divide even this room into portions with walls shrewdly placed through its length and breadth so that each that worketh shall sit as it were in his own chamber and there shall stand one at the door and whosoever cometh to whatever part of our task his business appertains he shall forthwith be brought to the room of him that hath charge of it cometh he with a madrigal or other light poesy that he would set out on the press he shall find one that has charge of such matters and can discern their true value or cometh he with news of aught that happens in the realm so shall he be brought instant to the room of him that recordeth such events or if so be he would write a discourse on what seemeth him some wise conceit touching the public concerns he shall find to his hand a convenient desk with ink and quills and all that he needeth to set it straightway on paper thus shall there be a great abundance of written matter to our hand so that not many days shall elapse after one of our news sheets goes abroad before there be matter enough to fill another  days said the aged printer think you you can fill one of these news sheets in a few days where indeed if you search the whole realm will you find talk enough in a single week to fill out this great sheet half an ell wide  ay days indeed broke in master nicholas the younger journeyman master brenton speaks truth or less than truth for not days indeed but in the compass of a single day i warrant you shall we find the matter withal master nicholas spoke with the same enthusiasm as his chief but with less of the dreamer in his voice and eye and with more swift eagerness of the practical man  fill it indeed he went on why gad zooks man who knoweth what happenings there are and what not till one essays the gathering of them and should it chance that there is nothing of greater import no boar hunt of his majesty to record nor the news of some great entertainment by one of the lords of the court then will we put in lesser matter aye whatever comes to hand the talk of his majestys burgesses in the parliament or any such things  hear him sneered the printer the talk of his majestys burgesses in westminster forsooth and what clerk or learned person would care to read of such or think you that his majestys chamberlain would long bear that such idle chatter should be bruited abroad  if you can find no worthier thing for this our news sheet than the talk of the burgesses then shall it fail indeed had it been the speech of the kings great barons and the bishops twere different but dost fancy that the great barons would allow that their weighty discourses be reduced to common speech so that even the vulgar may read it and haply here and there fathom their very thought itselfand the bishops the great prelates to submit their ideas to the vulgar hand of a common printer framing them into mere sentences tis unthinkable that they would sanction it  aye murmured caxton in his dreaming voice the time shall come master edward when they will not only sanction it but seek it  look you broke in master nick let us have done with this talk whether there be enough happenings or not enoughand here he spoke with a kindling eye and looked about him at the little group of apprentices and printers who had drawn near to listen if there be not enough then will i make things happen  what is easier than to tell of happenings forth of the realm of which no man can knowsome talk of the grand turk and the war that he makes or some happenings in the new land found by master columbus aye he went on warming to his words and not knowing that he embodied in himself the first birth on earth of the telegraphic editorand why not one day we write it out on our sheet the grand turk maketh disastrous war on the bulgars of the north and hath burnt divers of their villages and that hath no sooner gone forth than we print another sheet saying it would seem that the villages be not burnt but only scorched nor doth it appear that the turk burnt them but that the bulgars burnt divers villages of the turk and are sitting now in his mosque in the city of hadrian then shall all men run to and fro and read the sheet and question and ask is it thus and is it thus and by very uncertainty of circumstances they shall demand the more curiously to see the news sheet and read it  nay nay master nick said brenton firmly that will i never allow let us make it to ourselves a maxim that all that shall be said in this news sheet or news paper as my conceit would fain call it for be it not made of paper here a merry laugh of the apprentices greeted the quaint fancy of the master shall be of ascertained verity and fact indisputable  should the grand turk make war and should the rumour of it come to these isles then will we say the turk maketh war and should the turk be at peace then we will say the turk it doth appear is now at peace and should no news come then shall we say in good sooth we know not whether the turk destroyeth the bulgars or whether he doth not for while some hold that he harasseth them sorely others have it that he harasseth them not whereby we are sore put to it to know whether there be war or peace nor do we desire to vex the patience of those who read by any further discourse on the matter other than to say that we ourselves are in doubt what be and what be not truth nor will we any further speak of it other than this  those about caxton listened with awe to this speech they did notthey could not knowthat this was the birth of the leading article but there was something in the strangely fascinating way in which their chief enlarged upon his own ignorance that foreshowed to the meanest intelligence the possibilities of the future  nicholas shook his head  tis a poor plan master brenton he said the folk wish news give them the news the more thou givest them the better pleased they are and thus doth the news sheet move from hand to hand till it may be said if i too may coin a phrase to increase vastly its circulation  in sooth said master brenton looking at nicholas with a quiet expression that was not exempt from a certain slyness there i do hold thou art in the wrong even as a matter of craft or policie for it seems to me that if our paper speaketh first this and then that but hath no fixed certainty of truth sooner or later will all its talk seem vain and no man will heed it but if it speak always the truth then sooner or later shall all come to believe it and say of any happening it standeth written in the paper therefore it is so and here i charge you all that have any part in this new venture continued master brenton looking about the room at the listening faces and speaking with great seriousness let us lay it to our hearts that our maxim shall be truth and truth alone let no man set his hand to aught that shall go upon our presses save only that which is assured truth in this way shall our venture ever be pleasing to the most high and i do verily believeand here caxtons voice sank lower as if he were thinking aloudin the long run it will be mighty good for our circulation  the speaker paused then turning to the broad sheet before him he began to scan its columns with his eye the others stood watching him as he read  what is this master edward he queried presently here i see in this first induct or column as one names it the word king fairly and truly spelled lower down it standeth kyng and yet further in the second induct kynge and in the last induct where there is talk of his majestys marvelous skill in the french game of palm or tennis lo the word stands quhyngge how sayeth thou  wouldst have it written always in but one and the same way asked the printer in astonishment  aye truly said caxton  with never any choice or variation to suit the fancy of him who reads so that he who likes it written king may see it so and yet also he who would prefer it written in a freer style or quhyngge may also find it so and thus both be pleased  that will i never have said master brenton firmly dost not remember friend the old tale in the fabula of aesopus of him who would please all men here will i make another maxim for our newspaper all men we cannot please for in pleasing one belike we run counter to another let us set our hand to write always without fear let us seek favour with none always in our news sheet we will seek to speak dutifully and with all reverence of the king his majesty let us also speak with all respect and commendation of his majestys great prelates and nobles for are they not the exalted of the land also i would have it that we say nothing harsh against our wealthy merchants and burgesses for hath not the lord prospered them in their substances yea friends let us speak ever well of the king the clergy the nobility and of all persons of wealth and substantial holdings but beyond thishere brenton coxtons eye flashedlet us speak with utter fearlessness of all men so shall we be if i may borrow a mighty good word from tacitus his annals of a complete independence hanging on to no man in fact our venture shall be an independent newspaper  the listeners felt an instinctive awe at the words and again a strange prescience of the future made itself felt in every mind here for the first time in history was being laid down that fine fearless creed that has made the independent press what it is  meantime caxton continued to glance his eye over the news sheet murmuring his comments on what he sawah vastly fine master nicholasthis of the sailing of his majestys ships for spainand this too of the doge of venice his death tis brave reading and maketh a fair discourse here also this likes me tis shrewdly devised and here he placed his finger on a particular spot on the news sheethere in speaking of the strange mishap of my lord arundel thou useth a great s for strange and setteth it in a line all by itself whereby the mind of him that reads is suddenly awakened alarmed as it were by a bell in the night tis good tis well but mark you friend nicholas try it not too often nor use your great letters too easily in the case of my lord arundel it is seemly but for a mishap to a lesser person let it stand in a more modest fashion  there was a pause then suddenly caxton looked up again  what manner of tale is this what strange thing is here in faith master nicholas whence hast thou so marvelous a thing the whole world must know of it harken ye all to this  let all men that be troubled of aches spavins rheums boils maladies of the spleen or humours of the blood come forthwith to the sign of the red lantern in east cheap there shall they find one that hath a marvelous remedy for all such ailments brought with great dangers and perils of the journey from a far distant land this wonderous balm shall straightway make the sick to be well and the lame to walk rubbed on the eye it restoreth sight and applied to the ear it reviveth the hearing tis the sole invention of doctor gustavus friedman sometime of gottingen and brought by him hitherwards out of the sheer pity of his heart for them that be afflicted nor shall any other fee be asked for it save only such a light and tender charge as shall defray the cost of doctor friedman his coming and going  caxton paused and gazed at master nicholas in wonder whence hadst thou this  master nicholas smiled  i had it of a chapman or travelling doctor who was most urgent that we set it forth straightway on the press  and is it true asked caxton thou hast it of a full surety of knowledge  nicholas laughed lightly  true or false i know not he said but the fellow was so curious that we should print it that he gave me two golden laurels and a new sovereign on the sole understanding that we should set it forth in print  there was deep silence for a moment  he payeth to have it printed said caxton deeply impressed  aye said master nicholas he payeth and will pay more the fellow hath other balms equally potent all of these he would admonish or shall i say advert the public  so said caxton thoughtfully he wishes to make if i may borrow a phrase of albertus magnus an advertisement of his goods  even so said nicholas  i see said the master he payeth us we advert the goods forthwith all men buy them then hath he more money he payeth us again we advert the goods more and still he payeth us that would seem to me friend nick a mighty good busyness for us  so it is rejoined nicholas and after him others will come to advert other wares until belike a large part of our news sheetwho knows the whole of it perhaps shall be made up in the merry guise of advertisements  caxton sat silent in deep thought  but master caxtoncried the voice of a young apprentice a mere child as he seemed with fair hair and blue eyes filled with the native candour of unsullied youthis this tale true  what sayest thou warwick said the master printer almost sternly  good master is the tale of the wonderous balm true  boy said caxton master nicholas hath even said we know not if it is true  but didst thou not charge us pleaded the boy that all that went under our hand into the press should be truth and truth alone  i did said caxton thoughtfully but i spoke perhaps somewhat in overhaste i see that we must here distinguish whether this is true or not we cannot tell but it is paid for and that lifts it as who should say out of the domain of truth the very fact that it is paid for giveth it as it were a new form of merit a verity altogether its own  ay ay said nicholas with a twinkle in his shrewd eyes entirely its own  indeed so said caxton and here let us make to ourselves another and a final maxim of guidance all things that any man will pay for these we will print whether true or not for that doth not concern us but if one cometh here with any strange tale of a remedy or aught else and wishes us to make advertisement of it and hath no money to pay for it then shall he be cast forth out of this officina or office if i may call it so neck and crop into the street nay i will have me one of great strength ever at the door ready for such castings  a murmur of approval went round the group  caxton would have spoken further but at the moment the sound of a bell was heard booming in the street without  tis the great bell said caxton ringing out the hour of noon quick all of you to your task lay me the forms on the press and speed me the work we start here a great adventure mark well the maxims i have given you and god speed our task  and in another hour or so the prentice boys of the master printer were calling in the streets the sale of the first english newspaper    xviiin the good time after the war  footnote an extract from a london newspaper of 1916   house of commons report  the prime minister in rising said that he thought the time had now come when the house might properly turn its attention again to domestic affairs the foreign world was so tranquil that there was really nothing of importance which need be brought to the attention of the house members however would perhaps be glad to learn incidentally that a new and more comfortable cage had been supplied for the exgerman emperor and that the excrown prince was now showing distinct signs of intelligence and was even able to eat quite quietly out of his keepers hand members would be gratified to know that at last the hohenzollern family were able to abstain from snapping at the hand that fed them but he would now turn to the subject of home rule  here the house was seen to yawn noticeably and a general lack of interest was visible especially among the nationalist and ulster members a number of members were seen to rise as if about to move to the refreshment room mr john redmond and sir edward carson were seen walking arm in arm towards the door  the prime minister will the members kindly keep their seats we are about to hold a discussion on home rule members will surely recall that this form of discussion was one of our favourite exercises only a year or so ago i trust that members have not lost interest in the subject general laughter among the members and cries of cut it out what is it  the prime minister with some asperity  members are well aware what home rule meant it was a planor rather it was a schemethat is to say it was an act of parliament or i should say a bill in fact mr speaker i dont mind confessing that not having my papers with me i am unable to inform the house just what home rule was i think perhaps the exminister of munitions has a copy of last years bill  mr lloyd george rising with evident signs of boredom the house will excuse me i am tired i have been out all day aeroplaning with mr churchill and mr bonar law with a view to inspect the new national training camp i had the home rule bill with me along with the welsh disestablishment bill and the land bill and i am afraid that i lost the whole bally lot of them dropped them into the sea or something i hope the speaker will overlook the term bally it may not be parliamentary  mr speaker laughing tut tut never mind a little thing like that i am sure that after all that we have gone through together the house is quite agreed that a little thing like parliamentary procedure doesnt matter  mr lloyd george humbly still i am sorry for the term id like to withdraw it i separate or distinguish in any degree the men of ulster from the men of tipperary and the heart of belfast from the heart of dublin loud cheers  mr redmond springing forward and ill say this not i nor any man of ireland dublin belfast or connaught will ever set our hands or names to any bill that shall separate ireland in any degree from the rest of the empire work out if you like a new scheme of government if the financial clauses are intricate get one of your treasury clerks to solve them if theres trouble in arranging your excise on your customs settle it in any way you please but it is too late now to separate england and ireland weve held the flag of the empire in our hand we mean to hold it in our grasp forever we have seen its colours tinged a brighter red with the best of irelands blood and that proud stain shall stay forever as the symbol of the unity of irish and the english people  loud cheers ring through the house several members rise in great excitement all shouting and speaking together there is heard the voice of mr angus mccluskey member for the hebrides callingand yell no forget scotland me lad when you talk of unity do you mind the fortysecond and the london scottish in the trenches of the aisne wha carried the flag of the empire then unity ma friends yell never break it it may involve a wee bit sacrifice for scotland financially speaking ill no say no to a reveesion of the monetairy terms if ye suggest itbut for unitascotland and the empire now and forever  a great number of members have risen in their seats mr open ap owen glendower is calling aye and wales never forget wales mr trevelyan trendinning of cornwall has started singing and shall trelawney diewhile the deep booming of rule britannia from five hundred throats ascends to the very rafters of the house  the speaker laughing and calling for order while two of the more elderly clerks are beating with the mace on the tablegentlemen gentlemen i have a proposal to make i have just learned that there is at the alhambra in leicester square a real fine moving picture show of the entrance of the allies into berlin  lets all go to it we can leave a committee of the three youngest members to stay behind and draw up a new government for ireland even they cant go wrong now as to what we want  loud cheers as the house empties singing it was a long way to tipperary but the way lay through berlin
