26604380	the stokesley secret  by charlotte m yonge     chapter i    how can a pig pay the rent  the question seemed to have been long under consideration to judge by the manner in which it came out of the pouting lips of that sturdy young fiveyearold gentleman david merrifield as he sat on a volume of the great latin dictionary to raise him to a level with the teatable  long however as it had been considered it was unheeded on account of one more interesting to the general public assembled round the table  i say hallooed out a tall lad of twelve holding aloft a slice taken from the dish in the centre of the table i say what do you call this mary  bread and butter master sam replied rather pettishly the maid who had brought in the big black kettle  bread and butter  i call it bread and scrape solemnly said sam  it only has butter in the little holes of it not at the top miss fosbrook said in an odd pleading kind of tone a stout good humoured girl of thirteen with face hair and all a good deal like a nice comfortable apricot in a sunny place or a good respectable alderney cow  i think it would be better not to grumble susan my dear replied in a low voice a pleasant darkeyed young lady who was making tea but the boys at the bottom of the table neither heard nor heeded  mary mary quite contrary was sams cry in so funny a voice that miss fosbrook could only laugh is this bread and scrape the fare for a rising young family of genteel birth  oh with a pathetic grimace cried the prettyfaced though sandy haired henry the next to him in age if our beloved parents knew how their poor deserted infants are treated  a fine large infant you are hal exclaimed susan  im an infant youre an infant miss fosbrook is an infanta babby  for shame hal cried the more civilized sam clenching his fist  no no sam interposed miss fosbrook laughing your brother is quite right i am as much an infant in the eye of the law as little george  there i said i would cried henry didnt i sam  didnt you what asked susan not in the most elegant english  why martin greville twitted us with having a girl for a governess said henry he said it was a shame we should be taken in to think her grown up when she was not twenty and i said i would find out and now i have done it he cried triumphantly  everybody is quite welcome to know my age said miss fosbrook the colour rising in her cheek  i was nineteen on the last of april but i had rather you had asked me point blank henry than tried to find out in a sidelong way  henry looked a little surly and elizabeth a nicelooking girl who sat next to him and was nearest in age said oh but that would have been so rude miss fosbrook  rude but honest said miss fosbrook and susans honest eyes twinkled as much as to say i like that but she said i dont believe hal meant it  i dont care said sam  come mary this plate is donemore bread and butter dye hear not bread and gammon and he began the chant in which six voices joined till it became a roar pursuing mary down to the lower regions   thick butter and thin bread or it shall be thrown at marys head thick bread and thin butter is only fit for the ducks in the gutter   elizabeth looked appealingly at miss fosbrook but miss fosbrook was leaning back in her chair her handkerchief up to her mouth in fits of laughing seeing which the children bawled louder and louder and elizabeth only abstained from stopping her ears because she knew that was the sure way to be held fast and have it bellowed into them  little annie blundered in her eagerness upon   thick bread and thin butter   whereupon there was a general outcry  nanny likes thick bread and thin butter let her have it and sam henry and johnnie directed a whole battery of their remaining crusts towards her cup which would presently have been upset into her lap but for miss fosbrook who recovered herself and said gravely this must not be sam i shall send you away from the table if you do  sam wanted to see whether she would and threw the crust  sam she said very decidedly though there was a quiver in her voice as if she were frightened  sam looked up and did not move  oh miss fosbrook cried susan we were all just as bad  dont punish sam  it is time that sam should show that he has the feelings of a manly boy said miss fosbrook looking full at him  he knows that i must keep my word and that i have no strength to fight with himsam go and finish your tea on the windowseat  her clear brown eyes looked full at him as she spoke and all the young population watched to see what he would do  he hesitated a moment then took up his cup and plate and sat down in the window seat  miss fosbrook breathed freely and she had almost said thank you sam but she did not think this was the time and collecting herself she said fun is all very well and i hope we shall have plenty but we ought not to let it grow riotous and i dont think it was of a good sort when it was complaining of the food provided for us  the children were all rather subdued by what she said some felt a little cross and some rather ashamed and when mary brought back the dish replenished with slices no one said a word as to whether the butter were thick or thin  the silence seemed to david a favourable occasion for renewing the great question how does a pig pay the rent  there was a general giggle and again miss fosbrook was as bad as any  while david looking affronted tapped the table with the handle of his spoon and repeated i want to know  ill tell you davy man began henry first recovering  the pig is a very sagacious animal especially in hampshire and so he smells out wherever the bags of money are sown underground and digs them up with his nose  then he swings them on his back and gives a curl of his tail and a wink of his eye and lays them down just before the landlords feet and hes so cunning that not an inch will he budge till hes got the receipt with a stamp upon it on his snout  no now is that a true story cried little annie who was the only person except david grave enough to speak while sam exploding in the window called out why dont you know thats why pigs have rings in their noses   there was a lady loved a swine    honey says she ill give you a silver trough    hunks says he   continued hal that shows his disinterestedness  oh werry sagacious haminals is pigs  for shame hal cried elizabeth to confuse the children with such nonsense  why dont you think i know how the rent is paid  ive seen papa on rentday hundreds of times  but the pigs hal did you ever see the pigs  thousands of times  bringing bags of gold  o hal  hal  i want to know continued david who had been digesting the startling fact how the pig swings the bag on his back i dont think ours could do it  its a sort made on purpose said hal  made on purpose by mr henry merrifield said susan at last able to speak  dont believe one word david dear hal is laughing at you  but how does a pig do it asked david returning to the charge  why do you want to know my dear asked miss fosbrook  marys sister said so  i know exclaimed susan davy went out with the nursery children today and they went to see marys sister  her husband is drowned because he was a sailor and the mermaid went to south america and there are five little tiny children  of the mermaids cried harry  no no the mermaid was the ship and it was wrecked and they have noticing to live upon and she takes in washing and is such a nice woman  mamma said we might take them our old winter frocks and so david went there  and she said if she had a pig to pay the rent she should be quite happy said david  how could he  i suppose said miss fosbrook the pig would live on her garden stuff her cabbageleaves and potatoskins and that when he was fat she would sell him and pay the rent with the money  am i right sam you know i am a cockney  you could not be more right if you were a hampshire beg said sam jack higgins was her husbands name and a famous fellow he was he once rigged a little boat for me  and he sailed with papa once long ago added susan to which sam rejoined  more fool he to go into the merchant service and get drowned with nothing for his widow to live upon  i say cried hal why shouldnt we give her a pig  oh do earnestly exclaimed david  ill catch one broke from john and annie at once such lots as there are in the yard  you would catch it i believe said sam disdainfully while susan explained  no those are papas pigs  purday would not let you give them away  of course said henry that was only those little geese  i meant to make a subscription among ourselves and give her the pig and wont she be surprised  oh yes yes shouted the children lets do it all ourselves  ive got oneandthreepence and sixpence next saturday cried hal  and ive eightpence quoth annie  and ive a whole shilling said david  ive fourpence said johnnie  ive not much im afraid said susan feeling in her pocket with rather black looks  oh said sam everybody knows simple sukey never has a farthing in her pocket by any chance  yes but i have sam and with an air of great triumph susan held up threehalfpence whereat all the party screamed with laughter  well but bessie always has lots  shes as rich as a little jew come bet elizabeth elspeth betsy and bess what will you give what have you gotand one hand came on her shoulder and another on her arm but she shook herself free and answered rather crossly  donti cantive got something else to do with my money  oh you little stingy avaricious crab was the outcry beginning but miss fosbrook stopped it before elizabeth had time to make the angry answer that was rising on her lips  no my dears you must not tease her  each of you has a full right to use your own money as you may think best and it is not right to force gifts in this manner  shes a little affected pussycat said hal much annoyed i know what she wants it forto buy herself a ridiculous parasol like ida greville when she would see poor hannah higgins starving at her feet  elizabeth bit her lip and tossed up her head the tears were in her eyes but she made no answer  come never mind said sam shes as obstinate as a male when she gets a thing into her head  lets see what weve got without her ive only sevenpence  worse luck that i bought ball of string yesterday  the addition amounted to three shillings and elevenpence halfpenny a sum which looked so mighty when spread out chiefly in coppers on the windowseat that annie and david looked on it as capable of buying any amount of swine but sam looked rather blank at it and gazing up and down said but what does a pig cost  miss fosbrook what does a pig cost  miss fosbrook shook her head and laughed saying that she knew much less of pigs than they did and susan exclaiming theres purday in the court they all tumbled to the window one upon the top of the other  the window was a large heavilyframed sash with a deep windowseat and a narrow ledge within the sillas if made on purpose the first for the knees the second for the elbows of the gazers therefrom  as to the view it was into a walled kitchen court some high chestnut and lime trees just looking over the grey roofs of the offices  on the ground lay a big black newfoundland dog and a couple of graceful greyhounds one of them gnawing a bone cunningly watched by a keenlooking raven with his head on one side while peeping out from the bars of the bottlerack was the demure face of the sandy cat on the watch for either bones or sparrows  a stout stumpy shrewdlooking labourer in a short round frock high buskins an old wideawake short curly hair and a very large nose stood in front of the dairy door mixing a mess of warm milk for the young calves  purday  master purday roared nearly the whole young population above but he was so intent on his mixture that he went on as if he were deaf till a second explosion of purday  purday  i say made him turn up his face in an odd halfawake kind of manner  purday whats the price of a pig and what does a pig cost purday  what dye all holler at once for  a body cant hear a word was all the answer they got whereupon they all started together again and purday went on with his mixture as if they had been so many hens cackling  then sam got up his breath again and called alone purday and hal and susan by pats and pinches strangled the like outcry from annie and john so as to leave the field clear for the great question purday what does a pig cost  more than your voices up there sir growled purday making some laugh but henry cried impatiently  now purday we really do want to know what is the price of pigs  they was high last market began purday  i dont care if they were high or low said hal i want to know what money they cost  different pigs cost different prices quoth the oracle so sententiously that miss fosbrooks shoulders shook with laughing as she stood a little in the background of the eager heap in the window  a nice little pig such as youd give  hush hush hal its a secret cried susan  a pretty sort of secretknown to eight already and bawled out all over the yard said sam  but dont tell him what its for you can ask him without that  a nice little young pig said sam such as youd keep all the summer and fat in the winter  mind it aint for you purday cried hal  never fear my being disappointed sir said the freespoken purday with a twinkle of his eye which hal understood so well that he burst out  ah you think i can never do what i say i will but youll see purday if we dont give a pig to  he was screamed at and pulled into order and silence ere the words hannah higgins had quite come out and sam repeated his question  well said purday at last if pigs was reasonable you might get a nice little one to fat at kattern hill fair somewhere about ten shillings or maybe twelvesometimes more sometimes less  ten shillings  the community stood round and looked at one another at the notion of such an awful sum but hal was the first to cast a ray of hope on the gloom  kattern hill fair aint till midsummer and perhaps grandmamma will send us some money before that  if anybodys birthday was but coming  better save it out of our allowance said sam  how long is it to the fair  miss fosbrooks pocketbook declared it to be four weeks  well then said hal we three big ones have sixpence a week each thats six shillings leaving out stingy bess and the little ones threepence thats three times three is nine and three times nine is thirtysix thats three shillings and six is nine and very near four is fourteen  we shall do the pig yet  yes hal but if pigs are reasonable i am afraid three times nine never yet were so much so as to make thirtysix objected miss fosbrook  sam whistled  twentyseventhats three and twopenceits all the same said hal then at the scream of the rest at least two and threepence well any way theres plenty for piggywiggy and it shall be a jolly secret to delight hannah higgins and surprise papa and mamma hurrah  yes said sam but then nobody must have any fines  ay and sue must keep her money  that will be a wonder shouted harry  well ill try said susan  ill try not to have a single fine and ill not buy a single lump of sugarcandy for i do want poor hannah to have her pig  and so will we cried the younger ones with one voice  only added susan i must buy dickys canary seed  and i must have a queens head to write to mamma said annie  oh never mind that such trumpery as your letters are said hal mamma could say them by heart before she gets them  what does she care for them  little annie looked very deplorable  never mind my dear said miss fosbrook mammas always care for little girls letters and you are quite right to keep a penny for your stamp for heryou see hal this scheme will never come to good if you sacrifice other duties to it  henry twirled round impatiently  now suppose said miss fosbrook that we set up a treasury and put all in that we can properly afford and then break it open on the day before the fair and see how much we have  oh yes yes cried the children in raptures  will you help miss fosbrook said susan clasping her hands  i should like to do a very little if you will take this silver threepenny but i do not think it would be right for me to spare one penny more for all i can afford is very much wanted at home  what shall we have for treasury said hal looking round  i know cried susan  here in the babyhouse heres the toby lets put it inside him  the socalled babyhouse was an oldfashioned cupboard with glass doors where certain tender dolls and other curiosities playthings too frail to be played with and the like were ranged in good order and never taken out except when some one child was unwell and had to stay indoors alone  toby fillpot was a present from nurse freeman  it was a large mug representing a man with a red coat black hat and white waistcoat very short legs and topboots  the opening of the cup was at the top of his head and into this was dropped all the silver and pence at present mustered and computed to be about four shillings  and miss fosbrook youll not be cross about fines said johnnie looking coaxing  i hope i shall not be cross she answered but i do not engage to let you off any  i think having so good a use to put your money to should make you more careful against forfeiting it  yes said johnnie disconsolately  well i never get fined cried hal joyfully  except for running up stairs in dirty shoes said sam  oh theres no dirt now  let me see what are the fines said miss fosbrook  heres the list said susan and sighing she said im afraid i shall never do it  if bessie only would help  the fines of the stokesley schoolroom were these for delinquencies each value a farthing    for being dressed later than eight oclock for hair not properly brushed for coming to lessons later than five minutes after ten for dirty hands for being turned back twice with any lesson for elbows on the table for foolish crying for unnecessary words in lessontime for running up stairs in wet shoes for leaving things about   each of these bits of misbehaviour caused the forfeit of a farthing out of the weekly allowance  susan looked very gloomy over them but hal exclaimed never mind susie well do it all without you never fear  and now said sam i vote we have some fun in the garden  some readers may be disposed to doubt after this specimen whether the young merrifields could be really young ladies and gentlemen but indeed their birth might make them so for there had been squire merrifields at stokesley as long as stokesley had been a parish and those qualities of honour and good breeding that mark the gentleman had not been wanting to the elder members of the family  the father of these children was a captain in the navy and till within the last six years the children had lived near plymouth but when he inherited the estate they came thither and david and the two little ones had been born at stokesley  the property was not large and as captain merrifield was far from rich it took much management to give all this tribe of boys and girls a good education as well as plenty of bread and butter mutton and applepudding  there was very little money left to be spent upon ornament or upon pleasuring so they were brought up to the most homely dress suited to their station and were left entirely to the country enjoyments that spring up of themselves  company was seldom seen for papa and mamma had little time or means for visiting and a few morning calls and a little dining out was all they did which tended to make the young ones more shy and homely more free and rude more inclined to love their own ways and despise those of other people than if they had seen more of the world  they were a happy healthy set of children not faulty in essentials but it must be confessed a little wild rough and uncivil in spite of the code of fines    chapter ii    mrs merrifield had taught her children herself till samuel and henry began going to the curate for a couple of hours every day to be prepared for school  lessons were always rather a scramble so many people coming to speak to her and so many interruptions from the nursery and then came a time when mamma always was tired and papa used to come out and scold if the noises grew very loud indeed and was vexed if the children gave mamma any trouble of any kind next they were told they were to have a governessa sort of piece of finery which the little savages had always despisedand thereupon came miss fosbrook but before she had been a week in the house mamma was quite ill and in her bedroom and papa looked graver than he had ever done before and mr braddon the doctor came very often  and at last susan was called into mammas room and it was explained to her that mamma was thought so ill that she must go to be under a london doctor and would be away she could not tell how long so that meantime the children must all be left to miss fosbrook with many many injunctions to be good and obedient for hearing that they were going on well would be poor mammas only comfort  it was three days since captain and mrs merrifield had gone and miss fosbrook stood at the window gazing at the bright young green of the horsechestnut trees and thinking many various thoughts in the lull that the children had left when they rushed out of doors  she thought herself quite alone and stood sometimes smiling over the odd ways of her charges and at what they put her in mind of sometimes gravely thinking whether she had said or done the wisest things for them or what their mother would have most approved  she was just going to move away from the window when she saw a little figure curled up on the floor with her head on the windowseat bessie my dear what are you doing here  why are not you gone out  i dont want to go out  i thought they were to have a great game at whoophide  i dont like whoophide  johnnie pulls the clothes off my back  my dear i hope you are not staying in because they called you those foolish names  it was all in good humour  it was not kind said elizabeth her throat swelling  it was not true  perhaps not but you did not speak to give your reasons and who could tell how good they might be  ive a right to my secrets as well as they have said the little maiden  miss fosbrook looked kindly at her and she turned wistful eyes on the young governess  miss fosbrook will you keep a secret  that i will  i want my money to buy some cardboardand some ribbonand some real true paints  ive got some vermilion but i want some real good blue  and then i want to make some beautiful bands with tieslike what papa has for his lettersfor all mammas letters in her desk theres a bundle of papas when he was gone out to the crimean war and thats to have a frigate on it because of the calliopehis ship you know and theres one bundle of dear aunt sarahsthats to have a rose because i always think her memory is like the rose in my hymn you know and grandmamma shes to havei think perhaps i could copy a bit of the tower of westminster abbey out of the print because one sees it out of her window and oh i thought of so many more but you see i cant do it without a real good paintbox and that costs three and sixpence  now miss fosbrook is it stingy to wish to do that  not at all my dear but you could not expect the others to understand what they never were told  id have said something if they had not called me stingy said bessie  it certainly was rude and hasty but if we bear such things good naturedly they become better and they were very eager about their own plan  such a disagreeable thing as a pig continued bessie  if it had been anything nice i should not have minded so much  yes but my dear you must remember that the pig will be a more useful present than even your pretty contrivances  you cannot call them doing good as the other will be  then you are like them  you think i ought to spend all my money on a great horrid pig when mamma and the tears were in the little girls eyes  no indeed my dear  i dont think anyone is called on to give their all and it is very nice and quite right for a little girl to try to make a pretty present to please her mamma  there is plenty of time before you and i think you will manage to have some share in the very kind action your brothers and sisters are contriving  elizabeth had not forgiven as she should have done the being called stingy it rankled on her feelings far more than those who said the word understood and she presently went on if they knew ever so much they would only laugh at me and call it all bessies nonsense miss fosbrook please what is affectation  i believe it is pretending to seem what we are not by nature said miss fosbrook putting on manners or feelings that do not come to us of themselves  then i shall tell them they make me affected exclaimed she  if i like to be quiet and do things prettily they teaze me for being affected and im forced to be as plain and blunt as their are and i dont like it  i wish i was grown up  i wish i was ida greville  and why my dear  because then things might be pretty said elizabeth  everything is so plain and ugly and one gets so tired of it  is it silly to like things to be pretty  no far from it that is if we do not sacrifice better things to prettiness  elizabeth looked up with a light in her dark eyes and said miss fosbrook i like you  miss fosbrook was very much pleased and kissed her  she paused a moment and then said miss fosbrook may i ask one question  what is your name  mamma said it must be charlotte because you signed your letter ch a fosbrook but your little sisters letter that you showed us began my dear bell  if it is a secret indeed i will keep it  it is no secret at all said miss fosbrook laughing  my name is christabel angela  elizabeth opened her eyes and said it by syllables  christabel angela thats a prettier name than ida  does it make you very glad to have it  i like it for some reasons said miss fosbrook smiling  oh tell me cried bessie  mamma always says we should not be a bit happier if our names were pretty ones but i dont know i feel as if one would only the others like to make things plainer and uglier than they are  i never could call your name ugly it is such a dignified old respectable name  yes but they call me betty  and they call me bell and sometimes jellybag and currantjelly said miss fosbrook laughing and sighing for she would have liked to have heard those funny names again  then it is no good to you exclaimed elizabeth  i dont know that we talk of good in such a matter  i like my name because of the reason it was given to me  oh why eagerly asked the little girl  when i was born my papa was a very young man and he was very fond of reading poetry  why i thought your papa was a doctor  well  i thought only ladies and poets and idle silly people cared for poetry  they can hardly be silly if they care rightly for real poetry bessie said miss fosbrook at least so my papa would say  it has been one of his great helps  well in those days he was very fond of a poem about a lady called christabel who was so good and sweet that when evil came near it could not touch her so as to do her any harm and so he gave his little daughter her name  how very nice cried elizabeth  you must not envy me my dear for i have been a good deal laughed at for my pretty name and so has papa and i do not think he would have chosen anything so fanciful if he had been a little older  then isnt hewhat is it you call itpoetical now  indeed he is in a good way and as the earnest eyes looked so warmly at her christabel fosbrook could not help making a friend of the little maiden  he has very little time to read it for you know he is a parish surgeon in a great parish in london full of poor people worse off than you can imagine and often very ill  he is obliged to be always hard at work in the narrow close streets there and to see everything sad and dismal and disagreeable that can be found but do you know bessie he always looks for the good and beautiful side he looks at one persons patience and another persons kindness and at some little childs love for its mother or sister that hinders it from being too painful for him  but is that poetry  i thought poetry meant verses  verses are generally the best and most suitable way of expressing our feelings about what is good and beautiful but they are not always poetry any more than the verses they sang tonight about the bread and butter because you know wanting thick butter was not exactly a beautiful feeling  i think the denying themselves their little indulgences for the sake of giving the poor woman a pig is much more poetical though nobody said a word in verse  they both laughed and elizabeth said that wasnt what you meant about your papa  susy cares for goodness  no it was not all i meant but it was seeing high and noble thoughts expressed in beautiful verses that gives him pleasure and when he has a little bit of leisure it is his great treat to open a book of that sort and read a little bit to us and tell us why we like it  he says it makes him young again and takes him out of the dingy streets and from all his cares as to how the bills are to be paid  did you like coming here was bessies home question and miss fosbrook winked away a little moisture as she said  i was glad to be growing a woman and to be able to help about some of those bills and then i was glad to come into the beautiful country that papa has so often told us about  i did not know there was anything beautiful here  o bessie you never lived in london  you cant think how many things are beautiful to me here  i want to be writing about them to papa and kate all day long  are they said bessie  mamma has pretty things in the drawing room but she keeps them out of the way and everything here is so dull and stupid and the little girl gave a yawn  miss fosbrook understood her  the wainscoted room in which they were sitting had been painted of a uniform creamy brown the chairs were worn the table was blistered and cracked the carpet only covered the middle of the room and was so threadbare that only a little red showed here and there  all that was needful was there but of the plainest kind and where the other children only felt ease and freedom and were the more contented and happy for the homely good sense of all around them this little girl felt a want that she scarcely understood but which made her uncomfortable and discontented even when she had so much to be thankful for  miss fosbrook moved nearer to the window  down below there was certainly not much to be seen only pierce cleaning the knives in the knifehouse and martha washing out her pans before the dairydoor but that was not where she looked  she turned the little half fretful face upwards  look there she said and talk of seeing nothing pretty  i see nothing  do you not see the pale clear green of those noble horsechestnut leaves just sprung into their full summer dressnot in the least worn nor stained yet  and those fine spikes of white blossom all tending upupwhile the masses of those leaves fall so gracefully down as if lifting them up and then falling back to do them honour  bessie smiled and her eye lighted up  and see the colour against the skylook at the contrast of that bright light green with the blue so very deep of the skyand oh see that train of little clouds red with soft sunny light like a little soft flock of rosy lambs if there were such things lying across the sky o bessie you cant talk of wanting the sight of pretty things while you have that sky  bessie was coming closer to her when in burst sam and johnnie  hello bess moping here i declare  i suppose you and miss fosbrook are telling each other all your secrets  i was just coming out said miss fosbrook  i want to make out something about those noble flowers of the horsechestnut and why they dont look whiter  could you gather one for me sam  sam was only too glad of an excuse for climbing a tree however cheaply he might hold one who cared for flowers and by the time bessie had put on her lilacspotted sunbonneta shapeless article it must be confessed with a huge curtain serving for a tippet very comfortable and no trouble at allhe had scrambled into the fork and brought down a beautiful spire of blossoms with all the grand leaves hanging round in their magnificent fans  what will you do with it said the children standing round  do you think you could ask mary to spare us a jug susan  if i might put it in water in the schoolroom fireplace it would look fresh and cheerful for sunday  oh yes said susan pleased with the commission that i will and away she ran while miss fosbrook examined the spike to her own great enjoyment  i see she said the flowers are not really white they each have a patch of pink or yellow on them which gives them their softness  yes and do you see bessie they are in clusters of three and each three has one flower with a pink spot and two with a yellow one  that is very curious said bessie  the fretfulness was very much gone out of her tone and she stood looking at the beautiful flower without a word till susan came back when she began to show her what miss fosbrook had pointed out  susan smiled with her really good nature and said how funny but was more intent on telling miss fosbrook that she had brought the jug and then on hauling elizabeth away to a game at tom tittlers ground  miss fosbrook said she would put away the flower and come back again and she settled the branch in the chimney where it looked very graceful and really did enliven the room and then walked out towards the lawn  there was a lawn in front of the house part of which had been formerly levelled for a bowlinggreen and was kept clear of shrubs or flowerbeds  beyond was a smooth rather rapid slope towards a quiet river beyond which there rose again a beautiful green field crowned above by a thick wood ending at the top in some scraggy pinetrees with scanty dark foliage at the top of their rude russet arms  fine trees stood out here and there upon the slope of the field and captain merrifields fine sleeked cows were licking each other or chewing the cud under them  there was a white chinese bridge the rails all zigzags and patterns running this way and that so that it must have been very ugly and glaring before the white paint had faded so much  the house was a respectable old stone building rather brown and grey and the stone somewhat disposed to peel off in flakes the windows large sashes set in great projecting squared stones the tallest and biggest at the top  it was a house of a very sober pleasant countenance that looked as if it had always been used to have a large family in it and there was a vine with all its beauteous leaves trained all across the garden front making a pleasant green summerblind over the higher half of the drawingroom windows that now stood open telling of the emptiness within  christabel stood for a few moments looking round and thinking what a paradise of green rest this would be to her hardworked father and anxious mother and how she should like to see her little brothers and sisters have one free run and roll on that delicious greensward instead of now and then walking to one of the parks as a great holiday  yet hers was a very happy home and except her being absent from it nothing had befallen her to sadden her merry young spirits so when she heard the joyous cry behind her    im on tommy tittlers ground picking up gold and silver   she turned about and laughed as she saw the goldfinders stooping and clawing at the grass with eyes cast round about them for hal who was pursuing susan in and out up and down till with screams of exultation she was safely across the ridge of the bowlinggreen that served as home  when hal turned back miss fosbrook was as heedfully and warily picking up gold and silver as any of the rest of them  he was resolved on capturing her but first david was such a tempting prize with his back so very near and so unconscious that he must be made prisoner  a catch at the brownholland blousea crya shout of laughter and davy is led up behind the standard maidenblush rose always serving as the prison  and now the tug of war rages round it he darts here and there within his bounds holding out his hand to any kind deliverer whose touch may set him free and all the others run backwards and forwards trying to circumvent the watchful jailor tom tittler who in front of the rosebush flies instantly at whoever is only coming near his captive  ha  susan had nearlyall but done it while hal was chasing away annie  no not she hal is back again and with a shriek away she scours  sam oh he is very near if that stupid little davy would only look round he would be free in another moment but he only gapes at the pursuit of susan and sam will touch him without his being aware  noheres hal back again  sams off  what a scamper nows the timeheres miss fosbrook lighterfooted than any of the children softly stealing on tiptoe while hal is scaring johnnie her fingers just touch davys  freed  freed is the cry and off goes he pounding for home but hal rushes across the path he intercepts miss fosbrook and with a shout of triumphthere is the sound of a rent  everybody stands a little aghast  it is only the gathers says miss fosbrook goodhumouredly  ill tuck them up and sew them in by and by but really hal you need not pull so furiously i would have yielded to something short of that  gowns are such stuff said hal really meaning it for an apology though it did not sound like one for her goodnatured face abashed him a little  touch and take used to be our rule said miss fosbrook  bessie eagerly said that would be the best way the boys were so rude but all the rest with one voice cried out that it would be very stupid and miss fosbrook did not press it but only begged in a droll way that some one would take pity on her and come to release her and so alert was she in skipping towards her allies from behind the rosebush that bessie presently succeeded in giving the rescuing touch and she flew back quick as a bird to the safe territory dragging bessie with her who otherwise would have assuredly been caught and who warm with the spirit of the game felt as if she should have been quite glad to be made prisoner for her dear christabels sake  an hour after and all the children were in bed  susan and annie agreeing that a governess was no such great bother after all and elizabeth lying awake to whisper over to herself christabel angela christabel angela  thats my secret in a sort of dream of pleasure that will make most people decide on her being a very silly little girl  and christabel angela herself sat mending her gathers and thinking over her first week of far greater difficulties than she had contemplated when she had left home with the understanding that she was to be entirely under mrs merrifields direction  poor mrs merrifield had said much of regret at leaving her to such a crew of little savages and she had only tried to set the mothers mind at rest by being cheerful and though she felt that it was a great undertaking to manage those great boys out of lessonhours she knew that when a thing cannot be helped strength and aid is given to those who seek for it sincerely  and on the whole she felt thankful to the children for having behaved even as well as they had done    chapter iii    grant to us thy humble servants that by thy holy inspiration we may think those things that be good and by thy merciful guiding may perform the same spelt out david with some trouble and difficulty as he stood by miss fosbrook on sunday morning  miss fosbrook  well my dear  miss fosbrook  another well  is wanting to buy a pig one of the things that be good  anything kind and right is good my dear said miss fosbrook a little vexed at a sort of snorting she heard from the other end of the room  davy thinks the pig is in his collect said sam  he was one of those who were especially proud of being downright and in him it often amounted to utter regardlessness of peoples feelings yet not out of illnature and when susan responded dont teaze davyhe cant bear it he was silent but the mischief was done and when miss fosbrook went on saying that the wish to help the poor woman was assuredly a good thought which the little boy might well ask to be aided in fulfilling david had grown ashamed and would not listen  but the mention of the pig had set off master henry who was sitting up in the windowseat with annie also learning the collect and he burst out into descriptions of the weight of money that would be found in toby and how he meant to go to the fair with purday and help him to choose the pig and drive it home  more likely to hinder muttered sam  besides papa wouldnt let you added bessie but hal did not choose to hear and went on as to how the pig should ran away with purday and jump into a stall full of parliament gingerbread whereat annie fell into convulsions of laughing and hal should be the first to stop it and jump on its back and ride out of the fair holding it by the ears and then they should pop it into the sty unknown to hannah higgins and all lie in wait to hear what would happen and when it squealed she would think it the baby crying but there susan burst out at the notion of any one thinking a child could scream like a pig taking it as an affront to all babyhood and miss fosbrook took the opportunity of saying  hadnt you better hatch your chickens before you count them henry if you prevent everyone from learning the collect i fear there will be the less hope of mr piggy  oh we dont have fines on sundays said henry  mamma says that on sundays naughtiness is not such a trifle that we can be fined for it said susan  it is not naughtiness we are ever fined for added elizabeth that we are punished and talked to for  but the fines are only for bad habits  oh  i hope i shant have any this week sighed susan  you may hope said sam  youre sure of them for everything possible except crying  yes bessie gets all the crying fines said hal and i hope shell have lots because she wont help the pig  bessie started up from her place and rushed out of the room while miss fosbrook indignantly exclaimed  really boys i cant think how you can be so illnatured  they looked up as though it were quite a new light to them and susan exclaimed  oh miss fosbrook they dont mean it  sam and hal never were ill natured in their lives  i dont know what you call illnatured said miss fosbrook unless it is saying the very things most likely to vex another  i dont mean to vex anybody said henry only we always go on so and nobody is such a baby as to mind except bessie  and sam muttered one cant be always picking ones words  i am not going to argue about it said miss fosbrook and it is time to get ready for church  only i thought manliness was shown in kindness to the weak and avoiding what can pain them  she went away and susan was the first to exclaim  i didnt think shed have been so cross  stuff sue said sam its not being cross  i like her for having a spirit but one cant be finikin and mealymouthed to suit her london manners  i like the truth  it would have been well if any one had been by to tell mr samuel that truth of character does not consist in disagreeable and uncalledfor personalities  miss fosbrook did not wonder at little elizabeth for her discomfort under the rude homeliness of stokesley where the children made a bad copy of their fathers sailor bluntness and the difficulties of money matters kept down all indulgences  she knew that captain merrifield was as poor a man for an esquire as her father was for a surgeon and that if he were to give his sons an education fit for their station he must make his household live plainly in every way but without thinking them right feelings she had some pity for little bessies weariness and discontent in never seeing anything pretty  the three girls came in dressed for church in the plainest brown hats black capes and drab alpaca frocks rather long and not very full not a coloured bow nor handkerchief not a flounce nor fringe to relieve them even their books plain brown  bessie looked wistfully at miss fosbrooks pretty churchservice and said she and susan both had beautiful prayerbooks but mamma said they could not be trusted with them yetida greville had such a beauty  was it the effect of miss fosbrooks words that sam forbore to teaze bessie about ida grevillewhose name was a very dangerous subject in the schoolroom  also he let bessie take hold of miss fosbrooks hand in peace though in general the least token of affection was scouted by the whole party  it was a pretty walk to church over a paddock where the cows were turned out and then along a green lane and the boys had been trained enough in sunday habits to make them steady and quiet on the way especially as henry was romancing about the pig  by and by elizabeth gave miss fosbrooks hand a sudden pull and she perceived in the village street into which they were emerging a party on the way to church  there were two ladies one in stately handsome slight mourning the other more quietly dressed and two or three boys but what elizabeth wanted her to look at was a little girl of nine years old who was walking beside the lady  her hat was black chip edged and tied with rosecoloured ribbon and adorned with a real bird with glass eyes black plumage except the red crest and wings  she wore a neatlyfitting little fringed black polka beneath which spread out in fanlike folds her flounced pink muslin coming a little below her knees and showing her worked drawers which soon gave place to her neat stockings and dainty little boots  she held a small white parasol bordered with pink and deeply fringed over her head and held a goldclasped prayer book in her hand and miss fosbrook heard a little sigh which told her that this was the being whom elizabeth merrifield thought the happiest in the world  she hoped it was not all for the fine clothes and sam muttered  what a little figure of fun  martin and osmond greville went daily to mr careys like sam and hal so the boys ran on to them and mrs greville turning round showed a very pleasant face as she bowed to miss fosbrook and shaking hands with susan and elizabeth asked with much solicitude after their mamma and how lately they had heard of her  susan was too simple and straightforward to be shy and answered readily that they had had letters and mamma had been sadly tired by the journey but was better the next day  the little girls shook hands and mrs greville made a kind of introduction by nodding towards her companion and murmuring something about fraulein munsterthal and miss fosbrook found herself walking beside a lady with the least of all bonnets a profusion of fair hair and a good humoured onecoloured face no doubt miss idas german governess she said something about the fine day and received an answer but what it was she could not guess whether german french or english and her own knowledge of the two first languages was better for reading than for speaking so after an awkward attempt or two she held her peace and looked at her companions  susan and mrs greville seemed to be getting on very well together but elizabeths admiration of ida seemed to be speechless for they were walking side by side without a word perhaps too close to their elders to talk  annie and david were going on steadily hand in hand a little way off and miss fosbrook chiefly heard the talk of the boys who had fallen behind perhaps her ears were quickened by its personality for though sam was saying ill tell you what shes a famous fellow the rejoinder was what do you mean to say that you mind her  doesnt he said hals voice why she sent him away from tea last night just for shying crusts  and did he go and there was a disagreeable sounding laugh in which she was sorry that hal joined  catch the fraulein serving me so  she never tries  she knows better  i say sam i thought you had more spirit  youll be sitting up pricking holes in a frill by the time the captain comes back  and hal will be mincing along with his toes turned out like a dancingmaster continued an affected voice  no such thing cried hal angrily  im not a fellow to be ordered about  the grevilles laughed and one of them said well then why dont you show it  id soon send her to the rightabout if she tried to interfere with me  miss fosbrook could bear it no longer and facing suddenly round looked the speaker full in the face and said i am very much obliged to youbut you should not speak quite so loud  the boys shrank back out of countenance and sam who alone had not spoken looked up into her face with a merry air as if he were gratified by her spirited way of discomfiting them  osmond tried to recover and muttered what a sell rather impudently but they were now near the churchyard and mrs greville turning round all was hushed  christabel felt much vexed that all this should have happened just before going into church she felt a good deal ruffled herself and feared that bessies head was filled with nonsense if hals were not with something worse  the church looked pretty outside with the old weatherboarded wooden belfry rising above the tiled roof and western gable and it was neatly kept but not pretty within the walls all done over with pale buff wash and the woodwork very clumsy  sam and susan behaved well and attentively but bessie fidgeted into her mammas place and would stand upon a hassock  miss fosbrook was much afraid it was to keep in sight of the beautiful bird  hal yawned and johnnie not only fidgeted unbearably himself but made his sister annie do the same till miss fosbrook scarcely felt as if she was at church and made up her mind to tell johnnie that she should leave him at home with the babies unless he changed his ways  little david went on most steadily with his prayerbook and scarcely looked off it till the sermon when he fell asleep  miss fosbrook had one pleasure as she was going home  the children had all gone on some steps before her chattering eagerly among themselves when sam turned back and said abruptly miss fosbrook you didnt mind that i hope  what those boys were saying it depends on you whether you make me mind it  i dont mean to make any rows if i can help it said sam  i am sure i hope you will be able to help it  i dont know what i should do if you did  sam gave an odd smile with his honest face  well youve got a good spirit of your own  it would take something to cow you  pray dont try  sam laughed and said i did promise papa to be conformable  and i was very much obliged to you yesterday evening  the behaviour of the other boys depends so much on you  yes i know said sam and i dont mind it so much now i see you can stand up for yourself  besides what would it be if i had to write to your father that i could not manage such a beargarden  ill take care that shant happen exclaimed sam  it would hinder all the good to mamma  ill tell you what he added after a confidential pause if we get beyond you theres mr carey  i thought you did not mean to get beyond me  sam looked a little disconcerted and it struck her that though he would not say so he was doubtful whether the greville influence might not render henry unmanageable but he quickly gave it another turn  only you must not plague us about london manners  i dont know what you mean by london manners  do you mean not bawling at tea for i mean to insist upon that i assure you and i want you to help me  oh not being finikin and mincing and nonsensical  i hope im not so said miss fosbrook laughing heartily but ill tell you one thing sam that i do wish you would leave offand that is teazing  i dont know whether that is country manners but i dont like to see a sensible kind fellow like you just go out of your way to say something mortifying to a younger one  you dont know said sam  it is fun  they like it  if they really like it there is no objection  i know i should like very much to have my brother here quizzing me but you know very well there are two sorts of such fun and one that is only sport to the stronger side  bessie is so ridiculous  she is the very one i want to protect  i dont think that teazing her does any good it only gives her cross feelings  and she really has more right on her side than you think  you might be just as honest and bold if you were less rude and bearish  i cant bear to see her so affected and perked up  it is not affectation  she is really more gentle and quiet than you are you dont think it so in your mamma and she is like her  mamma is not like bessie  and then about davy  how could you go and stop the poor little boy when he was trying to think and feel rightly  he was so funny repeated sam  i hope you will think another time whether your fun is safe and kind  one cant be so particular he said impatiently  i am sorry to hear it  i thought the only way to do right was to be particular  he grunted and flung away from her  she was vexed to have sent him off in such a mood but unmannerly as he was she saw so much good in him that she could not but hope he would be her friend and ally  dinner went off very peaceably and then susan fetched her two darlings from the nursery george and sarah of three years and eighteen months old  her great perfection was as a motherly elder sister and even sam was gentle to these little things and played with them very nicely  miss fosbrook reminded hal of his collect but he observed that there was plenty of time and continued to stand by the window pursuing the flies with his finger not killing them but tormenting them and david very seriously by making them think he wouldnot a very pretty business for the day when all things should be happy more like that which is always found for idle hands to do  evening servicetime put an end to this sport but miss fosbrook could not set off till after a severe conflict with johnnie  she had decreed that he should not go again that day after his behaviour in the morning and perhaps he would not have minded this punishment much if david had not been going which made him think it a disgrace so in the most independent manner be put on his hat and was marching off when miss fosbrook stood in front of him and ordered him back  he repeated im going to church  it was plain enough that he had heard what those boys had said about not submitting  church is not the place to go to in a fit of wilfulness johnnie she said and his sisters broke out o johnnie but the naughty boy fancying perhaps that want of time would lead to his getting his own way marched on sticking up his toes very high in the air  hal laughed  johnnie johnnie dear entreated susan what would mamma say  john would not hear and walked on  john said miss fosbrook if you do not come back directly i must carry you  she had measured her strength with his  he was only eight years old and she believed that she could carry him but he heard the church bells ringing and thought he should have his way  she laid hold of him and he began fighting and kicking in stout shoes whose thumps were no joke  she held fast but she felt frightened and doubtful of the issue of the struggle and again there was hal laughing  forshame henry burst out sam and the same moment those two feet were secured and john was a prisoner  miss fosbrook called out to the rest to go on to church and she and sam dragged the boy up to the nursery and shut him in there roaring passionately  nurse freeman knowing nothing about it could not believe but that the stranger lady had made her child naughty and said something about their mamma letting him go to church and when the child wished to go to church it seemed strange he should not  miss fosbrook would not defend herself for she was in great haste but sam exclaimed stuff he was as naughty as could be all this morning and only wanted to go now because he was told not  johnnie bellowed out something else but miss fosbrook would not let sam go on she touched his arm and drew him off with her he exclaiming foolish old freeman she will pet and spoil him all churchtime till he is worse than ever  it was lucky for her that she was too much hurried to dwell on this vexation she almost ran to save herself from being late and scarcely heard sams mutterings about wishing to break martin grevilles head  you need not hurry so much he said theres a shorter cut only i suppose you cant get through a gap  cant i she laughed and he led her on straight through the short horns  some of them looked at her more than she fancied but she knew she might give up all hopes of sam if he detected her fears then came the gap where a tree had been cut down in the hedge and such a jump down from it  but she gathered up her muslin and made her leap so gallantly that the boy cried  hurrah well done and came and walked close to her saying confidentially i say do you think we shall ever do the pig  i am sure it might be done  if you are likely to do it you must know better than i  i dont know that i much care about it  it will be rather a bother only now we have said it i shall hate it if we dont do it  i think the pleasure of giving it will be a delightful reward for a little selfcommand  only hal and the girls will make such a work about it  im glad after all that bessie has nothing to do with it or she would want to dress it up in flowers and ribbons  haha  but what a little crab it is  dont be too sure of that  people may have other designs  bessies cant be anything but trumpery  sometimes present trumpery is a step to something better  a was an archer is not very wise but it is the road to readingand even if it were not so sam it is not right to shame people into giving for what is not bestowed for the true reasons does no good to giver nor to receiver  sam looked up with a frown of attention as if he were trying to take in the new light but he did take it in and smacking his hands together with a noise like a pistolshot said ay thats it  we dont want what is grudged  miss fosbrook thought of words that would another time be more familiar to sam  not grudgingly nor of necessity for god loveth a cheerful giver  what she said was you see if you plague bessie too much to make her like ourselves when she is really so different you are driving her to the shamming you despise so much  but ought not she to be cured of being silly  when we have quite made up our minds upon what silliness is  there the bell has stopped    chapter iv    the most part of churchtime johnnie was eating nurse freemans plum cake  perhaps this did not make him any easier in the conscience but he had a very unlucky sentiment that as he was already naughty and in disgrace it was of no use to take the trouble of being good till he could make a fresh beginning and after what the grevilles had said he did not think that would be till papa and mamma came home he did not at all mean to give in to a girl that was not even twenty  so he would not turn to the only wise thing he could have done the learning of his collect but he teased nurse out of more cake and more and got what play he could out of little george and that was not much for johnnie was not in a temper to be pleasant with a little one  coming home from church collects were to be learnt and said before tea  but hal after glancing over his own took up his cap and said come along sam purday will be feeding the pigs i want to choose the size of ours  ive not done said sam  papa never said we were to say them to miss fosbrook  he meant it though was all sams answer  dont hinder me  well ive no notion of being bound by what people mean continued hal and no one could imagine the torment he made himself neither going nor staying arguing the matter with his elder brother as if sams coming would justify him and interrupting everyone till at last miss fosbrook gathered all her spirit and ordered him either to sit down and learn properly at once or to go quite away  she was very much vexed for henry had been the most obliging and good natured of all at first and likely to be fond of her but such a great talker could not fail to be weak and his vanity had been set against her  he looked saucy at first and much inclined to resist if he had seen any sympathy for him in sam he might have done so but miss fosbrooks steady eye was too much for him so he saved his dignity as he thought by exclaiming im sure i dont want to stay in this stuffy hole with such a set of owls i shall go to purday and off he marched  the others stayed and said their collects and catechism very respectably all but john who had not learned the collect at all and was sent into another room to finish it to which he made no resistance he had had enough of actual fighting with miss fosbrook  then she offered to read a story to the others but she found that this was distasteful even to her friend sam he thought it stupid to be read to and said he should see after hal david trotted after him and susan and anne repaired to the nursery to play with the little ones and the baby  she minded it the less as they all had some purpose but she had already been vexed to find that all but davy preferred the most arrant vacant idleness to anything rational to be sure susan sometimes bessie and hal always would read any book that made no pretensions to be instructive but even a fact about a lion or an elephant made them detect wisdom in disguise and throw it aside  she thought however she would make the most of bessie and asked whether she would like to hear reading or read to herself  to myself said bessie and there was a silence while miss fosbrook glad of the quiet began reading her christian year presently she heard a voice so low that it seemed at a distance and it made her start for it was saying christabel then she almost laughed for it seemed to have been an audacious experiment to judge by little elizabeths scared looks and the glow on her cheeks  may i say it sometimes when we are alone together she said timidly  i do like it so much  if it is such a pleasure to you i would not deprive you of it said miss fosbrook laughing but dont do so except when we are alone for your mamma would not like me to seem younger still  oh thank you  isnt it a nice secret cried bessie clinging to her hand  and will you let me hug you sometimes  a little love was pleasant to miss fosbrook when she was feeling lonely and she took bessie in her lap and they exchanged caresses to the damage of the collar that miss fosbrooks sister had worked for her  and you dont call me silly cried bessie  that depends was the answer with some arch fun but bessie had not much turn for fun and presently went on   and you saw ida greville  yes  what did you think of her  i had not much opportunity of learning what to think  but her parasol and her bird  did you think her mama very silly to give her pretty things  no certainly not unless she wore them at unsuitable times or thought too much about them  ida has so many she does not think of them at all  and she has shells and such a lovely workbox and picturebooks she has all she wants  are you quite sure  oh yes quite sure and they dont tease her for liking pretty things her brothers keep quite away and never bother about the schoolroom but she learns italian and german and drawing and singing  mr greville said something about our spending the day there  oh if we do but go  wont you miss fosbrook  if i am asked and if your mamma would wish it  oh mamma always lets us go except oncewhenwhen  when what  when i cried said elizabeth hanging down her head i couldnt help it  it did seem so tiresome here and she said i was learning to be discontented but nobody can help wishing can they  there must be a way of not breaking the tenth commandment  i dont covet i dont want to take things away from ida only to have the same  yes but what does the explanation at the end of the duty to our neighbour say filling out that commandment  i think ill go and see what susie is doing said elizabeth  christabel sighed as the little girl walked off displeased at having her repinings set before her in a graver light than that in which she had hitherto chosen to regard them  she saw no more of her charges till teatime when the bell brought them from different quarters johnnie with such a grimy collar and dirty hands that he was a very unsundaylike figure and she would have sent him away to make himself decent but that she was desirous of not overtormenting him  sunday was always celebrated by having treacle with the bread so the butter riot was happily escaped and bessie was not in a gracious mood and the corners of her mouth provoked the boys to begin on what they knew would make her afford them sport  hal first  i say bet didnt purday want his gun today at church  elizabeth put out her lip in expectation that something unpleasant was intended and other voices were not slow to ask an explanation  shooting the cockyolly birds  a general explosion of laughter  i say always the preface to the boys wit shall i get a jay down off the barn to stick into your hat betty  dont hal said such a deplorable offended voice that sam who had really held his tongue at first could not help chiming in  no no a cocksparrow for her london manners  no thats for me sam said christabel goodhumouredly  a londonbred sparrow a pert forward chit  she really had found a safetyvalve the boys were entertained and diverted from their attack on their favourite victim by finding everyone an appropriate bird and when they came to tomtits and dishwashers were so astonished at miss fosbrooks never having seen either that they instantly fell into the greatest haste to finish their tea and conduct her into the garden and through a course of birds eggs and nests about which as soon as she was assured that there was to be no birdsnesting she was very eager  bessie ought to have been thankful that her persecutors were called off but she was in a dismal mood and was taken with a fit of displeasure that her own christabel angela was following the rabble rout into the garden instead of staying in the schoolroom at her service  the reason of her gloom was that miss fosbrook had spoken a word that she did not choose to take home and yet which she could not shake off  so she would neither stay in nor go out cheerfully and sauntered along looking so piteous that johnnie could not help making her worse by plucking at her dress by suddenly twisting her cape round till the back was in front and pushing her hat over her eyes till dont johnnie in a dismal whine alternated with ill tell miss fosbrook  christabel did not see nor hear  she had gone forward with a boy on either side of her and susan walking backwards in front all telling the story of a cuckooor gowk as sara called it in purdays languagewhich they had found in a waterwagtails nest in a heap of stones how it sat up constantly gaping with its huge mouth while the poor little fosterparents toiled to their utmost to keep it supplied with caterpillars and the last time it was seen when fullfledged were trying to lure it to come out of the nest by holding up green palmers at some little distance before it  this was in the evening by morning it was gone having probably taken flight at sunrise  miss fosbrook listened with all the pleasure the boys could desire she had read natural history and looked at birds stuffed in the british museum or alive at the zoological gardens on the rare days when her father had time to give himself and his children a treat and her fresh value and interest in all these country things were delightful to the boys  it was a lovely summer evening  the sun was low enough to make the shadows long and refreshing as they lay upon the blooming grass of the wilderness softly swaying in the breeze all pale with its numerous chaffy blossoms and varied by the tall buttercups that raised up their shining yellow heads or by white clouds of bold faced oxeye daisies  the peartrees were like white garlands the appletrees covered with white blossoms and rosy buds the climbing roses on the wall were bursting into blossom the sky was one blue vault without a cloud  surely elizabeth had no lack here of what was pretty  then why did she lag behind unseeing unheeding of all but peevishly pushing off john and anne thinking that they always teased her worst on sundays and very much discomfited that miss fosbrook was not attending to her  surely the fault was not altogether in what was outside her  see cry the boys  miss fosbrook must first look up there high upon the side of the house niched behind that thick stem of the vine  what cant she see those round black eyes and little beak they see her plain enough  ah now she has them  thats a fly catcher  by and by they shall be able to show her the old birds flying round catching flies on the wing and feeding the young ones all perched in a row  now can she scramble up the laurels  yes she hopes so though she wished she had known what was coming for she would have changed her sunday muslin  but a look of anxiety came on sams face as he peeped into the clump of laurels he signed back the others sprang upon the dark scraggy bough of the tree and hal called out  gone has ralph been there  ay the black rascal at least i suppose so  not an egg left and they would have hatched this week  well purday calls him his best friend said harry  he says we should not get a currant or a gooseberry if it wasnt for that there raven as papa wont have the small birds shot  bring down the nest sam cried susan georgy will like to have it  the children behind who never could hear of anything to be had without laying a claim to it shouted that they wanted the nest but sam said sue had spoken first and they fell back discontented and more bent on their unkind sport  miss fosbrook was rather shocked at the tearing out the nest and asked if the old bird would not have another brood there but it was explained that a thrush would never return to a forsaken nest and when sam came down with it in his hand she was delighted with the wonderful cup that formed the lining so smooth and firm a bason formed of dried mud set within the grassy wall  she had thought that swallows alone built with mud and had to learn that the swallows used their clay for their outer walls and down for their lining whereas the thrush is a regular plasterer  sam promised her another thrush to make up for her disappointment and meantime conducted her to a very untidy old summerhouse the moss of whose roof hung down loose and rough over a wild collection of headless wooden horses little ships with torn sails long sticks battered wateringpots and old garden tools  she was desired to look up to one of the openings in the ragged moss and believe that it housed a kitty wrens family of sixteen or eighteen but she had to take this on trust for to lay a finger near would lead to desertion in fact sam was rather sorry to be able to point out to her on coming out the tiny dark nutmeg cocktailed father kitty popping in and out of the thorn hedge spying at the party  now then for a wonder as they came out  sam waved everybody away nay waved is a small word for what he didshouted pushed ordered would be more like it  he was going to give miss fosbrook such a proof of his esteem as hardly any one enjoyed not even hal twice in the summer  everybody submitted to his violent demonstrations and christabel followed him to the back of the summerhouse  there stood a large red flowerpot upside down  now miss fosbrook  sams finger hooked into the hole at the top  off came the flower pot and disclosed something flying off with rushing wings and something confused remaininga cluster of grey wings all quill with gaping yellow mouths here and there opening a huddling movement always going on in the forlorn heap as if each were cold and wanted to be undermost  tits my tits said sam triumphantly theyve built their nest here three years following  but how do they get in and out  through the hole  take care ill show you one  wont you frighten away the bird  oh dear no  oxeyes arent like wrens i go to them every day see and he took up in his hand a creature that could just be seen to be intended for a bird though the long skinny neck was bare and the tiny quills of the young wings only showed a little grey sprouting feather as did the breast some primrosecoloured down miss fosbrook had to part with some favourite cockney notions of the beauty of infant birds and on the other hand to gain a vivid idea of what is meant by callow young  sam quickly put his nestling back and showed her the parent  she could hardly believe that the handsome bird in the smooth grey coat and bright strawcoloured waistcoat with the broad jetblack line down the centre the great white cheeks edged with black and the bold knowing look could be like what the little bits of deformity in the nest would soon become  ay thats an oxeye said sam  youll hear them going on peter peterpeterall the spring  but sam was cut short by a loud and lamentable burst of roaring where they had left the party  miss fosbrook hurried back hearing hals rude laugh as she came nearer it was elizabeth sobbing in the passionate way in which it is not good to see a child cry and violently shaking off susan who was begging her to stop herself before miss fosbrook should come  what was the matter  oh  bettys nonsense  johnnie did  johnnie only  now hal  telltale  crybaby  she only cried that miss fosbrook might hear  so shouted the little babel bessie sobbing resentfully between her words till miss fosbrook insisting that everybody should be quiet desired her to tell what had happened  johnniejohnnie called me a toad  the others all burst out laughing and miss fosbrook trying to silence them with a frown said it was very rude of john but she saw no reason why a girl of bessies age should act so childish a part  hes been teasing me and so has anne all this time cried bessie theyve been at me ever since i came out pulling me and plaguing me and  well said susan i told you to walk in front of miss fosbrook where they could not  i didnt do anything to her said john  now johnnie  he only pulled her frock and poked her ankles said anne pleadingly  onlyand why did you do what she did not like  johnnie looked sturdy and cross  anne hung her head and elizabeth burst out again  they always dothey always are cross to me  i said id tell you and now they said ida was a conceited little toad and stingy bet was another and out burst her howls again  a very sad and improper way of spending a sunday evening said miss fosbrook who had really grown quite angry  anne and john i will put an end to this teasing  go to bed this instant  they did not dare to disobey but went off slowly with sulky footsteps muttering to one another that miss fosbrook always took pipy bettys part nurse said so and they wished mamma was at home and when they came up to the nursery nurse pitied them  she had never heard of a young lady doing such a thing as ordering off two poor dear children to bed for only just saying a word but it seemed there were to be favourites now  no she could not put them to bed they must wait till mary came in from her walk she wasnt going to put herself out of the way for any fine london governess  so johnnie had another conquest over miss fosbrook but anne was uncomfortable and went and sat in a corner wishing she had had her punishment properly over and kicking her brother away when he wanted to play with her  as for bessie she only cried the more for miss fosbrooks trying to talk to her  it was a way of hers perhaps from being less strong than the others if once she started in a cry she could not leave off  susan told miss fosbrook so and the boys tried to drag her on with a promise of a blackbirds nest but she thought them unfeeling to such woeful distress and first tried to reason with bessie then to soothe her till at last finding all in vain she thought bed the only place for the child and led her into the house helped her still shaking with sobs to undress and was going to see her lie down in the bed which she shared with susan  elizabeth was still young enough to say her prayers aloud  the words came out in the middle of choking sobs not as if she were much attending to them miss fosbrook knelt down by her as she was going to rise and said in her own words  most merciful god give unto this thy child the spirit of content and the spirit of love that she may bear patiently all the little trials that hurt and vex her and win her way as thy good soldier and servant  amen  elizabeth held her breath to listen  it was new and odd  she did not like to say amen she did not know if the governess were not taking a liberty  perhaps it was a new way of telling her she was wrongchristabel whom she had thought on her side  the bad temper woke up and would not let her offer a friendly kiss she hid her face in the pillow and as soon as miss fosbrook had shut the door went off into a fresh gust of piteous sobs because miss elizabeth merrifield was the most miserable illused child in all the world  she might be one of the most miserable but it was not because of her illusage but because she had no spirit to be cheerful and had turned away from comfort of the right kind  she was in such a frame as to prefer thinking everyone against her to supposing that anything she could do would mend matters  christabel was much grieved at this unfortunate end to the sunday evening  she looked over all the boys birds eggsthey were allowed to keep two of every sort as curiositiesand listened to some wonderful stories of henrys about climbing trees and shooting partridges and she kept the remaining children quiet and amused but she was not happy in her mind  she thought she must have been wrong in not watching them more closely and she felt more dislike and indignation against johnnie than she feared was altogether right in his governess  also she feared to make too much of elizabeth and was almost afraid that notice taught her to be still more fretful  and yet there was a sense of being drawn to her by their two minds understanding each other by likeness of tastes by pity and by a wish to protect one whom her little world oppressed  nurse freeman could not be more afraid of miss fosbrook making favourites than she was herself  all she could do in the matter was that which she had already done at bessies bedside and much more fully than when the little girl was listening to her    chapter v    with monday morning began the earning of the pig  miss fosbrooks first business after prayers was to deal out the weeks allowance sixpence to each of the four elders threepence apiece to the three younger ones  may there be no fines she said  ill not have the hundredth part of a fine shouted henry tossing his money into the air  little davids set lips expressed the same purpose  please let me have a whole sixpence said susan  if i havent any change i shant spend it  you sukey youd better have the four farthings laughed sam youll be the first to want them  susan laughed and miss fosbrook partly as an example to the plaintive elizabeth said you are so goodhumoured susie that i cant find it in my heart to demand a fineoryour hair and there pointing to the stout red fingers did you ever behold such a black little row  oh dear cried susan in her goodhumoured hearty voice how tiresome when they were so clean this morning and ive only just been feeding the chicken and up in the hayloft for the eggs and pulling the radishes  well go and wash and brush and tomorrow remember the pig said miss fosbrook unable to help comparing the radishes and the fingers for redness and for earthiness  it was a more difficult matter when as elizabeth put her silver coin into her purse john must needs repeat the stupid old joke there goes stingy bet and bessie put on her woeful appealing face  john i shall punish you if i hear those words again  i dont mind  nurse says you have no business to punish me  she did not put me to bed and i had such fun  oh such fun and the boy looked up with a grin that set all the others laughing  christabel resolutely kept silence and hoped her looks did not show her annoyance as the boy went on i got lots of goodies for nurse said she had no notion of no stranger punishing her children  oh oh  oh  for samuel had hold of his ear and was tweaking it sharply  there  go and tell nurse if you like baby  sam indeed i cant have my battles fought in that way cried the governess much distressed as johnnie roared perhaps that old nurse might hear and to all attempts to find out whether he were hurt offered only heels and fists till susan came back and hugged him into quiet  now johnnie has cried before breakfast on a monday morning said annie all the rest of the week will go wrong with him  indeed said miss fosbrook i hope no such thingsuppose we try and show annie she is wrong johnnie  but johnnie was sulky and even susan looked as if she thought this a new and dangerous notion  sam laughed and said i wish you joy miss fosbrook  now hell think he must be naughty  johnnie said david solemnly the pig  the pig was a very good master of the ceremonies and kept all elbows off the table at breakfasttime and bessie who was apt to stick fast in the midst of her bread and milk and fall into disgrace for daintiness and dawdling finished off quietly and prosperously  then every one was turned loose till nine oclock  susan had charge of mammas keys and had to go down to the kitchen see what the cook wanted and put it out but only on condition that no brother or sister ever went with her to the storecloset  susan was highly trustworthy but mamma was too wise to let her be tempted by voices begging for one plum one almond or the last spoonful of jam  it took away a great deal of the pleasure of jingling the keys and having a voice in choosing the pudding  the two elder boys went to their tutor the other children to the nursery except elizabeth who was rummaging in her little box and david whom miss fosbrook found perched on the ledge of the window reading a book that did not look as if it were meant for men of his size  but miss fosbrook thought david like the oldest person in the house infinitely older than john who could do nothing better than he except running and bawling and a good deal older than even hal and sam  nay there were times when he raised his steady eyes and slowly spoke out his thoughts when she felt as if he were much more wise and serious than her twentyyears old self  well davy she asked as at the sound of the lessonbell the little old man uncrossed his sturdy legs closed his book and arose with a sigh have you found out all about it  i have found out why a pig is a profitable investment he answered gravely  and why  because he will feed upon refuse and fatten upon cheap food said david in the words of his book only i cant make out why  do you know miss fosbrook  i dont quite see what you want to know davy  i want to know why a pig gets fat on barleymeal when an ox wants mange and oilcake and hay  i asked nurse and she said little boys mustnt ask questions and i asked purday and he said it was because pigs is pigs and oxen is oxen  why do you think it is miss fosbrook  i dont think i know it is because the great god has made one sort of creature to be easily fed and made good for poor people to live upon said miss fosbrook  davids eyes were fixed on her as if he still had questions to ask and she was quite afraid of her powers of answering them for he was new in the world and saw the strangeness of many things to which older people become used by living with them but which are not the less strange for all that  however the trampling of many feet put an end to question and answer and the days work had to begin with the psalms and reading the morning lessons  bessie was by far the best reader and david did very well though he made very long stops to look deliberately at any long new word and could not bear to be told before he had mastered it for himself  even susan was sadly given to gabbling and missing the little words that she thought beneath her attention and the other two stumbled so horribly that it was pain to hear them  this beginning might be taken as the sign of how all would do their lessons  it is only a child here and there generally a lonely one to whom lessons can be anything but a toil and an obligation  even with clever ones who may be interested in some part of their study some other branch will be disagreeable and there is nothing in the whole world to be learnt without drudgery so it would be unreasonable to expect lessons to be regarded as delightful but there is one thing that is to be expected of any good childnot to enjoy lessons not to surpass others not to do anything surprising only to make a conscience of doing what is required as well as possible  now do not many children seem to think that they are to receive as little as they can possibly take in without being punished or that if they make any exertion their teachers ought to be so much obliged to them that some great praise or reward is due to them  let us see whether anyone in stokesley schoolroom was making a conscience of the days tasks  it is not of much use to ask for any at present in johnnienot for a whole week as annie would declare he does not know his single latin declension his spelling is all abroad his geography wild yet though turned back once he misses the fine by just saying his lessons passably the last time  they perhaps ought in strict justice to have been sent back but miss fosbrook was very glad to be saved the uproar that would have ensued and almost wondered whether she were not timidly merciful to the horrible copy and the greasy slate  but johnnie had no fine and was as proud of it as if he had been a good boy  she hadnt caught him out he said as if his kind governess had been his enemy  as to annie her french verbs were always dreadful things to hear and the little merry face usually so bright used to grow quite deplorable with the trouble she took not to use her mind  using her memory was bad enough but saying things by heart was an affliction she was used to and it was very shocking of miss fosbrook to require her to find out how many years richard ii had reigned if he began in 1377 and ended in 1399  susan prompted her however so she really got a triumph over miss fosbrook and was quite saved from thinking  oh but the teasing woman she silenced susan and would have this poor injured annie tell how old the tiresome man was began to reign at eleven years old dethroned after twentytwo years how old was he  annie found bursting out crying easier than thinking and then they all cried out o nanny the pig and miss fosbrook had the barbarity to call that foolish crying  what might one cry for if not at being asked how old richard ii was  if the fine must be paid there was no use in stopping so annie howled till miss fosbrook turned her out to finish on the stairs and as nurse freeman was out with the little ones there was no one to comfort her so she cried till she was tired and when the noise ceased susan was allowed to come and coax her and fetch her back to go on with her copy as soon as her hand was steady enough  she felt very foolish by this time and thought david eyed her rather angrily and contemptuously so she crept quietly to her corner and felt sad and lowspirited all the rest of the morning  now that thirtythree had come into her head it seemed so stupid not to have thought of it in time and then she would have saved her farthing and her eyes would not have been so hot  maybe too susans french phrases would not have been turned back miss fosbrook would have given a great deal not to have been obliged to do it but she had prompted flagrantly already and a teacher is obliged to have a conscience quite as much as a scholar so the book was given back and susan spent twelve minutes in seesawing herself and going over the sentences in a rapid whispering gabble a serious worry to the governess in listening to bessies practising and davids reading but she thought it would be a hardship to be forbidden to learn in her own way at that moment and forbore  david was interrupted in his little arthurs history and looked rather cross about it for susan to try again  she made all the same blundersand more too  back again  poor susie  once twice thrice has she read those stupid words over and knows less of them than before  davys loud voice will go into her understanding instead of those french phrases  she looks up in dull stupefaction  william rufus is disposed of and david as grave as a judge is taking up his slate looking a little fussed because there is a scratch in the corner  well susan says miss fosbrook  susan jumps up in desperation and puts her hands behind her  oh dear oh dear all that the gentlemen on a journey were saying to one another has gone clean out of her head  she cannot recollect the three first words  she only remembers that this is the third time and another farthing is gone  she stands and stares  susan says miss fosbrook severely you never tried to learn this  susan gives a little gasp and elizabeth who has said her french without a blunder puts in an unnecessary and not very sisterly word susan never will learn her french  susans honest eyes fill with tears but she gulps them back  she will not cry away another farthing but she does feel it very cross in bessie and she is universally miserable  christabel feels heated wearied and provoked and as if she were fast losing her own temper and that made her resolve on mercy  susie she said with an effort run twice to the great limetree and back  then take the book into my room read this over three times and we will try again  susan looked surprised but she obeyed came back and repeated the phrases better than she had ever said french before  she was absolutely surprised and highly pleased and she finished off her other lessons swimmingly but oh she was glad to be rid of them yes they were off her mind and so she deserved that they should be she flew away to the nursery and little sarah was soon crowing in her arms  elizabeth  not a blunder in french verbs or geographyvery tidy copy  french reading good english equally so only it ended in a pout because there was not time for her to go on to see what became of carthage and she was a most intolerable time in learning her poetry out of the book of readings or rather she much preferred reading the verses in other parts of the book to getting perfect in her lesson and then being obliged to turn her mind to arithmetic miss fosbrook called her three times and at last she turned round peevishly at being interrupted in the middle of the friar of orders gray and repeated her twenty lines of cowpers winters walk in a doleful whine though without a blunder  it was one of the horrible novelties that miss fosbrook was bringing in that she expected people to understand their sums as well as work them  she gave much shorter ones to be sure than mamma who did sometimes set a long multiplication sum of such a huge size that it looked as if it were meant to keep the victim out of the way but who would not prefer casting up any length of figures to being required to explain the meaning of carrying  really if it had not been for the pig that shocking question might have led to a mutiny in the schoolroom  when it was bad enough to do the thing how could anyone ask what was meant by the operation and why it was performed  what did bessie do when her sum was being overlooked  miss fosbrook read on  4 from 8 4 7 from 1hows this bessie  7 from 10 are   3 and 1 are 4 dolorously as her 3 was changed  now then what next  carry one  what did i tell you was meant by carry one  the tens said bessie not in the least thinking the tens had anything to do with the matter but only that she had heard something about them and could thus get rid of the subject  now bessie what tens can you possibly mean  think a little  im sure you said tens once said injured innocence  that was in an addition sum  see here it is quite different  i told you  bessie put on a vacant stare  she was not going to attend to what she did not like  miss fosbrook saw the face  she absolutely shrank from provoking another fit of crying and went quickly through the explanation  she saw that her words might as well have been spoken to the slate bessie neither listened nor took them in  not all her love for her dear christabel angela could stir her up to make one effort contrary to her inclinations  the slate was given back to her she wiped out the sum in a pet and ran away  miss fosbrook turned round david whose lessons had been perfectly repeated an hour ago was sitting crosslegged in the window with his slate and pencil and a basket of bricks his great delight which he was placing in rows  miss fosbrook said he isnt this it  twelve bricks take away those seven thenl 2 3 4 5the twelve is only 5  the 10 is gone isnt it so you must leave one out of the next figure in the upper line of the sum  now davy had only begun arithmetic on the governesss arrival but he had learnt numeration and addition in her way  she was so delighted that she stooped down and kissed him saying quite right my little man  davy rather disapproved of the kiss and rubbed his brownholland elbow over his face as if to clear it off  well thought christabel as she hurried away for five minutes peace in her own room before the dinnerbell it is a comfort to have one pupil whose whole endeavour is not to frustrate ones attempts to educate him  poor young thing that one little bit of sense had quite cheered her up  otherwise she was not one whit less weary than the children she had been learning a very tough lesson toomuch harder than any of theirs and she was not at all certain that she had learnt it right  now readers of all the children who do you think had used the most conscience at the lessons    chapter vi    what an entirely different set of beings were those stokesley children in lessontime and out of it  talk of the change of an old thorn in winter to a maybush in spring that was nothing to it  poor listless stolid deplorable logs with bowed backs and crossed ankles pipy voices and heavy eyes  who would believe that these were the merry capering noisy creatures full of fun and riot clattering and screeching and dancing about with ecstasy at sams information that there was a bonfire by the potatohouse  a bonfire said the london governess thinking of illuminations what can that be for  oh it is not for anything said susan it is purday burning weeds  dont you smell them  how nice they are  i was afraid it was only farmer smith burning couch  all the noses were elevated to scent from afar a certain smoky odour usually to be detected in july breezes and which reminded miss fosbrook of a brickfield  potatoes  potatoes  well roast some potatoes and have them for tea bellowed all the voices so that miss fosbrook could hardly find a space for very unwillingly saying  but my dears i dont know whether i ought to let you play with fire  oh we always do roared the children and susan added  we always roast potatoes when theres a bonfire  mamma always lets us it is only purday that is cross  yes yes mamma lets us  well if sam and susan say it is right i trust to them said miss fosbrook gladly only you must let me come out and see what it is i am too much of a londoner to know  oh yes and well roast you some potatoes  so the uproarious population tumbled upstairs there to be invested with rougher brownholland garments than those that already concealed the sprigged cottons of the girls and when the five came down again they were so much alike in dress that it was not easy to tell girls from boys  susan brought little george down with her and off the party set  sam and hal who had been waiting in the hall took miss fosbrook between them as if they thought it their duty to do the honours of the bonfire and conducted her across the garden through the kitchengarden across which lay a long sluggish bar of heavy and very odorous smoke to a gate in a quickset hedge  here were some sheds and carthouses a fagot pile various logs of timber a grindstone andthat towards which all the eight children rushed with whoops of ecstasya heap of smoking rubbish chiefly dry leaves and peas and potato haulm with a large allowance of cabbage stumpsall extremely earthy and looking as if the smouldering smoke were a wonder from so mere a heap of dirt  no matter  there were all the children round it some on their knees some jumping and voices were crying on all sides  o jolly jolly  ill get some potatoes  oh you must have some sticks first and make some ashes  theres no flamenot a bit get out of the way cant you  ill make a hot place  well each have our own oven and roast our own potatoes  dont sam youre pushing me into the smoke  this of course was from elizabeth and there followed dont bessie you will tread upon georgieyes georgie you shall have a place  sticks sticks shouted henry while sam was on his knees poking out a species of cavern in the fire where some symptoms of red embers appeared which he diligently puffed with his mouth feeding it with leaves and smaller chips in a very well practised way sticks annie  johnnie  davy get sticks i say and well make an oven  annie obeyed but the two little boys were intent on imitating sam on another side of the fire and johnnie uttered a gruff get em yourself while david took no notice at all  perhaps hal would have betaken himself to no gentle means if susan had not hastily put in his way a plentiful supply of dead wood which she had been letting little george think he picked up all himself and there was keen excitement which christabel could not help sharing while under sams breath the red edges of the halfburnt chip glowed flushed widened then went sparkling doubtfully slowly to the light bit of potatostalk that he held to it glowing as he blewfading smoking when he took breath  try againpuff puff puff diligently the fire evidently has a taste for the delicate little shaving that annie has found for it it seizes on it anotheranother a flame at last  hurrah pile on more not too much  dont put it out  oh there strong flamecoming crackling up through those smothering heaps of stick and haulm it wont be kept down it rises in the wind it is a red flaring banner  the children shriek in transports of admiration little george loudest of all because susan is holding him tight lest he should run into the brilliant flame  miss fosbrook is rather appalled but the children are all safe on the windward side and seem used to it so she supposes it is all right and the flame dies down faster than it rose  it is again an innocent smouldering heap like a volcano after an eruption  we must not let it blaze again just yet said sam keep it down well with sticks to make some nice white ashes for the potatoes see ill make an oven  they were all stooping round this precious hot corner some kneeling some sitting on the ground david with hands on his sturdy kneesall intent on nursing that creeping red spark as it smouldered from chip to chip leaving a black trace wherever it went when through the thick smoke that was like an absolute curtain hiding everything on the farther side came headlong a huge bundle of weeds launched overwhelmingly on the fire and falling on the childrens heads in an absolute shower knocking johnnie down but on a soft and innocent side of the fire among the cabbagestumps and seeming likely to bury sam who leant over to shelter his precious oven and puffed away as if nothing was happening amid the various shouts around him in which purday was the most audible word  ah so youve got at he after all said purday leaning on the fork with which he had thrown on the weeds  nothing is safe from you  what you thought you had a new place purday and circumvented us cried hal but we smelt you out you old rogue we werent going to be baulked of our bonfire  miss fosbrook here ventured on asking if they were doing mischief and purday answered with an odd gruff noise mischief enoughay to be surehucking the fire all abroad  its what theyre always after  i did think id got it safe out of their way this time  then in rather a frightened voice for she felt that it would be a tremendous trial of her powers should i make them come away  catch her muttered hal  there was horror and disapprobation on susans face  annie stood with her mouth open while john throwing himself on the ground with fury rolled over crying out something about i wont and very cross and david lay flat on his face puffing at his own particular oven like a little wind in an old picture  sam waited leaning on the ashen stick that served him as a poker  it was the most audacious thing he had ever heard  rob them of their bonfire  would that old traitor of a purday abet her  perhaps purday was as much astonished as the rest but after all much as the children tormented his bonfires overset his haycocks and disturbed his woodpile he did not like anyone to scold them but himself much less the new london lady so he made up an odd sort of grin and said no no maam it aint that they do so much harm let em bide and he proceeded to shake on the rest of his barrowful tumbling the weeds down over davids cherished oven in utter disregard but the children cried with one voice hurrah hurrah  purday we dont do any harm so dont ever grumble again hurrah  and i dont care for her the crosspatch said johnnie to annie never hearing or heeding miss fosbrooks fervent i am so glad  and as long as the foolish boy remembered it he always did believe that miss fosbrook was so cross as to want to hinder them from their bonfire only purday would not let her  miss fosbrook did not trouble herself to be understood she was relieved to have done her duty and be free to rejoice in and share the pleasure  she ran about and collected materials for sam till she was out of breath and joined in all the excitement as the fire showed symptoms of reviving after being apparently crushed out by purday  sam and susan at least believed that she had only spoken to purday because she thought it right but even for them to forgive interference with their bonfire privileges was a great stretch  at last she thought it time to leave them to their own devices and seize the moment for some quiet reading but she had not reached the house before little steps came after her and she saw elizabeth running fast  they are so tiresome she said  sam wont let me stand anywhere but where the smoke gets into my eyes and george plagues so  may i come in with you dear christabel  you are very welcome said miss fosbrook but i am sorry to hear so many complaints  they are so cross to me said bessie they always are  you must try to be cheerful and goodhumoured with them and they will leave off vexing you  but may i come in  it will be a nice time for my secret  christabel saw little hope for her intended reading but she was always glad of a space for making bessie happy so she kindly consented to the bringing out of the little girls treasury and the dismal face grew happy and eager  the subjects of the drawings were all clear in her head that was not the difficulty but the cardboard the ribbon the real good paints  one little slip of card miss fosbrook hunted out of her portfolio she cut a pencil of her own and advised the first attempt to be made upon a piece of paper the little bird that bessie produced was really not at all bad and her performance was quite fair enough to make it worth while to go on since miss fosbrook well knew that mammas are pleased with works of their children showing more goodwill than skill  for why their value is in the love and thought they show  the little bird was made into a robin with the colours in a paintbox that bessie had long ago bought but they were so weak and muddy that the result was far from good enough for a present and it was agreed that real paints must be procured as well as ribbon  miss fosbrook offered to commission her sisters to buy the prussian blue lake and gamboge in london and send them in a letter  this was a new idea to bessie and she was only not quite decided between the certainty that london paints must be better than country ones and the desire of the walk to bonchamp to buy some but the thought that the ribbon after all might be procured there satisfied her  the little doleful maid was changed into an eager happy chattering child full of intelligence and contrivance and showing many pretty fancies since there was no one to tease her and laugh at her and her governess listened kindly and helpfully  miss fosbrook could not help thinking how much happier her little companion would have been as an only child or with one sister and parents who would have made the most of her love of taste and refinement instead of the hearty busy parents and the rude brothers and sisters who held her cheap for being unlike themselves  but then she bethought her that perhaps bessie might have grown up vain and affected had all these tastes been petted and fostered and that perhaps her little hardships might make her the stronger steadier more useful woman instead of living in fancies  it was the unkindness on one side and the temper on the other that made miss fosbrook uneasy  the work had gone on happily for nearly an hour and bessie was copying a forgetmenot off a little painted cardboard pincushion of her own when steps were heard little trotting steps and susan came in with little george  he had been pushed down by johnnie and was rather in a fretful mood and susan had left all her happy play to bring him in to rest and comfort him coming to the schoolroom because nurse freeman was out  before elizabeth had time to hide away her doings george had seen the bright pincushion and was holding out his hands for it  bessie hastily pocketed it  george burst out crying and susan without more ado threw herself on her sister and pinioning bessies slight arm by the greater strength of her firm one was diving into her pocket in spite of her struggles  susan leave off said miss fosbrook let your sister alone  she has a right to do what she likes with her own  it is so cross in her said susan obeying however but only to snatch up little george and hug and kiss him  poor dear little man is betty cross to him  there there come with sue and shell get him something pretty  susie susie indeed its only that i dont want him to spoil it said elizabeth distressed  a foolish thing like that  why the only use of it is to please the children but you are just such a baby as he is said susan still pitying george  you had better put your things away bessie said miss fosbrook interfering to stop the dispute and as soon as elizabeth was gone and george a little pacified by an ivory ribbonmeasure out of miss fosbrooks workbox she observed to susan my dear you must not let your love for the little ones make you unjust and unkind to bessie  she always is so unkind to them said susan resentfully  i dont think she feels unkindly but if you tyrannize over her and force her to give way to them you cannot expect her to like it  mamma says the elder must give way to the younger said susan  you did not try whether she would give way  no because i knew she wouldnt and i could not have my little georgie vexed  and i could not see my little susie violent and unjust said miss fosbrook cheerfully  justice first susan you had no right to rob bessie for george any more than i should have to give away a dinner of your papas because he had refused a beggar  papa never would said susan rather going off from the point  very likely but do you understand me susan  i will not have bessie forced out of her rights for the little ones  not bessie only but nobody is to be tyrannized over it is not right  bessie is so nonsensical was all susan said looking glum  very likely she may seem so to you but if you knew more you would see that all is not nonsense that seems so to you  some people would admire her ways  yes i know said susan  mrs greville told mrs brownlow that bessie was the only one among us that was capable of civilisation but mrs greville is a fine lady and we always laugh at her  and now as bessie returned you want to go out to your play again my dear  will you leave georgie with us  susan was a little doubtful about trusting her darling with anyone especially one who could take bessies part against him but she wished exceedingly to be present at the interesting moment of seeing whether the potatoes were done enough and george was perfectly contented with measuring everything on the ribbon so she ran quickly off without the manners to thank miss fosbrook but to assure the rest of the party that the governess really was very goodnatured and that she would save her biggest and best potato for miss fosbrooks tea  christabel managed very happily with little george though not quite without offending elizabeth who thought it very hard to be desired to put away her painting instead of tantalizing her little brother with the sight of what he must not have  miss fosbrook could not draw her into the merry game with little george which made his shouts of glee ring out through the house and meet nurse freemans ear as she came indoors with the baby and calling at the school room door summoned him off to his tea as if she were in a pet with miss fosbrook for daring to meddle with one of her own nursery children  nothing more was heard of the others and christabel and elizabeth both read in peace till the teabell rang and they went down and waited and waited till miss fosbrook accepted bessies offer of going out to call the rest  but bessie returned no more than the rest and the governess set forth herself but had not made many steps before the voices of the rabble rout were heard and they all were dancing and clattering about her while susan and hal each carried aloft a plate containing articles once brown now black and thickly powdered with white ashes as were the children themselves up to their very hair  as a slight concession to grownup peoples prejudices they did at the risk of their dear potatoes getting cold scamper up to perform a species of toilette and then sat down round the teatable susie david and sam each vociferous that miss fosbrook should eat my potato that i did on purpose for her  poor miss fosbrook she would nearly as soon have eaten the bonfire itself as those cindercoated things tough as leather outside and within like solid smoke indeed the children who had been bathing in smoke all day had brought in the air of it with them but their tongues ran fast on their adventures and their taste had no doubt that their own bonfire potatoes were the most perfect cookery in art  miss fosbrook picked out the most eatable bits of each of the three and managed to satisfy the three cooks all zealous for their own  other peoples potatoes might be smoky but each ones own was deliciousquite worthy of the pig when he was bought thought miss fosbrook but she made her real pleasure at the kind feeling to cover her dislike of the black potatoes and thus pleased the children without being untrue  line upon line precept upon precept here a little and there a little  that is the way habits are formed and characters made not all at once  so there had been an opportunity for susan to grow confirmed in her kindness and unselfishness as well as to learn that tyranny is wrong even on behalf of the weak and bessie if she would take home the lesson had received one in readiness to be cheerful and to turn from her own pursuits to oblige others something had been attempted toward breaking her habit of being fretful and thinking herself injured  it remained to be seen whether the many little things that were yet to happen to the two girls would be so used as to strengthen their good habits or their bad ones    chapter vii    it is not worth while to go on describing every day at stokesley since lessons were far too much alike and playtimes though varied enough for the house of merrifield might be less entertaining to the readers  enough to say that by saturday afternoon john had not only forfeited his last farthing but was charged with another into next week for the poor pleasure of leaving his hat on the schoolroom floor because elizabeth had told him of it  at about four oclock it set in for rain catching the party at some distance from home so that though they made good speed the dust turned into mud and clung fast to their shoes  david never the best runner was only in time to catch johnnie by the skirt upon the third step of the staircase crying out the pig but johnnie tired of the subject and in a provoking mood twitched away his pinafore crying bother the pig and rushed up after the four who had preceded him leaving such lumps of dirt on the edge of every step that when miss fosbrook came after with elizabeth she could not but declare that a shower was a costly article  you see observed susan when its such fine weather it puts ones feet out of ones head  while sam henry and bessie were laughing at susan for this speech little george trotted in crying out halty man come halty man come georgie want sweetie  the gibraltar man cried john and annie with one voice and they were at the bottom of the stairs with a bound  oh send him away send him away  theyll spend all their money and there will be none left was davids cry while george kept dragging his eldest sisters frock with entreaties of susie susie come  they call him the gibraltar man because he sells gibraltar rock and gingerbread and all those things said henry in explanation we have always dealt with him and he is very deserving and his wife makes it allat least i know she makes gingerbeerso we must encourage him  so henry hastened downstairs to encourage the gibraltar man and susan saying soothingly yes yes georgienever mind davie well make up for it i cant vex him had taken the little fellow in her arms and followed  pigs enough here without sending to the fair muttered sam  please sam please miss fosbrook send the gibraltar man away and dont let him come cried david quite passionately  nasty man he will come every saturday and theyll always spend all their money  but my friend said miss fosbrook goodhumouredly suppose we have no right to banish the gibraltar man  i dont want him said bessie it makes my fingers sticky  youre no good said david vehemently  i dont like you and i hate the gibraltar man taking away all our money from poor hannah  gently gently davie nobody makes you spend your money and perhaps the poor man has children of his own who want food as much as hannahs do  then cant they eat the gibraltar rock and bulls eyes  sam suggested that this diet would make them sick to which poor little earnest david answered that when once the pig was bought he would give all his money for a whole month to the gibraltar man if he would not come for the next four weeks  and christabel thought of what she had once read that people would often gladly put away from their children friends the very trials that are sent by heaven to prove and strengthen their will and power of resisting selfindulgence  before she had quite thought it out the quick steps were back again and sam greeted the entrance of john thus  well if that isnt a shame  have you been and done sukey out of all that jack  it was only three bulls eyes said susan following  you know he had nothing of his own and it was so hard and annie gave him some  and nurse some added hal  trust jackie for taking care of himself  well he might say so considering how full were johns mouth hands and pockets  and davie has had nothing said kind susan  here davie holding out to him an amberlike piece of barleysugar  i dont want your stuff said david roughly  youve spent all away from the pig  no davie indeed only twopence said susan pray have a bit  you might at least say thank you said miss fosbrook  but how difficult is that middle road which is the only right one david being too much set on one single purpose good though it was could see nothing else  it was right and generous to abstain from sweets with this end in view but it was wrong to be rude and unthankful to the sister who meant all so kindly and was the most unselfish of all  she turned round to elizabeth with the kind offer of the dainty she had not even tasted herself but was not more graciously treated  how can you susie it is all pulled about with your fingers  this was a matter on which the misses and masters merrifield were not wont to be particular and with one of the teasing laughs that bessie hated sam exclaimed as susan turned to him yes thank you sukey i dont mind finger sauce but not before john was stretching out a hand glazed with sugar and calling out oh give it to me and as it disappeared in his brothers mouth he burst out angrily how cross sam  you did that on purpose  yes said sam i did for though pigs on four legs are all very well i dont like pigs on two  here jackie never mind said susan seeing him about to begin to cry and offering him her last sugarplum  i dont want sugarplums i want barleysugar said john devouring it nevertheless  i havent one bit more said susan regretfully  have you had any yourself susan asked sam  no but i didnt want any  oh then here susie i always keep a reserve said henry  no no not you jack i dont feed little pigs whatever susie does  and in spite of susan both the elder brothers set on john teasing him about his greediness till he burst out crying and ran away to the nursery  miss fosbrook hated the teasing but she thought it served john so rightly that she would not save him from it and she only interfered to remind the others that their fingers would bring them in for fines unless they were washed before tea  and how much have you spent reproachfully asked that rigid young judge david but all the answer he got was a pull by the hair from hal and hollo young one am i to give my accounts to you  david gravely put up his hand and smoothed his ruffled locks repeating in his manful way i want to know what you have left for the pig  whereupon hal laid hold of him pulled him off the locker and rolled him about on the floor like a puppy dog crying ill tell you what if you make such a work about it ill spend all my allowance and not subscribe at all  sam cried the tormented david and sam cried the governess really afraid the little boy would be hurt but sam only stood laughing with his back to the shutter and christabel herself hurried to the rescue to pick henry off his victim holding an arm tight while the child got up and ran away to get his hair rebrushed for tea  now hal you might have hurt him argued the governess  very good thing for him too said the brothers with one voice  she was very much shocked but when she thought it over she perceived that though hal might be to blame yet in the long run even this rough discipline might be more useful to her dear little david than being allowed to take upon him with his elder brothers and grow conceited and interfering  miss fosbrook was not surprised when next morning a frightful bellowing was heard instead of johnnie being seen and she learnt that master john was in the hands of nurse freeman who was administering to him a dose in consequence of his having been greatly indisposed all night  it must be confessed that christabel was not very sorry to hear it nor that nurse would keep him to herself all day for bad company as johnnie had been on the weekdays he had been worse on the sunday  and when john came out on monday he looked like a different boy he had lost his fractious rebellious look he spoke as civilly as could be expected of a small merrifield and showed no signs of being set against his lessons  to be sure it was a bad way of spending a sunday to be laid up with ailments brought on by overeating but even this was better than spending it like the former one in wilful misbehaviour and john who knew that papa mamma brothers and sisters all alike detested and despised real greediness had been heartily ashamed of himself both for this and his forfeits  a new week was a new startingpoint and he meant to spend this one well for indeed it is one of the blessings of our lives that we have so many stagesdays weeks years and the likefrom each of which we may make fresh starts feel old things left behind and go on to lead a new life  besides johnnie was quite well now and perhaps no child so well brought up could have been so constantly naughty the whole week without some degree of ailment suspected neither by himself nor others  for this is one of our real troubles when either young or old that sometimes there is a feeling of discomfort and vexation about us that without knowing why makes everything go amiss causes everybody else to appear cross and all tasks all orders all misadventures to become great grievances  grownup people feel this as well as children but they have gone through it often enough to know what is the matter and they have or ought to have more self command  but children have yet to learn by experience that the outer things are not harder and more untoward so much as that they themselves are out of sorts  this is poor comfort and certainly it is dangerous to say to ourselves that being poorly is any excuse for letting ourselves be cross or for not doing our best  if mrs merrifield had thought so what miserable lives her husband and children would have led  no the way to use the certain fact that the state of our bodies affects our tempers and spirits is to say to ourselves well if this person or this thing do seem disagreeable or if this work or even this little bit of obedience be very tiresome perhaps it may really be only a fancy of mine and if i go to it with a good will i may work off the notion or perhaps i am cross today let me take good care how i answer  and a little prayer in our hearts will be the best help of all  selfcommand and goodness will not come by nature as we grow up but we must work for them in childhood  when the monday allowances were brought out and the pigs chance inquired into david alone produced his whole sum untouched by forfeiture or waste and dropped it into toby fillpot  elizabeth had her entire sixpence but a penny had been spent on a letter to mamma and she gave but one to the fund in spite of the black looks she met from david  sam had lost a farthing by the shower and had likewise bought a queens head to write to his father  the rest fourpencethree farthings he paid over  poor johnnie his last weeks naughtiness had exceeded his power of paying fines and a halfpenny was subtracted from this weeks threepence while the gibraltar man had consumed all that fines had spared to little annie had left susan only threepence and henry but twopencehalfpenny this with twopence that miss fosbrook had found in her travelling bag made one shilling and fourpencefarthinga very poor collection for one week  david was quite melancholy  never mind said henry mr careys brother the colonel is coming to stay here the last week in july and he gives us boys half asovereign each so that we might buy a stunning pig all ourselves twice over  always  he never did so but once said sam  that was the only time he saw us though said hal and we were quite little boys then  ill tell you what sam hell give us each a sovereign this time and then ill buy a bow and arrows  stuff said sam  i hope he wont  why not  i hate it  i hate saying thank you i shall get out of the way if i can  sam has no manners said hal turning round to miss fosbrook  to think that he had rather go without a sovereign or two than say thank you  im too much of a gentleman to lay myself out for presents retorted samuel and the two boys fell on each other buffeting one another all in good part on sams side though there was some temper and annoyance on henrys  when sam was out of hearing hal discoursed very grandly on the sovereign he intended colonel carey to give him and the prodigious things he meant to do with it  a gentleman once gave osmond greville two sovereigns why should not colonel carey be equally liberal  and to hear the boy those two sovereigns would buy everything in the world from the pig to a doublebarrelled gun  david began to grow hurt and to fear the toby fund would be lost in this magnificence but hal assured him that it would be a help and they should all have a share in the pig promising presents to everybody which susan and annie expected with the more certainty that sam was never present to laugh down these fine projects  indeed miss fosbrook had laughed at them once or twice and observed that she thought money earned or spared a better thing than money given and this caused hal to cease to try to dazzle her though he could not give up the pleasure of regaling his sisters in private with the wonders to be done with colonel careys possible sovereigns    chapter viii    the second week was prosperous  the treasury made progress and christabel began to feel as if her pupils were not beyond her management as at first she had feared  collectively they were less uncouth and bearish not so noisy at their meals nor so needlessly rude to one another and the habit of teasing elizabeth whenever there was nothing else to do was greatly lessened  indeed sam did not plague her himself nor let his brothers do so unless she tempted him by some very foolish whine or bit of finery and in such eases a little friendly merriment is a sound cure very unlike the hateful fault of tormenting for tormentings sake  nor did elizabeth give nearly so much cause for their rough laughter since miss fosbrook had given wholesome food to her tastes and likings partly satisfying the longing for variety beauty or interest which had made her discontented and restless  her head was full of her secret and her pretty plans for her gift  such lovely drawings she saw in her minds eye such fairies such delightful ships kittens babies in the cradle  but when the pencil was in her hand the lines went all ways but the right her fairy was a grimy little object whose second wing could never be put on the ships were saucers the kitten might have been the pig the baby was an owl in an ivybush and to look at the live baby in the cradle only puzzled her the more  miss fosbrook gave her real drawing lessons but boxes palings and tumbledown sheds done with a broad black pencil did not seem to help her to what she wished  yet sometimes her fingers produced what surprised and pleased herself and christabel and she never was happier than when safely shut into miss fosbrooks bedroom with her card and her paints  she used to bolt herself in with a little parade of mystery that made annie exceedingly curious though the others generally let it alone as bettys fancy  christabel wanted to learn botany for her own pleasure  she found a book which susan and bessie pronounced to be horridly stupid indeed annie called it nasty and was reproved for using such a word but when the information in it was minced up small and brought out in a new form bessie enjoyed it extremely  the whole party were delighted to gather flowers for miss fosbrookthe wetter or the steeper places they grew in the better but the boys thought it girlish to know the names and susan though liking gardening did not in the least care for the inside of a flower  elizabeth however was charmed at the loveliness that was pointed out to her and even annie when the boys were not at hand thought it very entertaining to look at petals stamens and pistils and to see that a daisy is made up of a host of tiny flowers  both little sisters were having their eyes opened to see some of the wonder and some of the glory of this earth of ours  it made bessie much less often tired of everything and everybody though after all there is but one spirit that is certain never to be weary or dissatisfied and into that she had yet to grow  fines were much less frequent  there were no foolish tears only one lesson of johns turned back two of annies one of susans some unbrushed hair of susans tooan unlucky mention of the raven by annie in lessontimeand some books left about by sam  henrys fines were the serious ones  he had two for incorrect sums one for elbows on the table three for talking one for not putting his things away and besides he could not go without a pennyworth of string and the grevilles would have laughed at him if he had not bought some more marbles  but what did that signify when colonel carey was coming and a sovereign would buy a pig three times overat least if it was quite a little one  christabel wished the hope of that sovereign had never occurred to him for he seemed to think it quite set him free from the little selfrestraints by which the others were earning the pleasure of making the gift and though he still talked the most about the pig he denied himself the least for it  one evening the boys came in with a great piece of news  their tutor had read in the paper that admiral penrose was appointed to the ramilies to take command in the mediterranean  he was a great friend of their father and said the boys was most likely to make him his flagcaptain  and me a naval cadet said hal  he said he would when he was here  one of you he said put in susan  i know it will be me said hal  he looked at the rigging of my frigate and said i knew all the ropes quite well and he told papa he might be proud of such a son  oh oh groaned the aggrieved multitude  wellsuch a family but he was looking at me and i know he will give me the appointment and i shall sail in his shipyoull see and when i get to the mediterranean ill tell you what ill doi shall kill a shark all my own self  a shark in the mediterranean  well why shouldnt they get in by the straits of magellan  oh is that the other place  well never mindill shoot the shark  stuff hal said sam rather gruffly  hal went off on another tack  well at least he has set me down by this time and papa will have me up to london for my outfit  i hope you will have leave and come and see us said annie  ill try but you see i shall be an officer on duty and i dare say admiral penrose will hardly be able to spare me but ill send you all presents out of my pay  youll spend all your pay on yourself said david  out of my prizemoney then  you cant get prizemoney without a war said elizabeth  oh dont let there be a war cried susan  yes but there is said harry in a tremendous tone and as miss fosbrook held up her hands at least there was one in the black sea and i know there was a battle in the newspaperat least mr carey read about palermo  i dont think garibaldi in sicily will put much prizemoney into your pocket hal said miss fosbrook  oh but theres sure to be a war and i shall get promoted and be a man before any of you  i shall go about and see condors and lions and elephants and wear a swordat least a dirkwhile you are learning latin and greek at uncle johns  dont make such a noise about it said sam crossly  i dont know why you should be the one to go said elizabeth  sam is the eldest  yes but sam is such a slowcoach  papa said i was the only one fit to make a sailor ofat least he said i was smart andhollo  sam i wont have you kicking my legs  dont keep up such a row then growled sam but hal was in too full swing to be reached by slight measures  he pushed his chair back tucked up his feet like a tailors out of reach and went on  then i shall come home in my cocked hat like papasat least my cap and come and ask for a holiday for you all at uncle johns  uncle john was an undermaster at one of the great public schools and the children were all a good deal in awe of him  uncle john wont give one for you said sam  come boys i cant have this bickering said miss fosbrook  i cant see you trying which can be most provoking  stand up  now david say grace  there annie finish that bit of bread out of doors  go out and let us have no more of this  she spoke now with much less fear of not being minded and having seen one of the quarrelsome parties safe out of the schoolroom she went to fetch from her own room a glove that wanted mending and on her return found sam alone there curled up over his lessonbooks on the locker looking so gloomy that she was afraid she had made him sulky for which she would have been very sorry since she had a respect for him  what is the matter she asked and his nothing did not at all assure her that he was in a right mood  she doubted whether to leave him alone but presently thought he looked more unhappy than ill tempered and ventured to speak  have you a hard piece to learn perhaps i could help you  he let her come and look at his book but to her surprise he had before him a very easy problem in euclid  indeed if you only gave your mind to this she said you would soon make it out  stupid stuff exclaimed sam  it is all along of that and the rest of it that i have got to be a landlubber and he threw the book to the other end of the room  have you no chance said miss fosbrook without taking notice of this rudeness for she saw that the boy could hardly contain himself  no  the admiral did take notice of hal and one day when i was slow at a proposition my father said i was too blockheaded to beat navigation into and that hal is a smart fellow worth two of me  i know he is  i know that only if he would not make such an intolerable crowing  then you wish it very much  wish it  of course i do  why my father is a sailor and i remember the fury and i saw the calliopehis ship that he had in the war time  before i was as big as little george i always thought i should be a sailor  and now if papa goes out with admiral penrose and hal toooh it will be so horrid home  but cant you both go  no my father said he couldnt ask to have two of us put down unless perhaps some younger one had a chance by and by  and hal is the sharpest and does everything better than i can when he has a mind  my father says among so many all cant choose and if this place is to be mine hal may want to be in the navy more than i yes it is all right and hal must go  butbutwhen my father is goneand sam fairly burst out crying  i didnt hardly know how different it is with him away till this month  i was such a little fellow when he went to the black sea but nownever mind though and he stamped his foot on the floor  papa said it and it must be dont tell the others miss fosbrook and he resolutely went and picked up his euclid and began finding the place  you will do your duty like a man wherever you are sam said christabel heartily  sam looked as if he had rather that she had not said it but it was comfortable to him for all that and though she kept further compliments to herself she could not but think that there was no fear but that he would be a man in the best sense of the word before hal when she saw him so manfully put his sore grievance out of his head and turn to the present business of conquering his lesson  nor did she hear another word from him about his disappointment  it made her dislike henrys boasts more than ever and she used to cut them short as fast as she could till the young chatterer decided that she was cross and reserved all his wonderful at leasts for his sisters and his proofs of manliness for the grevilles  the gibraltar man did not come on saturday and miss fosbrook had been the saving of several stamps by sending some queer little letters in her own to mrs merrifield so that on monday morning the hoard was increased to sevenandsixpence although between fines and couldnt helps henrys sixpence had melted down to a halfpenny which was not worth while  on this day arrived a servant from the park bringing a delicate little lilac envelope stamped with a tiny rose and directed to miss merrifield  there was another rose on the top of the lilac paper and the writing was in a very neat hand   my dear susan  mamma desires me to say that she hopes you and bessie and annie will come to dine early tomorrow and play with me and that miss fosbury will come with you  she hopes your mamma is better and would be glad to have her address in london  i am your affectionate ida arabella greville   oh  miss fosbrook may we go cried the girls with sparkling eyes  mrs merrifield had written that one or two such invitations might be accepted but she had rather it did not happen too often as visits at the park were unsettling to some of the children  so as this was the first christabel gladly consented rather curious and rather shy on her own account  elizabeth begged for the rose to copy it and as there were no little ones present to seize it she was allowed to have it while susan groaned and sighed over the misfortune of having to write a horrible note just at playtime and the boys treated it as a sort of insult to the whole family that ida should have mistaken their governesss name  tell her you wont go till she has it right said sam at which annie made a vehement outcry of no no such as made them all laugh at her thinking him in earnest  susans note began    my dear ida  we shuold    but then perceiving that something was the matter with her word susan sat and looked at it till at last perceiving that her u and o had changed places she tried putting a top to the u and made it like an a while the filling up the o made it become a blot such as caught bessies eye  o susie you wont send such a thing as that up to ida  nothat would be a horrible note said her governess and she ruled the lines again  dear me said susan impatiently cant one send a message up by the man that well all come without this fuss  but miss fosbrook said that would be very uncivil and susan groaning stretched every finger till the lines were finished and began again in her scraggy roundhandgetting safely through the should and also through like to come very much but when miss fosbrook looked up next she saw that the rest of the note consisted of    mamma is at grandmammas no 12 st grovensor place  i am your affectionate susanna merrifield   my dear i am very sorry  what wont that do sighed susan beginning to get into despair  miss fosbrook pointed to the word grovensor  oh dear oh dear  i thought i had got that tiresome word this time why cant it put its ss and ns into their proper sensible places cried poor susan to whom it was a terrible enemy  she used to try them in different places all the way round in hopes that one might at last be right  cant you remember what i told you that the first grosvenor was the grand huntsman  grosveneur in french that would show you where to put the sgros great  but susan never wished to remember anything french and sam observed that the man deserved to be spelt wrong if he called himself by a french name  why couldnt he be content to be mr grandhunter  but as he is not we must spell his name right or mrs greville will be shocked said miss fosbrook  please cant you scratch it out said the disconsolate susan  i should not like to send a note with a scratch in it  besides yours is hardly civil  no indeed said elizabeth dont you know how people answer invitations susie  ill tell you  miss susanna and miss elizabeth and miss annie merrifield will be very happy to do the honour of dining with sam why do you laugh at me always  why you are telling ida you will do her honour by dining with her  people always do honour when they dine said elizabeth  i know they do  they profess to receive the honour not confer it bessie said miss fosbrook laughing but i dont think that is the model for susies note  it would be as much too formal as hers was too blunt  must i do it again said susan  i had rather not go if it is to be such a plague  indeed i fear you must susie  it is quite needful to learn how to write a respectable note really a more difficult thing than writing a long letter  i am sorry for you but if you were not so careless in your letters to mamma this would come more easily to you  but this time miss fosbrook not only ruled another sheet but wrote in fair largehand on a slate the words that susan might copy them without fresh troubles   we are much obliged to your mamma for her kind invitation and shall have much pleasure in coming with miss fosbrook to dine with you and spend the day  i am sorry to say that mamma was not quite so well when last we heard  her address isno 12st grosvenorplace   susan thought that here were a very serious number of words and begged hard for leave to leave out her sorrow  of course she was sorry but what was the use of telling ida so  miss fosbrook thought it looked better but susan might do as she pleased  i wouldnt say it then said sam  i wouldnt say it only to look better to ida  with which words he and hal walked off to the garden  would it be believed  susan in her delight at being near the end forgot the grand huntsman and made the unlucky place grovesnor and then in her haste to mend it put her finger into the wet ink and smeared not only that word but all the line above  it was a shame and a wonder that a girl of her age should be so incapable of producing a creditable note and miss fosbrook was very near scolding her but she had pity on the tearful eyes and weary fingers and spoke cheerfully  there that was almost the thing one more trial susan and you need never be afraid of idas notes again  if susan could not write notes at least she was not cross and it would be well if many who could send off a much better performance with far less difficulty could go to work as patiently as she did without one pettish word to miss fosbrook though that lady seemed to poor susie as hard a task mistress as if she could have helped it this time miss fosbrook authorized the leaving out of the spending the day and suggested that s would be enough without the whole susanna and she mercifully directed the cover to miss greville  there my dear you have worked hard for your pleasure she said as susan extended each hand to its broadest stretch to uncramp them and stretched herself backwards as if she wanted to double her head down to her heels  i shall give you a good mark susie as if it had been a lesson  susan deserved it for her patient perseverance had been all out of obedience not in the mere desire of having her note admired indeed good child at the best it was a very poor affair for a girl of twelve and miss fosbrook was ashamed of it when she looked at idas ladylike little billet  but i wonder said she to herself whether i shall feel as if i would change my dear stupid susan for miss ida  meanwhile susan flew screaming and leaping out into the garden in a mad tomboy fashion but that could well be pardoned as there were only her sisters to see her and the pleasure of having persevered and done her best was enough to make her heart and her limbs dance for merriment  depend upon it however wretched and miserable hard application to what we do not like may seem at the moment it is the only way to make playtimes really delicious    chapter ix    miss fosbrook soon knew what mrs merrifield meant by saying that visits at the park unsettled the children  susan indeed though liking anything that shortened lessons by an hour and made a change was not so fond of being on her good behaviour at the park as to be greatly exalted at the prospect but elizabeth and annie were changed beings  they were constantly breaking out with some new variety of wonder  they wondered whether they should dine in the schoolroom or at mrs grevilles luncheon they wondered if mr greville would speak to them they wondered whether fraulein munsterthal would be cross they wondered if ida still played with dolls and they looked as if they thought themselves wonderful too for going out for a day  nay the wonders were at their tongues end even when lessons began and put their farthings in great peril and when they had nothing else to wonder at they wondered when it would be twelve oclock and took no pains to swallow enormous yawns  once over her copy elizabeth exclaimed now yes this is necessary miss fosbrook may not we wear our white frocks  they are not ironed answered susan  oh do let me go and tell mary  theres lots of time said bessie who had lately thought it cruel of the clock to point only to half past ten and never bethought herself how mary would like to be called off from her scrubbing to iron three white frocks  would your mamma wish it asked christabel  oh dear no was susans answer we always wear clean ones of our everyday frocks  our white ones are only for dinnerparties and christmastrees  bessie grumbled  how cross  i hate those nasty old spotty cottons and johnnie returned to the old storylittle vain pussy cat  up went miss fosbrooks warning pencil she shook her head and held out her hand for two fines  elizabeth began to gulp and sob  oh dont betty cried susan  stop while you can  you wont like going up with red eyes  there ill pay your fine and theres another for my speaking  no susie that was not foolish speaking but kind words said miss fosbrook but no more now go on annie  but annie who was reading a little history of st paul would call cilicia cicilia and when told to spell it she began to cry too decidedly for susans goodnature to check her tears  and not only did elizabeths copy look as if she had written it with claws instead of fingers but she was grieving over her spotted cotton instead of really seeking for places in her map  thus the moselle obstinately hid itself and she absolutely shed tears because miss fosbrook declared that frankfort was on the maine  for the first time she had her grammar turned back upon her hands  how many mistakes annie made would be really past telling for these two little girls had their whole minds quite upset by the thought of a days pleasure and as they never tried to restrain themselves and to be sober be vigilant they gave way before all the little trials in their paths were first careless and then fractious  perhaps when they were older they would find out that this uplifted sense of excited expectation is the very warning to be heedful  if miss fosbrook had been a strict governess she would have told them they did not deserve to go at all or at any rate that bessie must repeat her grammar better and rewrite her copy and that annies unlucky addition sum must be made to prove but she had seen her little sisters nearly as bad in prospect of a pantomime so she was merciful and sent them in good time to brush their hair put on their spotted cottons and wash off as much as possible of the red mottling left by those foolish tears  their spirits rose again as fast as they had sunk and it was a lively walk through the park to the great house with a good deal of skipping and jumping at first and then near the door a little awe and gravity  they were taken through a sidedoor of the hall to the schoolroom where ida and her governess received them  it was the first time that christabel had seen her out of her beplumed hat and she thought her a pleasant brightlooking little girl not at all set up or conceited  her mauve muslin flounced though it was up to her waist showed that it had been wise to withstand bessies desire for the white muslins but miss fosbrook had enough to do on her own account with the endeavour to understand the german governesss foreign accent without attending to the children more than was necessary  it was not a very remarkable day and the pleasures of it seemed hardly enough to justify the little girls great excitement  there was first the dinner at the luncheon of the parents where the children sat up rather formal and subdued and not quite certain what all the dishes might contain a little afraid of getting what they could not eat though desirous of making experiments in this land of wonders  none of them had forgotten and they thought no one else had how bessie had once come to disgrace by bursting out crying over the impossibility of finishing some terrible ricebordered greenish yellow stuff that burnt her mouth beyond bearing and which ida called curry and said people in the east indies liked  however that was when bessie had been a very little girl and she still continued adventurous saying yes if you please to cutlets set round in a wreath with all their bones sticking up and covered with a reddish incrustation that susan and annie thought so unnatural that they preferred the boiled chicken that at least they could understand though it had funnyhooking accompaniments in the sauce and hals report of some savoury jelly which he had once encountered would have deterred them from the pink transparency in the shape of a shell if they had not seen bessie getting on very well with it miss fosbrook happily perceiving and cutting short annies intended inquiry whether it were nice  to her great relief this was the only want of manners betrayed by her little savages and she was able to keep her attention tolerably free from them so as to look at the pictures on the walls observe the two boys hals friends and talk to mrs greville who made conversation with her very pleasantly  she was much grieved to perceive from what that lady said that mrs merrifield was thought to be much more ill and in a far more alarming state than she had at all understood  the girls were too young to enter into the tone of sad sympathy with which mrs greville spoke and the manner in which a doubt was expressed whether the captain would be able to sail with admiral penrose if he should have the offer and as soon as she saw that they and their governess were in ignorance she turned it off but she had said enough to fill christabel with anxiety and desire to know more and as soon as the dinner was over and the little girls had run off together to visit idas beautiful cockatoo in the conservatory she turned to fraulein munsterthal and begged to hear whether she knew more than had been said  fraulein munsterthal did not quite know that such a person as mrs merrifield was in existence but she was very amiable and warm hearted and said how sad it was to think of the trouble that hung over these so careless children and was doubly kind to the girls when they came back from their conversation with pretty cocky who set up his lemoncoloured crest coughed sneezed and said cocky want a biscuit to admiration till the boys were seen approaching when ida knowing that some torment would follow took herself and her visitors back to the protection of the governesses in time to prevent the cockatoo from being made to fly at the girls and powder them with the white dust under his feathers  the afternoon was spent in the garden the little girls betaking themselves to a pretty mosscovered arbour where there was a grand dolls feast  ida had no less than twentythree dolls ranging from the magnificent rosalind who had real hair that could be brushed and was as large as little sally at home down to poor little china mildred whose proper dwellingplace was a bath and who had with great difficulty been put into petticoats enough to make her fit to be seen out of it  now nobody at home could have saved the life of a doll for a single day and susan and elizabeth were both thought far above them but these beautifully arrayed young ladies had always been the admiration of the heart of bessie as well as of annie and they were not too old for extreme satisfaction in handling their elegant ladyships and still more their beautiful dinner and tea service of pink and white ware  susan though she could not write a note or do lessons like ida was older in the ways of life and played rather as she did with the little ones at home than for her own amusement  she would much rather have had the fun of cats and mice with her brothers and but for the honour of the thing so perhaps would annie  however they were all very happy getting the dolls up in the morning giving mildred washing enough for all the twentythree making them breakfast hearing lessons in which ida was governess and made them talk so many languages that annie was alarmed  of course one of the young ladies was very naughty and was treated with extreme severity then there was dinner a walk an illness and a dinnerparty  while all the time the two real governesses sat in the shade outside and talked in english or german as best they might the fraulein understanding christabels english the best as did christabel the frauleins german  they began to make friends and to wish to see more of one another  there was a walk round the garden and admiration of the beautiful flowers and the fountain and pond of goldfish till the boys came home and got hold of the gardenengine for watering crying out fire fire and squirting out the showers of water very much in the direction of the girls  ida became quite crimson red and got hold of susans hand to drag her away then as the foremost drops of another shower touched her she faced about and said osmond dont or ill tell mamma there was a great rude laugh as of boys who well knew the threat was never put in execution and poor fraulein munsterthal only shook her head at miss fosbrooks look of amaze and said in german that die knaben were far too unartig for her to keep in order  she pitied miss fosbrook for having so many in charge as to destroy all peace and if sam and hal had been like these two christabel felt that she could have done nothing with them  to her dismay osmond and martin came in to the schoolroom tea and she never had thought to feel so thankful for poor dear susans slowness of comprehension for from their whispers among themselves and from their poor tormented sisters blushes she was clear that the fire was a piece of bad wit on susans red hair  boys who could so basely insult a guest and that a girl she was sure must be bad companions for sam and henry  such little gentlemen as they had been at dinner too so polite and wellbehaved before their father and mother  there could be no doubt that something must be very wrong about them or they would not change so entirely when out of sight  it is not always true that a child must be deceitful who is less good in the absence of the authorities because their presence is a help and a restraint checking the beginning of mischief and removing temptation but one who does not fall by weakness but intentionally alters his conduct the instant the elder is gone shows that his will has been disobedient all along  by and by mr grevilles voice was heard calling martin  osmond as they went out to meet him in the passage miss fosbrook clearly overheard here is the spring of the gardenengine spoilt  do you know anything about it  no  you have not been meddling with it  no  and they ran downstairs  the colour flushed into christabels cheeks with horror  she was glad that her little girls were all in idas room listening to a musicalbox and well out of hearing of such fearfully direct falsehoods as it seemed to her not knowing that the boys excused it to their own minds by the notion that it was not the spring of the engine that they had been meddling with and that so they did not know how the harm had been doneas if it made it any better that they lied to themselves as well as their father  the german saw her dismay and began to say how unlike her ida was to her brothersso truthful so gentle and courteous but poor christabel could not get over the thought of the ease and readiness with which deceit came to these boys  could their daily companions samuel and henry have learnt the same effrontery and be deceiving her all this time  no no she could not would not think it  assuredly not of sam  she was very glad not to see the boys again and went home with her pupils rather heavyhearted at eight oclock just as ida was to put on her white muslin and pink ribbons and go down after dinner for half an hour  there were many kisses at parting and a whole box of sweets done up in beautifully coloured and gold and silver paper presented to the little visitors but it might be supposed that the girls were tired for there was a fretful snarling all the way across the park because elizabeth insisted that the gifts should be called bonbons and the others would hear of nothing but goodies  nobody looked at the beautiful evening sky nor at the round red moon coming up like a lamp behind the trees nor at the first stars peeping out nor even at the green light of the glowwormall which were more beautiful than anything ida had shown them except perhaps the hothouse flowers and at last two such cross illtempered voices sounded from bessie and annie that christabel turned round and declared that she should not let the sugarplums be touched for a week if another word were said about them  she hoped that when the visit was over it would be done with but no such thing  though susan was her own good hearty self elizabeth had not recovered either on that day of the next from the effects of the pleasuring  on each she cried over her lessons and was cross at whatever the boys said to her made a fuss about keeping the ornamental cases of the bonbons and went about roundbacked peevish and discontented finding everything flat and ugly after her one peep at the luxuries of the park  her farthings melted away fast but she seemed to think this her misfortune not her fault she did not try to talk to miss fosbrook feeling perhaps that she was in a naughty mood which she would not try to shake off and she made no attempt to go on with her present for her mamma it looked so poor and trumpery after the beautiful things she had seen  nor did christabel like to remind her of it fearing that the occasion for giving it might never come but she did feel that it was a mournful thing to see the child who was in danger of so fearful a sorrow wasting her grief in pining after foolish fancies and turning what should have been a refreshing holiday into an occasion of longing after what she thus made into pomps and vanities of this wicked world  christabel had heard that people who murmur among blessings often have those blessings snatched away and this made her tremble for poor little discontented elizabeth    chapter x    there exclaimed susan i really have got a letter from papa himself  what a prize  youll have to mind your grosvenor when you answer him said sam but hollo whats the matter  for susans eyes had grown large and her whole face scarlet and she gave a little cry as she read  your mamma my dear asked miss fosbrook  oh mammamamma is so very ill and susan throw the letter down and broke into a fit of sobbing  sam caught it up and elizabeth came to read it with him both standing still and not speaking a word but staring at the letter with their eyes fixed  what is it my dear said miss fosbrook tenderly putting her arm round susan but she sobbed too much to make a word distinct and bessie held out the letter to her governess looking white and too much awed to speak  captain merrifield wrote in short plain sad words that he thought it right that his children should know how matters stood  the doctors treatment for which their mother had been taken to london had not succeeded but had occasioned such terrible illness that unless by the mercy of god she became much better in the course of a day or two she could not live  if she should be worse he would either write or telegraph and susan and sam must be ready to set out at once on the receipt of such a message and come up by the next train to london where they should be met at the station  he had promised their mother that in case of need he would send for them   god bless you my poor children and have mercy on us all your loving father h merrifield   that was all and christabel felt more than even the children did from how full and heavy a heart those words had been written  though she hardly knew how to speak she tried to comfort susan by showing her that her father had evidently not given up all hope but susan was crying more at the thought of her mammas present illness and pain than with fear of the future and sam said sadly he would not have written at all unless it had been very bad indeed  yes said miss fosbrook but i believe in cases like this there is often great fear and then very speedy improvement  oh dear said bessie speaking for the first time i know it will be  little girls in storybooks always do have their mammasdie  storybooks are all nonsense so it wont happen said sam and really it seemed as if the habit of contradicting bessie had suggested to him the greatest consolation that had yet occurred  just then henry and the younger ones came in and learnt the tidings henry wept as bitterly as his elder sister and john and annie both did the same but david did not speak one word as if he hardly took in what was the matter and going to the window took up his lesson books as usual  it is nine oclock hal said sam presently  oh we cant go to mr carey today said hal  yes we shall returned sam  oh dont cried susan  suppose a telegraph should come  well then you can send for me said sam  come hal  how can you sam said henry crossly i know mr carey will give us leave when he knows  i dont want leave said sam i dont want to kick up a row as youll do if you stay at home  well then if the message comes i shall take susie to london instead of you  im sure they want me most  no go down to mr careys with your brother if you please hal said miss fosbrook decidedly  if he should tell you not to stay i cant help it but you will none of you do any good by hanging about without doing your daily duties  hal saw he had no chance and marched off muttering about its being very hard  sam picked up his books and turned to go with a grave steady look that was quite manly in its sadness only stopping to say now jackie you be goodplease miss fosbrook let him run down after me if the message comes and ill be back before the horse is out  miss fosbrook promised and could not help shaking hands with the brave boy if only to show that she felt with him  then must we all do our lessons asked annie disconsolately when he was gone  yes my dear i think we shall all be the better for not neglecting what we ought to do  but there is one thing that we can do for your dear mamma you know what i mean  suppose you each went away alone for five minutes and were to come back when i ring the little bell  the first to come back was annie with the question in a low whisper miss fosbrook will god make mamma better if we are very good  miss fosbrook kissed her saying my dear little girl i cannot tell  all i can certainly tell you is that he hears the prayers of good children and if it be better for her and for you he will give her back to you  annie did not quite understand but she entered into what miss fosbrook said enough to wish to be good so she took up her book and began to learn with all her might  elizabeth would have thought it much more like a little girl in a book to have done no lessons but have sat thinking and perhaps reading the bible all day but on the whole elizabeth had hardly thoughts enough to last her so long nor was she deep or serious enough to have done herself much good by keeping the bible open before her  in fact she did lose her verse in merely reading the chapter for the day  so it was just as well that she had something to do that was not play and that was a duty and thus might give the desire to be good something to bear upon  but christabel saw by susans face and heard in the shaken voice with which she took her turn in the reading that she could not have given her mind to her tasks and did not need them to keep her out of mischief  it would have been cruel to have required her to sit down to them just then and her governess was glad to be able to excuse her on account of the packingup  all her things and sams must be got ready in case of an immediate start and she was sent up to the nursery to take care of the little ones while nurse and mary mended ironed and packed  to be sure nurse freeman made poor susan unnecessarily unhappy by being sure that it was all the fault of the london doctors but she was a kind tender old woman and her petting was a great comfort to the poor girl  what did her most good however was sitting quite quiet with the little ones while they were asleep and all alone it seemed to rest and compose her and she always loved to be in charge of them  poor child she might soon have to be their little mother she was able to play with them when they awoke and cheered herself up with their pretty ways and by finding how quickly baby was learning to walk  ah but would mamma ever see her walk  if any of the children thought it unjust that susans lessons should be let off they were wrong  parents and teachers must have the power of doing such things without being judged  sometimes they see that a child is really unable to learn when the others perceive no difference and it would be very harsh and cruel to oppress one who is out of order for fear little silly idle healthy things should think themselves hardly used  at any rate the lessons were capitally done and when the children met again they were all so much brighter and more hopeful that they quite believed that their mamma was going to get better very fast bessie especially was so resolved that thus it should be that she shut herself into miss fosbrooks room and drew and painted with all her might as if preparing for mammas birthday made it certain that it would be kept  the boys brought word that they would have a holiday the next day as it was the feast of st  barnabas and after morning service mr carey was going to meet his brother and bring him home  i shall be all the more certain to get the sovereign or two sovereigns said henry to david the only person whom he could find to listen to him if sam is gone and everyone will be caring about me  and then youll give it to the pig said david  oh yes to be sure  you will grow into a pig yourself if you go on that way david  however david partaking the family distrust of hals birdsinthe bush and being started on the subject of the hoard ran up to sam who was learning his lessons by way of something to do and said if you go to london sam may i have your sixpence on monday for the pig  i dont know that i am going  but if you door we shant get the pig  i dont care  dont you care if we dont get the pig  no  be off with you  david next betook himself to his eldest sister who was trying to write to her father and finding such a letter harder and sadder work than that to ida greville though no one teased her about writing blots or spelling  if you go to london susie said he in the very same words may i have your sixpence on monday for the pig  oh davie dont be tiresome  david only said it over again in the same words and put his hand down on her letter in his earnestness  come away davie said miss fosbrook dont tease your sister  i want her to say i may have her sixpence on monday for the pig  no you shant then said susan angrily you care for the nasty pig more than for poor mamma or anyone else and you shant have it  so seldom did susan say anything cross that everyone looked up surprised  miss fosbrook saw that it was sheer unhappiness that made her speak sharply and would not take any notice except by gently taking away the pertinacious david  he was very much distressed at the refusal and when miss fosbrook told him that his brother and sister could not think of such things when they were in such trouble he only answered but hannah higgins wont get her pig  miss fosbrook was vexed herself that her friend david should seem possessed with this single idea as if it shut out all others from his mind  he was consoled fast enough for susan with another great sob threw down her pen and coming up to stroke him down with her inky fingers cried out o davie davie i didnt mean it i dont know why i said it  you shall have my sixpence or anything  but oh dear i wish the message was come and we were going to dear mamma for i cant write and i dont know what to do  then she went back to her place and tried to write and sat with her head on her hand and dawdled and cried and blotted till it grew so near posttime that at last miss fosbrook took the longest of her scrawls and writing three lines at the bottom to say how it was with them all directed it to captain merrifield thinking that he would like it better than nothing from home sent it off and made susan come out to refresh her hot eyes and burning head in the garden  sam presently came and walked on her other side gravely and in silence glad to be away from the chatter and disputes of the younger ones  that summons had made them both feel older and less like children than ever before but they did not speak much only when they sat down on a garden bench as miss fosbrook held susans hand she presently found some rough hard young fingers stealing into her own on the other side and saw sams eyes glistening with unshed tears  she stroked his hand and they dropped fast  but he was ashamed to cry and quickly dried them  i think she said that you will be a man sam take care of susan and be a comfort to your father  i hope i shall said sam but i dont know how  nobody can tell how beforehand she said  only watch to see what he may seem to want to have done for him  sit quietly by and dont get in the way  were you ever so unhappy miss fosbrook asked susan  yes once i was when my father was knocked down by an omnibus and was very ill  tell us about it said susan  she did tell them of her week of sorrow and anxious care of the younger children and the brightening ray of hope at last  it seemed to freshen both up and give them hopes for each drew a long sigh of relief and then sam said papa wrote to mr carey  she is to be prayed for in church tomorrow  oh said susan with a sound as of dismay which made christabel ask in wonder why she was sorry when from susans halfuttered words she found that the little girl fancied that a happy issue out of all her afflictions meant death  oh no my dear she said  what it means is that the afflictions may end happily in whatever way god may see to be best it may be in getting well it may be the other way  at any rate it is asking that the distress may be over not saying how  isnt there some other prayer in the prayerbook about it said sam looking straight before him  i will show you where to find it in the visitation of the sick  i dare say it has often been read to her  the boy and girl came in with her and brought their prayerbooks to her room that she might mark them  this had been a strange long sad day of waiting and watching for the telegram and the children even fancied it might come in the middle of the night but miss fosbrook thought this unlikely and looked for the morrows post  there was no letter  it was very disappointing but miss fosbrook thought it a good sign since at least the danger could not be more pressing and delay always left room for hope  the children readily believed her they were too young to go on dwelling long on what was not in sight and even susan was cheerful and able to think about other things after her nights rest and the relief of not hearing a worse account  the children might do as they pleased about going to church on saints days and on this day all the three girls wished to go as soon as it had been made clear that even if the message should come before the short service would be over there would be ample time to reach the station before the next train  miss fosbrook was glad to prove this for not only did she wish to have them in church but she thought the weary watching for the telegram was the worst thing possible for susan  sam was also going to church but henry hung back after accompanying them to the end of the kitchengarden  i wouldnt go sam just suppose if the message came without anyone at home and you had to set out at once  we couldnt said sam theres no train  oh but they always put on a special train whenever anyone is ill  then there would be plenty  at least they did when mr grevilles mother was ill so they will now and then you may ride upon the engine for there wont be any carriages you know  i say sam if you go to church and the telegraph comes i shall set off  youll do no such thing said sam  you had much better come to church  no i shant  it is like a girl to go to church on a weekday  it is much more like a girl to mind what a couple of asses like the grevilles say returned sam taking up his cap and running after his sisters and their governess  it is quite right observed henry to john and david who alone remained to listen to him that one of us should stay in case the telegraph comes in and there are any orders to give  i can catch the pony you know and ride off to bonchamp and if the special train is there i shall get upon the engine  but it is sam and susan who are going  oh thats only because sam is eldest  i know mamma would like to have me much better because i dont walk hard like sam and when i get there she will be so much better already and we shall be all right and admiral penrose will be so delighted at my courage in riding on the engine and putting out the explosion or something that he will give me my appointment as naval cadet at once and i shall have a dirk and a uniform and a chest of my own and be an officer and get promoted for firing redhot shot out of the batteries at gibraltar  master hal exclaimed purday dont throw them little apples about  they are redhot shot purday  ill redhot shot you if you break my cucumber frames young gentleman  come get out with you  probably anxiety made purday cross as well as everyone else or else he distrusted henrys discretion without sam for he hunted the little boys away wherever they went  now they would break the cucumber frames now they would meddle with the gooseberries or trample on the beds and at last he only relented so far as to let david stay with him on condition of being very good and holding the little cabbages as he planted them out  master davie was a solemn one purday said and they were great friends but hal and johnnie were fairly turned out as their idle hands were continually finding fresh mischief to do in their sauntering desultory mood  i think said hal since purday is so savage well go and look out at the gate and then we shall see if the telegraph comes  johnnie had no clear idea what a telegraph was and was curious to know how it would come rather expecting it to be a man in a red coat on horseback blowing a horna sight that certainly was not to be missed so he willingly strolled down after henry to the gate leading to the lane  i cant see any way at all said henry looking out into the lane i shall get up and so see over into the bend of the road and hal mounted to the topmost bar of the gate and sat astride there john scrambling after him not quite so easily his legs being less long and his dress less convenient  both knew that their papa strongly objected to their climbing on this iron gate the newest and handsomest thing about the place but thought hal of course no one will care what i do when i am so anxious about poor mamma and thought johnnie what hal does of course i may do  so there the two young gentlemen sat perched each with one leg on either side of the new iron gate  it was rather like sitting on the edge of a knife and john could scarcely reach his toes down to rest them on the bar below but he held on by the spikes and it was so new and glorious a position that it made up for a good deal to be five feet above the road moreover hal said it was just like the masthead of a manofwarat least when the waves didnt dash right overhead like the picture of the eddystone lighthouse  hollo what a couple of cherubs aloft cried a voice from the road and looking round henry beheld the two grevilles  yes he answered its very jolly up here  eh is it  riding on a razor to my mind  come down and have a lark said osmond while martin undoing the gate proceeded to swing it backwards and forwards to johns extreme terror but the more he clung to the spikes and cried for mercy the quicker martin swung it shouting with laughter at his fright  henry meanwhile scrambled and tumbled to the ground and caught the gate and held it fast while he asked what his friends had been about  one held up a scarlet flask of powder the other a bag of shot  you havent got a gun  no but we know where gardener keeps his and the governors out for the day  come along hal  you shall have your turn  i dont want to go far from home today  oh stuff  what was it mamma heard osmond  that your mother was ever so much better wasnt it  i thought it was worse said osmond  well never mind  your hanging about here wont do her any good i suppose  no but  oh hell catch it from the governessi say how many seams shall you have to sew today hal  i dont sew seams  i do as i please  ha  is that them coming out of church  oh it is it is cried john from his elevation  oh help me down hal  but henry did not want miss fosbrook to find him partaking in gate climbing and either that desire or the general terror a bad conscience made him and the grevilles run helterskelter the opposite way leaving poor little john stuck on the top of the gate quite giddy at the thought of coming down alone and almost as much afraid of being there caught by miss fosbrook coming home from church  it was a false alarm after all that the congregation were coming out  john would have been glad if they had for nothing could be more miserable than sitting up there his fingers tired of clutching the spikes his feet strained with reaching down to the bar his legs chilled with the wind his head almost giddy when he thought of climbing down  he would have cried could he have spared a hand to rub his eyes with he had a great mind to have roared for help especially when he heard feet upon the road but these turned out to belong to five little village boys still smaller than himself who when they saw the young gentleman on his perch all stood still in a row with their mouths wide open staring at him  johnnie scorned to let them think he was not riding there for his own pleasure so he tried to put a bold face of the matter and look as much at ease and indifferent as he could under great bodily fear and discomfort the injury of his brothers desertion the expectation of disgrace and the reflection that he was being disobedient to his parents in the height of their trouble  there is nothing in grief that of necessity makes children or grown people good  sometimes especially when there is suspense it fills them with excitement as well as putting them out of their usual habits and thus it often happens that there are tremendous explosions of naughtiness just when some one is ill in a house and the children ought to be most good  but it is certain that unless trouble be taken in the right way it makes people worse instead of better    chapter xi    hal had got into a mood in which he was tired of fears and of waiting for tidings and was glad to shake off the thought and be carried along to something new he and the grevilles were rather fond of one anothers company in an idle sort of way  they put him up to things as he said they made a variety and he was always glad of listeners to his wonderful stories which rather diverted the other boys who though they sometimes made game of them were much less apt to pick them to pieces than was sam  poor captain merrifield what had not befallen him according to his son  he had been stuck on to a rock of loadstone he had been bitten by mosquitos as big as jackdawsat least as jacksnipes he had sat down to rest on the trunk of a fallen tree and it whisked him over on his face and turned out to he a rattlesnakeat least a boa constrictor  nay henry discoursed on the ponies he had himself tamed the rabbits he had shot the trees he had climbed the nests he had found the rats he had killed in terms he durst not use when his brother was by or if he did and sam brought him to book he always said it was all fun  it often seemed as if he did not himself know whether he meant to be believed or otherwise and as to his intentions for his sailor life they were as has been already seen of the most splendid character  sometimes he shot the french admiral dead from the masthead sometimes he sailed into plymouth with the whole enemys fleet behind him sometimes he the youngest midshipman rescued the whole crew in a wreck where all the other officers were drowned sometimes he shot a shark through the head just as it was about to make a meal of prince alfred  he certainly was thus an entertaining companion to those who did not pay heed to truth and liked to hear or laugh at great swelling words and the grevilles on their idle day were glad to have him with them and were rather curious to prove how much fact there was in his boast of being a most admirable shot  meddling with guns was absolutely forbidden to all the three except by special permission and with an elder looking on but the grevilles were not in the habit of obeying except when they were forced to do so and henry having once begun to think no one would heed his present doings was ready to go on rather than be accused of minding his governess  so the gardeners gun was taken from the hidingplace whither it had been conveyed from the toolhouse and the three boys ran off together their first object being to get out of the greville grounds where they could be met by any of the men  they got quite out into the fields before they ventured to stop that osmond might load the gun  each was to take a shot in turn osmond tried first at a poor innocent young thrush newly come out for his earliest flight  happily he missed it martin claimed the next and for want of anything better to shoot took aim at the scarecrow in the middle of farmer grices beans  he was sure that he had hit it and showed triumphantly the great holes in its hat but the other boys were strongly persuaded that they had been there before  well come away said osmond this is a great deal too near old grices farmyard  if we go popping about here we shall have him out upon us for an old tiger as he is  come along then said martin  but hal had just got the gun and saw something so black and shiny through the hedge that he was persuaded that a flock of rooks were feeding in the next field and he fired  such a cackling and screeching as arose and with it one dying gobble and a very loud hollo you rascal  my eyes youve been and gone and done it cried osmond  cut cut screamed martin and hal not exactly knowing what he had done but sure that it was something dreadful and hearing voices in pursuit threw down the gun and took to his heels but the others had the start of him and were over the gap long before he could get to it  and even as he did reach it a hand was on his throat almost choking him and a tremendous voice cried you young poacher you shant get off that way  ill have you up to the bench that i will for shooting the poor old turkeycock before my very eyes  oh dont dont  i didnt mean it cried hal turning in the terrible grip i thought it was only a rook  a rook i dare say  and what business had you to think coming trespassing here on my ground and breaking the hedges  id have you up for that if for nothing else you young vagabond  oh dont dont  im henry merrifield  i dont care if youre henry merry andrew said farmer grice who was a surly man and had a grudge of long standing against the captain for withstanding him at the board of guardians  ill have the law out of you whoever you are  butbutmamma is so very ill cried hal bursting into tears  the more shame for you to be rampaging about the country this fashion said the farmer giving him a shake that seemed to make all his bones rattle in his skin  serve you right if i flogged you within an inch of your life  oh please donti mean please doanything but have me up to the magistrates  ill never do it again never sobbed henry in his terror  mr grice had some pity and also knew that his wife and all the neighbours would be shocked at his prosecuting so young a boy whose parents were in such distress  so he said there then ill overlook it this time sir so as i have the value of the bird  and what is the value asked henry trembling  value  why the breed came from norfolk he was three years old and my missus set great store on him he was as good as a housedog to keep idle children out of the yard and it was quite a picture to see him posturing about and setting up his tail  value not less than fiveandtwenty shillings sir  but i have not fiveandtwenty shillings  i cant get them said hal falling back into misery  you should have thought of that before you shot poor old tom turkey quoth farmer grice  but what in the world shall i ever do said henry  thats for you to settle sir said the farmer taking up the unlucky gun  i shall take this and keep it out of further harm  oh pray pray cried henry  it is not my gun it is mr grevilles please let me have it  what was it those young dogs the master grevilles that were with you growled mr grice  if id known that id not have let you off so easy  those boys are the plague of the place i wish it had been one of them as id caught id have had some satisfaction out of them  henry entreated again for the gun explaining that they had not leave to take it but the farmer was unrelenting  he might go to them he said to make up the price of the poor turkeycock how they could have got the gun was no affair of his have it they should not till the money was brought to him and if it did not come before night he should carry the gun up to the park and complain to mr greville  with this answer the unhappy hal was released and ran after his friends to tell them of the terms  he found them sitting on a low wall just within their own grounds waiting to hear what had become of him  when he had told his story they both set upon him for betraying them and declared that they should send him to coventry ever after and never do anything with him again but as it was plain that the gun must be redeemed if they wished to avoid severe punishment there was a consultation  nobody had much money but osmond consolingly suspected that the farmer would take less five andtwenty shillings was an exorbitant price to set on a turkey cocks head and perhaps half would content him  the half however seemed as impossible as the whole  osmond had three shillings martin two hal fourpence  what was to be done and the boys declared that if it should come to their fathers knowledge hal who had given up their names should certainly not be shielded by them  in fact he who had done the deed was the only one who ought to pay  the sound of the servants dinnerbell at the park broke up the consultation the boys must not be missed at luncheon and they therefore separated agreeing to meet at that same place at four oclock to hear the result of hals negotiation with the farmer for neither of the grevilles would hear of helping him to face the enemy  poor hal plodded home disconsolately  once he thought of telling sam and asking his help but sam would be so much shocked at such a scrape at such a time as possibly to lick him for it before helping him  indeed hal did not see much chance of sam being able to do anything for them and he had too often boasted over his elder brother to like to abase himself by such a confessionwhen too it would almost be owning how much better it would have been to have followed sams advice and have gone safely to church  could he borrow of any one  had he nothing of his own to sell or exchange  ah if it had not been for that stupid hoard of little davids he might have had even so much  bythebye some of that collection was his own  he might quite lawfully take that back again  how much could it be  how much did he put in last week the week before  oh never mind some of it was his at all events there was no harm in taking that  most likely he should be able to restore it fourfold when colonel carey made his present or if not nobody knew exactly what was in toby fillpot and after all very likely they would forget all about it people could not think about pigs when mamma was ill or maybe he should go to join his ship and hear no more of it  so he came home and crossed the paddock just as the dinnerbell was ringing opening the halldoor as the children were running across it to the diningroom  miss fosbrook who was walking behind them turned as he came in  henry she said i have sent johnnie to dine in the nursery for his disobedience in climbing the gate  i certainly shall not give you a less punishment  you must have led him into it and how could you be so cruel as to leave the poor little fellow alone in such a dangerous place  stupid little coward it was not a bit of danger said hal  so young a child began miss fosbrook  oh thats all your london notions said hal  why i climbed up our gate at stonehouse which was twice as high when i wasnt near as old as that  i am not going to argue with you henry but after such an act of disobedience i cannot allow you to sit down to dinner with us  go up to the schoolroom and mary shall bring you your dinner  im sure i dont want to dine with a lot of babies and governesses exclaimed henry and bounced upstairs leaving miss fosbrook quite confounded at such an outbreak of naughtiness  she intended as soon as dinner should be over to go up to him and try to lead him to be sorry for his conduct and to think what a wretched moment this was for such audacity and then she feared that she ought to punish him farther by keeping him in all the afternoon he was so soft and easily impressed that she almost trusted to make him feel that it would be right that he should suffer for his misconduct  when she went upstairs almost as soon as grace had been said he was gone  nobody could find him and calling produced no answer she became quite distressed and anxious but could not go far from the house herself nor send sam in case the message should arrive  oh said sam no doubt hes after something with the grevilles and was afraid you would stop him in  she tried to believe this but still felt far from satisfied all the afternoon and was glad to see the boy come back in time for tea  he said he had been with the grevilles he did not see why anybody need ask him questions he should do what he pleased without being called to account  nobody told him not to run away after dinner he was not going to stay to be ordered about for nothing  this was so bad a temper that christabel could not bear to try to touch him with the thought of his sick mother  she knew that softening must come in time and believed the best thing to do at the moment would be to put a stop to his disrespectful speeches to her and his cross ones to his brothers and sisters by sending him to bed as soon as tea was over as the completion of his punishment  he did not struggle for she had taught him to mind her but he went up stairs with a gloomy brow and angry murmurs that it was very hard to be put under a stupid woman who knew nothing about anything and was always cross    chapter xii    saturdays post brought a letter and a comfortable one  all thursday mrs merrifield had been in so doubtful a state that her husband could not bear to write lest he should fill the children with false hopes or alarm them still more but she had had a good night was stronger on friday and when the post went out the doctors had just ventured to say they believed she would recover favourably  the letter was finished off in a great hurry but captain merrifield did not forget to thank his little susan warmly for her poor scrambling letter and say he knew all she meant by it bidding her give miss fosbrook his hearty thanks for forwarding it and for telling him the children were all behaving well and feeling properly  his love to them all they must try to deserve the great mercy that had been granted to them  to the children this was almost as good as saying that their mother was well again but there was too much awe about them for their joy to show itself noisily  susan ran away to her own room and bessie followed her and sam said no word only miss fosbrook remarked that he did not eat two mouthfuls of breakfast  she would not take any notice she knew his heart was full and when she looked round on that little flock and thought of the grievous sorrow scarcely yet averted from them she could hardly keep the tears from blinding her they were all somewhat still and grave and it was too happy a morning to be broken into by the reproofs that henry deserved even more richly than christabel knew  she had almost forgotten his bad behaviour and when she remembered something of it she could not but hope that silence on such a day as this might bring it home to him more than rebuke  yet when breakfast was ever he was among the loudest of those who shaking off the strange awed gravity of deep gladness went rushing together into the garden feeling that they might give way to their spirits again  sam shouted and whooped as if he were casting off a burthen and picking little george up in his arms tossed him and swung him round in the air in an ecstasy while john and annie and david went down on the grass together and tumbled and rolled one over the other like three kittens their legs and arms kicking about so that it was hard to tell whose property were the black shoes that came wriggling into view  susan was quieter  she told nurse the good news and then laid hold upon baby and carried her off into the passage to hug all to herself  she could tell no one but baby how very happy she was and how her heart had trembled at her mothers suffering her fathers grief and at the desolateness that had so nearly come on them  oh she was very happy very thankful but she could not scream it out like the others baby must have it all in kisses  christabel said a little voice when all the others were gone i shall never be pipy again  you must try to fight against it my dear  because said elizabeth coming close up to her when dear mamma was so ill it did seem so silly to mind about not having pretty things like ida and the boys plaguing and so on  yes my dear a real trouble makes us ashamed of our little discontents  i said so many times yesterday and the day before that i would never mind things again if only mamma would get well and come home said the little girl and i never shall  you will not always find it easy not to mind said christabel but if you try hard you will learn how to keep from showing that you mind  oh said elizabeth and a great mouthful of an oh it was those things are grown so silly and little now  you have seen them in their true light for once my dear  and now that you have so great cause of thankfulness to god you feel that your foolish frets and discontents were unthankful  yes said bessie her eyes cast down as they always were when anything of this kind was said to her as if she did not like to meet the look fixed on her  well then bessie try to make the giving up of these murmurs your thankoffering to god  suppose every day when you say your prayers you were to add something like this and she wrote down on a little bit of paper o thou who hast raised up my mother from her sickness teach me to be a thankful and contented child and to guard my words and thoughts from peevishness  isnt it too small to pray about said elizabeth  nothing is too small to pray about my dear  do you think this little midge is too small for god to have made it and given it life and spread that motherofpearl light on its wings  do you think yourself too small to pray or your fault too small to pray about  elizabeth cast down her eyes  she did not quite think it was a fault but she did not say so  bessie what was the great sin of the israelites in the wilderness  the colour on her cheek showed that she knew  they tempted god by murmurs said christabel  they tried his patience by grumbling when his care and blessings were all round them and by crying out because all was not just as they liked  now dear bessie god has shown you what a real sorrow might be will it not be tempting him to go back to complaints over what he has ordained for you  i shall net complain now i shall not care said elizabeth  but she took the little bit of paper and christabel trusted that she would make use of it knowing that in this lay her hope of cure for whatever she might think in this first joy of relief her little troubles were sure to seem quite as unbearable while they were upon her as if she had never feared a great one  however nothing remarkable happened everyone was bright and happy but still the influence of their past alarm subdued them enough to make them quiet and wellbehaved both on saturday and sunday and miss fosbrook had never had so little trouble with them  in consideration of this and of the agitation and unsettled state that had put the last week out of all common rules she announced on monday morning that she would excuse all the fines and that all the children should have their allowance unbroken  maybe she was moved to this by the suspicion that these four sixpences and three threepennies would make up the fund to the price of a reasonable pig and she thought it time that davids perseverance should be rewarded and room made in his mind for something beyond swine and halfpence  her announcement was greeted by the girls with eager thanks by the boys with a tremendous three times three for miss fosbrook and bessie was so joyous that instead of crying out against the noise she joined in with susan and annie but they made such a ridiculous little squeaking that sam laughed at them and took to mocking their queer thin hurrahs  yet even this elizabeth could bear  david was meanwhile standing by the locker his fingers at work as if he were playing a tune his lips counting away ninetytwo ninety three ninetyfourthats me ninetyfive ninetysix ninetyseven thats jack and so on till having plodded up diligently he turned round with a little scream one hundred and twenty  thats the pig  what cried annie  one hundred and twenty pence  sukey said one hundred and twenty pence were ten shillings  that will do it  thats the pig  oh weve done it  may i take it to purday  it was to be let alone till fairday you little bother said hal  no no no cried many voices only till we had enough  and i am sure nobody knows if we have added hal hotly  a lot of halfpence indeed  but i know hal insisted david  there are eightynine pence and one farthing in toby fillpot and this makes one hundred and twenty two pence and one farthing  youd no business to peep said sam  i didnt peep said david indignantly  there were fortyeight pence at first and then susie had three that was fiftyone  and he would have gone on like a little calculating machine with the entire reckoning in his head if the others had had patience to hear but annie and johnnie were urgent to have the sum counted out before their eyes  hal roughly declared it was against the rules and little inquisitives must not have their way  but others were also inquisitive and sam said it would be best to know how much they had that purday might be told to look out for a pig at the price besides he wanted to have it over it was such a bore not to have any money  its not fair cried henry passionately  you dont keep the rules  you shant have my sixpence i can tell you and i wonti wont stay and see it  nobody wants you said sam  i didnt know there were any rules said the girls but hal was already off  hal has only put in fivepencehalfpenny said david so no wonder he is ashamed  such a big boy with sixpence a week  but if he wont let us have his sixpence now  never mind we will make it up next week said susan  now then who will take toby down said miss fosbrook unbuttoning one glass door and undoing the two bolts of the second behind which the cup of money stood  susie ought because she is the eldest  davie ought because he is the youngest  david stood on a chair to take toby off his shelf  solemn was the face with which the little boy lifted the mug by the handle putting his other hand to steady the expected weight of coppers but there was at once a frown a little cry of horror  toby came up so light in his hand that all his great effort was thrown away and only made him stagger back in dismay falling backward from the chair and poor toby crashing to pieces on the floor as he fell while out rolled one solitary farthing  nobody spoke for some moments but all stood perfectly still staring as hard as if they hoped the pence would be brought out by force of looking for them  then davids knuckles went up into his eyes and he burst forth in a loud bellow  it was the first time miss fosbrook had heard him cry and she feared that he had been hurt by the fall or cut by the broken crockery but he struck out with foot and fist as if his tears were as much anger as grief and roared out i want the halfpence for my pig  sam sam cried susan if you have hid them for a trick let him have them  ii play tricks now exclaimed sam in indignation  no indeed  then perhaps hal has said elizabeth  for shame bessie cried sam  i only know said elizabeth half in selfdefence half in fright that one of you must have been at the babyhouse for i found the doors open and shut them up  and why should it be one of us demanded sam while david stopped crying and listened  because none of the younger ones can reach to undo the doors said elizabeth  it was as much as i could do to reach the upper bolt though i stood upon a chair  this was evident for the babyhouse was really an oldfashioned bureau and below the glass doors there was a projecting slope of polished walnut upon which only a fly could stand and which was always locked  no one whose years were less than half a score was tall enough to get a good hold of the button even from the highest chair far less to jerk down the rather stiff upper bolt  it cannot have been a little one certainly said miss fosbrook but you should not be so ready to accuse your brothers bessie  david however had laid hold of a hope and getting up from the floor hastened out of the room followed by john and they were presently heard shouting hal all over the house  what day was it that you found the door open bessie asked miss fosbrook  it was just after dinner said elizabeth recollecting herself  it was on friday  yes i remember it was friday because i went into the schoolroom to get my pencil and i was afraid hal would jump out upon me and looked in first to see whether he was going to be tiresome but he was gone  yes said susan it was the day we found poor jack stuck up on the gate when he and hal were in disgrace  oh he never would have played tricks then  did you go up before me bessie asked miss fosbrook for i went up directly after dinner to speak to henry  yes i did said she  i thought if you got in first you would be scolding him ever so long and would let nobody in so i would get my pencil first and i slipped up before you had left the table  just then the two boys were heard stumping up the stairs and ran in panting with haste and excitement david with a fiery red ear  no no hal didnt hide it  but he boxed davies ear for thinking he did added john and said hed do the same for spiteful bet  then he never played tricks said susan  i told you not said sam  no reiterated david and he said id no business to ask and if bet went prying about everywhere id better ask her  have you got it betty  i cried elizabeth  how can you davie  you have got a secret exclaimed david and you always were cross about hannah higginss pig  you have got it to tease me  miss fosbrook make her give it back  nonsense david said miss fosbrook bessie is quite to be trusted and it is wrong to make unfounded accusations  never mind betty added sam kindly if davie wasnt a little donkey he wouldnt say such things  where is henry asked the governess  why did he not come himself call him i want to know if he observed this door being open  he is gone down to mr careys said john  and it is high time you were there too sam said miss fosbrook starting  if you are late beg mr careys pardon from me and tell him that i kept you  sam was obliged to run off at full speed and the other children stood about still aghast and excited  miss fosbrook however told them to take out their books  she would not do anything more till she had had time to think and had composed their minds and her own for she was exceedingly shocked and felt herself partly in fault for having left the hoard in an unlocked cupboard  she feared to do anything hastily lest she should bring suspicion on the innocent and she thought all would do better if time were given for settling down  all were disappointed at thus losing the excitement fancying perhaps that instant search and inquiry would hunt up the money and david put himself quite into a sullen fit  no he would not turn round nor read nor do anything unless miss fosbrook would make stingy bet give up the pence  miss fosbrook and susan both tried to argue with him but he had set his mind upon one point so vehemently that it was making him absolutely stupid to everything else and he was such a little boy only five years old that his mind could hardly grasp the exceeding unlikelihood of a girl like elizabeth committing such a theft either in sport or earnest nor understand the injury of such a suspicion he only knew that she had a secreta counter secret to his pig and when she hotly assured him that she had never touched the money and susan backed her up with there she says she did not he answered she once told a story  elizabeth coloured deep red and susan cried out loudly that it was a shame in david then explained that it was a long long time ago that hal and bessie broke the drawingroom window by playing at ball with little hard apples and had not told but when questioned had said no but indeed they had been so sorry then that she knew they would never do so again  again david showed that he could not enter into this and sulkily repeated she told a story  i will have no more of this said christabel resolutely  you are all working yourselves up into a bad spirit  and not another word will i hear on this matter till lessons are over  that tone was always obeyed but lessons did not prosper the children were all restless and unsettled and david hitherto for his age her best scholar took no pains and seemed absolutely stupefied what did he care for fines if the chance of the pig was gone  and he was sullenly angry with miss fosbrook for using no measures to recover the money fancied she did not care and remembered the foolish nursery talk about her favouring bessie  once miss fosbrook heard a little gasping from the corner and looking round saw poor bessie crying quietly over her slate and trying hard to check herself  she would not have noticed her though longing to comfort her if david had not cried out bet is crying a fine  no said miss fosbrook but a fine for an illnatured speech that has made her cry  she has got the pigs money muttered david  say that again and i shall punish you david  he looked her full in the face and said it again  she was thoroughly roused to anger and kept her word by opening the door of a small dark closet and putting david in till dinnertime  then she and susan both tried to soothe bessie by reminding her how childish david was how he had caught up some word that probably hal had flung out without meaning it and how no one of any sense suspected her for a moment  it is so illnatured and hard sobbed bessie  to think i could steal  i think they hate me  ah said susan if you only would never be cross to the boys bessie and not keep out of what they care for they would never think it  yes susie is right there said christabel  if you try to be one with the others and make common cause with them giving up and forbearing they never will take such things into their heads  and we dont now said susan cheerily  didnt you hear sam say nobody but a donkey could think it  but bessie has a secret said annie  again stout susan said for shame  ill tell you what my secret is began bessie  no said susan dont tell it dear  well trust you without and sam will say the same  bessie flung her arms round susans neck as if she only now knew the comfort of her dear good sister  lessons were resumed and as soon as these were done miss fosbrook resolved on a thorough search  some strange fit of mischief or curiosity might have actuated some one and the money be hidden away so she brought david out of his cupboard and with susans help turned out every drawer and locker in the schoolroom forbidding the others to touch or assist  they routed out queer nests of broken curiosities disturbed old dusty dens of rubbish peeped behind every row of books but made no discovery worth mentioning except the left leg of annies last doll the stuffing of johnnies ball the tiger out of georges noahs ark and the first sheet of sams latin grammar all stuffed together into a mousehole in the skirting  at dinner christabel forbade the subject to be mentioned not only to hinder quarrelsome speeches but to prevent the loss being talked of among the servants since she feared that one of them must have committed the theft and though anxious not to put it into the childrens heads suspected rhoda the little nurserygirl who was quite a child and had not long been in the house  henry ate his dinner in haste but could not get away till miss fosbrook had called him away from the rest and told him that if he had been playing a trick on his little brother it was time to put an end to it before any innocent person fell under suspicion  iive been playing no tricksat least  without any at least henry have you hidden the money  no  you dined in the schoolroom on friday  were the babyhouse doors open then  iim sure i didnt notice  you didnt open them to take anything out  what should i want with the things in the babyhouse  did you or did you not  ii didntat least  in one word did you open them yes or no  no  what time did you go out after eating your dinner  bother how is one to remember  its all nonsense making such a fuss  the children fancied they put in ever so much more than they did and very likely took out some  no davids reckoning was accurate  i wrote down all i knew of and i am sure none was taken out for early that very morning i had put in a sixpence myself and the cup was then full of coppers with that little silver threepenny of davids with the edge turned up upon the top  then you must have left the door undone said henry delighted  i dare not be positive said christabel but i believe i remember bolting it and if i had not done so it would have flown open sooner  oh but the wind you know  if the doors did open it would not account for the loss of the money  well i cant help it said henry ungraciously trying to move off but she first required him to tell her what he had said to the younger boys to make them suspect elizabeth  did i said henry i am sure i didnt at least if i did i only said bess peeped everywhere and was very close  i didnt suspect her you know  i should think not said miss fosbrook indignantly  now please to come up with me  i want to go out said henry  no she would not let him go  she thought elizabeth ought to clear herself so far as it could be done by making her secret known since that had drawn suspicion on her and when all the children were together she called the little girl and told her so  it is very unkind of them said bessie with trembling lip but they shall see if they want that to show i am not a thief  i said i wouldnt see said susan  you knows bessie i trust you  and i said sam i dont care for peoples secrets  i dont want to pry into bessies  no one followed their example all either really suspected or else were full of curiosity and delighted to gratify it  half a dozen slips of card with poor little coloured drawings on them and as many lengths of penny ribbon  is that all said annie much disappointed  so thats what bet made such a fuss about said john and davids face fell as if he had really expected to see the lost pence  the next thing after the search had been made through all the childrens bedrooms was to go to the nursery  and thither miss fosbrook allowed only susan and sam to follow her  nurse freeman was very stiff and stately but she had no objection to searching and the boy and girl began the hunt while miss fosbrook meantime cautiously asked whether nurse were sure of rhoda and if she were trustworthy  this made mrs freeman very angry and though her words were respectful she showed that she was much offended at the strange lady presuming to suspect anyone especially one under her charge  miss fosbrook wanted to have asked rhoda whether the doors were open or shut when she carried henry his dinner but nurse would not consent to call her  i understood the nursery and the girl were to be my province she said  if miss merrifield heard her mamma say otherwise then it is a different thing  susan cowered into the dark cupboard  nurse must be in a dreadful way to call her miss merrifield instead of missy  nothing more could be done  the pence could not be found  nurse would not let rhoda be examined and all that could be found out from the children had been already elicited  christabel could only beg that no more should be said and her head aching with perplexity hope that some light might yet be thrown on the matter  there must be pain and grief whenever it should be explained but this would be far better even for the offender than the present deception  and the whole family were in a state of irritation and distrust that hurt their tempers and made her bitterly reproach herself with not having prevented temptation by putting the hoard under lock and key  she ordered that no more should be said about it that evening and made herself obeyed but play was dull and everything went off heavily  the next morning susan came back early from her housekeeping business with her honest face grave and unhappy and finding miss fosbrook alone told her she had something really to say to her if she might and this being granted began with the bright look of having found a capital notion  ill tell you what i wish you would do  well  if you would call every one in all the house and ask them on their word and honour if they took the pence  my dear i am not the head of the house and i have no right to do that besides i do not believe it would discover it  what could a thief get in from out of doors said susan looking at the window  hardly that my dear but i am afraid a person who could steal would not scruple to tell a falsehood and i do not wish to cause this additional sin  it is very horrid i cant bear it said susan puckering up her face for tears  do you know miss fosbrook the maids are all so angry that you said anything about rhoda  you did not mention it my dear  oh no nor sam  it was nurse herself  but they all say that you want to take away her character and they wont have strangers put over them  pray susie dont tell me this  it can do no good  oh but please cried susan  and then maryi cant think how she couldbut she said that poor dear bessie was always sly and that she had been at the cupboard and had got the pence but she was your favourite and so you vindicated her  and nurse began teasing her to confess and tell the truth and told her she was a wicked child because she would not but it was all because we were put under strangers  im sure they do set on johnnie and davie to be cross to her  when was this my dear  last night when we went to the nursery to be washed  it was our night you know  oh  i wish mamma was well  indeed i do my dear  and how did poor bessie bear it  she got quite white and never said a word even when they told her she was sulky  but when we got into bed and i kissed her and cuddled her up oh she did cry so i didnt know what to do  so do you know i got my shawl on and went and called sam and he was not gone to sleep and he came and sat by her and told her that he believed her and knew she was as sound a heart of oak as any of us and we both petted her and sam was so nice and kind till she went to sleep  then he went to the nursery and told nurse how horrid it was in her but cook said it only made her worse because she is jealous of our taking part with you  my dear i do like to hear of your kindness to bessie but i wish you would not mind what any of the maids say nor talk to them about it  it only distresses you for nothing  but i cant help it said susan  you could not help this attack in the nursery but you need not talk to cook or mary about it  it is of no use to vex ourselves with what people say who dont know half a story  cant you tell them not said simple susan  no i cannot interfere  they would only do it the more  we can only keep bessie as much out of the way of the maids as we can and show our confidence in her  certainly elizabeth had been known to look infinitely more glum when nothing was the matter than under all this vexation even though the servants were really very unkind to her and her two little brothers both behaved as ill as possible to her whenever they had the opportunitydavid really believing that she had made away with the money and ought to be tortured for it and johnnie taking it on his word and being one of those little boys who have a positive taste for illnature and think it fun  they pinched her they bit her they rubbed out her sums they shut up her lessonbooks and lost her place they put bitten crusts into her plate and did whatever they knew she most disliked whenever miss fosbrook or sam was not in the way but she never told  she did not choose to be called a tell tale and besides they really did not succeed in making her life miserable so much was she pleased with the real kindness her trouble had brought out from susan and sam  susan could not prevent the persecution of the two naughty little boys but she defended her sister to her utmost and sam cuffed them if they said a word or lifted a finger against bessie before him and he gave her such notice and kindness as she never had received from him before  one afternoon when he was going to walk to bonchamp he asked leave for her to come with him and would take nobody else and hot day as it was bessie had never had such a charming walk  she kept herself from making one single fuss and in return he gathered wild strawberries for her showed her a kingfisher and took her to look in at a very grand aquarium in the fishingtackle makers window where she saw some goldfish and a most comical little newt  and going home they had a real good talk about their fathers voyage and how they should get on without him and bessie found to her great pleasure that sam hoped miss fosbrook would stay when mamma came home  for i do think she has put some sense into you bessie said sam  she was so delighted that instead of preparing to fret if sam did but hold up a finger at her she looked up with a smile when he came in her way sure of protection and expecting something pleasant as well as thinking it an honour to be asked to help him in anything the next day when mr carey had insisted on his verifying by the map all the towns which he had been contented to say were in asia minor where every place in ancient history is always put if its whereabouts be doubtful she saved him so much time and trouble that he got out into the garden full half an hour earlier than he would otherwise have done  thereupon he told her she was a jolly good fellow and gave her such a thump on the back as a few weeks ago would have made her scream and whine but this time she took it as a new form of thanks and felt highly honoured by being invited to help him to fish for minnows though it almost made her sick to stick the raw meat upon his hooks  the threatening of a true sorrow the bearing a real trouble and the opening to her brothers kindness had done far more to make her a happy little girl than all miss fosbrooks attempts to satisfy her cravings or please her tastes  these had indeed done her some good and taught her to find means of enjoyment for those likings that no one else cared for but it had been the spirit of delight that had been chiefly wanting and when thankfulness and love were leading her to that it was much easier to see that the evening clouds or the rising moon were lovely than when she was looking out for affronts  nothing was said in public about the loss and christabel hoped that the bad impression as to elizabeth would wear out in the young minds of the lesser children but davids whole nature seemed to have been disorganized by the disappointment  instead of being a pattern child for diligence and good behaviour very fond of miss fosbrook and not only inoffensive but often keeping john and anne in order he seemed absolutely stupid and senseless at lessons became stubborn at reproof seemed to take pleasure in running counter to his governess and rendered the other two who though his elders were both of weak natures compared with his own more openly naughty than himself sometimes it seemed to christabel that the habit of spiting bessie was getting so confirmed that it would last even when the cause was forgotten and yet the more she strove to put it down in sight the more it throve out of sight and when she looked at david and thought how she had once admired him she could not but remember the text that says thy goodness is as the morning cloud and as the dew shall it vanish away  she had thought it goodness based upon religious feeling as well as on natural gravity and orderliness and so perhaps it had once been but the little fellow had fixed his whole soul on one purpose and though that was a good one it had grown into an idol and swallowed up all his other motives till of late he had only been good for the sake of the pig not because it was right  being disappointed of the pig he had nothing to fall back upon but felt himself so illused that it seemed to him that it was no use to be good and he revenged himself by naughtiness  such sturdy strong characters as little davids when they are once set on the right object come to the very best kind of goodness but when they take a wrong turn they are the very worst both for themselves and others    chapter xiii    the monday after the loss of the pence was a pouring wet day  the whole court was like a flood and the drops went splashing up again as if in play purday wore his masters old southwester coat and looked shiny all over and when the maids had to cross the court they went click click in their pattens under their umbrellas  but it was baking day and susan and annie had been down to coax the cook into making them a present of a handsome allowance of dough and miss fosbrook into letting them manipulate it in the schoolroom probably this was the only way of preventing the dough from being turned into bullets and sent flying at each others eyes or possibly plastered on somebodys nose and the cook and kitchenmaid from being nearly driven crazy  the dough was justly divided and an establishment set up in each locker  bessie declined altogether sam had lent her his beautiful book of the british songsters and she was hard at work at the table copying a tomtit since she no longer carried on the work in secret but at one locker were the other three elders at the other the three lesser ones and little george in a corner by susan pegging away at his own private lump and constantly begging for more  susans ambition was to make a set of real twists just like cooks and she pulled out and twisted and plaited though often robbed of her dough by the two boys whose united efforts were endeavouring to produce a likeness of purday with his hat on his head plums for eyes a pipe in his mouth and driving a cow but unluckily his neck always got pinched off and his arms would not stay on  no matter the more moulding of that soft dough the better  johnnie and annie had a whole party of white clammy serpents always being set to bite one another and to melt into each other and david was hard at work on a brood of rabbits with currant eyes and would let no one interfere with him  didnt i hear something asked bessie looking up  oh its only the roller said sam purday always rolls on a wet day  something however made the whole party of little bakers hold up their heads to listen  there was a gleam on their faces as a quick alert step sounded on the stairs and bessie the nearest to the door and not cramped like the rest who were sitting on their heels sprang forward and opened it with a scream of joy  there he wasthe light alert weatherbeaten man with his loose wavy hair and bright sailor face  there was papa  oh the hurly burly of children tumbling up as well as they could on legs crooked under them and holding out great fans of floury doughy paws all coming to be hugged in his arms in turn so that before he had come to the end of the eight in presence bessie had had time to whisk off to the nursery snatch baby up from before nurses astonished eyes rush down with her and put her into his arms  baby had forgotten him and was taken with such a fit of screaming shyness that susan had to take her and annie to play bopeep with her before she would let anyones voice be heard  ive taken you by surprise miss fosbrook said the captain shaking hands with her in the midst of the clatter  oh it is such a pleasure she began  i hope you left mrs merrifield much better  much better much better thank you  i hope to find her on the sofa when i go back on thursday  i could only run down for a few days just to settle things and see the children before i join the ramilies  admiral penrose very goodnaturedly kept it open for me till we could tell how she was said the captain with rather a trembling voice  then you are going  o papa said susan looking up at him and baby will not know you till  hold your tongue miss croaker said the captain roughly but kindly and miss fosbrook could see that he was as much afraid of crying himself as of letting susan cry ive no time for that  ive got a gentleman on business down stairs and your uncle john and i must go down to them again  we shant want dinner only sue tell them to send in some eggs and bacon or cold meat or whatever there may be for tea and get a room ready for your uncle  he would have gone but susan called out o papa may we drink tea with you georgy and all  yes to be sure if you wont make a bearfight any of you for your uncle  maynt i come down with you added sam looking at him as if he wanted to make the most of every moment of that presence  better not my boy said the captain ive got law business to settle and we dont want you  better stay and make yourselves decent for teatime  mammas love and she hopes youll not drive uncle john distracted  and he was gone  bother uncle john first muttered sam i am sorry to say  i cant think what hes come for sighed annie  to spoil our fun suggested johnnie disconsolately  to take sam to school added hal while i go to sea  you dont know that you are going said elizabeth  papa said nothing about it  oh but i know i shall  admiral penrose promised  you know a great many things that dont happen  you knew colonel carey would give you two sovereigns  henry looked as if he could bite  well i shall finish purday said sam turning away with a sigh and they shall have him for tea  tea will be no fun repeated annie  oh dear what does uncle john come here for  may not he come to be with his brother suggested christabel  oh but they are grown up said annie  cant he have him in london without coming here to worry us in our little time added johnnie  perhaps he will not worry you  oh but they all cried and stopped short  he plagues about manners said annie  he wanted susie and me to be sent to school said bessie  he said it was like dining with young hottentots  he told papa it was disgraceful when we had all been sliding on the great pond in the village added annie  and he gave sam a box on the ear for only just taking a dear little river crayfish in his fishingnet to show aunt alice  the net was dripping wet observed bessie  yes said anne but aunt alice is so finikin and fidgety she never wets her feet and cant get over a stile and is afraid of a cow and he wants us all to be like her  and he makes papa and mamma mind things that they dont mind by nature said susan  mamma always tells us to be good and never play at hockey in the house when hes there said anne  she has not told us so this time said john triumphantly  no but we must mind all the same said susan and sam silenced some independent murmurs about not minding uncle john by saying it was minding mamma  miss fosbrook herself was a little alarmed for she gathered that mamma was in some fear of this terrible uncle that he had much influence with his brother and was rather a severe judge of the young family  she sincerely hoped that he would not find things much amiss for the honest goodness of the two eldest had won so much regard from her that she could not bear them to be under any cloud and indeed she felt as if the whole flock were her own property as well as her charge and that she as well as they were about to be tried  she would have felt it all fair and just before their kindly father but it seemed hard that all should be brought before the schoolmaster uncle and she was disposed to be tender for her children and exceedingly anxious as to the effect they might produce  she was resolved that the captain should hear of the affair of the pence but the presence of his brother would make the speaking a much greater effort  meantime she saw that all the fingers were clean and all the hair brushed  she flattered herself that susans yellow locks had learnt that it was the business of hair to keep tidy and had been much less unmanageable of late but she had her fears that they would ruffle up again when their owner at the head of a large detachment rushed out to take the fancy bread out of the oven and she came halfway down stairs in case it should be necessary to capture them and brush them over again  while thus watching the door of the diningroom the only down stairs room in order opened suddenly and the captain came forth oh miss fosbrook he said please come in here  i was just coming to look for you  my brothermiss fosbrook  to her surprise miss fosbrook received a very pleasant civil greeting from a much younger man than she had expected to see looking perhaps more stern about the mouth and sharp about the eye than his elder brother and his clerical dress very precise but somehow he was so curiously like his niece elizabeth that she thought that his particularity might spring from the same love of refinement  all going on well asked the captain  fairly well she answered  sam and susan are most excellent children  there is only one matter on which i should like to speak to you at some time when it might suit you  is it about this he said putting into her hand a sheet written in huge roundhand in pencil no words misspelt but the breaks in them at the end of the lines perfectly regardless of syllables   my dear papa  please let me have a poli ceman  bet h as got at toby and stole our pence which was for a secret  nu rse says she is a favourite and miss fosbrook will not find them  your affectionate son  david douglas merrifield   oh this was the letter david insisted on sealing before i put it into mine exclaimed miss fosbrook as soon as she had made out the words  we have been in great trouble at the loss but we agreed not to write to you because you had so much on your mind  is bessie in fault  no no none of us believe it but i am very anxious that you should make an investigation for the maids suspect her and have made the younger children do so  and who is toby  toby is only a jugcalled toby fillpot i believeshaped like a man  i know put in mr john merrifield laughing  dont you remember him harry  we had the like in our time  well interrogated the captain  just after you left home said christabel as shortly and clearly as she could the children agreed to save their allowance to buy a pig for hannah higgins  they showed great perseverance in their object and by the third week they had about seven shillings in this jug which to my grief and shame i let them keep in the glass cupboard not locked but one door bolted the other buttoned  on friday morning the 11th i know the cup was full of coppers and silver for i took it down to add something to it  on the next monday morning the money was gone all but one farthing  can you guess who took it  i should prefer saying nothing till you have examined the children and servants for yourself  right said the captain  very welli am sorry to treat you to a courtmartial john but i must hold one after tea  christabel pitied the children for having to speak before this formidable uncle but there could be no help for it since no other sittingroom was habitable and there were torrents of rain outof doors  there was just time to show the glass cupboard and the shelf where toby had stood and to return to the diningroom before the children began to stream in and make their greetings to their uncle susan with george in one hand and her plate of bakings in the other  very fancy bread indeed it was as uncle john said  the edge of purdays hat had been quite baked off and one of his arms was gone he was black in the wrong places and was altogether rather an uncomfortablelooking object  davids brood of rabbits were much more successful though the ears of many had fallen off  uncle john was very much diverted and took his full share of admiring and tasting the various performances  on the whole the meal went off much better than christabel had feared it would  she had really broken the children of many of the habits with which they used to make themselves disagreeable there was no putting of spoons into each others cups nor reaching out with buttery fingers lips were wiped and people sat still upon their chairs even if they fidgeted and sighed and there was only one slop made all teatime and that was by johnnie and not a very bad one  indeed it might be hoped that mr merrifield did not see it for he was talking to sam about the change of footpath that mr greville was making  there was indeed no fun but it might be doubted whether papa would have been in a mood for fun even had his brother not been there and miss fosbrook was rather glad there was nothing to make the children forgetful of propriety  as soon as mary had carried off the teathings and wiped the table uncle john put himself as much out of the way as he could behind the newspaper in the recess of the window and miss fosbrook would have gone to the schoolroom but captain merrifield begged her to stay  i hear he said that a very unpleasant thing has taken place in my absence and i wish to learn all that i can about it that the guilty person may be brought to light and the innocent cleared from any suspicion  the children looked at one another wondering how he had heard or whether miss fosbrook had told him but this was soon answered by his calling out david come here and tell me what you meant by this letter  david walked stoutly to his fathers knee nothing daunted though his brothers muttered behind him so he wrote little sneak and he knew no better  not that it was wrong to lay the case before his father but boys had usually rather suffer injustice than make an accusation  why did you write this letter david said his father  because i want my pence for the pig  tell me how you lost them  bess took them  elizabeth sprung up crimson and with tears in her eyes and sam and susan were both bursting out into an angry no no but their father made a sign to all to keep still and they obeyed though each of the elder ones took hold of a hand of their sister and squeezed it hard  did you see her take them asked the captain  no  then why do you say she did  i dont want to frighten you david i only want to hear why you think she did so  david was getting alarmed now and his childish memory better retained the impression than what had produced it  he hung down his head scraped one foot and finding that he must answer mumbled out at last nurse said it and hal  henry come here  did you accuse your sister to david  no burst out henry at once but there was a rounding of everyones mouth to cry out oh and he quickly added in a hasty scared way at least when davie came bothering me i said he had better ask betty because she had been prying about and meddling with the babyhouse i never meant that she had done it but davie is such a little jack ass  did you see her meddle with the babyhouse  she said that herself muttered henry  yes papa said elizabeth starting forward i did find the doors of the babyhouse open and shut them up but i never touched anything in it  sam and susie know i would not and that i would not tell a story now though i once did you know papa  captain merrifield still kept his grave set face and only asked when did you find the doors open  on friday papafriday weekst barnabas dayjust after dinner  was no one with you  no papa  you came upstairs first  yes i wanted my pencil before and she stopped short  before what  before miss fosbrook went in to speak to hal said elizabeth getting red all over  hal had been dining in the schoolroom said miss fosbrook on account of a little bit of disobedience  captain merrifield looked keenly at henry who tried to return the look but shuffled uncomfortably under it  then hal had been dining in the schoolroom  was he there when you came in  no  were the doors open when you were dining there henry  nno  you are sure that you did not meddle with them  i do not know why i should said henry hastily and confusedly it is only the girls and the babies that have things thereandand miss fosbrook herself had been at the cupboard in the morning why shouldnt she have left it undone herself and the doors got open  no no cried susan if they arent fastened they always burst open directly and we never could have been in the room half the morning without noticing them  then you are certain that they were closed when you went down to dinner  everyone was positive that the great glass doors flying out must have made themselves observed in that room full of children especially as susan remembered that she had been making a desk of the sloping part under them  does anyone remember how long it was between hals leaving the room and bessies coming up  i dont know when he went out said all those who had been in the diningroom but there spoke up a voice quite proud of having something to tell among the othersi saw hal go out and bessie come up directly  you johnnie  how was that  miss fosbrook made me dine in the nursery papa because hal and i had been riding on the new iron gate to see if the telegraph would come in while the others were at church and then hal ran away with the grevilles and i couldnt get down till sam came and helped me and so miss fosbrook made me dine in the nursery and when i had done i went and sat upon the top of the garret stairs to watch when they came out from dinner and ask if i might come down again  and what did you see johnnie  first i saw a wasp said johnnie  never mind the wasp  did you see when henry went out  i saw him come in first said john and miss fosbrook order him up and say she would send him his dinner and come and speak to him presently  so i watched to catch her when she was coming up to him and i saw mary bring him up some mince veal and the last bit of the gooseberry pie and then very soon he bolted right downstairs  i didnt think he could have had time to eat the pie and i was going to see if there was a bit left when i saw bessie coming up and i whipped up again  then nobody went into the room between henry and bessie  no there wasnt any time  the whole room was quite silent  there was no sound but a quick short breathing from the captain  but he had rested his brow upon his hand and his face could not be seen  it was as if something terrible had flashed upon him and he was struggling with the first shock and striving to deal with it  if they had seen him in a tempest with his ship driving to pieces on a rock he would not have been thus shaken and dismayed  however by the time he looked up again he had brought his face back to its resolute firmness and he spoke in a clear stern startling voice that made all the children quake and some catch hold of each others hands  henry tell me what you have done with your theft  miserable henry  he did not try to deny it any longer but burst out into a loud sobbing cry o papa  papa  i meant to have put it back again  i couldnt help it  tell me what you have done with it repeated the captain  ii paid it to farmer grice i was obliged and i thought i could have put it back again and some of it was my own  fivepencefarthing cried david  you thief you  the childs fists were clenched and his young face all one scowl of passion quite shocking to see  his father put him aside and said hush david no namesnow henry what do you say to your sister for your false accusation which has thrown your own shame on her  oh no no papa he never did accuse me cried bessie for the first time bursting into tears  he never said i did it that was only davies fancy and it has made susie and sam so kind i have not minded it at all  please dont mind that papa  come away henry said the captain now that your sister has been cleared we had better have the rest out of the sight of these tenderhearted little girls  he stood up and without a word stroked down elizabeths smooth brown hair raised her face up by the chin and kissed her forehead the only place free from tears then he took henry by the shoulder and marched him out of the room  bessie could not stop herself from crying and was afraid of letting uncle john see her so she flew out after them and straight upstairs to her own room  miss fosbrook and susan both longed to follow her but they had missed this opportunity and the sound of voices outside showed so plainly that the captain and henry were in the hall that they durst not open the door  everyone was appalled and nothing was said for a few seconds  the first to speak was annie in a low terrorstricken whisper yet with some curiosity in it  i wonder what papa will do to him  give him nine dozen i hope answered david through his small white teeth all clenched together with rage  for shame davie said susan you should not wish anything so dreadful for your brother  he has been so wicked  i wish it  i will wish it said david  hush david said miss fosbrook such things must not be said  i will talk to you by and by  i am glad poor bessie is cleared added susan though i always knew she could not have done it  to be surei knew it was hal  sam you didwhy didnt you tell cried annie  i wasntto saysure said sam and i couldnt go and get him into a scrape  i thought he might tell himself if he could ever make up the money again  yes said susan he would have done that  he always fancied he should get a sovereign from colonel carey  he talked till he thought so said sam  but what made you guess he had done so sam said miss fosbrook i did suspect him myself but i never felt justified in accusing him of such a thing  i dont know  i saw he had been getting into a fix with those grevilles and had been sold somehow  they said something and got out of my way directly and i was sure they had done some mischief and left him to pay the cost  did you ask him said susan  what was the use  one never knows where to have him  he will eat up his words as fast as he says them with his at least till he doesnt know what he means  nor i didnt want to know much of it  still i cant think how you could let poor bessie live under such a cloud said christabel  you didnt believe it said sam nor anyone worth a snap of my finger  besides if i had known and had to tell what a horrid shame it would have been if the naval cadetship had been to be had for him  i knew bessie would have thought so too and then he would have been out of the way of the grevilles and would have got some money to make it up  then is there no chance of the cadetship now  oh we should have heard of it long ago if there had been  so i mind the coming out the less but its perfectly abominable to have had all this row and for papa to be so cut up in this little short time at home  i never saw him more grieved said mr merrifield  he was hardly more overcome when your mother was at the worst  they started for they had forgotten uncle john or they would never have spoken so freely but he now put down his newspaper and looked as if he meant to talk  susan ventured to say and indeed they had all been so very good before  the pig made them so  a learned pig i should think said her uncle laughing good naturedly  we were obliged to take care said susan or we got so many fines  christabel finding that mr merrifield looked at her helped out susan by explaining that various small delinquencies were visited with fines and that the desire to save for the pig had rendered the children very careful  indeed she said i was thankful for the incentive but i am afraid that it was overworked and did harm in the end and she glanced towards david  it is the way with secondary motives was the answer  here captain merrifield came back alone and his brother was the only person who ventured to say well  i have sent him to his room said the captain  it is a very bad business though of course he made excuses to himself  the captain then told them henrys confession  he had been too much hurried by the fear of being caught to take out his own share of the hoard and had therefore emptied the whole cupful into his pocket handkerchief tied it up and run off with it intending to separate what was honestly his own  what that was he did not know but his boastful habits and want of accuracy had made his memory so careless that he fancied that a far larger proportion was his than really was and his purposes were in the strange medley that falls to the lot of all selfdeceivers sometimes fancying he would only take what he had a right to whatever that might be sometimes that he would borrow what he wanted and replace it when the sovereign should be given to him or that the grevilles would make it up when they had their months allowance  when he came to the farm mr grice was resolved to take nothing less than the whole sum that he had with him  perhaps this was less for the value of the turkeycock than for the sake of giving the boys such a lesson as to prevent them from ever molesting his poultry again  at any rate he was inexorable till the frightened henry had delivered up every farthing in his possession and then convinced that no more was forthcoming he relented so far as to restore the gun and promise to make no complaint to either of the fathers  at first henry lived on hopes of being able to restore the money before the hoard should be examined but colonel carey went away and as might have been expected left no present to his brothers pupils  still henry had hopes of the grevilles and even when the loss was discovered hoped to restore it secretly and make the whole pass off as a joke but the 1st of august came martin and osmond received their pocketmoney but laughed his entreaty to scorn telling him that he had shot the turkeycock not they  since that time his only hope had been in the affair blowing overas if a sin ever did blow over  one question i must ask miss fosbrook said the captain though after such a course of deceit it hardly makes it worse  has he told any direct falsehood  she paused and recollected  yes sir she said i am afraid he did he flatly told me that he had not touched the babyhouse  i expected nothing else said the captain gravely  what has become of bessie  she ran upstairs  may i go and call her said susan  i will go myself said her father  he found elizabeth in the schoolroom all flushed and tearstained in the face and he told her affectionately how much pleased he was with her patience under this false accusation  delight very nearly set her off crying again but she managed to say it was miss fosbrook and sam and susie that made me patient papa they were so kind  and nobody would have believed it if i wasnt always cross you know  not cross now my little woman he said smiling  oh  i said i never could be cross again now mamma is better but miss fosbrook says i shall sometimes feel so and i do believe she is right for i was almost cross to georgie today  but she says one may feel cross and not be cross  he did not quite know all that his little girl was thinking of but he patted her fondly and said yes there is a great deal to be thankful for my dear and i shall trust to you elder ones to give your mamma no trouble while i am afloat  i will try said bessie  and please papa would you tell nurse about it  she doesnt half believe us and she is so tiresome about miss fosbrook  tiresome what do you mean  she always thinks what she does is wrong and she puts nonsense into johnnies head and talks about favourites  mary told susan it was jealousy  the captain spoke pretty strongly to nurse freeman that evening but it is doubtful if she were the better for it  she was a very good woman in most things but she could not bear that the children should be under anyone but herself and just as henry lost the truth by inaccuracy she lost it by prejudice  miss fosbrook was glad to get away from the diningroom where it was rather awful to sit without her work and be talked to by mr merrifield even though she liked him much better than she had expected  when david came to bed she sat by him and talked to him about his angry unforgiving spirit  she could not but think he was in a fearful temper and she tried hard to make him sorry for his brother instead of thirsting to see the disappointment visited on him but david could not see what she meant  wicked people ought to be punished it was wicked to steal and tell stories and he hoped henry would be punished so as he would never forget it for hindering poor hannah from getting her pig  he would not understand henrys predicament he was only angry bitterly angry and watching for vengeance  miss fosbrook could not reason or persuade him out of it nor make him see that he could hardly say his prayers in such a mood  indeed he would rather have gone without his prayers than have ceased to hope for henrys punishment  perhaps in this there was sense of justice and indignation against wrong doing as well as personal resentment  miss fosbrook tried to think so and left him but not without praying for him that a christian temper of forgiveness might be sent upon him  all the others were subdued and awestruck  it was not yet known what was to happen to henry but there was a notion that it would be very terrible indeed and that uncle john would be sure to make it worse and they wished miss fosbrook goodnight with very sad faces    chapter xiv    nothing had as yet befallen henry for he came down to breakfast in the morning but his father did not greet him and spoke no word to him all the time they were in the room together  the children felt that this was indeed terrific  such a thing had never befallen any of them before  they would much rather have been whipped and even davids heart sank  something however was soon said that put all else out of his sisters minds  the captain turned to them with his merry smile saying pray what would miss susie and miss bessie say to coming up to london with me to see mamma  the two girls bounded upon their chairs susans eyes grew round and bessies long the one said o papa and the other oh thank you and they looked so overwhelmed with ecstasy and all the three elders laughed  then you will behave discreetly young women  ill try said susan and bessie always does  oh thank you papa  grandmamma should be thanked she asked me to bring a child or two to be with mamma when i go down to portsmouth  we had thought of susan but i think betty deserves some amends for what she has undergone  oh yes papa thank you cried susan sam and david from their hearts john and annie because the others did so  then you wont kick her out if she shares your berth sue  oh i am so glad papa  it is so nice to go together  then miss fosbrook will you be kind enough to rig them out  i must drive into southminster at ten oclock and if you would be so good as to see them smartened up for london there i should be much obliged to you  the mere drive to the country town was a great event in itself even without the almost incredible wonder that it was to lead to and the delights of which ida and miss fosbrook had told them in london went so wildly careering through the little girls brains that they hardly knew what they said or did as they danced about the house and ran upstairs to get ready long before ten oclock  mr carey had been informed that his pupils would not come to him during the few days of their fathers stay and sam begged to ride in on his pony by the side of the carriage but he was desired to fetch his books and call henry as his uncle wished to give them both an examination  was this the beginning of captivity to uncle john david and johnnie were quite angry  they considered it highly proper that hal should be shut up with uncle john but they thought it very hard that sam should be so used too and sam himself looked very roundbacked reluctant and miserable partly at the task partly at being deprived of the sight of his father for several hours of one of those few precious days  miss fosbrook wished susan to have sat on the front seat of the old phaeton with her father but he would not consent to this and putting the two little girls together behind handed the governess to the place of honour beside him where she felt rather shy in spite of his bright easy manner  i am afraid he said after having flourished his whip merrily at johnnie annie and davie who were holding open the iron gate that you have had a tough job with those youngsters  we never meant you to have been left so long to their mercy  i knowi know i only wish i could have done better  you have done wonders  my brother hardly knows where he isnever saw those children so mannerly  miss fosbrook could not show how delighted she was  i could hardly have ventured on taking those two girls to town unless you had broken them in a little  i would say nothing last night till i had watched susan for my mother is particular and if my wife was to be always worrying herself about their manners they had better be at home  indeed i think you may quite trust to their behaving well  those two and sam are so thoroughly trustworthy that i had no real difficulty till this unhappy business  the captain wanted to talk this over with her and hear her account of it once more  she gave it fully thinking he ought to know exactly how his children had acted in the matter and wishing to explain where she thought she had made mistakes  when she had finished he said thank you and considered a little while then said a thing like this brings out a great deal of character and a new eye sometimes sees more what is in a child than those that bred him up  it has been a touchstone indeed she answered  poor hal he said sadly then resumed ive said nothing of it yet to the boysbut admiral penrose has promised to let me take out one with me  i had thought most of hal he seemed to me a smarter fellow more likely to make his way than his brother but this makes me doubt whether there can be stuff enough in him  i might not be able to look after him nor do i know what his messmates may be and i should not choose to risk it except with a boy i could thoroughly trust  those young grevilles seem to me hals bane and temptation  ay ay but if a boy is of the sort hell find someone to be his bane wherever he goes  ill have no more of the grevilles though if he should not go with me my brother john would take him into his house and keep a sharp look out after him  just tell me if you have no objection how the boy strikes you  most people think him the most taking of the lot  so he is said christabel thoughtfully he has more ease and readiness and he is affectionate and warmhearted but then he is a great talker and fond of boasting  exactly  i told him that was the very way he learnt falsehood  i am afraid too she was obliged to add that his resolutions run away in talk  he has not much perseverance and he is easily led  well i believe you are right but then whats to be done  i can hardly afford to lose this chance but sam was always backward and i doubt his even caring to go to sea  oh  captain merrifield  what has he given you reason to think that he does  she told him how she had found sam struggling with his longing for the sea and his father and how patiently the boy had resigned himself to see his brother put before him and himself condemned for being too dull and slow  did i say so  i suppose he had put me past my patience with blundering over his lessons  i never meant to make any decision but i did not think he wished it  he said it had been his desire from the time he could remember especially when he felt the want of you during your last voyage  very odd how reserved some boys are  i declare i was vexed that it had gone out of his head though i thought it might be for the best you know i was not born to this place  i never dreamt of it till my poor brother sams little boy went off in a fever six years ago and we had to settle down here  before that we meant my eldest to follow my own profession but when he seemed to take to the soil so kindly i thought after all he might make the happier squire for never having learnt the smell of salt water nor the spirit of enterprise but if it were done already the first choice is due to him  you are sure  ask the girls  he leant back and shouted out the question sue do you know whether sam wishes to go to sea  theres nothing he ever wished so much was the answer  then why didnt he say so  because he thought it would be no use screamed susan back  no use why  because hal says admiral penrose promised him  o papa are you going to take sam  oh dear we cant get on without him sighed elizabeth  are you sure he would like it said her father  i thought he never cared to hear of the sea  he cant bear to talk of it because it makes him so sorry said susan  and cried bessie he burnt his dear little ship the victory because he couldnt bear to look at it after you said that papa  after i said what  that he was not smart enough to learn the ropes  very silly of him said the captain to take in despair what was only meant to spur him on  i suppose now i shall find he has dawdled so much that he couldnt get through an examination  this shut up the mouths of both the girls who were afraid that he might not since they saw a good deal of his droning habits over his lessons and heard more of hals superior cleverness  miss fosbrook ventured to say you may expect a great deal of a boy who works on a pure principle of obedience  you think a great deal of that youngster said the captain highly gratified  it is the first time i ever knew a stranger take to him  i did not take to him as a stranger  i thought him uncouth and dull  i only learnt to love and respect him as i felt how perfectly i might rely on him and how deep and true his principles are  if the children have gone on tolerably well in your absence it is because he has always stood by me and his weight of character has told on them  captain merrifield did not answer at once he bit his lip then blew his nose and cleared his throat before he said miss fosbrook you have made me very happy it will make his mother so  she always rated him so high that i half thought it was a weakness for her eldest son but there  i suppose he was downhearted about this fancy of his poor boy and that hindered him from making the most of himself  i wonder what sort of a figure he is cutting before his uncle  the town was at length reached and the shopping was quite wonderful to the sisters  miss fosbrook found a shop where the marvellous woman undertook to send home two grey frocks trimmed with pink by the next evening and found two such fashionable black silk jackets that susie felt quite ashamed of herself though rather pleased and bessie only wished she could see her own back it must look so like idas  then there were white sleeves and white collars that made them feel like young women and little pink silk handkerchiefs for their necks and two straw hats which miss fosbrook undertook to trim with puffs of white ribbon and a pink rosette at each ear bessie thought they would be the most beautiful things that had ever been in her possession and was only dreading that sam would say they were like those on ida grevilles donkeys best harness while susan looked quite frightened at them whispered a hope that mamma would not think them too fine and that miss fosbrook would not let them cost too much money and when assured that all fell within what papa had given to be laid out she begged that annie and little sally might have the like  but as they were not going to london miss fosbrook could not venture on this and as bessie had set her affections upon a certain white chip hat with a pink border and a white feather both sisters remained wishing for somethingas is sure to happen on such occasions  however elizabeth recovered from the hat when she was out of sight of it and they went and saw the cathedral where the painted windows and grave grand arches filled her with a truer and wiser sense of what was beautiful and then they walked a long time up and down under its buttressed wall waiting for papa till they grew tired and hungry but at last he came in a great hurry and sorry to have been hindered  with naval politeness he gave his arm to miss fosbrook and carried them off to a pastrycooks where he bade them eat what they pleased and spend the rest of the florin he threw them on buns for the little ones while he fetched the carriage and so they all drove home again and found the rest of the party ravenous having waited dinner for threequarters of an hour  wonderful to relate uncle john had not eaten anybody up not even baby though papa advised susan to make sure that she was safe and then sent sam to ask purday for a salad  perhaps this was by way of getting rid of this constant follower while he asked his brother what he thought of the boys attainments  uncle john could not speak very highly of the learning of either but he said sam knows thoroughly what he does know  as to the other he thinks he knows everything and makes most awful shots  when i asked them who didos husband was sam told me he did not know and hal that he was diodorus siculusat least scipiono he meant sicyon  then you think neither could stand an examination for the cadetship  i could not be sure of sam but i am quite sure that hal could not  here the dinnerbell rang the hungry populace rushed to the dining room and the meal was gone through as merrily as could be while still the father never spoke to henry  uncle john was as pleasant and goodnatured as possible  who would have thought of the marked difference he made between dining with barbarians or young gentlefolks  dinner over captain merrifield called samor rather since that was not necessary as sam was never willingly a yard from his elbow he ordered the others not to follow as they went into the garden together  sam he said admiral penrose is kind enough to offer me a berth in the ramilies for one of you  if you can pass the examination should you wish to avail yourself of the offer  sam grew very red in the face looked down and twirled the button of his sleeve  he certainly was not a gracious boy for all he said was in a gruff hoarse voice without even thanks not if it is for this  for this  what do you mean sam said captain merrifield thinking either that the boy was fainthearted or that his wish had been the mere fancy of the girls  not if it is to punish hal said sam with another effort  that is not the question  do you wish it  sam hung his head and made his eyebrows come down as if they were to serve as a veil to those horrid tears in his eyes and after all his voice sounded sulky as he said yes  is that all said the captain angry and disappointed  is that the way you take such an offer  if you had rather stay here and be bred up to be a country squire say so at once dont mince the matter  o papa cried sam indignantly how can you think that  didnt i always want to be like you  then why cant you say so  because i cant bear to cut hal out said sam putting his arm over his eyes as a way he considered secret of disposing of his tears  put that out of your head sam or if you dont fancy the sea have it out at once  o papa please listen  you know though miss fosbrook is very jolly we couldnt help getting nohow when you were away us two particularly  you have no mischief to confess surely sam said his father really imagining that this preference to hal was acting on him so as to make him mention some concealed misdemeanour if you have you know truth is the best line  but i havent papa said sam looking up quite surprised  you know i am a year older and couldnt help caring more and miss fosbrook is so nice one couldnt bother her but you see the grevilles would put it into hals head that it was stupid and like a girl to mind her  it is all their fault and they were sneaks about the turkeycock and wouldnt payand i know he would have ended by putting the money back when he could only davie made such a row before he could and he did so reckon on the navyhe would pay it back the first thing  the last sentences came between gasps very like sobs  have done with hal said captain merrifield still with displeasure  i wouldnt take him now on any account  if the grevilles lead him wrong what would he do among the mids  if he acts dishonourably here we should have him disgracing himself and his profession  since he cant take it and you wont i shall try to make some exchange of the chance till john or david will be old enough  but papa i began sam  i dont want to force you to it continued captain merrifield in his vexed voice  i never mean to force my sons to any profession if i can help it and you have a right to be considered  it has always been a disadvantage to me and to this place that i was bred to the sea instead of to farming and though you cant live on the property without some profession it may be quite as well that you should turn your mind to something elseonly if it be the army i cant help you on in it  i had rather go to sea if you please said sam  dont say so to please me said his father  i tell you the examinations are a pretty deal harder than they were in my time  it is not a trade for a youngster to be idle in and i wont have you just when youve knocked about a few years and are getting fit to be of use on board and nowhere else calling yourself heartily sick of it and turning round to say it was my doing  ill never do that papa said poor sam unable to understand why his father should speak as though scolding him  no  and mind you must take the rough with the smooth if you sail with me and not be always running after me papaing me  i cant see after you and should only get you ill will if i tried  i had rather go said sam  im sure i dont know what to make of you said his father looking at him in a puzzle  however if you do mean to go you may tell freeman to get your things ready to come up with me on thursday only if you dont really like the notion find out your own mind and let me know in time thats all  the captain turned away and gave a long whistlean accustomed signalthat brought children and dogs all rushing and tumbling about him together to walk with him about the farm and his brother among them but sam hung back  he had not the heart to go with that merry throng for he did not know whether his father were not displeased with him and he therefore thought he must be to blame  people who like sam rather cultivate the habit of gruffness and reserve and prefer to be short and rude become so utterly unable to express what they mean that on great occasions they are misunderstood and give pain by supposed ingratitude and dislike even when they feel most warmly  captain merrifield could only judge from looks and words and even when sam had been satisfied about henry he had shown so little alacrity or satisfaction as really to leave a doubt whether he were not unwillingly yielding to his fathers wishes which would have been a mistaken act as the captain thought no one ought to be a sailor unless with a very strong desire that way  thus sam really perplexed and distressed his father when he least intended it and unable to understand what was the matter yet feeling heavy and sad he turned aside from the rest and by way of the quietest place he could find climbed up a tall peartree to the very highest branch he could reach  he put himself astride on one bough his feet upon another below and his back leaning against the main stem  no one could see him up so high among the thick leaves but he could see all around the village and over the house he could look down into the farmcourt at the pigs burying themselves in the straw and out beyond at the geese and ducks in the meadow and the broods of chickens pecking and scratching about or the older poultry rolling in the dustholes they had scraped for themselves he could see purday among his cabbages in the garden and further off could watch the walkingparty through the fields his father with little george in his arms and uncle john as often as possible by his side while the others frisked about sometimes spreading out like a flock of sheep in the pasture land or when they came to the narrow paths in the cornfields all getting into single file and being lost sight of all but their heads  sam recollected how the day when he had heard that he was not likely to be a sailor he had felt as if he hated stokesley and as if it would be a prison to him and how everything reminding him of the sea had been a misery to him  he would not then have believed anyone who had told him that he would really hear of his appointment and be so little glad  yet for two whole years the loss of the hope had weighed on him and made him dull whenever he thought of grownup life heard of the sea or was asked what he was to be  and almost always at his prayers he had that meaning in his mind when he said thy will be done he had really submitted patiently and tried to put away the longing from his mind and would there can be no doubt have been happy and dutiful at home but at length the wish of his heart was suddenly granted  and then wish though it still were there came all this grief and discomfort  the gladness was in him somewhere but he could not get at it either for his own comfort or that of his father  he missed his mother exceedingly  she would know what he meant and tell papa that he did care to go  yet did he care so very much  only think of beginning to be a stranger at this dear old home and seeing no mother no susie nor any of them for years togetherprobably not his father after the first voyage  however the sailor was too strong in sam for that grief not to pass off and his chief trouble was the sense of supplanting henry  he knew the disappointment would be most bitter and he could not get rid of the sense of having taken an unfair advantage of the disgrace of henrys adventure  as to his fathers manner he got over that more easily for his conscience was free he knew that the tone of displeasure would be gone at the next meeting and he was too sure of his own love of the sea to fear that he should not show it enough  after all he was to be a naval cadet he could not be sorry  nay he felt he had his wish the very wish he had thought it wrong to put into a prayer  he thought he ought to be thankful that it was granted in the same way as he had been when his mother began to recover  so he put his hands together and looked up into the summer blue sky through the leaves and his lips moved as he whispered his thanks and asked to be helped in being a good brave sailor and that something as good might happen to poor henry  after this somehow the weight was gone he knew not where  all he recollected was that he should see mamma in two days and that he was to sail with papa if he could get through his examination  there was a sort of necessity of doing something comical and just then spying miss fosbrook with a book walking slowly below he could not resist the temptation of sending down on her a shower of little hard pears and twigs  bob came one down on her book and another on her bonnet  she looked up and saw a leg stretching out for a branch apparently in such a dangerous manner that she did not know whether she should not have sam himself on her head next and started back watching as he swung himself from branch to branch and then slid down embracing the trunk  did i hit you said he  i couldnt help trying it it was such fun  it was a great liberty but she was so goodhumoured as to laugh and said he had taken good aim  please miss fosbrook next said he would you hear how many propositions i can say  and as she opened her eyes at this holiday amusement he added papa has got the appointment after all and means me to have it  i am so glad sam  i give you joy she said and took his hand to shake it heartily  i wish hal could go too said sam  dear sam she said kindly and guessing his feelings as having gone along with them i dont wonder you are sorry for him but indeed i think it is better for him to be sheltered from beginning real life just now  papa said he would not have taken him said sam but it seems so hard to have all his life changed for a thing that sounds worse than he meant it to be  sam said miss fosbrook i once read a sermon that said that our conduct in little things does decide the tenor of our lives  you know one moment of hastiness cost moses the promised land and only a little while ago we heard how joash had but few victories allowed to him because he did not think it worth while to strike the ground as often as elisha told him  it is the little things that show whether we are to be trusted with great  it is such a tremendous punishment said sam when he would have put it back again  my brother knew a bankers clerk who was transported for borrowing what he meant to put back again  no sam people must bear the result of their doings and your father judges for hal as much in kindness as in anger  i know he knows best  you may see it as well as trust  with all his grand talk do you really think that hal would not be upset at the first hardship or that he could face bullying or danger  remember the bull that was at least a vicious cow and turned out to be a calf  sam could not help laughing as he said yes that would never do at sea and he would be done for if he were cowardly there  but i wish i could get out of sight of him till i am gone  and please hear my euclid ill get the book if youll stay out here  therefore if the two sides of two triangles be equal to one another and the adjacent angles be equal each to each resounded through the laurels as the walking party returned  hallo al fresco euclid exclaimed uncle john as sam with a blush ran after his blotted diagrams as a sudden gust of wind blew them dancing over the garden  captain merrifield caught one and restored it to sam with a pat on the back that made his teeth rattle in his head but which made him as happy as a young seaking showing that they perfectly understood each other  but to be ever so good a boy does not carry one through the examinations that stand at the door of every road of life for those who are not wealthy  sam knew he was the dull boy of mr careys four pupils and though from sheer diligence he was less often turned back than the rest yet they could all excel him whenever they chose his lessons all went against the grain and were a sore trouble to him and his uncle had shown much wrath today at his ignorance and backwardness  he was therefore in a great fright and gave himself and miss fosbrook no peace running after her every moment with his euclid his colenso or his slate  that boy will stupefy himself and his admirable cramming machine exclaimed uncle john when coming out into the court after tea to talk to purday the two brothers heard the complement a e is equal to the complement d e proceeding out of the schoolroom window  a truce with your complements tonight shouted the captain come down sam i must have a game at hideandseek  though hideandseek on the lawn with papa was the supremest bliss that life had yet offered to the young merrifields and though susan bessie annie and johnnie had all severally burst into the room to proclaim it and summon sam he had refused them all but this call settled it he broke off in the middle of his rectangle and dashed down stairs to the great relief of kind miss fosbrook who with all her goodwill found her head beginning to grow weary of angles and rightangles on a hot evening in the height of summer  the summerhouse was to be home and there the party were assembled nine in number for not only papa but uncle john was going to play and henry though forlorn and unnoticed had wandered about with the rest all day trying to do as usual to forget the heavy load that pressed on him and to believe that he was not going to be punished for mere unluckiness in borrowing and for not answering impertinent questions  the world was very unlike itself to him and he saw the enjoyment without being able to enter into it just as a sick person sees the sunshine without feeling the warmth but instead of penitence he merely tried to shake off his compunction  so there he stood in the ring as susan was finding out who was to be the first to hide by pointing to each at each word of the formula   eggs butter cheese bread sticks stocks stones dead   dead came to uncle john as perhaps susan had contrived and shrugging up his shoulders he went off to hide and his whoop was presently heard  he was not very good game maybe he did not wish to be very long sought for he was no further than in the tall french beans generally considered as a stupid place to hide in  the children had been in hopes that he would catch papa which was always a very difficult matter for the sailor was lighter of foot as well as of course longer in limb than any of the children but they saw that uncle john had not the slightest chance with him and it was bessie who was caught in her homeward race  bessie was rather a good hider and was searched for far and wide before sams i spy  i spy gave the signal that a bit of the spotty cotton had been seen peeping out from under purdays big potatobasket in the toolhouse and the whole party flew towards home  bessie would not aim at papa for if so she would certainly catch no one but she hunted down david who was too sturdy to be a quick runner and who was very well pleased to be caught  ill have papa he said as she captured him  i know of such a cunning place  davids place proved to be in among his likenesses the cabbages immediately in front of the summerhouse  there he lay flat on the very wet mould among the stout cabbages all of which had a bead of wet in every wrinkle of their great leaves so that when susan had at length spied him and he came plunging out his brownhollandto say nothing of his kneeswas in a state that would have caused most mammas to send him to be instantly undressed but nobody even saw it and he charged instantly towards the door of the summerhouse not pursuing anyone in particular but cutting all off from their retreat  he slipped aside however and let all the lesser game pass by uncaught his soul soared higher than even uncle john who looked on exceedingly amused at the small mans stratagem and at the long dodging that took place between him and his father the quick lithe captain skipping hither and thither and trying to pop in one side while his enemy was on the other and the square determined little puffing panting boy guarding his door hands on knees ever ready for a dart wherever the attempt was made  the whole party in the home nearly went into fits at the fun and at the droll remarks uncle john made at this hare and tortoise spectacle till at last either the captain gave in or davie made a cleverer attack than ever for with a great shout he flew upon papa and held him fast by the legs everyone shrieked with delight papa hid in such clever places and when found he roared so splendidly that it struck the little ones with terror and did the hearts of the elders good to hear him indeed the greatest ambition johnnie entertained was to roar like papa  then he could make his voice sound as if out of any place he chose so that no one could guess by his whoop where to look for him and this time it seemed to be quite out at the other end of the kitchengarden where they were all looking when another whoop came apparently down from sams peartree on the lawn and while they were peeping up into it whoop reechoed from the stables  at last as annie was gazing up and round as if she even thought it as well to look right into the sky for papa she suddenly beheld the two merriest eyes in the world on the roof of the summerhouse itself he had been lying there on the thatch watching at his ease all the wanderings of the seekers and uttering those wonderful whoops to bewilder them  i spy  i spy shrieked annie flying in even while her father sprang to the ground and with davies manoeuvre on a larger scale seemed to be taking his choice of all the fugitives rushing up from all parts  one elder boy and one younger he was hunting down the gooseberry path when just as he was about to pounce on the former he said that it was not sam stood still and folded his arms  a shriek made him look round little david stood sobbing and crying piteously  davie what davie  what is it my man  where are you hurt  no no  im not hurt  catch hal papa  no david  i do not play with boys that act like henry  speak to him papa oh speak  i shall before i go said the captain gravely  now now  papa  oh do  i did want him to be punished but not like this  no david  if he can expect to play with me and be treated like the others he is not in the state to receive forgiveness  there have done crying let us go on with the game  but david could not go on playing he was too unhappy  not to be forgiven even if punished seemed to him too dreadful to happen to anyone and he thought that he had brought it all on henry by his letter of accusation  tardily and dolefully he crept into the house and miss fosbrook met him looking so woebegone that she too thought he had hurt himself  she took him dirt and all on her lap and there he sobbed out that papa wouldnt speak to hal and it was very dreadful and he wished there were no such things as pigs or money or secrets they only made people miserable  dear davie they only make people miserable when they care too much about them  papa will forgive hal before he goes away i am sure only he is making him sorry first that he may never do such a thing again  i dont like it  and david cried sadly perhaps because partly he was tired with having been on his legs more than usual that day but his good and loving little self was come home again  he at least had forgiven his brother the wrong done to himself and there was no hanging back that night from the fulness of prayer no he rather felt that he had been unkind and the last thing heard of him that night was that as sam and hal were coming upstairs to bed a little white figure stood on the top of the stairs and a small voice said hal please kiss me  i am so sorry i told papa about  there hold your tongue said hal cutting him short with the desired kiss if you hadnt told someone else would  but long after sam was asleep hal was wetting his pillow through with tears    chapter xv    still the silence lasted  henry had tried at first to persuade himself that it was only by chance that he never heard his own name from lips that used to call it more often than any other  indeed he was so much used to favour that it needed all the awestruck pity of the rest to prove to him its withdrawal and he was so much in the habit of thrusting himself before samuel that even the sight and sound of the first book of euclid all day long failed to convince him that his brother could be preferred above all as nurse freeman had been collecting his clean shirts as well as sams and all the portmanteaus and trunks in the house had been hunted out of the roof once either the spirit of imitation or his usual desire of showing himself off made him break in when sam was knitting his brows frightfully over a sum in proportion  hal could do it in no time  so he did but he put the third term first and multiplied the hours into the minutes instead of reducing them to the same denomination so that he made out that twentyfive men would take longer to cut a field of grass than three and then could not see that he was wrong but miss fosbrook and sam both looked so much grieved for him that a start of fright went through him  some minds really do not understand a fault till they see it severely visited and at least and couldnt help had so blinded henrys eyes that he had thought himself more unlucky than to blame till his fathers manner forced it on him that he had done something dreadful vaguely afraid he hung about looking so wretched that he was a piteous sight and it cut his father to the heart to spend such a last day together  mayhap the captain could hardly have held out all that second day if he had not passed his word to his brother  the travellers were to set off at six in the morning to meet the earliest train  and it was not till nine oclock at night when the four elder ones said goodnight that the captain following them out of the room laid his hand on henry as the others went upstairs and said henry have you nothing to say to me  henry leant against the baluster and sobbed not knowing what else to do  you cant be more grieved than i am to have such a last day together said his father laying his hand on the yellow head but i cant help it you see  if you will do such things it is my duty to make you repent of them  hal threw himself almost double over the rail and something was heard about sorry and never  poor little lad said his father aloud to himself he is cut up enough now but how am i to know if his sorrow is good for anything  o papa  ill never do such a thing again  i wish i knew that hal said the captain sitting down on the stairs and taking him between his knees  there let us talk it over together  i dont suppose you expected to steal and deceive when you got up in the morning  oh no no  go back to the beginning  see how you came to this  as he waited for an answer hal mumbled out after some time you said we need not go to church on a weekday  well what of that  i didnt go in case the telegraph should come  there are different ways of thinking said his father  church was the only place where i could have gone that st barnabas day  i would have gone said the selfcontradictory henry only the grevilles are always at one for being like a girl  ha now we see daylight said the captain  the grevilles are at onethats more like getting to the bottom of it  yes papa said hal glad to make himself out a victim to circumstance you cant think what a pair of fellows those are for not letting one alone purday says they havent as much conscience between them as a pigeons egg has meat and going down to mr careys with them every day they let one have no peace  you will find people everywhere who will let you have no peace unless you do not care for them though you will not be left to the grevilles any longer  yes papa when i am away from them you will see  no hal i shall not see i shall hear  shall not i sail with you then papa  you will not sail at all  i thought you knew that  i thought the admiral must have given you two appointments said hal timidly  he gave me one for one of my sons  the first choice is sams right even if he had not deserved it by his brave patient obedience  hal hung his head then said but papa if sam broke down in his examination please mightnt i  no henry  not only does your uncle say that though sams success is very doubtful your inaccuracy would make your failure certain but if your knowledge were ever so well up to the mark i could not put you into the navy  left to yourself here you have been insubordinate vain weak shuffling  can i let you go into greater temptation where disgrace would be public and without remedy  oh but papa  papa  away from the grevilles and not under only a governess  you shall be away from the grevilles and not under a governess your uncle is kind enough to take you with him to his house and will endeavour to make you fit to try to get upon the foundation by the time there is a vacancy  o papa dont sobbed henry  i cant help it hal  you have shown yourself unfit either for the sea or for home  what can i do with you  try meonly try me papa  i would  i cannot go by what you say you would be but what you are  deeds not words  but if you wont let me go into the navy only let me be in real school  no henry i have not the means of sending you there  excepting on the foundation and if you get admittance there at all it will only be by great diligence and your uncles kindness in preparing you  henry cried bitterly  it was a dreadful prospect to do his lessons alone with uncle john in the boys playhours and be kept in order by aunt alice when his uncle was in school  perhaps his father would not have liked it himself for his voice was very pitying though cheering as he said one half year hal very likely no more if you take pains and youll get into school and be very happy so long as you dont make a greville of every idle chap you meet  henry cried as though beyond consolation  i hate leaving you this way continued his father but by the time i come home you will see it was the best thing for you and look up to uncle john as your best friend  why hal boy youll be a tall fellow of fourteen  let me find you godly and manly  you cant be one without the other  there now good night god bless you  more might have been said to henry on his fault and what had led to it but what his father did say was likely to sink deeper as he grew older and had more sense and feeling  from him captain merrifield went to the schoolroom where miss fosbrook was packing up for the little girls and putting last stitches to their equipments with hearty goodwill and kindness as if she had been their elder sister  he thanked her most warmly and without sending away the girls who were both busy tacking in little white tuckers to the evening frocks he began to settle about the terms on which she was to remain at stokesley  he said that he could not possibly have left his wife without a person on whose friendly help and good management of the children he could depend  important as it was to him to be employed he must have refused the appointment if miss fosbrook had been discontented or had not had the children so well in hand  he explained that he had reason to think that mrs merrifields present illness had been the effect of all she had gone through while he was in the black sea during the crimean war  she had been a very strong person and had never thought of sparing herself but she and all her little children had had to get into stokesley in his absence she had to manage the estate and farm teach the elder children and take care of the babies with no help but nurse freemans  and though he had been wounded when with the naval brigade and had been at deaths door with cholera the effects had done him no lasting harm at all while the overstrain of the anxiety and exertion that she had undergone all alone had so told upon her that she had never been well since and he much feared would never be in perfect health again  he must depend upon miss fosbrook for watching over her and saving her as his little susie could not yet do and for letting him know from time to time how she was going on and whether he ought to give up everything and come home  he had tears in his eyes as he thanked christabel for her earnest promise to watch and tend mrs merrifield with a daughters care and her heart swelled with strong deep feeling of sorrow and sympathy with these two bravehearted loving people doing their duty at all costs so steadily and she was full of gladness and thankfulness that they could treat her as a true and trusty friend  he walked away feeling far too much to bear any eye upon him and susan was found to be crying quietly making her thread wet through and her needle squeak at every stitch at the sad news that mamma never was to be quite well even though assured that she was likely to be much better than she had been for months past  bessie shed no tears but miss fosbrook who had been hindered all day by sams euclid and colenso and had sat up till halfpast eleven oclock to make the two sunday frocks nice enough for the journey on going into the bedroom to lay them out for the morning saw a little face raised from the pillow of one of the small white beds and found her broad awake  bessie never could go to sleep properly when anything out of the common way was coming to pass so that was the less wonder but she had a great deal in her head and she was glad to get christabel to kneel down by her to listen to her whispers  dear christabel i am so sorry  i never cared about it before  about what my dear  what papa said about when he was in the black sea  i never knew mamma cared so much  i dare say not my dear you were much younger then  and i didnt know all about it said bessie or else ive forgotten  i have been trying to remember whether we ever thought about mamma and oh christabel do you knowi believe we only thought she was cross  oh dear it was so naughty and bad of us  i can guess how it happened my dear  you were not old enough to be made her friends and you could not understand quiet sorrow  to think we should have said she was cross  that was wrong because it was disrespectful  you see my dear when grown people are in trouble you young ones cant enter into their feelings nor always even find out that anything is amiss and you get vexed at there being a cloud over the house and call it crossness  grownup people are sometimes cross arent they said bessie nurse is and i heard papa say aunt alice was  we have tempers certainly said miss fosbrook and unless we have conquered them as children there will be signs of them afterwards but very few people and certainly no children can tell when grave looks or words sharper than usual come from illness or anxiety or sorrow and it is the only way to save great grief and selfreproach to give ones own faults the blame and try to be as unobtrusive and obliging as possible  and i am older now and can understand said bessie but then it is susie that is right hand and does everything  theres plenty in your own line bessieplenty of little kindly services that are very cheering and above all  what  attending to your mammas troubles will drive away your own grievances  only i will not talk to you any more now for i want you to go to sleep if you lie awake you will be tired tomorrow and that will incline you to be fretful  fretful tomorrow  bessie could not believe it possible and indeed miss fosbrook did not think the chance great as long as there was amusement and excitement  the danger would be in the waitings and disappointments that will often occur even in the height of enjoyable schemes  it would take too long to tell of all the goodbyes  the children old enough to enter into the parting were setting off too and miss fosbrook felt more for the little ones than they did for themselves as they watched their father and uncle and two sisters into the gig and the boys into the cart with purday to drive them and the boxes sam sitting on his fathers old midshipmans chest trying as well as the jolting would let him to con over that troublesome thirty fifth proposition which nine times repetition to miss fosbrook had failed to put into his head  johnnie and annie wished themselves going to sea or to london or anywhere rather than having the full force of miss fosbrook on their lessons  she did not make them do more but she took the opportunity of making everything be done thoroughly and as they thought bothered them frightfully about pronouncing their words in reading and holding their pens when they wrote  after a little while however they found that really their hands were much less tired and their lines much smoother and more slanting than when they crooked their fingers close down over the ink  absolutely they began to know the pleasure of doing something well and they felt so comfortable that they were wonderfully good and the pig fund might have had a chance but david did not seem to think of reviving it  perhaps his great vehemence had tired itself out and maybe he was ashamed of the great disturbance he had made and all that had come upon henry and did not wish to think of it again for st katherines fairday passed over without a word of the pig  the young ladies were not great letterwriters and all that was known of them was that mamma was better they had been to the zoological gardens and the hyena was so funny and mrs penrose was so nice  then that papa and sam were gone to portsmouth and that they had telegraphed that sam had succeeded  if it had been her own brother miss fosbrook could not have been much happier and in honour of it she and the three children all went to drink tea in the wilderness walking in procession each with a flag in hand painted by her for the occasion  three days after when the post came in there was a letter directed to master david douglas merrifield stokesley house bonchamp  it was a great wonder for david was not baby enough nor near enough to the youngest to get letters as a pet nor was he old enough to be written to like an elder one  he spelt the address all over before he made up his mind to open it and then exclaimed but it is not a letter  its green  it is a postoffice order davie said miss fosbrook  let me look  yes for ten shillings  write your name there and if we take it to the postoffice at bonchamp they will give you ten shillings  ten shillings  oh davie cried johnnie i wish it was to me  it just makes up for what hal took and more too said annie where can it come from davie  from the queen said davie composedly the queen always does justice  miss fosbrook was quite sorry to confess for truths sake that she did not think the queen could have heard of the loss of the pig fund and that it was more likely to be from someone who wished to make up for the disasterwho could it be  she looked at the round stamp upon the greenlettered paper and read portsmouth  could it be from papa  then she looked at the cover but it was not a bit like the captains writing it was pretty ladylike clearlooking hand writing and puzzled her a great deal more  if the children had once had a secret of their own there was a very considerable one to puzzle them now and they could hardly believe that miss fosbrook knew nothing about it any more than themselves  so restless and puzzled were they that she thought they would never be able to settle quietly to their lessons and that it would save idleness if she walked with them at once to bonchamp to get the money  it was two miles but all three were stout walkers and they were delighted to go indeed they would have fancied that someone else might run away with the ten shillings if they had not made haste to secure it  so david douglas merrifield was written with much difficulty to make it small enough in the very best and roundest hand  the boys were put into clean blouses annies striped cotton came to light and off set the party through the lanes each with sixpence in their hand for it was poor fun to go to bonchamp unless one had something to spend there  david wanted a knife johnnie wanted a whip annie nothing in particular only to go into a shop and buyshe didnt know what  but the wonderful affair at the postoffice must have the first turn and very grand did david feel as the clerk peeped out from his little hole and looked amused and gracious as the little boy stood on tiptoe to give in his green paper  will you have it in gold or silver sir he asked  in gold please said david  it was something to have a bit of gold in ones possession for the first time in ones life and david felt as if he had grown an inch taller and were as good as six years old as he walked away with the half sovereign squeezed into his hot little palm  the toyshop was at the end of the street and in they went johnnie to try all the whistles in the handles of the whips and be much disgusted that all that had a real sound lash cost a shilling david to open and shut the sixpenny knives with the gravity of a judge examining their blades and annie to gape about and ask the price of everything after the tiresome fashion of people old or young when they come out bent on spending but without any aim or object however annie was kind if she were silly and she was very fond of johnnie so it ended after a little whispering in her sixpence being added to his to buy a real good whip such as would crack and not come to pieces  just then what should the children espy but a nice firm deal box containing a little saw a little plane a hammer a gimlet a chisel and sundry different sizes of nails  was there ever anything so delightful especially to david who loved nothing so well as running after george bowles the carpenter and handling his tools what was the price of them  just ten shillings and sixpence  they were very cheap the woman of the toyshop said  they had been ordered by an old lady at her grandsons entreaty but afterwards a misgiving had seized her that the young gentleman would cut his fingers and she would not take them  miss fosbrook whispered david may i give back the knife then i could buy it  you have bought and paid for it said christabel  somebody else will buy the box said david wistfully  miss fosbrook within herself thought this unlikely for nobody went to bonchamp for costly shopping and she saw that the woman would gladly have had the knife back if she could have sold the toolbox which even at this reduced price was much too dear for the little boys who frequented the shop  come away now my dear she said decidedly  no another time thank you  david was as nearly crying as ever he was as he was forced to follow her out of the shop  those tools were so charming his fingers tingled to be hammering sawing boring holes  had he lost the chance for that poor blunt knife  must he wait a whole fortnight for another sixpence and find the delicious toolchest gone  dear davie i am very sorry said christabel when they were in the street  that nasty knife cried david  it is not the knife davie said she but that i want to thinki want you to thinkwhy these ten shillings must have been sent  because we lost the money for the pig said david  but kattern hill fair is over and i dont want a pig now i do want the gimlet to make holes  yes david but you know what was saved for the pig came from all of you you would have had no right to spend it on anything else unless they all had consented  this is my very own said david it was sent to memyselfme  so it seems now but just suppose you were to have a letter to say that someonepoor hal himself perhapsor papahad sent ten shillings to make up the money for the pig and directed it to you because you cared so much would it not be a shame to have spent the money upon yourself  then they should not have sent it without saying said david  miss fosbrook thought the same when she saw how hard the trial was to the little boy but she hoped she was taking the kindest course as she said now david in nine days time if you are good you will have had another sixpence  i see no chance of the tools being sold or if they are i could send for such a box from london  by that time perhaps something will have happened to show who sent the money and why  and if it is all for myself i may have the tools cried david  you shall have them if you really think it is right when monday week comes    chapter xvi    ideas were slow in both entering or dying out of davids mind but while there they reigned supreme  carpentry had come in as the pig had gone out and with the more force because a new window was being put into mammas room and george bowles was there with all his delightful tools letting the little boys amuse themselves therewith till they had hardly three sound fingers between them and nurse freeman when she dressed their wounds could not think what was the use of a lady if she could not keep the children from hurting themselves but miss fosbrook thought that it was better that boys should get a few cuts and bruises than that they should be timid and unhandy  one evening all the party walked to carry to hannah higginss little girl a pinafore that annie had been making  she was a nice tidy woman but there was little furniture in her house and she looked very poor  the garden was large and in pretty good order and there was an empty pigsty into which annie peeped significantly  no miss annie we havent no pig said mrs higgins  ben says says he mother when im taken on for carter boy see if i dont get you a nice little pig as will eat the garden stuff and pay the rent  oh but began annie and there she came to a sudden stop  is he likely soon to be a carter boy asked miss fosbrook  no maam he is but ten years old and they dont often take them on under twelve but he is a good boy to his mother and a terrible one for leasing  miss fosbrook was obliged to have it explained to her that leasing meant gleaning and she saw the grand pile of small neat bundles of wheat put out to dry on the sunny side of the house  o davie cried annie as soon as they were outside the gate shant we get the pig for hannah  it is my money not yours i shall do what i please with it said david rather crossly  miss fosbrook pulled annie back and desired her to let david alone herself wondering what would be the effect of what he had seen  he had been eager to do good to hannah when no desire of his own stood in the way but a formed wish had arisen in his mind and he loved himself better than hannah  christabel dreaded the clearingup of the secret of the postoffice order lest he should be proved to love himself more than right and justice  there were not many letters from the absent pair of sisters they seemed to be much too busy and happy to write and appeared to be seeing everything and to be only just able to put down the names of the wonders  the chief of all however was that kind mrs penrose had actually taken them to portsmouth for a couple of nights to see the ramilies in which she was going to remain till it sailed they had sat in the admirals cabin and had slept upon dear little sofas where they wished they always slept they had been in papas cabin which was half filled up with a great gun that can only be fired out at the window scratched out and porthole put in  oh how delightful  i wish i had a big gun in my room cried johnnie  and they had seen sams chest and sam did look so nice in his uniform and he had dined with them every day  they had dined late with the grownup people and the admiral was so kind only rather funny  annie wished she were as old as bessie as much as john wished to have a gun filling up his whole bedroom  the next day their papa had taken them into the country to see lady seabury bessies godmother a very old lady indeed older than grandmamma and who could not move out of her chair  she gave me wrote bessie  there again something had been scratched out and a kiss written overhead  that something was quite a long word but it had been very completely blotted out not like the window which had only a couple of cross bars through which it could be plainly read but there had plainly been first an attempt at smearing it out with the finger and that not succeeding an immense shiny black mess like the black shade of a chafer grub had been put down on it and had come off on the opposite side of the sheet  what could the word be  annie and david were both sure they could read the lines through all the blot  the first letter was certainly s  but said miss fosbrook do you think it is quite honourable to try to read what bessie did not mean us to see  they did not quite enter into this but they left off trying  mamma had been out in the carriage several times and they were all coming home on saturday weekthat was the best news of alland then we have a secret too for miss fosbrook  david said he was tired of secrets and would not guess  annie guessed a great deal but miss fosbrook thought more about the word she would not try to read  she began to have a strong suspicion from whom the postoffice order had come and was the more uneasy about the spending of davids half sovereign but she durst say nothing for she knew it could do no good if he felt himself compelled against his own will and she saw that he was full of thought  one day the lawn had been mown and the children where all very busy wheeling their little barrows and loading them with the short grass david was with them at first but when purday left off work he marched after the old man in his grave deliberate way and was seen no more till nearly teatime when he walked into the schoolroom with a very set look upon his solemn face and sat himself down crosslegged on the locker with a sigh that seemed to come out of the very depths of his heart  whats the matter david  he made no answer and miss fosbrook let him alone but annie presently bounced in crying out davie davie where were you we have been hunting for you everywhere  where did you go  i went with purday  what to milk the cows  yes  and then  i went with him to farmer longs to see his little chinese pigs  and you have bought one  o davie  purday is to ask the farmer about the price tomorrow morning because he wasnt at home  then you wont get the carpenters tools said annie  no said david purday said tools that they make for little boys never will cut  so you told purday all about it  david nodded his head  oh do tell me what purday said continued annie  its nothing to you said david bluntly  but by and by when john came in and a few more questions were asked david let out that purday had said well he thought sure enough if the money was sent to master david for that intent he did not ought to spend it no other ways and whether or not hannah higgins was a deserving woman and master davie didnt know what it was like never to have a bit of bacon neer a sunday in the winter  he couldnt say but it was hard that those poor folks should get nothing but bread and cabbages from weeks end to weeks end just that master davie might spoil bits of deal board with making chips of them  and when david was sure he shouldnt spoil his wood purday had told him that them toyshop young gentlemans tools were made to sell and not made to cut  best save up his money and buy one real mans tool after another and then hed get a set equal to george bowless in time  though so young david was longsighted and patient enough to see the sense of this and had already made up his mind that he would begin with a gimlet  and though he did not say so and the first resolution had cost a very tough struggle his heart seemed to have freed itself in that one great sigh and he was at peace with himself  miss fosbrook was very glad he had gone to so wise and good an adviser as purday and was almost as happy as david himself  she gave him and john leave to go with purday the next day to bargain for the pig as david was very anxious for one in especial whose face he said was so jolly fat and it was grand to see the two little boys consequentially walking on either aide of purday who had put on his whitest round frock for the great occasion  farmer long was at home he came out and did the honours of his ten little pigs and when he found which was davids favourite he declared that it was the best of the lot and laughed till david blushed at the young gentlemans having got such an eye for a pig it was a regular little trudgeon said purday meaning perhaps a trojan and it was worth at least twelve shillings but the farmer in his goodnature declared that little master should have it for the ten as it was for a present  hannahs boy was working for him and was a right good lad and he would give him some straw for the pigs bed when he went home at night  then he took the two boys into the parlour and while purday had a glass of beer in the kitchen mrs long gave each of them a big slice of plumcake and wanted very much to have given them some wine but that they knew they must not have and she inquired after their mamma and papa and made them so much of visitors that david was terribly shy and very glad when it was over though john liked it and talked fast  as to the giving the pig that was a serious business and david felt hot and shy and wanted to get it over as soon as possible without a fuss  so he bolted into mrs higginss cottage put his hands behind his back and spoke thus please mrs higgins put your pigsty in order  weve all done itat least they all wanted toand a green order came down in a letterand weve bought the pig and ben will drive it home when he comes from work  and then as if he had been in a great fright he ran away while johnnie stayed and when hannah understood received so many curtsies and listened to so much pleasure that he could hardly think of anything else and felt very glad that some pence of his had been in toby fillpot  annie said that it was not fair that she had not been at the giving the pig and miss fosbrook was a little disappointed too but then it was much better that david should not want to make a display so she would not complain and comforted annie by putting her in mind that they could go and see the little pig in his new quarters  a few days more and the carriage was driving up to the door with dear mamma in it andwhy there were three little girls not two one look and the colour came into christabels face  it was her youngest little sister dora who sat beside bessie  mrs merrifield had gone to see mrs fosbrook and ask if she could take anything for her to her daughter and she had been so much shocked at the sight of the little pale london faces that she had begged leave to take home one of the children to spend a month with her sister at stokesley since miss fosbrook could not be spared to go home at present  was not that a secret for christabel  how these two sisters did hug each other  but the stokesley secrets have lasted long enough and there is no time to tell of the happy days of doras visit and the good care that johnnie took of her whenever she went out and of her pretty quiet ways that made bessie take her for her dearest of friends  and still less can be told of the smooth peaceful free spirit that seemed to have come home with mamma even though she was still able to do little among the children for the very having her in the house appeared to keep things from going wrong  one thing must be told however and that is that when annie told all the wonderful story of the postoffice order and the chinese pig bessie grew redder and redder in the face and susan squeezed both her hands tight together and said may i tell bessie
