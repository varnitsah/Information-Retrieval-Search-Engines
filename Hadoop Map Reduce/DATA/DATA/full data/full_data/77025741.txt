77025741	the cabmans story   the mysteries of a london growler  we had to take a growler for the day looked rather threatening and we agreed that it would be a very bad way of beginning our holiday by  getting wet especially when fanny was only just coming round from the whooping cough  holidays were rather scarce with us and when we took one we generally arranged some little treat and went in for enjoying ourselves  on this occasion we were starting off from hammersmith to the alexandra palace in all the dignity of a fourwheeler  what with the wife and her sister and tommy and fanny and jack the inside was pretty well filled up so i had to look out for myself  i didnt adopt the plan of john gilpin under similar circumstances but i took my waterproof and climbed up beside the driver  this driver was a knowinglooking old veteran with a weatherbeaten face and white side whiskers it has always seemed to me that a london cabman is about the shrewdest of the human race but this specimen struck me as looking like the shrewdest of the cabmen  i tried to draw him out a bit as we jogged along for i am always fond of a chat but he was a bit rusty until i oiled his tongue with glass of gin when we got as far as the green anchor  then he rattled away quickly enough and some of what he said is worth trying to put down in black and white  wouldnt a hansom pay me better he said in answer to a question of mine  why of course it would  but look at the position  a fourwheelers a respectable conveyance and the driver of its a respectable man but you cant say that of a rattling splashing ansom  any boy would do for that job  now to my mind money haint to be compared to position whatever a mans trade may be  certainly not i answered  besides ive saved my little penny and im got too old to change my ways  ive begun on a growler and ill end on one  if youll believe me sir ive been on the streets for sevenandforty year  thats a long time i said  well its long for our trade he replied  you see there aint no other in the world that takes the steam out of a man so quickly what with wet and cold and late hours and maybe no hours at all theres few that lasts at it as long as i have  you must have seen a deal of the world during that time i remarked there are few men who can have greater opportunities of seeing life  the world he grunted flicking up the horse with his whip  ive seen enough of it to be wellnigh sick of it  as to life if youd said death youd ha been nearer the mark  death i ejaculated  yes death he said why bless your soul sir if i was to write down all ive seen since ive been in the trade theres not a man in london would believe me unless maybe some o the other cabbies  i tell ye i took a dead man for a fare once and drove about with him nigh half the night  oh you neednt look shocked sir for this wasnt the cabno nor the last one i had neither  how did it happen i asked feeling glad in spite of his assurance that matilda had not heard of the episode  well its an old story now said the driver putting a small piece of very black tobacco into the corner of his mouth  i daresay its twenty odd years since it happened but its not the kind o thing as slips out of a mans memory  it was very late one night and i was working my hardest to pick up something good for id made a poor days work of it  the theatres had all come out and though i kept up and down the strand till nigh one oclock i got nothing but one eighteenpenny job  i was thinking of giving it up and going home when it struck me that i might as well make a bit of a circuit and see if i couldnt drop across something  pretty soon i gave a gentleman a lift as far as the oxford road and then i drove through st johns wood on my way home  by that time it would be about halfpast one and the streets were quite quiet and deserted for the night was cloudy and it was beginning to rain  i was putting on the pace as well as my tired beast would go for we both wanted to get back to our suppers when i heard a womans voice hail me out of a side street i turned back and there in about the darkest part of the road was standing two ladiesreal ladies mind you for it would take a deal of darkness before i would mistake one for the other one was elderly and stoutish the other was young and had a veil over her face  between them there was a man in evening dress whom they were supporting on each side while his back was propped up against a lamppost he seemed beyond taking care of himself altogether for his head was sunk down on his chest and hed have fallen if they hadnt held him  cabman said the stout lady with a very shaky voice i wish you would help us in this painful business  those were her very hidentical words  certnly mum i says for i saw my way to a good thing what can i do for the young lady and yourself  i mentioned the other in order to console her like for she was sobbing behind her veil something pitiful  the fact is cabman she answers this gentleman is my daughters husband they have only just been married and we are visiting at a friends house near here  my soninlaw has just returned in a state of complete intoxication and my daughter and i have brought him out in the hope of seeing a cab in which we could send him home for we have most particular reasons for not wishing our friends to see him in this state and as yet they are ignorant of it  if you would drive him to his house and leave him there you would do us both a very great kindness and we can easily account to our hosts for his absence  i thought this rather a rum start but i agreed and no sooner had i said the word than the old one she pulls open the door and she and the other without waiting for me to bear a hand bundled him in between them  where to i asked  fortyseven orange grove clapham she said  hoffman is the name  youll easily waken the servants  and how about the fare i suggested for i thought maybe there might be a difficulty in collecting it at the end of the journey  here it is said the young one slipping what i felt to be a sovereign into my hand and at the same time giving it a sort of a grateful squeeze which made me feel as if id drive anywhere to get her out of trouble  well off i went leaving them standing by the side of the road the horse was wellnigh beat but at last i found my way to 47 orange grove it was a biggish house and all quiet as you may suppose at that hour  i rang the bell and at last down came a servanta man he was  ive got the master here i said  got who he asked  why mr hoffmanyour master  hes in the cab not quite himself this is number fortyseven aint it  yes its fortyseven right enough but my masters captain ritchie and hes away in india so youve got the wrong house  that was the number they gave me i said but maybe hes come to himself by this time and can give us some information  he was dead drunk an hour ago  down we went to the cab the two of us and opened the door  he had slipped off the seat and was lying all in a heap on the floor  now then sir i shouted wake up and give us your address  he didnt answer  i gave another shake pull yourself together i roared  give us your name and tell us where you live  he didnt answer again  i couldnt even hear the sound of breathing  then a kind of queer feeling came over me and i put down my hand and felt his face  it was as cold as lead  the coves dead mate i said  the servant struck a match and we had a look at my passenger he was a young goodlooking fellow but his face wore an expression of pain and his jaw hung down  he was evidently not only dead but had been dead some time  what shall we do said the flunkey he was as white as death himself and his hair bristled with fear  ill drive to the nearest police station i answered and so i did leaving him shivering on the pavement  there i gave up my fare and that was the last i ever saw of him  did you never hear any more of it i asked  hear  i thought i should never hear the end of it what with examinations and inquests and one thing and another  the doctors proved that he must have been dead at the time he was shoved into the cab  just before the inquest four little blue spots came out on one side of his neck and one on the other and they said only a womans hand could have fitted over them so they brought in a verdict of willful murder but bless you they had managed it so neatly that there was not a clue to the women nor to the man either for everything by which he might have been identified had been removed from his pockets  the police were fairly puzzled by that case  ive always thought what a bit o luck it was that i got my fare for i wouldnt have had much chance of it if it hadnt been paid in advance  my friend the driver began to get very husky about the throat at this stage of the proceedings and slackened his speed very noticeably as we approached a large publichouse so that i felt constrained to offer him another gin which he graciously accepted  the ladies had some wine too and i followed the example of my companion on the box so that we all started refreshed  the police and mes been mixed up a good deal continued the veteran resuming his reminiscences they took the best customer i ever had away from me  id have made my fortin if theyd let him carry on his little game a while longer  here with the coquetry of one who knows that his words are of interest the driver began to look around him with an air of abstraction and to comment upon the weather  well what about your customer and the police i asked  its not much to tell he said coming back to his subject  one morning i was driving across vauxhall bridge when i was hailed by a crooked old man with a pair of spectacles on who was standing at the middlesex end with a big leather bag in his hand drive anywhere you like he said only dont drive fast for im getting old and it shakes me to pieces  he jumped in and shut himself up closing the windows and i trotted about with him for three hours before he let me know that he had had enough  when i stopped out he hopped with his big bag in his hand  i say cabbie he said after he had paid his fare  yes sir said i touching my hat  you seem to be a decent sort of fellow and you dont go in the breakneck way of some of your kind  i dont mind giving you the same job every day  the doctors recommend gentle exercise of the sort and you may as well drive me as another  just pick me up at the same place tomorrow  well to make a long story short i used to find the little man in his place every morning always with his black bag and for nigh on to four months never a day passed without his having his three hours drive and paying his fare like a man at the end of it  i shifted into new quarters on the strength of it and was able to buy a new set of harness  i dont say as i altogether swallowed the story of the doctors having recommended him on a hot day to go about in a growler with both windows up  however its a bad thing in this world to be too knowing so though i own i felt a bit curious at times i never put myself out o the way to find out what the little game was  one day i was driving tap to my usual place of dropping himfor by this time we had got into the way of going a regular beat every morningwhen i saw a policeman waiting with a perky sort of look about him as if he had some job on hand  when the cab stopped out jumped the little man with his bag right into the arms of the bobby  i arrest you john malone says the policeman  on what charge he answers as cool as a turnip  on the charge of forging bank of england notes says the bobby  oh then the game is up he cries and with that he pulls off his spectacles and his wig and whiskers and there he was as smart a young fellow as youd wish to see  goodbye cabby he cried as they led him off and that was the last i saw of him marching along between two of them and another behind with the bag  and why did he take a cab i asked much interested  well you see he had all his plant for making the notes in that bag  if he were to lock himself up in his lodging several hours a day it would soon set people wondering to say nothing of the chance of eyes at the window or keyhole  again you see if he took a house all on his own hook without servant nor anyone it would look queer so he made up his mind as the best way of working it was to carry it on in a closed cab and i dont know that he wasnt right  he was known to the police however and that was how they spotted him  drat that van it was as near as a touch to my offwheel  bless you if i was to tell you all the thieves and burglars and even murderers as have been in my growler one time or another youd think id given the whole newgate calendar a lift though to be sure this young chap as i spoke of was the only one as ever reglar set up in business there  there was one though as i reckon to be worse than all the others put together if he was what i think him to be  its often laid heavy on my mind that i didnt have that chap collared before it was too late for i might have saved some mischief  it was about ten years agoi never was a good hand for datesthat i picked up a stoutbuilt sailorsort of fellow with a reddish moustache who wanted to be taken down to the docks after this chap as i told you of had taken such liberties with the premises id had a little bit of a glass slit let in in front herethe same that your little boys flattening his nose against at this momentso as i could prevent any such games in the future and have an idea whenever i wished of what was going on inside  well something or another about this sailor fellow made me suspicious of him and i took a look at what he was after  he was sitting on the seat sir with a big lump o coal in his lap and was a looking at it most attentive  now this seemed to me rather a rum start so i kept on watching of him for as youll see my windows not a very large one and its easier to see through it than to be seen  well he pulls a spring or something and out jumps one of the sides of this bit of coal and then i saw it was really a hollow box painted you see and made rough so as to look like the other  i couldnt make head or tail of it anyhow and indeed id pretty near forgot all about it when there came news of the explosion at bemerhaven and people began to talk about coal torpedoes  then i knew as in all probability id carried the man who managed the business and i gave word to the police but they never could make anything of it  you know what a coal torpedo is dont you  well you see a cove insures his ship for more than its value and then off he goes and makes a box like a bit ocoal and fills it chock full with dynamite or some other cowardly stuff of the sort  he drops this box among the other coals on the quay when the vessel is filling her bunkers and then in course of time box is shoveled on to the furnaces when of course the whole ship is blown sky high  they say theres many a good ship gone to the bottom like that  youve certainly had some queer experiences i said  why bless you remarked the driver ive hardly got fairly started yet and here we are at the alexandry  i could tell you many another story as strange as theseand true mind ye true as gospel  if ever your missus looks in need of a breath of fresh air you send round for mecopper street number ninetyfourand ill give her a turn into the country and if youll come up beside me on the box ill tell you a good deal that may surprise you  but theres your little lad a hollering to you like mad and the wife wants to get out and the other ones a tapping at the window with a parasol  take care how you get down sir thats right  dont forget number ninetyfour  goodday missus  goodday sir  and the growler rumbled heavily away until i lost sight both of it and of its communicative driver among the crowd of holidaymakers who thronged the road which led to the palace
