line known under the general title of the rover boys series for young americans  ten volumes make a great number and as i look back i wonder how i have been able to write so many as i have said before when i started this series i had in mind to pen three volumes and possibly a fourth but no sooner had the rover boys at school the rover boys on the ocean the rover boys in the jungle and the rover boys out west appeared than there was a demand for another volume and then more and so i have had to take the boys from time to time on the great lakes in the mountains on land and sea in camp and on the river where we last left them  the present tale tells of adventures on the mighty mississippi river and then on the great plains where dick tom and sam and some of their friends have a variety of adventures and assist in unraveling the mystery surrounding a lonely ranch of course their old enemy baxter is bound to make himself known but the rover boys do not fail to take care of themselves as of old  again i thank the many thousands who have shown their appreciation of my efforts to amuse and instruct them i earnestly hope the present volume will not disappoint them  affectionately and sincerely yours  arthur m winfield     the rover boys on the plains    chapter i  on the houseboat  say tom whats that big thing coming down the river  im sure i dont know sam its big enough to be a house replied tom rover  maybe it is a house came from dick rover who was standing beside his brothers on the rear deck of the houseboat which was taking them down the mississippi river  a house broke in a distinctly german voice did you mean to said dere vos a house floating der rifer town dick rofer  why not hansy my boy replied funloving tom rover before his big brother could answer hasnt a house got a right to take a float if it wants to perhaps its out for its health  ach you vos choking tom cried hans mueller of a house been der rifer on dere peen somedings wrong mit him alretty  its a lumber raft hans said dick and a whopping big one too he added as he took another look at the object that was approaching the houseboat  hope it doesnt give us such a close shave as that raft we met two days ago said sam anxiously i was almost certain they were going to run into us  they have got no business to run so close to this houseboat grumbled tom they know well enough that we cant turn out of our course very well i think some of those lumbermen are the toughest kind of citizens  if they get too close ill shout a warning through the megaphone went on dick after a brief pause it certainly does look as if they intended to crowd us he continued anxiously  oh dick do you think there is any danger came from a girl who had just joined the crowd  not yet dora  perhaps we had better run in close to shore until the raft has passed continued dora stanhope with an anxious look in her pretty eyes  dont do it cried tom we have as much right to the river as they have tell em to keep their distance dick  i shallwhen they get close enough  if that raft hits our houseboat well be smashed to kindling wood was sams comment id rather theyd give us a wide berth  the rover brothers were three in number dick being the oldest funloving tom coming next and sam coming last when at home they lived with their father and their uncle and aunt at valley brook farm pleasantly located in the heart of new york state from this farm they had been sent to putnam hall as related in the first volume of this series entitled the rover boys at school at this institution of learning they had made a large number of friends and also some enemies  a short term at putnam hall had been followed by a chase on the ocean and then a trip to the jungles of africa in search of mr anderson rover who has disappeared then came a trip out west and one on the great lakes followed by some adventures during a winter in the mountains  after being in the mountains the rover boys had expected to go back to school but a scarlet fever scare closed the institution and they took a trip to the pacific as related in the rover boys on land and sea the seventh volume of this series they were cast away on an island and had many thrilling adventures but escaped to receive a warm welcome when they arrived home  the scarlet fever scare was now a thing of the past and the boys went back to putnam hall to participate in the annual encampment as told of in the rover boys in camp here they had plenty of sport and the outing was voted the best ever  what to do during the summer vacation was a question quickly settled by the brothers their uncle randolph rover had taken a houseboat for debt and it was voted to go aboard this craft which was located on the ohio river and take a trip down that stream and also down the mighty mississippi  it will be the outing of our lives said tom we can just take it easy and float and float and float  the arrangements for the outing were quickly completed with the rover boys went their old school chums songbird powell who was always making up doggerel which he called poetry hans mueller already introduced and fred garrison the houseboat was a large one and to make the trip more pleasant the boys invited two ladies to go along mrs stanhope and mrs laning with mrs stanhope came her only daughter dora whom dick rover thought the nicest girl in the world and with mrs laning came her daughters nellie and grace intimate friends of tom and sam  as those who have already read the rover boys on the river know the trip on the houseboat started pleasantly enough but before long one of their old enemies dan baxter turned up accompanied by an evilminded boy named lew flapp these fellows succeeded in making prisoners of dora stanhope and nellie laning and ran off with the houseboat but they were followed by the rovers and their friends and in the end the girls were rescued the houseboat recovered and lew flapp was made a prisoner to be sent east to stand trial for his various misdeeds dan baxter escaped and for the time being there was no telling what had become of him but he was destined to show up again as the chapters to follow will prove  after the houseboat was once again in the possession of the rovers and their guests there was a general jollification on board lasting several days all felt much relieved to think that matters had turned out so well for them  we are well out of that mess had been dick rovers comment  and i hope we never get into such another answered dora stanhope i was really frightened to death when i was a prisoner  i would feel a great deal better if dan baxter had been captured  oh dick do you think he will try to harm us further and doras face paled a trifle  well he seems to be like a bad pennyhe turns up when you least expect it  anyway he wont have flapp to aid him  that is true but i never feared flapphe was too much of a coward at heart  then you do fear baxter dick and dora looked at her best friend curiously  its not exactly that dora i dont want you to have any trouble i dont care for myself  i shall do my best to keep out of his way what a pity it is that baxter can not turn over a new leaf  it isnt in him to do so put in fred garrison who had come up  but his father has reformed said dora  i really think dan is worse than his father returned dick there is a certain viciousness about him that is lacking in his fathers makeup  dan baxter doesnt believe in forgiving or forgetting an injury put in sam who had joined the crowd once after something went wrong he said hed get square if it took a hundred years i believe he remembers that injury yet  he might do well if hed only settle down to something said fred he isnt dumb by any means  he is not smart only cunning fred answered dick in regular business i dont believe hed ever make his salt  do you think he is still following the houseboat was the question put by songbird powell  i cant say as to that if he is he must hustle pretty lively for we are now making a good many miles a day  after this conversation the days had gone by swiftly and pleasantly enough soon the broad ohio river was left behind and the houseboat started down the mississippi stops were made at various points and the young folks as well as the two ladies enjoyed themselves to the utmost they had a few friends in the south and whenever they stopped off to see these they were treated with great cordiality  no more troubles of any kind for us said sam one day but he was mistaken that very afternoon a lumber raft came close to hitting the houseboat frightening all who chanced to be on the deck at the time  phew was toms comment no more such close shaves for me that raft might have smashed us to smithereens  two days went by and the boys and girls enjoyed themselves by going fishing and by watching the sights on the river and along the shore the weather was ideal for the outing and they had not a care until the second big lumber raft came into sight as mentioned at the beginning of this chapter and threatened as the first had done to run them down    chapter ii  the big lumber raft  py chiminy dot raft vos coming dis vay so sure like nefer vos cried hans mueller after an anxious moment had passed  we ought to warn em off with a shotgun growled tom even if they dont hit us they havent any right to make my hair stand up like quills on the fretful porcupine  vot has der porkerpint to do mit your hair questioned hans innocently  youll soon find outif that lumber raft hits us hansy got your life insured  mine life insured  thats it if you havent better take out a policy for steen dollars and some cents payable at nine cents a week in advance  tom this is no joking matter broke in dick be quiet till i use the megaphone  dots it cried hans use dot magnifyphone by all means  there was a fairsized megaphone on the houseboat used to call to persons on shore if necessary and bringing this out the eldest rover placed it to his mouth  on board the lumber raft he shouted at the top of his lungs sheer off dont run us down  we are not running you down was the surly answer from a man at the front of the raft  yes you are and we want you to keep off  go on in toward the west shore and you will be all right said the man he was a burly looking individual with an unusually long nose  by this time the lumber raft was sweeping closer the raft and the houseboat were moving in the same direction and this kept them for the time being apart  if you dont keep off there will be trouble cried sam  oh you boys dry up was the reply from the man with the long nose and now they recognized him as a fellow they had met in a hotel at their last stopping place the man had had a row with a porter and had made himself generally disagreeable  the houseboat was under the immediate command of captain starr the captain a rather strange individual was not feeling very well and had gone off to take a nap now it was thought best by all to call him  the overgrown woodchoppers growled the captain as soon as he had come out on deck and taken in the situation sheer off he yelled do you hear  turn in toward shore was the answering cry  we cantits too shallow  is it really too shallow asked dick  i think so we are not in the channel as it is  im going to get a gun came from tom and off he rushed to secure the firearm  the raft had now swept so close that several on board could be seen plainly they were a roughlooking sort and the man with the long nose was the shrewdest of the lot  well have to turn in or well be hit ejaculated sam those side logs are bound to strike the cabin  he pointed to some timbers that projected over the edge of the raft they were only a few feet off and might crash into the cabin of the houseboat at any moment  in anger at being forced to change his course captain starr turned the houseboat toward the bank of the river then the big raft began to pass them just as tom reappeared shotgun in hand  i ought to have you arrested for this stormed captain starr his words were always louder than his actions  bah answered the man with the long nose in derision  maybe youd like to have a taste of this put in tom holding up the gun  dont you dare to shoot yelled the man and lost no time in sliding from his seat and out of sight  at that moment those on the houseboat felt a slight shock and then the crafts headway was checked  whats up now cried dick  were aground thats whats the matter muttered captain starr those rascals ought to suffer for this  in a moment more the big raft had passed the houseboat the latter now began to swing around with the current  i hope we are not stuck in the mud for good grumbled fred garrison  look look burst from sams lips he was pointing to the raft  whats up now came from several of the others  unless i am mistaken dan baxter is on that raft  baxter exclaimed tom  yes  where  he was sitting on that pile of boards in the rear as soon as he saw me he slid out of sight  are you sure it was baxter questioned songbird powell  if it wasnt him it was his double  if it was baxter we ought to try to catch him suggested fred  i dont see how we are going to catch anybody just now sighed dick we are stuck hard and fast  oh dick are we really aground questioned dora  we are that said captain starr  is there any danger asked nellie laning who had joined the others accompanied by her sister grace  no immediate danger miss it depends on whether we can get off or not  well have to get off said tom decidedly    rub a dub dub   were stuck in the mud   as hard as hard can be   shall we ever   or shall we never   set the houseboat free came softly from songbird powell  great caesar thats a fine thing to make a rhyme about returned sam reproachfully  lets make songbird wade out in the mud and shove us off suggested tom with a wink at his companions  wade out in the mud cried the youth who was given to rhymes not much  mud bath is the finest thing in the world songbird went on tom bound to cure hay fever warts squinteye and lots of things  then you go take it yourself murmured songbird  well have to get out the rowboat and see if we cant pull her off said captain starr  yes and the sooner the better said dick if we wait we may get harder aground than ever  it did not take long to let the rowboat over the side of the dora as the houseboat was named then dick sam tom and fred got in to do the rowing while the others remained on the houseboat to try what they could do toward poling off a line was made fast between the rowboat and the dora and the boys began to pull away with might and main  is she moving asked dick after several minutes of hard pulling  not yet answered captain starr keep at it though  let us shift some of the heavy things on board suggested songbird and this was done then the boys rowed with all their might and those on the houseboat used their poles to the best advantage  hurrah she vos coming shouted hans dots der time vot you did sometings aint it  keep at it boys came from the captain well be all right in a few minutes more  mind you we dont want to tow the houseboat down to new orleans said tom who was perspiring freely in the warm sun  there she goes came a moment later we are all right now and a little hurrah went up  i wish i had those lumbermen hereid give em a bit of my mind said sam who felt tired out from the hard rowing it was all their fault  of course it was their fault answered dick more than likely though well never meet them again  what an awfully long nose one of them had  i dont believe that fellow was a lumberman he wasnt dressed like the others and didnt act like them  the rowboat was soon placed aboard of the houseboat once more and the dora continued on her course down the river all told a half hour had been lost and the lumber raft was scarcely a speck in the distance  id like to know for certain if that was dan baxter on board said dick to sam if it was and he saw us hell do his best to make trouble again  well the best we can do dick is to keep our eyes open  do you think that lumber raft will tie up somewhere below here asked tom  the raft is certain to tie up somewhere tom but it may go a good many miles before that happens answered the eldest rover and there the subject was for the time being dropped    chapter iii  a pepper ghost  mrs stanhope and mrs laning had been taking a nap and they were much interested when they awoke and learned of what had occurred  let us be thankful that the raft did not run us down said doras mother who was a widow  it was mean to make us run aground was mrs lanings comment some folks try their best to get others into trouble  that fellow with the long nose got out of sight in a hurry when he saw the shotgun observed tom  oh tom you wouldnt have shot him would you cried nellie  i only meant to scare him but if they had really run us down i dont know what i would have done  it was not long after this that the lumber raft passed entirely out of their sight gradually the talk changed and all began to wonder where they were to tie up for the night  i did hope to reach masterville said captain starr but i dont think we can make it  do we need anything in particular in the shape of provisions asked dick  i dont think so you might ask aleck  the person referred to was a colored man who was in the employ of the rovers and had been with the boys on many of their outings his full name was alexander pop and he thought the world and all of dick tom and sam  hullo aleck called out dick going to the cooks galley  yes sah comin sah was the answer and in an instant alecks smiling ebony face showed itself at the doorway  have we got enough provisions on hand until tomorrow  yes sah  then we wont have to go ashore for anything  no sah less yo want sumfing very special and the colored man grinned  are you going to give us a pretty good supper aleck asked tom walking up  lamb chops sah an green peas sweet potatoes an cake an cutup peaches  thats firstrate aleck said dick smiling  any quail on toast asked tom  no sah  any bear steaks or salmon eggs  aint seen none ob dem tings yet massa tom  how about butterflies wings on toast  whawhats dat  or milkweed stewed in onion fat went on tom earnestly  gracious sakes alive sah i didnt know dat  or firefly fritters aleck dont you love firefly fritters especially when they are rolled in lemon skin and cheese  say massa tom aint you afoolin dis darkey  fooling why aleck you know i never fool tom gave a sigh thats the way of the world when a fellow is trying to do his best and he walked off leaving the faithful aleck staring after him doubtfully but soon the colored man began to smile to himself  dats some moah ob his jokes dats what dat is he murmured dat boy couldnt lib less he was playin a joke on sumbody  the houseboat had now gained a portion of the river where the shore was lined with a beautiful forest and as the sun began to set over the treetops all came out on the deck to enjoy the scene  if it wasnt for the troubles we have encountered this would be an ideal trip said dora as she stood by dicks side  let us forget the troubles dora said the youth softly and gave her hand a little squeeze i am so glad you are with us if you werent i think it would be rather lonely for me  oh dick you mustnt talk so cried the girl and blushed but she was pleased nevertheless  just where the forest ended there was a point of land stretching out into the river and there it was decided to tie up for the night an early supper was had and then about half of the party went ashoredick and dora to take a stroll in the moonlight and tom sam and some of the others to do a little exploring  the forest looks a little bit spooky said fred as they walked along  spooky came scornfully from songbird powell why its grandfairly breathing the essence of poetry and then he continued    down in the depths of a forest grand   where many a hoary tree doth stand   and many a little babbling brook   gives music to each shady nook   tis there i love a walk to take  and step upon a rattlesnake finished tom better keep your eyes open songbird or the rattlers will be after you they love music and poetry you know  rattlesnakes horrible shuddered songbird thats enough to drive the poetry out of a fellow for a week  do you think there are any rattlers here asked sam  i tont vos afraid of raddlesnakes alretty put in hans i vos know a fine vay to kill dem and his mild eyes began to twinkle  whats the way hans asked tom  first you got some poison in a pottle  yes  den you go py der voots till you come py mr raddlesnake  all right proceed  den you got dot mr raddlesnake py der neck oben his mouth und put der boison on der insides in an hour mr raddlesnake vos so dead like nefer vos alretty  sold thats the time hans caught you tom exclaimed sam and set up a roar  yah i vos chust vaiting to cotch you tom and now the german youth joined in the hilarity  all right thats one on me said tom my move next he added but under his breath  theres a rattlesnake now yelled fred a moment later and all gave a jump hans as lively as the rest but it was only a small reptile and harmless and quickly disappeared from view  in a clearing the boys built a fire and sat around this telling stories and talking over the events of the day  from one thing and another the conversation gradually drifted around to ghosts and fred told a ghost story that was thrilling in the extreme  dont you believe in ghosts hans questioned sam  not much i tont answered the german youth da vos all humbugs alretty  then you wouldnt run if you saw a ghost queried songbird  not von sthep said hans positively  this talk set tom to thinking and on the way back to the houseboat he called sam to his side  ive got an idea  what is it questioned his brother  you heard what hans said about ghosts  to be sure i did  well ive got an idea for some fun  good for you tom  well fix up a ghost  oh thats old  so it is but this particular kind of ghost isnt old  what is it to be  one full of pepper  pepper  exactly and when hans hammers itwhy look out thats all  the matter was talked over for a few minutes and sam readily fell in with his brothers ideas reaching the houseboat the pair went to one of the staterooms and procured a sheet and a bolster  then tom ran off to the galley and obtained a box full of pepper the pepper was sprinkled over the sheet and the bolster  now well take the outfit to hans room said tom and this was done without the german youth being aware of what was taking place  the others were then let into the plot and just before retiring tom called hans to one side  hans i want to give you a tip he whispered tragically  vot for  some of the fellows are going to scare you they have fixed up a ghost in your room  is dot so  when you go to bed dont be frightened  not much i vont pe tom maype i vos hammer dot ghost hey  thats the talk take a switch along and lock your door then you can switch the ghost good  ha ha dots a goot blan roared the german youth maype somepody tont cotch him  a few minutes after that the boys and the others separated for the night and hans retired to his own stateroom  as it was bright moonlight no lights had been lit nor did the german youth make any  tom had deceived him completely and behind his back he carried a heavy switch he intended to lather the ghost good before giving the joker whoever he might be a chance to get away  as he closed the door he caught sight of something white and ghostlike standing near the head of his berth he shut the door softly and locked it  oh my he cried a ghost a ghost and then he raised his switch and brought it down on the white object with all his might blow after blow was delivered in rapid succession for he wanted to get in as many cracks as possible before the joker should expose himself  dere you vos you pad ghost he cried i dink you vos  at this point hans stopped short something had entered his nosesomething that tickled exceedingly  kerchew kerchew he sneezed vot iskerchew i dinkkerchew oh my kerchew i vos schneeze mine headkerchew stop dot somepodykerchew oh dearkerchew oben der doorkerchew  blinded and sneezing violently hans dropped his switch and made for the door throwing it wide open he ran out to get some pure air for the stateroom was filled with floating pepper  i fix somepody for diskerchew he roared chust vait you chokers  then he caught sight of tom who stood nearby grinning  dot vos your drick he went on chust you come here  thank you not tonight hansy my dear boy said the joker keeping at a safe distance  vell den you go long mit your old ghost went on hans and picking up the peppered bolster and sheet he threw them into toms room where the funloving youth had the pleasure of disposing of the mess as best he could    chapter iv  trouble with negroes    the rolling the rolling   the rolling river for me   the rolling river the rolling river   that carries us down to the sea  so sang songbird powell the next morning when he came out on deck after a refreshing nights rest  songbird youre a regular lark remarked dick  i feel like one was the answer who wouldnt feel good on such a glorious morning as this  maype you didnt haf some ghosts drouble you put in hans with a grin  forget it hans answered dick its too fine a morning to think of ghosts  it was indeed a glorious morning clear and balmy the ladies of the party were much pleased and so were the girls all gathered on the deck to take in the sights before breakfast was announced by aleck  a big schooner was passing with all sails set and not long after this a large steamer bound up the mississippi hove into sight  now well get some big swells remarked sam and he was right soon the houseboat began to rock in a fashion that pleased the boys but alarmed the girls  when the houseboat rocks like that im always afraid well be swamped said grace  there is little danger of that said captain starr the wash would have to be much heavier before it could do any damage  the morning passed pleasantly enough the ladies spent the time over their fancy work while the girls and boys read played games and also sang and played there was a piano on the dora and the boys had a guitar and a banjo along  they were at dinner and discussing their next stopping place when without warning there came a shock that threw aleck flat on the floor with a trayful of cupcustards over him  fo de lan sake gasped the colored man has we struck a stone wall  whow ejaculated fred who had had some hot coffee spilled on his knee this isnt pleasant i can tell you  dick was already running on deck and the others followed they saw that captain starrs face was full of concern not another craft of any kind was in sight and they were a good two hundred feet from shore  didnt we strike something captain asked the eldest rover  reckon we did sir was the answer  what  a sunken tree most likely they are the worst things to be met with on the mississippi more than one boat has been sunk by a hidden tree trunk  did the snag poke a hole into us asked tom if it did we had better make for shore  ill look around and see said the captain and did so accompanied by the boys and aleck for the time being dinner was forgotten  fortunately no great damage had been done one side board had been loosened but this was easily nailed tight and then the houseboat proceeded on her way as before  ive heard of boats being wrecked by these snags said songbird  one boat i was on some fifteen years ago was wrecked that way said captain starr she was running at full speed when we struck a big tree that had rather a sharp point the point ran through into the cabin and killed two people and the boat sank in ten minutes  excuse me from such a disaster as that was freds comment while nellie who had heard the story shuddered  that evening they tied up close to the village of canston not far south was a large plantation employing a great number of negroes and some of these came down to take a look at the houseboat  as soon as the dora was tied up captain starr made a thorough examination of the craft to make certain that she had received no injury below the waterline dick accompanied him and so did songbird  she is o k announced the captain there isnt a leak as big as a flea anywhere  aleck tom and sam went down into the village to procure some stores for the houseboat and while there learned that there had been a row at the plantation and two negroes had been seriously hurt as a consequence of the quarrel one burly negro called watermelon pete had run away  hes a bad egg that watermelon pete said the storekeeper in speaking of the affair i wish hed leave this locality for good  when the boys got back to the houseboat they found the others hunting all over the dora with lanterns  what are you looking for asked tom  grace thinks she saw a big negro come on board answered dick we are trying to root him out  the houseboat was searched from end to end but nothing could be discovered of any intruder  must have sneaked off again said sam if he did i hope he didnt steal anything  well keep our eyes open after this said captain starr  the night passed quietly enough but for some reason she could not explain grace awoke long before the others she tried to go to sleep again but finding that a failure dressed and went out on the deck  she had been out only a few minutes when on walking past the diningroom window she saw a sight that filled her with amazement by the closet was a burly negro filling a carpetbag with silverware  oh she cried stop that  at the sound of her voice the burly negro turned and scowled viciously at her  yo dun keep quiet he said in a low intense voice  i shall not answered grace help somebody she called  hush up yo fairly hissed the burly intruder and sprang for the doorway in another moment he had grace by the arm dont yo make anudder sound or yoll git sumfing yo wont lak  oh gasped the poor girl she wanted to say more but the words stuck in her throat the negro still held her and his grasp was like that of steel  are yo gwine to shut up asked the intruder  lelet me go please  aint gwine to let yer go be still now heah  grace did hear and as the negro glowered at her her heart almost stopped beating she gazed around and so did the negro not another person was in sight  come into de room went on the negro after a painful pause and he literally dragged her forward to the door if yo be still yo wont git hurt  holding her with one hand he continued to fill his carpetbag with the other spoons knives and forks were rapidly stowed away and they were followed by some napkin rings and other articles of value  as the negro worked grace recovered some of her selfpossession she did not dare to cry out and tried to think of some other method of arousing the others on the boat her eyes fell upon a bell pull hanging from the wall and on the sly she gave it a violent jerk  the rope connected with a bell in the cooks galley this was close to where aleck was sleeping and it caused the cook to arouse with a start  dis chile mus hab done overslept hisself he exclaimed and then as the bell rang once more he sprang up in a hurry sumting wrong dats suah as yore boahn  throwing himself into some of his clothing he ran out on deck and to the diningroom one glance was enough and he raised a shout which aroused everybody on the houseboat  the shout told the intruder that his game was up and carpetbag in hand he started to run away but aleck put out his foot and the other negro went sprawling at full length  yo stay right dar roared aleck pop wrathfully dont yo tempt to git away nohow less yo want to go to yo own funeral  yo aint gwine ter stop me yelled the thief and sprang up hurling the cook to one side then he started for the shore  by this time sam was coming out of his stateroom he saw the fleeing negro and made after him catching the rascal just as he was about to leap ashore  not so fast he sang out and caught him by the arm  yo cant hole me stormed the burly fellow and tried to twist himself loose but before he could break away captain starr was at hand quickly followed by tom and hans  vots der madder vos he a robber asked hans schoot him der sphot on  git back dar ise a dangerous coon ejaculated the burly negro and suddenly produced a big revolver of the old civil war kind dont dare lay hans on me agin  at the sight of the pistol all fell back and in a twinkling the negro was over the side and running for the nearest patch of woods  let us go after him said dick and the others agreed but pursuit was useless the burly negro was gone later they learned that he was watermelon pete the rascal who had gotten into a row at the nearby plantation  are you hurt grace was sams first question after the chase had come to an end  no but that colored man nearly scared the life out of me she answered and then told her story  i wonder if well ever see him again said fred  most likely not answered dick but he was mistaken he was to meet watermelon pete and under circumstances as surprising as any that he had yet encountered  well there is one satisfaction remarked songbird he didnt get away with any of the stuff  no but he mussed de dininroom all up growled aleck an dat silber has got to be shined up agin befoah we kin use it  during the day several halfintoxicated colored men came on board of the dora and made it decidedly unpleasant for all hands  we may as well get out of here said dick and the others agreed with him  two negroes were on board at the time and captain starr ordered them ashore  give us some rum an well go answered one of them impudently  youre going and without any rum cried dick wrathfully and ran the colored man to the gangplank sam and tom caught hold of the other colored man and did likewise  let go ob me roared one of the fellows and then both of them began to struggle and use language not fit for polite ears to hear  dump them into the riverthe bath will do them good suggested songbird and in a trice this was accomplished and both went down with a loud splash by the time they had managed to crawl to the shore through the mud the houseboat was a good distance out into the stream the negroes shouted and shook their fists but the rovers and their friends and even aleck laughed at them  dem fool niggers dont know nuffin growled the cook ise shamed ob em i is  perhaps they wont be so fresh when another houseboat comes along said fred  or else theyll do their best to get square put in tom  the journey down the river was continued and soon the plantation and the village were left far in the distance    chapter v  dan baxter appears  two days later found the houseboat moored to one of the docks at a small city in arkansas it was a bustling place of perhaps four thousand inhabitants and commanded a fair river trade  the whole party was willing enough to go ashore and the rover boys hired several carriages in which all were driven around to various points of interest  ill tell you what i wouldnt mind doing said sam while driving around id like to get on horseback and take a trip out on the plains  perhaps we can do that before this trip comes to an end answered dick you must remember we have a good part of our outing before us  there was a parade in the town that day and they watched this with interest then the girls and the ladies went back to the houseboat leaving the boys to continue their rambles  i see some lumber rafts here said sam i wonder if that one stopped here that tried to run us down  it might be answered fred  dick was out buying some special supplies and his errand took him to a quarter of the town which was by no means of the better sort as he hurried along he heard several voices in dispute  you must settle that bill at the hotel a heavy voice was saying  you cant leave us until you do settle said a second voice  i paid my bill i am not going to pay for youi didnt invite you to come with me came from a third person  dick thought he recognized that voice and looking in the direction was astonished to see dan baxter the bully was in the hands of two lumbermen who held him by the arm  he must be in trouble thought dick and he was right soon the dispute waxed hot and one of the men hit baxter in the face  stop that cried dick running up stop it i say  at the sound of his voice the men started back in alarm  he must be the new sheriff whispered one they say he looks like a boy  then we had better light out said the second lumberman and on the instant both took to their heels and disappeared around a corner  when dick reached dan baxters side he found the former bully of putnam hall pale and much agitated he too wanted to run away but dick held him  so we meet again baxter  let go of me growled the bully  what are you doing here  thats my business  what were the men doing  they wanted me to pay their hotel bill for them but i didnt propose to do it  do you know that lew flapp is under arrest  i dont care  i think ill have to have you arrested too  not much dick rover  you came down the river on that big lumber raft didnt you  what if i did  those rascals did their best to run us down  ha ha they gave you a fine scare didnt they and the bully laughed boisterously  did the raft stop here  no but i did  well you had better come with me dan  where to  the lockup  never the big bully drew back you let me alone  dick caught hold of baxter once more but now the bully hauled off and hit him a stinging blow on the chin the eldest rover retaliated by a blow that blackened the bullys left eye then they clinched and rolled on the ground  hi whats the matter here called out a planter running up at this moment  he is a thief cried dan baxter take him off of me  a thief eh said the planter and he caught dick by the arm come let him up you rascal  he was a powerful man and hauled dick back with ease in a trice dan baxter scrambled up and drew back a few paces  ill get an officer he called out and ran off to disappear down an alleyway between a group of negro shanties  come after him said dick he is the real thief you have blundered  you cant fool me suh said the planter firmly  what wont you come after him  nary a step i allow i know a thief when i see one  do you mean that for me  i surtainly do suh  well youre a big fool thats all i have to say cried dick and watching his chance he got out of the planters clutches and ran after dan baxter  the chase led into the worst portion of the town but dick did not give up until a good hour had passed then he returned to the houseboat much downcast and told his story  and the worst of it is my watch is missing he announced  perhaps you dropped it during the struggle suggested songbird  either that or dan baxter got his fist on it while we were talking he is bad enough now to do almost anything  better go back and see if you cant find the watch said tom ill go with you  they walked to the spot and made a thorough search but the watch failed to come to light dick gave a long sigh  im out that timepiece and i guess for good he murmured  they were about to return to the houseboat when dick saw the planter approaching once more  ha so you have come back suh he cried  did you see anything of my watch remanded dick sharply  your watch  yes its gone  i saw nothing of a watch  i suppose that other fellow came back with an officer didnt he went on the eldest rover sarcastically  i did notahsee him suh  im out my watch all because of your foolishness  suh  you neednt suh me i mean what i said my watch is gone if you didnt take it yourself you helped that fellow to get away with it  this to me suh me colonel jackson gibbs suh of the sudley light artillery suh infamous suh  so is the loss of my watch infamous  i shall make a complaint suh to the authorities  go ahead and tell them that i lost my watch too and walked off leaving colonel jackson gibbs of the sudley light artillery gazing after him in amazement  do you think he will make more trouble asked tom  not he he is too scared that i will hold him responsible for the loss of the watch and dick was right they never did hear of the planter again  that night all on board did nothing but talk about dan baxter and the way he had managed to escape  he is as bad as paddys flea said dora when you put your finger on him he isnt there  the houseboat left the town the following afternoon and the course was now down the mississippi in the direction of a village called braxbury where mrs stanhope had some friends of many years standing  they used to have quite a plantation said the lady if they still have it well have a good chance for a nice time on shore  and we can go out for that ride on the prairies added sam  want to scalp a few noble red men asked tom with a wink  no red men in mine tom but wouldnt you like an outing of that sort just for a change  dont know but what i would but we couldnt take the girls along very well  no we could leave them with their friends at the plantation  on the following day it began to rain and all had to keep to the cabin of the houseboat at first the rain came down lightly but towards noon it poured in torrents out on the river the weather grew so thick that they could not see a hundred feet in any direction  better run for the shore and tie up said dick to captain starr we dont want to run the risk of a collision especially when our times our own  i was just going to suggest it said the skipper of the dora and soon they were turning toward shore a good landing place was found and the houseboat was tied up near several large trees in that vicinity  instead of abating the storm kept increasing in violence so far there had been but little thunder and lightning but now several vivid flashes lit up the sky and some sharp cracks made the girls jump  oh i detest a thunder storm cried nellie i wish it was over  so do i answered dora but i suppose we have got to make the best of it  do not sit so close to an open window said mrs laning  i was going to close the window came from mrs stanhope i never sit with a window open during such a storm as this and then the window was closed and also the door  im going out for some fresh air said tom a little later when the worst of the lightning seemed to be over i hate to be cooped up like a chicken in a henhouse and getting out his raincoat he went on deck and presently dick followed him  this will make the river swell up remarked dick gazing around curiously gracious how it pours  the wind is rising thats a sign it is going to clear up  not always tom i think this storm will last all day and perhaps tonight too  the boys walked from one end of the houseboat to the other and gazed out on the rolling river then a gust of wind almost took them from their feet  phew we cant stand much of this observed dick well get drenched in spite of our raincoats i think  dick got no further for at that moment there was a weird flash of lightning followed by an earsplitting crash of thunder then came a crash of another kind  look out one of the trees is coming down on the houseboat ejaculated dick  as he uttered the words another crash followed and down came the trunk of a big tree cutting into the companion ladder and the cabin of the dora one of the branches of the tree swept over poor tom and before he could save himself he was hurled into the river    chapter vi  the effects of a big storm  tom cried dick as he saw his brother swept from view  there was no answer to this call and much alarmed the eldest rover leaped over a limb of the fallen tree and ran to the edge of the houseboat  the rain was again coming down in torrents and for the moment dick could see little or nothing he heard a cry from the cabin of the dora and this increased his dismay  at last he caught sight of toms head about ten feet away from the houseboat a glance showed him that his brother was unconscious and on the point of sinking again  i must save him muttered dick to himself and without an instants hesitation he leaped overboard  dick tom the cry was uttered by sam as he came running out of the houseboat hatless and in his shirt sleeves  the fallen tree obstructed his view and it was several seconds before he caught sight of his brothers in the water  dick he yelled whats the matter  throw me a rope was the answer and it did not take sam long to obey instructions then dick caught tom under the shoulders and both were hauled back to the side of the dora  did the tree knock you overboard asked sam anxiously  it knocked tom over answered dick  just as he was placed on deck again tom opened his eyes and stared around him  whowhere am i he demanded faintly  you are safe tom answered dick kindly dont you remember the tree knocked you overboard  oh the funloving rover drew a long breath did you fish me out  i jumped in after you and sam fished us both out  good enough  by this time some of the others were stepping forth from the wreck of the cabin all were more or less excited and the girls and ladies came out hatless and coatless despite the rain which now seemed to come down with renewed fury as if to add to their misery  is anybody hurt demanded dick  i was hit by a broken board answered mrs laning but it scared me more than anything else  one of the broken windows came in on me and covered me with glass came from songbird but wasnt that a crack of thunder i thought it was the crack of doom  and were you really hurled overboard asked nellie rushing up to tom and almost embracing him you poor boy how glad i am that you were not drowned  well come to think of it im glad myself he returned with a little smile  oh tom its nothing to joke about  that is true nellie  say i tont vont no more oxcitements like dot cried hans i vos schared out of mine vits alretty aint it  we were all scared said fred but hadnt we better get inside again we are all getting wet to the skin  the cabin is in an awful mess declared dora and she told the truth daylight was streaming through a hole in one corner and the rain was entering in a stream  let us get a tarpaulin and cover that hole said dick ill do it he added i cant get any wetter than i am and he gave a short laugh  and ill help said tom who had recovered rapidly from his involuntary bath  we shall need a carpenter to make repairs said captain starr who had been working to shove off the fallen tree this smashup is a pretty bad one  the boys remained outside and all went to work to remove the tree trunk and to cover the hole with a heavy tarpaulin it was a task lasting the best part of an hour and when it had come to an end the rain was slackening up  we shall certainly have to lay up somewhere for repairs said fred we cant continue the journey in this condition  let us hire a carpenter at the next town we stop at suggested sam and to this they agreed  the mess in the cabin was left for aleck to clean up and then the ladies and the girls straightened things out as best they could as soon as the storm cleared away the journey down the mississippi was continued  i cant help but think of what might have happened if that stroke of lightning had hit the houseboat said songbird it makes me shiver  we certainly had a narrow escape answered dora i never wish to get quite so close to another stroke  on the following day they stopped at a place which i shall call ramontown from one of the dock owners they learned where they could find a master carpenter and they called upon this individual and had him look at the damage done  i can fix up the craft as good as she ever was said he but it will take at least a week and it will take several days more to give her two good coats of paint  the matter was talked over and they decided to remain tied up and have the houseboat put in firstclass condition once more then mrs stanhope sent a long letter to her friends at braxbury stating she would call with some others and mentioned the houseboat trip  just twentyfour hours later a middleaged man came down to the houseboat and shook hands warmly his name was carson denton and he was the husband of mrs stanhopes friend  i am more than glad to see you he said i just got your letter to clara and as she wanted me to open any letter that might be at the braxbury postoffice for her i read it we do not live in braxbury any longer but further west at a place called silver creek where i have a goodsized plantation  is that so when did you move mr denton  only a few weeks ago which accounts for you not having known of the change i had a good chance to trade my place in town for a plantation or ranch as my son bob calls it and i took it we have a fine place and clara will be much pleased i am sure to have you and your friends pay us a visit  oh mamma let us go cried dora i dont wish to stay on the houseboat while the repairs are being made  the matter was talked over for an hour and the boys and girls took mr denton over the houseboat from end to end  ive heard of you rover boys said he to dick tom and sam mrs stanhope has written to us about you and how you once saved her from a fellow named josiah crabtree if you and your chums wish to visit our place id like you to do so ive got a son bob who i know would like to meet you  well i wouldnt mind taking a trip inland answered dick  cant we go on horseback put in sam eagerly  we might do that  certainly you could make the trip in that way said mr denton but it would take some time for the roads are not of the best down here we usually take a train as far as docker crossing and then ride the rest of the distance twelve miles in a carriage or on horseback  ill tell you whats let do suggested tom the girls and the ladies can go with mr denton on the train and all us boys can hire horses and make the trip that way we can leave captain starr and aleck in charge of the houseboat until we get back we need not hurry ourselves for our time is our own  when talked over this plan met with universal approval and it was decided to put it into execution without delay mr denton wished them to make an extended stay at his plantation and the boys decided to take their own time in getting there  it will be just the outing on horseback that i have been looking for said sam i hope we have nothing but clear weather  we ought to have after such a storm said fred see how clear the sky is today  that trip to the plantation on horseback will take about five days said dick that will make quite an outing  puts me in mind of our trip out west said tom what are we going to do when night comes on go to some ranch or make our own camp  oh let us go into our own camp cried songbird it will be such fun  thats the talk chimed in sam  we can camp out on the way if the weather proves good decided dick but if it rains good and hard i reckon all of you will be glad enough to get under cover  pooh whos afraid of a little rain put in fred why that will make us grow  so the talk ran on and finally all arrangements were completed for the trip inland aleck pop was sorry he could not accompany the boys but dick thought it best that he remain behind  you know how captain starr is alecka bit queer at times the dora is a valuable craft and i shall feel safer if i know you are helping to keep watch over her  all right massa dick i will do my best to see dat no harm comes to de houseboat but id like to be wid you boys no use er talkin  perhaps you can go along next time said dick and with this the colored man had to be content  it did not take the ladies and the girls long to get ready for the trip and they left on the following morning the boys going to the railroad station to see them off there was a hearty handshake all around then the train came in and the party was off with a waving of handkerchiefs  and now to get ready for our own start came from tom  through the carpenter who had taken the contract to repair the houseboat they were introduced to a man who owned a number of horses and for a proper consideration this individual let them have the use of the steeds they wanted they were all good animals and used to the saddle and the man guaranteed that the lads would not have any trouble whatever with them  but i want to tell you beforehand that the road is none of the best said the horse owner it is pretty fair for the first fifteen miles or so but then it is bad for thirty miles after that you want to beware of sink holes  weve been on some pretty bad roads before this answered sam i guess well know enough to take care of ourselves  well i didnt think there would be any harm in telling you  oh thats all right  the rover boys were so used to traveling and to camping out that they knew exactly what to take along the other lads were also well informed because of the military encampments in which they had participated they carried only what was necessary so that their steeds might not be too heavily burdened  looks like yo was ready fo a reglar outin remarked aleck when they were ready for a start i dun hopes yo all come back safe and sound  why of course well come back safe and sound exclaimed sam what put that into your noddle aleck  i dunno massa sam but dis am a queer country aint it  not in the least we expect to have a fine outing and nothing else  and well be back here inside of two weeks added dick that is unless we make up our minds to stay at mr dentons place for a while  all right sah  and when we get back i shall expect to see the houseboat in firstclass order continued dick to captain starr  i shall do my best answered the captain  a moment later all of the boys mounted their horses and the journey inland was begun little did they dream of the strange adventures and perils which lay ahead of them    chapter vii  a day on the road  vot kind of a horse you vos call dis annahow  the question came from hans after about four miles of the journey had been covered so far his steed had acted well enough but now without warning the animal began to balk and paw the turf  something is wrong that is certain replied dick perhaps you havent got a tight enough rein hans  dot reins vos so tight as nefer vos i dink dis horse got somedings der madder mit him  as the german boy finished he gave the horse a slap on the neck with his hands in a twinkling up came the steeds hind heels and poor hans slid out of the saddle and down to the neck  voah dere he bawled voah i said vot you vants to do annahow drow me your head ofer sthop und do it kvick  but the horse did not stop instead he began to back and then of a sudden he leaped high up in the air to come down on all fours with a thump that nearly jounced poor hans to pieces  hello hans has got a bucking bronco cried tom hans what will you take for him  i gif him avay bawled the poor german youth oh  for the steed had made another leap and now hans went over his neck in a jiffy to land in a heap of dust on the side of the road then the horse took to his heels and disappeared up the trail like a flash  are you hurt questioned dick leaping to the ground and running to the german youths assistance  vere is dot horse sang out hans as he scrambled up and wiped the dust from his mouth and eyes he was not injured but was greatly excited  the horse has run away  vell i nefer go after him somepotty  ill go after him cried tom  so will i added fred and away they sped with sam and songbird after them  be careful called dick that horse may prove to be a pretty highstrung beast  i think i can manage him cried tom but we have got to locate him first  those in pursuit of the horse had to travel the best part of a mile before they came in sight of the animal quietly grazing by the roadside  looks as meek as a lamb observed fred whoa there he called out  at the call the horse pricked up his ears and looked at them curiously then he took half a dozen steps forward  he is going to run away again came in a warning from songbird  not today sang out tom and riding forward he leaned over and caught the dangling reins then watching his chance he leaped into the other saddle  scarcely had he done this than the runaway steed began to prance and kicked up his heels as before but tom was on guard and try his best the horse could not dislodge the boy  beware tom cried sam dont let him throw you or he may step on you  i dont intend to let him throw me was the panting answer  finding he could not throw tom the horse adopted new tactics he gave a sudden bound forward and was off with the speed of the wind  he is running away with tom  on and on went the steed and tom did his best to pull him in but without result then the funloving youth smiled grimly and shut his teeth hard  all right old fireworks if you want to run ill give you all you want of it he murmured  on and on they flew until a bend in the road shut off the others from view a mile was covered and the horse showed signs of slackening his speed  no you dont said tom you wanted to run now keep it up for a while and he slapped the animal vigorously  away went the horse and another quarter of a mile was passed then the horse slackened up once more  another run please said tom and slapped him as before the horse went on but at a reduced speed and came to a halt before another quarter mile was passed  had about enough eh questioned tom well you can run a little more just for good measure  by the time the next run came to an end the horse was covered with foam and tired out for the road was very rough tom now turned him back and made him journey along at a fairly good rate of speed  well i declare here comes tom back cried fred on catching sight of the funloving rover are you hurt  not a bit  and the horse asked sam  as meek as a lambshouldnt wish for a better animal he wanted a little run thats all and i gave it to him  soon dick came up with hans riding behind him the german boy looked at the captured horse with awe  did he bite you he questioned  no  didnt he hurt you at all  nary a hurt hansy  vonderful  do you want him back  not for a dousand tollars tom of i got to ride him i valk continued hans decidedly  then supposing you try my horse he is gentle enough  tont you been afraid of dot beast  no  all right den i dook your horse but of you got killed it tont vos mine funeral added hans warningly  the animal tom had been riding was close by and soon the german youth was in the saddle and the journey was resumed they could not go fast however for toms horse was all but exhausted  i think he has learned his lesson said tom to his brothers and so it proved for after that single kickup the horse gave them no further trouble  about four oclock that afternoon they rode into a place called harpertown which was something of a horsetrading center some of the horse dealers thought they had come in to do some trading but lost interest when the boys told them that they were simply on a journey to the denton plantation  we may as well stop here for a while said sam perhaps we can get a good supper at the hotel  thought we were going to camp out remarked fred build our own camp fire and all that  we can try that tomorrow when we are among the hills said dick and by a vote it was decided to stay in harpertown for supper  they put up their horses at the livery stable attached to the hotel and then went to the lavatory to wash up on coming out and going to the general room of the hostelry dick ran into a man who looked familiar to him  why how do you do mr monday he cried and put out his hand  the man looked startled at being addressed so unexpectedly then he recognized dick and smiled faintly  how do you do dick rover he said i didnt expect to run across you down here  are you at work here mr monday  hush please do not mention my name said james monday hastily he was a detective who had once done some work for dicks father after which he had given up his private practice to take a position with the united states government  all right just as you please dick lowered his voice i suppose you are on a case down here  james monday nodded  can i help you in any way  i think not rover where are you bound  to a plantation about a hundred miles from here and the eldest rover gave a few particulars  well i wish you luck said the government detective now do me a favor will you he asked earnestly dont act as if you know me and dont tell anybody who i am  ill comply willingly  if your brothers recognize me ask them to do the same  i will  i am looking up some rascals and i dont want them to get on to the fact that i am a detective  i understand  at that moment a heavyset individual with a shock of bushy hair came slouching in at once james monday took his departure the newcomer gazing after him curiously  dick waited a moment and then rejoined sam and tom  dick we just caught sight of a man we know said sam can you guess whom  mr dayoftheweek put in tom  dick put up his hand warningly  dont mention that to a soul he whispered i was just talking to him he is here on special business and he wants nobody to know him  then well be as mum as a mouse in a cheese answered sam  correct joined in tom but whats his game  i dont know answered dick but he was destined to find out ere he was many days older    chapter viii  fun at the hotel  the long ride had made all of the boys hungry and when they procured supper at the hotel they cleaned up nearly everything that was set before them  nothing the matter with your appetites observed a sourlooking individual who sat next to tom at the table  nothing at all sir answered the funloving youth what made you think there was  eh  what made you think there was something wrong with our internal machinery whereby we might be wanting in a proper regard for victuals  the man stared at tom and while a few at the table snickered the man himself looked more sour than ever  see here dont you poke fun at me he cried  never dreamed of it my dear sir said tom unruffled by the way hows your heart  whyermy hearts all right  glad to hear it yesterday i heard of a donkey who had his heart on the wrong side of his body odd case wasnt it  see here you young imp do you mean to call me aera donkey and the man grew red in the face  a donkey why no sir what put such a notion in your head  you said  so i did go on  you said  so you said before  you said  you said that before you said i said and i said so i did its perfectly clear as the strainer said to the tea  by this time all sitting at the table were on a broad grin as a matter of fact the sourlooking man was not liked in that locality and the boarders were glad to see somebody take him down  i wont put up with your foolishness stormed the man i am not a donkey and i want you to know it  well i am glad you mentioned it said tom calmly now there wont be the least occasion for a mistake  dont insult me  no sir i am not looking for work  eh  i said i wasnt looking for work  what do you mean by that  that sir is a mystery puzzle and there is a reward of one herring bone for the correct solution answers must be sent in on one side of the paper only and have a certificate added that the sender has not got cold feet  at this quaint humor some at the table laughed outright the sourlooking individual looked thoroughly enraged  iill settle with you another time young man he roared and dashed from the room  tom you made it rather warm for him remarked dick  well he had no right to find fault with our appetites grumbled tom we are paying for our meals and i am going to eat what i please  and i dont blame you young man said a gentleman sitting opposite sladen is very disagreeable to us all and makes himself especially obnoxious to newcomers he imagines the hotel is here for his especial benefit  well he wants to treat me fairly or ill give him as good as he sends and better  during the evening sladen made himself particularly disagreeable to the rovers and their chums this set tom to thinking and he asked one of the hotel men what business the man was in and where he usually kept himself  he is a traveling salesman was the answer he sells horse and cattle medicine  oh i see said tom and set his brain to work to play some joke on the sourlooking vender of stock remedies  toms chance came sooner than expected a batch of colored folks had drifted into the place under the impression that a certain planter was going to give them work at big wages they were a worthless lot the scum of other plantations and nobody wanted them  sitting down tom penned the following note and got it to one of the negroes in a roundabout fashion  the man who wants you and all of the others is sandy sladen he does not dare to say so here at the hotel but all of you had better go up to him on the sly and tell him you are ready to work and ask for a dollar in advancethats the sign that it is all right do not let him put you off as he may want to test you this is the chance of your life  the communication was signed with a scrawl that might mean anything the negro read it and passed it to his friends all were mystified but they decided that they must do as the letter said and without loss of time  sladen was sitting in the readingroom of the hotel smoking a cheap cigar when he was told a negro wished to see him  very well send him in he said in his loud consequential tone  the burly negro came in almost on tiptoes and putting his mouth close to sladens ear whispered  ise ready to go to work sah hadnt yo bettah gib me a dollah sah  whats that demanded the traveling man  the negro repeated his words in a slightly louder tone  i dont want you to work for me cried the sourlooking individual get out  dats all right sah i can do it sah  i dont want you  yes yo do sah wont you han ober dat dollah sah it will come in mighty useful sah  say youre crazy cried the traveling man  by this time two other colored men were coming in both approached as secretly as had the first  ise ready to go to work fo you sah said each and added kin i hab dat dollah  look here what does this mean roared the irate man get away from here before i boot you out  but the negroes did not go and in a few minutes more three others entered soon the readingroom was full of them all talking in an excited manner  wese ready to work fo you they cried  give me a chance fust bawled one big coalblack fellow  no de fust job comes to me put in the man who had received the letter  dat job is mine called out a third aint dat so and he caught sladen by the arm  this was a signal for the others and soon they completely surrounded the traveling man who tried in vain to ward them off  give us dat dollah called out several  we want work an yo has got to gib it to us  yo cant bring us to dis town fo nuffin  they pushed and hustled the traveling man all around the room while the rest of the guests looked on in amazement tom and his friends stood by the door and enjoyed the scene immensely  he is surely getting all that is coming to him observed fred  say he vos so mad like a bumbles bee came from hans  if you dont go away ill call an officer came frantically from the traveling man i dont want to hire anybody  yes yo do was the chorus give us dat dollah  by this time the owner of the hotel had heard of the excitement and he came bustling in  see here he said to sladen you cant use this hotel for an employment office if you want to hire help you have got to do it on the outside  i dont want help stormed the traveling man  these men say you sent for them  maybe he wants them to try some of his horse remedies suggested a man who did not like sladen if so i advise them not to take the job and a general laugh arose at the sally  you have got to get out of here said the hotel man speaking to the negroes and you must go too he added to the traveling man  me  yes you you have made trouble enough around here after this when you come to town you can go to some other hotel  this is an outrage  we want a job or some money bawled two of the colored men and they rushed at sladen and began to shake him violently he pushed them away and started for the door they went after him and in the hallway he got into a free fight and almost had his coat torn from his back  ill get even with somebody for this he almost foamed if i find out who played this joke on me  go on and do your talking outside interrupted the hotel proprietor and then the disgruntled traveling man had to leave with the angry mob of colored men following him he was so pestered by the latter that he had to take a train out of town the very next morning  that was piling it on pretty thick tom said dick after the excitement was over  he deserved it dick i made some inquiries around the hotel and not a single person liked him he was the torment of all the hired help and was keeping them in hot water continually  well if he finds you out hell make it warm for you  i intend to keep mum answered the funloving rover and he did keep mum it may be added here that he never met sladen again    chapter ix  hans as a poet  dick was down in the stable attached to the hotel on the following morning when a man came in and approached him he was the same individual who had drawn near when the eldest rover was talking to the government detective  getting ready to leave stranger he said in a pleasant tone  yes we are going to start right after breakfast  bound for the denton plantation so i hear  yes do you know mr denton  i met him once or twicewhen he was in business in braxbury a nice man so i understand  yes he is a very nice man  it might be that you are related to him  no  thats a nice hoss youve been riding  i find him so answered dick shortly he did not fancy the appearance of the man who was speaking to him  looks something like a horse was here yesterday and the day before continued the man following dick up i reckon you remember him  dick did remember for the horse had been ridden by james monday  by the way who was your friend added the man with assumed carelessness but eying dick closely  i cant tell you anything about him was the sharp answer have you a horse here continued dick to change the subject  certainly then you didnt know the man  oh i met him once or twice years agowhen he was in business up in new york and without waiting to be questioned further dick walked out of the stable the man eyed him as closely as he had the government detective the day previous  he isnt much more than a boy but id like to know if he is out here only for pleasure or on business said the man to himself we cant be too careful in our work and he smiled grimly  that fellow wants to know too much said the eldest rover in talking it over with his brother sam i must say i dont like his looks at all  nor i dick ill wager he has some game up his sleeve  perhaps he is the fellow mr monday is watching  that is possible too he was certainly very inquisitive  after a good breakfast the rovers and their friends prepared to resume their journey from the landlord of the hotel they obtained information regarding the roads and trails to follow  they aint none of the best said the hotel man but they are the best we possess so youll have to put up with them and he laughed at his little joke  they were soon on the way a good nights rest had put all in the best of humor and they joked and sang as they rode along  songbird this ride ought to be full of inspirations for you remarked fred  ill wager he is chockful of poetry at this minute put in dick  then for gracious sake turn on the spigot before you explode songbird cried tom dont pen up your brilliant ideas when they want to flow  an idea just popped into my head said the sostyled poet now you have asked me you have got to stand for it and in a deep voice he commenced    the road is dusty the road is long   but we can cheer our way with song   and as we ride with gladsome hearts  each one can wish he had some tarts finished tom and continued    or pies or cakes or icecream rare   good things that make a fellow stare  dont mention icecream cried fred oh but wouldnt it be fine on such a hot day as this  no icecream in this poetry came from songbird listen and he went on    the road doth wind by forests deep   where soft the welcome shadows creep   down the valley up the hill   and then beside the rippling rill   the welcome flowers line the way   throughout the livelong summer day   the birds are flitting to and fro  they love to flit and flit you know came from the irrepressible tom and he added    the bullfrog hops around the marsh   his welcome note is rather harsh   the lone mosquito shows his bill   and boring deep secures his fill  hold on there came from dick i draw the line on mosquitoes in poetry they can do their own singing  and stinging added fred gayly  mape i vos make some boultry vonce aint it said hans calmly  thats it hans cried sam go ahead by all means and the german youth started    der sky vos green der grass vos plue   i sit town to an oyster stew   der pirds vos singing all der night   you vill get choked of your collar is tight   oh see der rooster scratching hay   ven der pand begins to blay   at night der sun goes town to ped   und cofers mid clouds his old red head   at night der moon she vinks at me  for making such bad poetree finished tom and added with a groan hans did you really make that all up by yourself  sure i did was the proud answer  you must have had to eat an awful lot of mince pie to do it put in sam  vot has mince bie to do mit boultry  its got a lot to do with such poetry as that murmured songbird in disgust  oh i know vots der madder you vos jealous of me hey  sure he is jealous hans said dick songbird couldnt make up such poetry in a hundred years  it runs in der family went on the german boy calmly mine granfadder he vonce wrote a song da sung him py a funeral  did it kill anybody asked fred  not much it vos a brize song he got a dollar for doing it  it must run in the family like wooden legs among the soldiers said tom and there the fun for the time being came to an end  the road now ran up a hill and then they came to a thick patch of timber before they left the timber they rested for their midday lunch camping out as suited them  this is something like remarked fred i think it firstrate  it is very nice to be outdoors when it doesnt rain answered dick  how nice it would be if we had the girls along said sam  oh ho sam is pining for grace cried tom teasingly  pooh you neednt to blow returned the youngest rover blushing last night you called out for nellie in your sleep you must have been dreaming of her  ill dream you burst out tom getting as red as sam had been and he made a move as if to throw a cup of coffee at his brother  children children said dick sweetly i ameramazed  hes sorry because you forgot to mention dora said the irrepressible tom now dora is just the cutest  avast tom or you will get it said dick we havent got the girls with us so let us drop the subject  it was very pleasant in the timber and they did not leave until thoroughly rested near at hand was a small but pure stream and here they washed up and watered their horses  while the others were at the stream tom wandered off in the direction of the road now they saw him coming back full of excitement  whom do you suppose i saw on the road he said  give it up returned fred  dan baxter  baxter came in a chorus  yes he was with that fellow who was at the hotel the chap with the bushy hair added tom to dick the man who asked so many questions  were they on horseback asked sam  yes when baxter saw me he looked frightened i called to him to stop but he wouldnt do it  where were the pair going asked dick with interest  in the same direction we are going  perhaps we can catch up with them went on dick anyway it is worth trying  a minute later all were in the saddle and on the trail once more    chapter x  a twentydollar bill  its odd that dan baxter should be out here observed sam as they journeyed along can he be following us  it is possible returned dick you know he would do almost anything to harm us  he has got to keep his distance said fred i shant put up with any more of his games  when they came to a turn of the road they saw dan baxter and the bushyhaired man a long distance ahead the former bully of putnam hall was on the lookout for them and at once urged his steed onward at an increased rate of speed  he means to get away if he possibly can cried songbird if we want to catch him we have got to do our utmost  on and on they rode until another turn hid baxter and his companion from view again  the bully was frightened for he did not know what would happen to him if he was caught by the rovers and their friends in such a lonely spot as this  the man who was with him a fellow named sack todd noticed his anxiety and smiled grimly to himself  youre mighty anxious to git away from them fellows he remarked  well if i am what of it returned dan baxter sharply so many things had gone wrong lately that he was thoroughly out of humor  oh i allow you have a perfect right to give em the goby if you want to answered sack todd i wouldnt mind helpin you a bitmaybe tell me about em will you  they are fellows i hate and ive always hated them cried the bully fiercely we used to go to the same boarding academy and they did their best to get me into trouble then i tried to get square and that put me in hot water and i had to leave after that we had more trouble they tried to prove i was a criminal  i see go on  its a long story i hate em and id do almost anything to get square with them  good for you cried sack todd i like a fellow who wants to stand up for himself but just now you are running away  i cant stand up against such a crowd alone but some day it will be different  let us turn down a side road said sack todd that will throw em off the scent  he was a good judge of character and fancied he could read baxters story fairly well the young man had come down in the world and he was bitter against everybody and everything  they passed down a side path and then on to a trail that was all but hidden by the grass and bushes  its a short cut to cottonton said the man we can reach there in no time by this trail very few though know of the route  as they rode along the halfhidden trail he questioned dan baxter more closely than ever and as a result learned as much as he cared to know he realized that the former bully was hard up and ready to do almost anything to make some money what he had possessed he had spent in gambling and other forms of fast living  perhaps i can put you in the way of making some money said sack todd slowly that is if you are not over particular as to what it is he added looking at baxter sharply  im not looking for hard work thank you was the ready answer i am not used to that sort of thing and couldnt stand it  this sort of work would be easy enough but it would require judgmentand a little nerve at first  well i think i have fairly good judgment and as for nervewhy try me thats all  then there is another point to the business youd have to drive some pretty sharp bargains  i can do that  sometimes the goods are not exactly as represented  i guess i understand and that wouldnt stop me and dan baxter grinned but id want pretty good pay  i think i can make that suitableafter we know each other better said sack todd  he continued to draw baxter out and hinted at a scheme to make big money at last the former bully of putnam hall could stand it no longer  see here he cried if you mean business spit out what is in your mind you can trust me with anything i am not of the milkandwater sort i am out for money first last and all the time  then you are a fellow after my own heart answered the man i reckon we can come to terms but not just yet  well ive got to have something pretty quick i am next to deadbroke  perhaps i can help you out a bit  i wish you would  here is twenty dollars i reckon that will prove that i am taking an interest in you and the bright crisp bill was handed over  money talks cried dan baxter he gazed at the bank note in genuine pleasure i am much obliged  here is where i must leave you went on sack todd as they reached a crossing in the trails keep right on and youll soon come in sight of cottonton meet me there tonight at the planters rest  i will  you had better keep out of sightif those rovers are on your trail  trust me to lay low said baxter with a short laugh  in another moment the former bully of putnam hall found himself alone sack todd had galloped off at a high rate of speed  he is certainly an odd sort mused baxter but i guess he means to do right by me or he wouldnt lend me a twenty so readily he must be used to handling big money by the roll of bills he carried i wish i possessed such a roll there must have been several hundred dollars in it at least  he felt to make sure that the bill was safe in his pocket and then continued on his journey several times he looked back but he could see nothing of the rover boys or their friends  dan baxter felt particularly downcast and desperate since the capture of lew flapp he had been without a companion in whom to confide and the peculiar loneliness among utter strangers was beginning to tell on him this was one reason why he had told sack todd so much of his story  coming to the end of the timber and brushwood he saw lying before him in something of a valley the town of cottonton consisting of several well laid out streets and an outlying district of pretty homes at a distance was the regular road but so far his enemies were not in sight  the ride had made baxter hungry and reaching the town he lost no time in hunting up a modest restaurant on a side street where he hoped the rovers would not find him  what can you give me for dinner he asked i want something good  a number of dishes were named over and he selected roast beef potatoes beans coffee and pie he was quickly served and pitched in with a will  riding makes a fellow feel hungry he explained to the proprietor of the eating house who hovered near  yes sah so it does going to stay in town sah  i dont know yet im just looking around  yes sah certainly if you stay ill be pleased to furnish meals regularly sah  ill remember that  having disposed of the meal and also an extra cup of coffee dan baxter called for a cigar and lit it then he hauled out the twentydollar bill as he did so he gave a slight start he had handled a good deal of money in his time and the bank bill looked just a bit peculiar to him  what if it isnt good he asked himself  fortyfive cents please said the restaurant keeper his usual price for such a meal was thirty cents but he thought baxter could stand the raise  sorry i havent a smaller bill answered the bully coolly i ought to have asked the bank cashier to give me smaller bills  i reckon i can change it sah said the restaurant man thinking only of the extra fifteen cents he was to receive  take out half a dollar and have a cigar on me continued baxter magnanimously  yes sah thank you sah said the man  he fumbled around and in a minute counted out nineteen dollars and a half in change pocketing the amount the bully walked out mounted his horse once more and rode away  nice chap to pay fortyfive cents and then treat me to a cigar thought the restaurant keeper wish i had that sort coming in every day  he lit the cigar and smoked it with a relish particularly so as it had not cost him anything he put the twentydollar bill away to use when he should go to a neighboring city to buy some household goods two days later  when he went to buy his things they came to twentysix dollars and he passed over the new twentydollar bill and also an old one received some weeks before  ill have to get change at the bank said the store keeper and left his place to do so in a few minutes he came back in a hurry  see here he cried they tell me one of these bills is a counterfeit  a counterfeit gasped the restaurant man  so the bank cashier says  which bill  the new one  you dont mean it why i took that bill in only a couple of days ago  then you got stuck mr golden  is he sure its a counterfeit  dead certain of it he says its rather a clever imitation and that a number of them are afloat around these parts where did you get it  a stranger gave it to me groaned the restaurant keeper i thought he was mighty smooth he treated me to a cigar i wish i had him here  you had better watch out for him  sure i will but i suppose hell know enough to keep out of my way added the man who had been victimized    chapter xi  a midnight scare  the rovers reached cottonton without catching sight of dan baxter again nor did they locate him while stopping at the town  he knows enough to keep out of our way remarked dick even now he may be watching every move we make  they did not remain in cottonton long and that night found them once more on a trail leading to another patch of timber all were in excellent spirits and hans enlivened the time by singing a song in his broken english in a manner which convulsed them all  hans would make his fortune on the variety stage remarked fred his manner is too funny for anything  vot you said apout a stage demanded the german youth i tont vos ride on no stage ven i got a goot horse alretty  fred wants you to go on the stage said sam  he thinks you might play shakespeare said tom  vot kind of a play is dot shakespeares  its a farce in steen acts and twice as many scenes said dick you might play the doubletongued mute  i like not such a blay i like dot blay vere da vos all killed off kvick  good gracious hans wants to go in for tragedy ejaculated tom who would think he was so bloodthirsty if you keep on like that hansy dear ill be afraid youll murder us in our sleep  i like dem murders da vos alvays make dem goose skins mine back town  at this there was a general roar  goose skins is good came from fred  vot you laffin at hey demanded hans  nothing  dere dont been noddings to laugh at by a murder not so  thats true hansy said sam  maybe of you vos killed you vould sit ub and laugh at him hey  i shouldnt laugh said tom id keep quiet about it  yah i know you tom rofer i bet you sixteen cents i vos a better actor mans as you been continued hans warming up  i dont doubt it hansy some day well put you on the stage  of i got on der stage i make me a hundred dollars a veek i pet you my head  maybe youd make two hundred hans suggested songbird  you all peen jealous of vot i can do but some day i vos show you you see cried the german youth and rode on ahead somewhat out of sorts  they had resolved to camp out that night in true hunter fashion and approaching a spot that looked inviting they came to a halt the place was some distance from the road and ideal in many respects being on high ground and with a spring of pure water flowing into a tiny brook but fifty feet away  as they had no tent they proceeded to make a shelter of boughs and covered the flooring with the same material in the meantime a campfire was lit and two of the number set about preparing the supper which had been brought along  this is all very well when one has his stuff with him observed fred but if we had to go out and shoot game or catch fish it would be a different story  pooh as if we havent done that cried tom i shouldnt like anything better than to go out into the woods for a month  by the time the shelter was in readiness for the night the supper was cooked and all sat around the campfire to partake of the meal a certain part of it had been slightly burnt but to this nobody paid attention although it would have been noticed if this had occurred at home or at a hotel but camping out makes such a difference doesnt it boys  supposing some wild animals came along to eat us up said sam when they were finishing their meal  are there any wild animals around here questioned songbird  i am sure i dont know there may be bobcats in the timber  vot is a popcat asked hans  its a kind of a wildcatvery strong and very fierce  of dot peen der case i tont vonts to meet mr popcat  i dont think any of us want to meet such a beast said tom is anybody to stay on guard tonight  dont ask meim too dead tired said dick promptly  nor me came from the others  let us go to sleep and venture it said sam i dont think a thing will come near us  so it was decided and as soon as the campfire began to die down one after another of the boys retired songbird was the last to lie down and soon he was slumbering as peacefully as the rest  sam had been sleeping perhaps three hours when he woke up with a slight start he sat up and tried to pierce the darkness around him  did anybody call he questioned after a pause  nobody answered and he listened attentively the horses had been tethered in the bushes close to the shelter and now he heard several of the animals move around uneasily  something must be disturbing them he told himself ill have to get up and see what it is  at first he thought he would arouse some of the others but all appeared to be sleeping so soundly he hated to do so  they wont thank me for waking them up unless it is worth while was what he told himself  he arose and felt his way over the others who lay between himself and the opening of the shelter outside there was no moon but the stars were shining brightly and he could make out objects that were not too far off  as he moved toward the horses he heard a rustling in the bushes he strained his eyes and made out a dark form stealing along close to the ground  a wild beast he muttered i wish i had a gun  he turned back to the shelter and aroused dick and then tom this awoke all of the others  whats the matter questioned dick as he got out a pistol  some sort of a wild animal is prowling around this place  py chiminy vos it von of dem catpobs ejaculated hans turning pale  i dont know what it is  where is it now came from fred  i dont know that either it was slinking around yonder bushes a minute ago  let us stir up the fire put in songbird all wild animals hate a big blaze and he set the example and hans helped to heap up the brushwood  i tont vont to become acquainted mit dem catpobs nohow said the german youth he can go avay so kvick like he come  after the fire was brightened there came a painful pause each boy was on his guard with eyes straining from their sockets  i see something cried fred suddenly  where asked the others in a breath  therebut its gone now  again they waited and soon came a rustling on the other side of the camp followed by the cracking of a bone which had been thrown away during the evening repast  there he is  shoot him  no dont shoot burst out tom i know what it is  what  nothing but a dog  nonsense  i say it is tom began to whistle come here old boy he went on good dog come here  at this the animal stopped crunching the bone and came forward slowly and suspiciously it was indeed a large black dog with curly hair and lean sides  hullo cried sam come here thats a good dog say fellows he looks half starved  are you sure it aint no catpob queried hans anxiously  yes hans answered songbird he is nothing but a dog and rather friendly at that  the dog came closer wagging his tail slowly and suspiciously dick put out his hand and patted him and then he waved his tail in a vigorous fashion  he is willing enough to be friends said the eldest rover i shouldnt be surprised if he is homeless  in that case we might adopt him said tom who loved a nice dog  let us try him on something to eat put in songbird there is no meat left on that bone  some things had been saved for breakfast and a portion was set before the newcomer he devoured it greedily and wagged his tail furiously  he feels at home now said dick and he was right the dog leaped up first on one and then another and licked their hands  whats your name asked tom and the dog wagged his tail and gave a low joyful bark  better call him wags suggested sam he seems to be death on keeping that tail going  wags it is announced tom how do you like it wags old boy and the dog barked again and leaped up and down several times in joy  vell he vos goot enough was hans comment bud i tont see vy he couldnt introduce himselluf by der daydime alretty i vos going to ped again and he rubbed his eyes sleepily  so am i going to bed said fred tom are you going to stay awake to watch the dog  no he is going to sleep with me answered the funloving youth come on wags get your nightcap and come to bed  he made a certain move of his hand and the canine suddenly sat upon his haunches and cocked his head to one side  hullo hes a trick dog exclaimed dick shake hands and the dog did so then as sam snapped his fingers the animal began to walk around the camp on his hind legs  ill wager he knows a lot of tricks said tom and if so he must be valuable  then whoever owns him will want him back was songbirds comment  well i guess he can travel with us until somebody claims him said tom and so it was decided    chapter xii  the runaway steer  on the following morning there was the promise of a storm in the air and the boys felt a bit blue over the prospects but by nine oclock the sun came out as brightly as ever and they were correspondingly elated  i dont care to do any camping out in wet weather said fred i got enough of that at the hall  well when you camp out you must take what comes as the shark said when he swallowed a naval officer and found a sword sticking in his throat answered tom we cant have the weather built to order for anybody  wags was up and moving around with his tail wagging as furiously as ever he seemed to feel perfectly at home  acts as if he had known us all our lives said dick he is certainly a fine creature or he will be after he is fed up a bit  if he belongs around here i dont see how he should be starved said sam  well you must remember there are some pretty poor folks living in these parts sam the colored folks are passionately fond of dogs and very often they dont have enough to support themselves  i am going to claim wags as my own until his rightful owner comes along announced tom maybe ill even take him home with me our old dog is dead  this was final and nobody saw fit to dispute the decision so wags was given his breakfast after which the party struck camp and the journey for the denton plantation was continued  the timber passed they came out on a long stretch of prairie land leading to the high hills beyond  here we are on the plains cried sam who wants to race and off he rode at top speed with some of the others following even wags seemed to enjoy the brush and barked continually as he ran ahead and leaped up before one horse and then another  sams wild ride on the plains lasted rather longer than the others had anticipated and when it came to an end all found themselves away from the beaten trail which they had been pursuing they came to a sudden stop and gazed around in perplexity  heres a mess said dick  wheres the trail  that is what i want to know  i think it is over yonder  i think it is in the opposite direction  all of the boys began to talk at once and then followed a dead silence for several seconds  one thing is certainthe trail cant be in two directions said tom  he can pe if he vos krooked said hans wisely  it was a fairly straight trail observed fred i cant see how we happened to leave it  i was following sam said songbird you cant blame me  so was i following sam added several of the others  and i was having a good time on the horse said the youngest rover i thought in the bunch there would be at least one who would look after the trail  so it is really nobodys fault said dick quickly to avoid a possible quarrel the question is how are we going to find the trail again  i know how put in hans calmly  how  look for him  thanks awfully said tom that is a bright as a burntout match  just the same that is what we will have to do tom said dick let us divide up and some go to the right and some to the left  this was considered a good plan and was carried out without delay ten minutes later songbird set up a shout    upon this ground   the trail is found   all come right here   and see it clear  good for songbird cried tom he gets a last years tomato as a reward songbird will you have it in tissue paper or a trunk  well the trail is plain enough was dicks comment as he came riding up i cant see how we missed such a welldefined path  the run had tired their horses somewhat and all were willing to proceed further on a walk they were coming to a fringe of bushes on the plain and here found a stream of water  not a ranch or a plantation of any kind in sight announced fred as he gazed around while some of the steeds obtained a drink what a wilderness certain portions of our country are  plenty of chances for emigrants returned songbird we are a long way from being filled up  the trouble is so i have heard father say so many of the emigrants stay in the big cities rather than come out to the country put in sam  having rested for a spell at the brook they proceeded on their way once more the air was growing warmer and as the sun mounted higher in the sky they wished they were in the shadow of a forest once more  what a journey it must be to cover some of the immense western plains on horseback remarked songbird to ride for miles and milesmaybe all daywithout seeing a cabin or a human being  we know something of that answered dick we liked our trip out west though he added  toward the middle of the afternoon they reached the first stunted growth of timber growing at the base of the hills toward which they had been journeying at noon as it was so hot they had not stopped for lunch and now they proceeded to make themselves comfortable on a patch of thick grass even wags was willing to lie down and stretch out the dog acted as if he had been a member of the party since starting from home  are you going to blame me for going wrong demanded the poetic youth  i wonder if he would be any good after game said sam as he looked at wags  i doubt it said tom an educated dogthat is a trick dograrely knows anything else but nevertheless i think wags remarkably bright  it was not until four oclock that they went on once more according to what they had been told they ought now to be coming in sight of a cattle ranch kept by some old cattle men but nothing like a ranch appeared  this is queer to say the least remarked tom as they came to a halt in a small clearing what do you make of it dick  i shouldnt like to say just yet  do you think we are on the wrong trail queried fred quickly  we may be  of dot is so den py jiminatics ve vos lost ejaculated hans now vosnt dot lofly alretty  lost cried fred  thats the size of it cried songbird we must have taken to the wrong trail after our little race  you found the trail for us remarked tom dryly  not a bit of it said dick all of us were to blame for we all thought it was the right trail the one question is where are we and where is the right trail  and a big question to answer dick came from sam for all we know we may be miles and miles off the road  no use of crying over spilt oil as the lamp said to the wick sang out tom i move we go on until we strike a ranch or plantation or something  that is what well have to do unless we want to go back  no going back in this shouted several and then they moved forward as before but at a slower rate of speed  it was truly warm work and it must be confessed that all were more or less worried in the last town at which they had stopped they had met a number of undesirable characters and one man had told dick that not a few outlaws were roaming around ready to pick up stray horses or money or whatever they could get their hands upon  they were passing through a bit of sparse timber when they heard a strange tramping at a distance  what do you think that can be questioned fred coming to a halt followed by the others  horses suggested hans  sounds to me like cattle said dick but i dont see so much as a cow do you  nothing whatever in sight said tom  as the noise continued sams horse began to grow skittish and showed some inclination to bolt  steady there sang out the youngest rover none of that now and he did his best to hold the steed in check  something is coming cried tom a few seconds later something running pretty well too  by instinct all turned to the side of the trail sam taking a position between a clump of trees and a big rock swiftly the sound came closer and then of a sudden a big and wildlooking steer broke into view lumbering along the trail at his best speed  a steer  look out fellows he is wild and ugly  he looks as if he meant to horn somebody  so the cries rang out and all of the boys drew further to the side of the trail as the steer came up he paused and gazed at them in commingled wonder and anger  he is going to charge began tom when with a fierce snort the steer wheeled to one side and charged upon sam and his horse at full speed    chapter xiii  jim jones the cowboy  to some of the boys it looked as if sam and his steed must surely be seriously injured if not killed the steer was large and powerful looking and his horns were sharp enough to inflict serious damage  back up sam screamed tom  poor sam could not back very well and now his horse was thoroughly unmanageable closer came the steer until his wicked looking horns were but a foot away  at that critical moment a shot rang out so close at hand that it made all of the boys jump realizing the dire peril dick had drawn the pistol he carried and fired at the steer his aim was fair and the beast was struck in the ribs  good for you dick burst out poor sam give him another he added as he tried to quiet his horse and keep the steed from pitching him to the ground  dick was quite willing to take another shot but to get into range was not so easy songbirds horse was between himself and the steer and the latter was plunging around in a manner that was dangerous for the entire party  but at last the eldest rover saw his opportunity and once more the pistol rang out on the summer air the shot took the steer in the left ear and he gave a loud snort of pain and staggered as if about to fall  he is about done for cried tom i am glad of it  the steer continued to plunge around for fully two minutes and all took good care to keep out of his reach then he took a final plunge and fell over on his side breathing heavily and rolling his eyes the while  i reckon i had better give him a final shot was dicks comment and dismounting he came forward and fired directly into the beasts eye it was a finishing move and with a convulsive shudder the steer lay still and the unexpected encounter came to an end  well i am glad that is over said sam as he wiped the cold perspiration from his forehead i thought he was going to horn me sure  he would have done so had it not been for dick returned tom  i know it dick i shant forget this  whats to be done about the steer asked songbird it seems a pity to leave him here  vot is der madder mit cutting him ub for meats put in hans ve can haf some nice steak ven ve go into camp next dime hey  thats a scheme said fred  at that moment wags who had kept in the background so long as the steer was raging around set up a sharp barking  whats wrong now asked tom turning to the dog  somebody may be coming suggested dick  ill show you fellers wots wrong cried a rough voice and through the brushwood close by there crashed a broncho on top of which rode a roughlooking cowboy wearing a red shirt and a big slouch hat who went and shot that steer  i did answered dick was he yours  he was and you had no right to touch him growled the cowboy  didnt i though said dick are you aware that he came close to hurting us he charged full tilt at my brothers horse  stuff and fairy tales boy that steer was all right he broke away from the drove but he wouldnt hurt a flea  we know better put in tom  if my brother hadnt killed him he would probably have killed my horse and maybe me added sam  somebody has got to pay for the damage done growled the cowboy i am not going to stand for it not me so sure as my name is jim jones and he shook his head determinedly  well mr jones i am sorry i had to kill your steer but it had to be done and that is all there is to it said dick calmly  that aint payin for the critter is it  no  an do you reckon im goin to let the boss take the price out o my wages continued jim jones warmly  isnt the steer worth something as meat  yes but not near as much as he was wuth on the hoof  we might take up a collection for mr jones if he is a poor man suggested songbird who did not want any trouble  but we havent got to do it broke in tom it was his business not to let the steer run wild in the first place  so youre going to take a hand eh stormed the cowboy then feeling he was in the minority he went on more humbly yes im a poor man and this may get me discharged  how much do you think we ought to pay asked dick name a reasonable price and i may settle just to avoid trouble and not because i think i ought to pay  how about fifty dollars asked the cowboy with a shrewd look in his fishy blue eyes  cut it in half and i may meet you came from dick he was no blueribbon animal  the cowboy tried to argue but the rovers and their chums would not listen and in the end jim jones said he would accept twentyfive dollars and let it go at that he said he would have the steer carted away before night  where do you come from asked dick after paying over the money  from the cassibel ranch sixty miles northwest from here i and my pard were driving some cattle to town when this steer got scared at a rattlesnake and broke away  i dont blame him said fred id get scared at a rattlesnake myself  do you know the way to mr carson dentons plantation went on dick  sure  this is not the right trail is it  not by a long shot the right trail is four miles from here  will you direct us to the right road asked dick  sure thing answered jim jones he paused for a moment want to get there the easiest way possible i reckon  of course  well then keep to this trail for half a mile further then when you come to the blasted hemlock take the trail to the left that will take you through the upper end of the next town and right on to dentons  thanks said dick is it a good road  fine after the fust few miles are passed there are a few bad spots at first but you mustnt mind them  we shant mind came from sam we have struck some bad spots already  a few additional words passed and then all of the boys rode along the trail as the cowboy had pointed out jim jones standing beside the dead steer watched them out of sight and chuckled loudly to himself  reckon i squared accounts with em he muttered got twentyfive dollars in cash and the animile and if they foller thet trail as i told emwell there aint no tellin where theyll fotch up but it wont be dentons ranch not by a long shot and he laughed heartily to himself  all unconscious that they had been wrongly directed by jim jones the rover boys and their chums continued their journey when they reached the hemlock that had been struck by lightning they took to the other path as directed  i am sorry i didnt ask how far that town was said dick for all we know we may be miles away from it  if it gets too late we had better go into camp for the night suggested songbird and so it was agreed  the coming of night found them in something of a hollow between two ranges of hills the trail was soft and spongy and the horses frequently sank in over their hoofs  this is something i didnt bargain for observed songbird i trust we dont get stuck and have to go back  that cowboy said the trail would be poor for a while came from fred  they continued to go forward on the lookout for some suitable spot where they might camp for the night the thought of reaching a town had faded away an hour before  gosh this is getting worse cried tom be careful hans he called to the german youth who was ahead  vots dot sang out the other  i said be careful you dont want to sink through to china do you  not much i tont was the answer oh  hans let out a loud cry of alarm and with good reason his horse had struck a sinkhole as they are called on the plains and gone down to his knees he made such a plunge that poor hans was thrown over his head to land full length in an oozy sticky bog  stop cried dick as soon as he saw this accident dont go any further fellows its dangerous  hellup safe me roared hans trying in vain to extricate himself from the oozy bog while his horse did the same hellup oder i peen drowned in der mud alretty    chapter xiv  out of an unpleasant situation  not one of the party was just then in a position to give poor hans any assistance all were stuck in the ooze and one horse after another was slowly but surely sinking  we must turn back cried songbird and do it in a hurry too  easier said than done grunted fred my this is worse than glue  i think the ground on our left is a bit firmer than here said sam i am going to try it anyway  not without considerable difficulty he turned his steed and after a struggle the spot he had indicated was gained dick followed and so did tom  the rovers were safe but not so their chums hans was the worst off but fred and songbird were likewise in positions of serious peril wags was flying around barking dismally as though he understood that all was not right  turn this way called out sam its your one hope  let me have that rope you are carrying tom said dick and having received the article he threw one end to hans who was still floundering around catch hold hans and ill haul you over  as the rope fell across the german youths body he caught it tightly in both hands and as dick tom and sam pulled with might and main he fairly slid on his breast to where they were standing  mine gracious dot vos somedings awful he exclaimed it vos so sticky like molasses alretty  now we must help the others said dick  songbird is out exclaimed sam  the rope was thrown to fred and with a great tug he was finally brought out of the ooze  nearly took my hand off he declared but i dont careanything is better than to be stuck in such a spot as that  the horses were still floundering desperately and it was little that they could do for the beasts one went in one direction and the others in another but at last all appeared to be safe although covered with the sticky mud and slime  thats an adventure i didnt bargain for was toms comment do you know what i think i think that cowboy sent us into this on purpose  maybe he did came from dick did it i suppose to get square because we didnt pay him all he thought the steer was worth  to round up the horses was no easy task and by the time this was accomplished it was long past dark they searched around for a suitable spot and then went into camp  this trip is lasting longer than i expected remarked dick when they were around the campfire preparing an evening meal i trust the others dont get worried about us  oh i guess they know that we can take care of ourselves answered tom  i wish i had that cowboy here muttered sam id give him a piece of my mind  i think wed all do that added fred  i vos gif him a biece of mine mind from der end of mine fist said hans and this made them all laugh  the camping spot was not a particularly good one yet all slept soundly they left wags on guard but nothing came to disturb them  it was misty in the morning and so raw that they shivered as they prepared to start off how to proceed was a question and it took them a good quarter of an hour to decide it  it would be folly to go deeper into this bog or swamp said dick i vote we keep to the high ground  thats the talk said sam maybe when we get up far enough we will have a chance to look around us  as well as they were able they had cleaned off the horses and themselves and now they took good care to keep from all ground that looked in the least bit treacherous  here is a new trail cried tom after about two miles had been covered and it seems to lead up a hill too  then that is the trail for us put in songbird and they took to the new trail without further words  songbird i dont hear any poetry observed dick as they rode along whats the matter  cant make up poetry in such a dismal place as this was the answer in a disgusted voice i wish we were out of this woods and out of the mist too i declare its enough to give a fellow malaria  the sun was trying to break through the mist which was an encouraging sign here and there a bird set up a piping note but otherwise all was as quiet as a tomb  i see something of a clearing ahead announced sam presently  and a trail cried fred thank fortune for that  the clearing reached they found a welldefined trail running to the southwestward  that must run to caville announced dick see there is a regular wagon track  i hope it is the right road returned fred  they were soon out on the plains again and then into another patch of timber they had to ford a small stream and on the other side came to a fork in the trail  which way now questioned sam as all came to a halt in perplexity  this seems to be the main road although it is hard to tell one from the other said dick after an examination  the others agreed with the eldest rover and once more they went forward but in less than a mile they saw that the road was not in as good a condition as that left behind  this looks as if we had made a mistake observed fred oh what luck we are having  id like to know began tom when he stopped abruptly for out of the brushwood an old man had stepped gun in hand  youuns hold on cried the old man  hullo what do you want asked dick  i want for youuns to turn around an go tudder way  isnt this the trail to caville  no it aint an youuns cant come this way nohow  is it a private road  yes  where does it lead to  that aint none o youuns business said the old man curtly youuns is on the wrong road an have got to turn back  supposing we dont turn back questioned tom who did not fancy the style in which they were being addressed  at this the old man tapped his gun  orders is to turn em back or shoot he answered simply this are a private road dont ye see the wire fence  they looked into the brushwood and saw a single strand of wire stretched from tree to tree on each side of the trail  not much of a fence was songbirds comment  its enough an youuns cant come no further  maybe you live beyond said sam curiously  maybe i do an maybe i dont it aint none of youuns business  you are very civil i must say  dont you git fly boy or this ole gun o mine might go off this aint no trail fer youuns an youuns have got to turn back  will you tell us if that other trail runs to caville asked dick  it dont run nowheres the old man grinned for a moment it stays where it are but if youuns travel along it for about five miles yell reach the town  and you wont tell us whose road this is came from tom  it aint none of youuns business thet aint better turn back an have done with it  the old man showed plainly that he did not wish to converse further he stood in the center of the trail with his gun ready for instant use  we made a mistake before and got into a sinkhole said dick we dont want to make another mistake  take tudder trail an youuns will be all right answered the old man and thereupon they turned around and rode off  what a crusty old fellow said sam  yes but he meant business came from fred he would have shot at us sure had we insisted upon moving forward  there is some mystery about this said dick  perhaps he lives a hermit life down that trail suggested songbird  it looked more to me as if he was on guard put in sam he certainly meant business  if we had time id sneak around to one side and see what was beyond  yes and get shot said fred we had better take his advice and go on to caville  it did not take them long to reach the fork in the road and here they turned into the other trail they had proceeded less than fifty yards when dick put up his hand  somebody is coming behind us he announced  they halted at a turn in the road and looked back two persons soon appeared both on horseback they were riding at a good gait and turned into the trail which was guarded by the old man  well i never cried tom in amazement  i recognized the first man said sam it was that bushyhaired fellow i think somebody said his name was sack todd  thats the chap replied dick but didnt you recognize the other  no  it was dan baxter    chapter xv  something of a mystery  dan baxter  the cry came simultaneously from several of the crowd  i think dick is right said songbird i thought it must be dan but i wasnt sure for i didnt expect to see him here  he and that sack todd must have become friends put in tom i would like to know what dan is doing out here  he is certainly up to no good answered dick i must say this adds to the mystery doesnt it boys  thats what it does chimed in sam i wish we could catch baxter and bring him to justice  or reform him came from dick  reform him dick cried tom that would be mighty uphill work  it isnt in him added fred he is teetotally bad  i used to think that of dans father but arnold baxter has reformedand he wants his son to do likewise  well that isnt here or there said tom after a pause what are we to do just now  let us push on to town first answered songbird after that we can rearrange our plans if we wish  this was considered good advice and once again they urged their steeds along coming to a high point in the trail they made out caville a mile distant and rode into the town about noon  it was not much of a place and the single hotel afforded only the slimmest of accommodations but they had to be satisfied and so made the best of it  the meal over dick strolled into the office of the tavern where he found the proprietor sitting in a big wooden chair leaning against the counter  quite a town began the eldest rover cheerfully  wall it aint so bad but what it might be wuss stranger did the grub suit ye  it did  glad to hear it stranger sometimes the folks from the big cities find fault expect me to run a reglar asterdelmonicum or sumthin like that  it is very hard to suit everybody said dick by the way he went on do you know a man around these parts named sack todd  do i know him to be sure i do stranger friend o yourn  not exactly but i have met him a few times where does he live  lives over to red rock ranch quite a few miles from here  alone  not exactly he has a cousin there i believe and some others but i wouldnt advise you to go over to the ranch nohow  why  sack todd dont take to visitors the story goes that a visitor once stopped there an shot his wife and robbed her an since that time he aint had no use fer anybody only them as he knows very well  does he run the ranch for a living  dont know but what he does but he dont work very hard adoin it  is there an old man working for hima fellow with thin shoulders and reddish hair  yes an hes a sour pill too  he must be an odd stick to keep himself so close  yes but sacks a good spender when hes in the humor of it sometimes he comes to town with a wad o money an treats everybody right an left then agin he comes in an wont notice nobody  here the talk came to an end for the hotel man had to attend to some new arrivals dick joined the others and all took a walk so that their conversation might not be overheard  this only adds to the mystery said tom after dick had repeated what the tavern keeper had said i am more anxious now than ever to visit red rock ranch as they call it  so am i added sam and remember we want to catch dan baxter if we can  well we cant go ahead and back too boys came from dick if we really mean to investigate we ought to send mr denton and the ladies and the girls word if we dont and we are delayed any great length of time they will be sure to worry about us  maybe we can telephone suggested songbird dont you see the wires some of the plantations must have the service  thats the talk cried fred let us try it anyway  they walked to the nearest station and looked over the book but the denton plantation was not mentioned  we can send a letter said dick that will get there before they have a chance to worry  they returned to the tavern and there the communication was written and later on dropped in the postoffice then they held another consultation  those fellows around that ranch are all armed beyond a doubt said tom i think we ought to get something in the shape of firearms  weve got a gun and a pistol now answered dick  say i tont vos go pack of der been schootin goin on cried hans i tole you dot sack todd been a pad man  you can remain behind hans returned sam  he can go on to mr dentons said songbird  not muchi stick py der crowd said the german youth he thought it worse to leave them than to confront any possible perils  their horses had been fed and cared for and by the middle of the afternoon each was provided with a pistol the extra weapons being secured at the local hardware establishment  afraid of outlaws questioned the man who sold the pistols  there is nothing like being armed answered dick on some of these trails there is no telling what sort of persons you will meet  ive got an idea said tom when they were on the street again why not take our time and move on red rock ranch after dark  and lose our way came from sam  well we cant use that trail in the daylight that old man will be sure to halt us  we can get around the old man somehow said songbird as soon as we spot him we can make a detour  by four oclock they were on the way not to excite suspicions on the part of any of sack todds friends who might happen to be around they left caville by a side trail and then took to the back road after the last of the houses of the town had been passed  id just like a long ride over the prairie cried sam i know id enjoy every minute of it  they had proceeded less than a mile when hans went to the front  i dink dis horse vants to let himself out a leetle said he  ill race you said sam and away they started at a breakneck speed  hold on cried dick dont tire yourselves out in that fashion weve got a good many miles to go yet  but neither of the racers paid any attention and soon they were a good distance to the front hans was doing his best to keep ahead of the youngest rover and as his steed was a little the better of the two he had small difficulty in accomplishing his object  but alas for the poor german boy the race made him careless of where he was going and soon he found himself on the very edge of a swamp similar to that encountered before  whoa he yelled to his horse whoa and then he added sam go pack kvick  whats wrong hans  it ist all vet aroundt here und idu meine zeit  as the german youth finished his horse stepped into a fairsized hole on the edge of the swamp on the instant a cloud arose from the hole  hornets screamed sam and backed away with all speed  hellup hellup yelled hans ouch oh my and then he tried to back away but the hornets were angry at being disturbed in their nest and went at him and his horse with vigor  something is wrong with hans observed dick looking ahead see his nag is dancing around as if it was crazy  oh me oh my roared hans slapping to the right and to the left i vos stung in more as a hundred blaces hellup me somepotty dis vos der vorse yet alretty git avay you hornets i gif you fife dollars to git avay  ride off hans called out fred dont stay near the hornets nest it will only make it so much the worse for you  thus advised hans backed and started off but instead of going off by himself he rode directly into the crowd  hi you keep away sang out tom and then as a hornet alighted on his nose he went on whow havent you any sense  anypotty vot vonts dem hornets can haf dem free of charge mit drading stamps drown in answered hans git avay and he rode on  the cheek of him put in fred who was also bitten we ought to drive him back into the hole  not on mine life said hans i vos so stung now i cant see mine eyes out of aint it  all lost no time in getting away from the vicinity of the hornets nest and presently the pests left them and went back to the hole to see what damage had been done  this is an experience i didnt bargain for said songbird who had been stung in the cheek  maybe youd like to make up some poetry about it grumbled tom oh how my chin hurts  and my ear  and my nose  humph look at my eye  so the talk ran on and the crowd looked at each other in their misery but the sights were too comical and despite the pain each had to laugh at the others  didnt know you had so much cheek songbird  my what an awful smeller freds got  dicks left hand is a regular boxing glove  im going to put some soft mud on the hand returned dick there is nothing better to draw out the pain of a hornets sting  den gif me some of dot mut too said hans i tont vos care how he looks so long as it makes me feel easier  mud was easy to procure and all used it liberally and before long the pain and swelling began to go down but their sufferings did not cease entirely until many hours afterwards while poor hans could not use one eye for two days  after this we had better keep our eyes open for hornets nests observed dick  i certainly dont want to be stung again said sam  i believe a fellow could be stung to death by such pests ventured fred  yes and a horrible death it would be answered dick  the encounter with the hornets had delayed them greatly and it was getting toward nightfall before they went on their way again  we may as well take our time said tom we cant reach red rock ranch until tomorrow  after crossing a level stretch of prairie they came to the edge of a woods not far off was a shack similar to those to be seen all over this section of our country  hullo here is a house cried dick i wonder if anybody lives here  he dismounted and walking forward looked into the shack on a bed of boughs a heavyset man was sleeping  hullo there called out the eldest of the rovers  the man sat up in alarm and made a movement as if to draw a pistol  what do you want of me he asked roughly    chapter xvi  a scene from a treetop  i dont know as we want anything of you said dick we chanced to be riding by that is all  oh the man looked relieved and let his hand drop from his pistol pocket are you alone  no there is quite a crowd of us  at this the man leaped up and looked out of the open doorway of the shack his face fell again when he saw so many and all well mounted  may i ask what you are doing here he questioned turning his sharp eyes on dick once more  we are doing a bit of traveling overland we were on a houseboat but we got tired of riding on the mississippi  i see one of them personally conducted tours a feller reads about in them magazines eh  that is pretty close to it and dick smiled more to throw the man off his guard than anything else he did not like the looks of the stranger in the least  dont go an git lost young man have ye a guide  no but i dont think we are going to get lost what place do you call this the eldest rover continued thinking to ask some questions himself and thus keep the fellow from becoming too inquisitive  this is pluggins palace the man gave a short laugh did ye ever hear of pluggins  no  pluggins was a pretty fair sort but had a habit of stickin his nose into other folks business one day so the story goes he went too far and nobody has seen him since  was he killed  the man shrugged his shoulders  dont ask me stranger he disappeared and that was the end of him he used to live here and the boys writ that motto to his memory and the man pointed to a wall upon which hung a board on which had been painted the following    this is in memory of   silas pluggins   he was a good man   but he could not keep his nose   from others bissness   take warning  dick read the lines with deep interest and so did all of the others  they didnt know much about sign painting but they evidently knew what they wanted to say remarked tom do you live here now he added to the strange man  no i was only taking a nap thats all  are you on foot asked fred  no my hoss is close by the man gave a loud whistle and soon a slicklooking mare came into view from behind the shack reckon i must be goin he pointed to the board on the wall kind of a sign to set a feller to thinkin eh  just a bit returned dick dryly  it dont do to stick your nose into what dont concern you goodby  the man left the shack leaped into the saddle on the mare spoke to the steed and in a second was off like the wind around a turn in the woods  gracious but he can ride was toms comment that mare is a peach  another mystery came from dick he gazed at the board on the wall do you know what i think  what asked songbird  that is an outandout warning  sure  a warning meant for just such persons as ourselves  you mean it is a warning to keep away from red rock ranch asked sam  i do and i think that fellow was on guard just as the old man was on that other road  if he was why didnt he stop us then  because we took him unawares and because he saw that we were too many for him  by jinks dick i think you are right cried tom and if you are it is more than likely that he has gone to the ranch to warn sack todd  exactly and that means warning dan baxter too i tell you boys there is something behind all this and i for one am in favor of doing our best to solve the mystery  i am with you  so am i  and i dick you can count on me  vell tont i vos here too came from hans  but we must go slow said tom it would be nonsense to rush forward wed be certain to walk into some trap  the matter was talked over and it was decided to leave the vicinity of the shack before making an extended halt they did not know but what the strange man would come back accompanied by sack todd dan baxtex and others equally willing to do them harm  they plunged into the woods in the direction the man had taken but coming to a brook rode their steeds down the watercourse for half a mile thus completely destroying their trail then they came out and urged their now tired horses up a small hill from which to get some idea of their surroundings  its too dark to see a thing announced tom after he and sam had mounted to the top of a tall tree but i think we could get a fine view from here in the daytime  again they held a discussion and it was decided to go into camp where they were they had brought some cooked food with them so did not have to start a fire and being tired all fell asleep in short order leaving wags on guard as they had done before  when they awoke the sun was shining brightly wags was missing having gone to hunt up something to eat in the brush all swallowed a hasty repast washing it down with a drink from the brook then tom climbed the tree again followed this time by his big brother  i see a ranchout that way cried the funloving rover after a look around dick cant you see it  yes tom and it must be the one we are seeking for see there is a series of rocks behind it and they are red  dick was rightthe rocks were certainly there and there could not be the slightest doubt regarding their color  the ranch was a long lowlying place and so far off they could see it but imperfectly  we may as well draw closer said dick and began to climb to the ground followed by his brother  there was no path through the woods and the tree branches were so lowhanging that they were willing enough to walk their horses soon the tangle grew so thick they were forced to dismount and proceed on foot  i trust we dont get into a pocket said sam it would be a job to get back the way we came  i see a clearing ahead announced songbird a little later and presently they reached an opening in the midst of which grew a tall pine tree  im going to shin that tree announced sam and went up and so did all of the others reaching the topmost branches only after a difficult climb lasting ten minutes  they were well rewarded for their efforts for from the top of the tree they could see a long distance in all directions but they had eyes only for the ranch which now stood out strongly in the bright sunlight  i see two men walking about the place said sam but i cant make out their faces  there is a big wagon approaching from a road yonder announced dick it seems to be filled with hay  they watched the approach of the wagon which lumbered along slowly although drawn by a pair of powerful looking horses at last the wagon reached a side entrance to the ranch and came to a halt and the driver dismounted  five minutes passed and then four or five men came up to the wagon the hay which was on top was cast aside revealing some machinery resting on the bottom of the wagon  some farming machinery said fred but why did they have it covered with hay  the men tugged at one of the pieces of machinery and at last lifted it from the wagon but instead of setting it on the ground they disappeared with it into the ranch  hullo ejaculated dick if that is farming machinery why are they taking it into the house  maybe its a heating apparatus suggested sam  yes they need it in this weather said tom sarcastically  well what is it then  that remains to be found out said dick this certainly is a place of mystery he added it is assuredly no ordinary ranch  one piece of machinery after another was carried into the ranch until the wagon was empty then the turnout was taken into a big barn at the back of the ranch  that show is over said songbird i wonder what the next act in this drama will be  they remained at the top of the tree for an hour or more during that time they saw several men moving around the ranch and some thick smoke coming from a broad chimney but that was all  how much longer are you going to stay here asked sam presently  no longer answered the eldest brother starting to descend i am going to investigate this whole thing and find out just what it means    chapter xvii  the bank bills on the table  dick this is a dangerous piece of business said fred after the entire party was again on the ground  thats right broke in songbird dont forget the warning on the wall of the shack  i am not afraid answered the eldest rover there is some great mystery here and i feel it ought to be investigated why those men may be bandits or something like that for all we know  they are certainly not on the level or they wouldnt put up with a fellow like dan baxter came from sam  dot ist so said hans at der same dime ve tont vont to put our mouths into der lions head alretty  ive got a plan said dick after a pause i do not think it a wise move for all of us to go forward at once i think two will be enough the others can stay here and await developments  then you have got to take me with you said sam promptly  sam you had better let me go with dick put in tom  no i want to go insisted the youngest rover and so it was at last decided  i dont see how you are going to approach that ranch in broad daylight said fred as they have guards on the road it is more than likely they have guards around the ranch also  i think ill wait until night fredor at least until it is dark  after that the boys spent the time in exploring the woods and looking over the plains beyond they saw several wagon tracks apparently leading to nowhere in particular and they also found something of a cave covered with logs and heapedup brushwood  something more to investigate said tom and began to pull the brushwood away followed by his companions the logs followed and there was revealed to them an opening at least twenty feet square by half that in height  what do you call this questioned tom as he kicked something of metal lying under a pile of dead leaves  its a roller of some sort answered songbird and see here are some cogwheels and a lot of old shafting  machinery and quite some of it too murmured dick they must run a regular factory of some sort here  i think i have solved the problem cried fred ive read of this a number of times this sack todd has a secret process of manufacturing some article and he doesnt want anybody to learn what the process is so he has established himself here and sworn all his workmen to secrecy  ive heard of that myself said tom a man had a certain process of tanning leather he kept his secret for years until a workman got mad at him and gave the thing away  dick was inspecting the machinery with care it was worn out and rusted and hard to make out just what it was  unless i am mistaken these are parts of a printing press said the eldest rover  a printing press cried several of the others  yes but that doesnt solve the mystery of what the press was used for  it was damp and unwholesome in the cave and they were glad enough to leave it and come out into the sunlight once more they walked back to where they had left their horses and here procured lunch and fed all of the animals including wags  slowly the afternoon wore away it began to grow cloudy and so became dark at an early hour  we may as well start said dick at last we can go to the edge of the woods anyway  i suppose you dont know when you will be back said tom  no but probably in three or four hours  take good care of yourselves  well try to do that put in sam  if i were you id not expose myself was freds advice those chaps are rough customers and there is no telling what they would do if they caught you spying on them  that is true  a few words more followed and then dick and sam set off on their tour of inspection each carried a pistol and each felt that he could take care of himself but neither dreamed of the dire peril which he was confronting  they had left their horses behind and now found advancing on foot no easy task in spots the undergrowth was so dense they had to literally force their way through and they also had to make two long detours to escape swamps and treacherous bogholes the mosquitoes and gnats were also bad and bothered them not a little  i guess we are earning all we are getting out of this grumbled sam as he came to a halt after pulling himself through a tangle of bushes and vines unless we take care well have our jackets ripped off our backs  do you want to turn back sam  no but i guess we had better go a little slower  dick was willing and as a consequence by the time the edge of the timber was reached the sun was sinking over the hills in the west and it was growing dark  red rock ranch was now in plain view not over two hundred yards distant in front and to one side was a level stretch the reddish rocks were behind leading to a small hill there were numerous outbuildings and a heavy barbed fence surrounded the whole excepting at one point where there was a wideswinging gate of wire and boards  i think the best thing we can do is to work our way around to the rocks said dick after studying the situation we can work up from the rocks to the outbuildings and so on to the ranch itselfif we get the chance  with caution they skirted the woods and inside of quarter of an hour reached the first of the series of rocks as they crouched behind these dick caught his brother by the arm  keep quiet he whispered i saw a man coming from the barn  after that they remained motionless for ten minutes at a distance they saw two men coming and going from one building to another they were evidently caring for the horses cattle and poultry for the night  they are gone said sam presently as he saw the men walk toward the ranch house and disappear  waitthey may come out again  they waited but the men did not reappear and now it was growing darker rapidly look as hard as they might in all directions they could not see a single human being  the coast seems to be clear now sam  yes but it wont hurt to wait a few minutes longer was the answer  as it grew darker they saw several lights lit in the ranch one was in the kitchen one in what looked to be a bedroom and another in a small room in the main part of the building the curtain over the window of the lastnamed room was up and they could see the lamp quite plainly resting on a table  let us crawl up and take a look into the windows whispered dick it seems to be safe enough now if we hear anybody coming we can lay down in the grass or behind a bush  hardly daring to breathe they crawled from the shelter of the rocks to the nearest outbuildings one given over to some chickens from there they advanced to a cow shed and then to one of the big barns  i can see into the kitchen from here whispered sam look  they looked and by the light of a big bracket lamp made out two men and a boy moving about the kitchen evidently preparing the evening meal the door to the next room was open and they caught a glimpse of several men at a table eating or waiting to be served  id like to know if dan baxter is in that crowd said dick  they watched the scene for several minutes but if the former bully of putnam hall was present he did not show himself then a curtain was drawn down shutting off their view  they next moved to the bedroom window and there beheld a man lying on a couch smoking a pipe he seemed to be a refined individual with a cleanshaven face and curly black hair  he doesnt look as if he belonged to this crowd was dicks comment he looks as if he might be a thorough gentleman  he certainly looks like a city man answered sam perhaps he has come to see this sack todd on business  perhaps  they watched the man for several minutes and saw him get a letter from his pocket and read it attentively then he closed his eyes as if to take a nap throwing his pipe on a chair  whoever he is he is making himself at home observed the youngest rover  let us move on to the next window said his brother now is our best chance to size up the placewhile most of the crowd are getting their supper  as silently as before they moved along in the darkness to where the light was streaming from the third window not far from a corner of the ranch then each of the boys raised himself up with the slowness of an indian on a trail  nobody seemed to be in the room and growing bolder they drew nearer until they could get a good view of the interior they saw a table and several chairs and also a desk and a safe on the table was the lamp and beside this several piles of new crisp bank bills  my gracious look at the money gasped sam why there must be thousands and thousands of dollars there dick  you are right  sack todd must be very wealthy  unless and the eldest rover paused  unless what  unless those bank bills are counterfeit    chapter xviii  dick and sam become prisoners  do you really think those are counterfeit dick gasped sam  more than likely dont you remember the machinery that printing press  yes yes its as clear as day this must be a regular den and sack todd  sam got no further for at that moment he felt himself seized from behind a pair of strong arms were thrown around him so that he could scarcely budge  dick was attacked in a similar fashion and though both of the rovers struggled desperately they found that their assailants had the advantage  caught you good and proper didnt we came in the voice of sack todd  let me go cried dick  not much young man have you got the other one jimson  i have answered the second man a fellow with a long nose and he wont get away in a hurry im thinking  we had better take em inside went on sack todd  just as you say answered andy jimson i reckon you boys remember me he went on with a grin  you are the man who was on that lumber raft that came near running down our houseboat said dick  struck it fust clip didnt expect to meet me agin did ye  i did not  wanted to shoot me didnt ye  didnt you deserve it asked sam boldly you came mighty close to sinking us  oh that was only a bit of fun on the part o the feller who owned the raft he knew what he was doin but i reckon you didnt know what you were doin when you spied on sack and his outfit continued the longnosed man sarcastically  theyll know what they were doing before i am through with em said the owner of red rock ranch  what are you going to do with us demanded dick  that remains to be seen  you had better let us go  at this sack todd set up a laugh of derision  youll not leave here yet awhile young man i heard what you and your friend said just before we closed in on you do you suppose i am going to let you get out and blab about what you have discovered  his harsh tone made both dick and sam shiver they felt that they were dealing with a hardened criminal and most likely one who would stop at nothing in order to attain his object  i must say it was a fool move to let that money lay around loose was andy jimsons comment and he nodded toward the piles of bank bills  one of the men just brought them up and i hadnt time to put them away explained the owner of the ranch besides i didnt think there were spies around  maybe there are more of them sack  thats so ejaculated sack todd he turned to the boys have you any friends near  that is for you to find out answered dick you can be sure of one thing though he added if you dont let us go you will get into serious trouble  there was a big crowd of em on that houseboat put in jimson  i know there was a crowdi met em some days ago well march these off and then look around and see if there are others continued the owner of red rock ranch  as it would have been useless to struggle the boys did not attempt to get away both sack todd and jimson were heavily armed and dick and sam felt that they would shoot upon the slightest provocation  the owner of the ranch uttered a shrill whistle and in a moment two men came running out of the diningroom of the ranch each carried a gun  whats wanted boss they asked  we have captured two spies answered sack todd  spies  yes we want you to place them down below and then come and follow us we are going to see if there are any more of them around  the two men placed their guns over their backs and took hold of sam and dick  dont let them slip you added the owner of the ranch i reckon theyre a pretty slick pair  they shant slip us eh spud  nary a slip scutty returned the second newcomer  then you dont intend to let us go asked dick  no  this is a highhanded proceeding  is it well down here we sometimes take the law into our own hands chuckled the owner of red rock ranch  then if the law ever gets hold of you it will go so much harder with you said sam  bah do you suppose i am going to argue with a kid like you growled sack todd take em below he said turning to his men  there was no help for it as others were coming to the scene as the boys marched into the ranch they came face to face with dan baxter  dick rover gasped the bully and sam what does this mean  so you know these fellows said one of the men  of course i do i was telling sack todd about them i used to go to school with them what are they doing here  the boss and jimson found them spying around the place  oh i see dan baxter grinned so youve got yourselves in a nice pickle eh  baxter have you joined this crowd asked dick  the bully started  whythats my business he stammered  perhaps it is but you might be in something better put in sam  oh you neednt preach to me  dont you know that these men are counterfeiters added dick  you had better shut up kid put in one of the men you are in our power and the less you say the better off youll be see  i have spoken nothing but the truth  that may be so too but folks dont always like to hear the truth  what are you going to do with them questioned dan baxter curiously  put them in a place we have ready for just such skunks  prisoners  sure  down below  thats it  dan baxter grinned to himself and then leered at sam and dick  you wont like that its pretty musty underground and wet too  id rather go there than do what you have done baxter answered dick  what have i done  you have joined these lawbreakers you need not deny it  humph  you may think it smart but some day youll rue it  i dont think so as it is the law and i are not very good friends and dan baxter laughed harshly  i cant listen to your talk all night put in one of the men march the latter word to the prisoners  they had been disarmed so there was no help for it and they walked through the ranch to where there was a big trapdoor in the floor this was raised up disclosing a flight of wooden steps  down you go was the next order  they went down side by side to find themselves in a narrow cellar at a distance they made out a light coming from the crack of a door a lantern was lit and they were ordered to a passageway at the end of the cellar beyond was something of a cell built of stone and heavy timbers with a thick door that was bolted and locked  in you go said one of the men shoving dick forward  is this where you intend to keep us  yes  for how long  that is for the boss to decide  its a wretched place said sam looking around it isnt fit for a dog to stay in  thats not my fault you brought this on yourself said the man  when a kid takes it on himself to play the spy he must take what comes said the other man as he shoved sam in behind his brother  the cell was foulsmelling and damp and both of the boys shivered as they looked around them  will you leave us a light asked the youngest rover  well leave you nothing said one of the men as he bolted and locked the heavy door come on now he added to his companion the boss will be wondering what is keeping us so long  a moment later the two men walked off leaving poor sam and dick prisoners in the dark underground cell    chapter xix  peter poll the dolt  after sam and dick had departed the camp in the woods seemed unusually lonesome to those left behind  i wish i had gone along said tom not once but several times  of da only come pack in safdy was hans comment  to pass the time songbird tried to make up some poetry but nobody cared to listen to him and he soon subsided the deathlike quiet felt to them as if it was the hour before the storm  are you fellows going to sleep asked fred as it began to grow late  you can go fred said tom im going to stay awake until sam and dick get back  then ill stay awake too  to tell the truth nobody felt like sleeping and all huddled together in a hollow close to where the horses had been tethered wags came and rested his head in toms hand  old boy you know we are worried dont you said tom and the dog looked up as if he understood  it was a long time before their watches pointed to midnight then songbird stretched himself  i am so sleepy i can scarcely keep my eyes open he said with a yawn  then go to sleep said tom  i take a leetle nap too said hans and soon both were slumbering leaving tom and fred on guard they wished they had a fireit would make things more cheerfulbut they did not dare to indulge themselves for fear their enemies might see the light  by the time it was three in the morning even fred could hold out no longer he dropped off leaving tom to keep the vigil by himself but soon songbird started up  have they come back tom he asked  not yet  they must be making some wonderful discoveries hullo so the others went to sleep too dont you want a nap  well ill take forty winks if youll promise to keep a good lookout  ill do that im as fresh as a daisy now  tom leaned back against a tree and in a minute more was in slumberland when the others awoke they did not disturb him consequently it was some time after sunrise when he opened his eyes  i declare ive had a regular sleep he cried why didnt you wake me up  we didnt think it necessary said fred  have they got back  no  at this toms face grew serious  thats strange and i must say i dont like it  oh i guess theyll show up before a great while answered fred they couldnt travel very well in the dark if they tried it theyd be sure to get lost  once more they unpacked the provisions they had brought along and made a leisurely breakfast then they packed their things again and waited  i am going up to the top of a tree and take another look around announced tom about ten oclock he could scarcely stand the suspense  ill do the same said songbird and soon they were in the top of a tall tree and gazing axiously in the direction of red rock ranch  the place looked to be deserted  not a sign of dick and sam anywhere said the funloving rover  for reply songbird hummed softly to himself    the woods and plains are everywhere   but for those things we do not care   in every nook and every place   we look for a familiar face   what has become of those we cherish   are they alive or did they perish  dont go on that way songbird you give a fellow the blues cried tom if i thought dick and sam had perished  merely a figure of speech tom i had to find a word to rhyme with cherish thats all  and such a word is rarish i suppose murmured tom honest this is no joking matter he continued soberly  i know it and i wish sam and dick were back  they continued to watch the ranch and presently saw a boy come out with a bundle under his arm and a fishing pole over his shoulder  theres a boy and he is coming this way cried the poetic youth  they watched the boy as long as they could and saw him turn to the northward and take to a trail running close to a fairsized stream  i think he is going fishing said tom id like to run across him and question him  they watched the boy as long as they could and then climbed down the tree and told the others of what they had seen  i am going after him said tom you stay here until i get back  i am going along said songbird and so it was arranged  a few minutes of walking brought them to the stream of water and they walked along the bank of this a distance of quarter of a mile when tom called a halt  there is the boy nowsitting on a rock fishing he whispered dont scare him off  they crept into the shelter of the trees and came out again directly behind the boy who had just landed a goodsized fish and was baiting up again he was a small boy with an oldlooking face covered with a fuzz of reddish hair he had yellowish eyes that had a vacant stare in them  hullo cried tom  the boy jumped as if a bomb had gone off close to his ear his fishing pole dropped into the stream and floated off  out for a days sport asked tom pleasantly  the boy stared at him and muttered something neither tom nor songbird could understand  what did you say asked the funloving rover  poor fishing pole murmured the boy now peter cant fish any more  is that your namepeter asked tom he saw that the boy was not just right in his mind  yes  peter what  no no peter pollpretty peter poll who will be rich some dayif he does not tell all he knows said the boy repeating the words in parrotlike fashion  do you live at red rock ranch asked songbird  the boy bobbed his head up and down vigorously  with mr sack todd  again the boy nodded  what do you do there  wash dishes and cook but peter will be rich some dayif he doesnt tell all he knows went on the boy then of a sudden he flapped his two arms and crowed like a rooster  he is a dolt whispered songbird to tom and the latter nodded  the poor fishing poleit will be drowned went on the dolt  never mind ill pay you for it peter said tom and drew a silver coin from his pocket so you live with mr todd how do you like it  peter must not tell all he knows  does he treat you kindly  peter gets sugar sometimesand he is to have a pipe and tobacco soon  did you see anything of two strangers last night continued tom in a sterner tone two boys about my own age  peter must not tell  you answer me or it will be the worse for you and now tom caught the simpleminded youth by the collar he did not intend to harm the lad but he wanted to make him speak  oh oh let me go screamed the dolt let me go for a hundreddollar bill a brand new one  a what asked songbird curiously  peter must not tell all  you answer my question broke in tom facing the boy and searching his eyes did you see those two boys last night or not  peter must not  answer and now tom had the lad by the ear  yesyesi saw them  did anybody else see them  peter must not  peter do you want to be drowned in the river  no no  then tell me all you know about the boys  sack todd will kill me peter must not tell  did sack todd see the boys  yes he caught themhe and andy jimsonat the window peter must not tell  caught gasped tom were they made prisoners  the boy nodded and then crowed like a rooster once more  where were the prisoners put  down down downin the deep hole where the water flowsdown where they want to put peter if he tells all he knows but i shant tell anythingnot a thing and his eyes blazed fiercely not a thing  poor dick and sam have been captured and are prisoners in some vile place groaned tom what will become of them    chapter xx  an offer from the enemy  this is a cheerful outlook i must say i wonder how long it is going to last  the question came from sam after an hour had been spent in the damp and lonely cell under red rock ranch  that is a riddle to me sam answered dick i dont think they will let us go in a hurry we have learned too much  do you imagine they will find tom and the others  i hope not if they do well be in a pickle for i guess it will be tom and the others who will have to get us out of this hole  i wish we had a light  i am afraid it would do us small good this seems to have been built for a regular prison and i suppose the only way out is through the door and that is securely fastened  the two rovers were in no cheerful frame of mind they realized that sack todd was much exercised over the fact that they had discovered the secret of the ranch and what he would do to them in consequence there was no telling  perhaps well never get away from here alive cried sam after another talk  oh i dont think hell dare to go as far as that sam he knows we have friends and that they will do all in their power to rescue us or find out what has become of us  another hour went by so slowly that it seemed three then of a sudden dick uttered an exclamation  ive struck a prize sam  what is it  a bit of candle  humph what good will that do if you havent any match  but i have several matches answered the eldest rover and a second later came a faint scratch and then the bit of candle dirty and mousegnawed was lit  it was not much of a light but it was far better than nothing and both boys felt lighthearted when they could see each other once more  let us make another examination of the hole suggested dick something may have slipped us before  they went over each part of the walls with great care on one side a portion of the stones was set in squarely  this looks as if they had at one time closed some sort of a passageway here remarked dick i should like to know what is beyond  cant we pick out one or two stones  we can try  the candle was set down on the stone flooring close to the wall and the two lads started to work without delay in a corner of his jacket dick found an old jackknife that had not been taken away from him and this he used on the mortar sam had nothing but a long rusty iron nail so their progress was necessarily slow  dont seem to be making much headway observed sam after pegging away for a while wish we had a hammer and a cold chisel  if we used a hammer they could hear us sam  at last they had one stone loose and pulled it out of the wall holding up the light they saw that there was a wall of plain dirt behind it  beaten muttered the youngest rover and a disappointed look came over his face dick we have had our labor for our pains  i am not so sure of that sam  why not id like to know that doesnt look much like a passageway  that is true but we may be able to dig through the dirt without great trouble and if this spot is close to the outer wall of the building  oh i see and sams face took on a more hopeful look but it might take a long time anyway and his face fell once more  they had just started to loosen a second stone when the candle began to splutter they saved it as much as they could but in five minutes it flickered for the last time and went out leaving them in a darkness that seemed more intense than ever  we might as well continue to work said dick as bravely as he could there is nothing else to do  but at the end of an hour they had to give up the task all of the stones around the hole they had made refused to budge and as the opening was not over eight inches in diameter it availed them nothing  it is no use sam said dick finally we are simply wearing ourselves out for nothing give it up  both boys were exhausted but were too much disturbed to take a good sleep yet as they sat on a bench the eyes of each closed and he took a series of naps arousing at every unusual sound that penetrated to the underground cell  overhead everything had become unusually quiet but toward morning came heavy footsteps and they heard the opening and closing of an outer door  somebody has come in said sam i wonder if it is the party that went to look for tom and the others  more than likely i wish i knew if they discovered anything or if tom managed to keep out of sight  again there was silence and once more the boys dozed off not to rouse up until there came the unlocking of the cell door sack todd stood there lantern in hand and beside him andy jimson  hope you had a good nights sleep said the owner of red rock ranch  fine answered dick sarcastically your feather beds cant be beat  and the quilts were extra warm put in sam catching his cue from his brother  humph your night here doesnt seem to have tamed you down much growled sack todd  i said they were gamy youngsters came from the longnosed man they showed that when they were on the houseboat  i want to question you said sack todd setting down his lantern how many were there in your party  how many did you catch questioned dick at the same time pinching his brothers arm to make sam keep quiet  you answer my question boy growled the owner of the ranch  why dont you answer mine  i am not here to answer questions  who said i was then  you are a prisoner  you had better answer up if you know whats good fern you broke in andy jimson sack doesnt stand for any nonsense  tell me how many were in your party repeated the owner of the ranch  something less than half a hundred  what the owner of red rock ranch leaped to his feet and then sat down again on a bench opposite the two rovers you are fooling  all right then dont question me  they must have organized a regular searching party burst out the longnosed man if they did sack we are in for it  its all talk andy they couldnt get up such a party around here folks know better than to bother me besides they know i am a good spender and they like to help not hinder me and the ranch owner winked  are you boys going to tell me the plain truth or not demanded sack todd after a pause  what i want to know is what do you intend to do with us returned dick  that will depend on yourselves young man  will you explain asked sam  you came here entirely uninvitedyou have got to take the consequences  that doesnt explain anything put in dick  you have learned a very important secret if that secret was given to the world at large it would spell ruin for me and all of my associates went on sack todd  that is your fault not ours  bah dont talk like a child rover do you think ill allow a couple of boys to ruin me not much  well what do you intend to do keep us prisoners  i must see about the others first after that ill make you an offer  what sort of an offer broke in sam  youll either have to join us or take the consequences  join you gasped sam and dick in a breath  that is what i said  ill never do it came quickly from dick  its foolish to think of it added sam we are not criminals  you had better give the matter careful consideration if you wont join us the ranch owner paused  what asked both boys  i shouldnt like to say one thing is certain though you shall never leave red rock ranch to expose us  thats the talk put in andy jimson you had better make up your mind to join us just as that other young fellow did  you mean dan baxter  yes  has he really joined questioned dick with interest  to be sure he has and hell make a good thing out of it too  in what way  in what way cant he have all the spending money he wants what more does a fellow need  counterfeit money you mean  whats the difference so long as it passes  maybe youll get caught passing it some day said sam  it is not likely we are careful and the money made here is very close to the real thing  dont tell the kids everything broke in sack todd  at that moment there came a shrill whistle from the top of the stairs leading to the cell  hullo im wanted cried the owner of red rock ranch come on andy well finish this talk some other time and he stepped to the doorway both were soon outside the door was fastened as before and off the men hurried leaving sam and dick in anything but a comfortable frame of mind    chapter xxi  through the forest  the knowledge that sam and dick had been made prisoners by those at red rock ranch was most discouraging to tom and songbird  they are in a hole in the ground said the funloving rover that must mean that they are in some sort of dungeon  more than likely they have a place for prisoners at the ranch returned songbird the question is now that we have learned so much whats to do about it  we must rescue sam and dick  that may be easier said than done tom my idea is the fellows at the ranch are desperate charactershorse thieves or worse  no horse thieves there burst out peter poll who had listened to the talk in wonder sack todd is richpiles of money piles but peter must not tell all he knows he added with a whine  so sack todd is rich questioned tom  piles of moneyfine bank bills i can tell you some day peter will be a millionaire but peter must not tell  say perhaps this dolt isnt telling the truth cried songbird he seems to be more than a button short  button button whos got the button sang out the foolish boy played that oncelots of fun let us play now and he started to pull a button from his jacket  come with us peter said tom come we wont hurt you  where do you want peter to go  not very far away come we will give you something nice to eat  now as it happened eating was one of the dolts weak points and he readily consented to accompany them without loss of time they made their way back to where fred and hans had been left  hullo who vos dot ejaculated the german youth as they hove in sight  this is a boy we picked up along the stream answered tom and then drew the others aside and told his story  what are you going to do next questioned fred seriously it is certainly too bad sam and dick are prisoners we must take care that we are not captured  the mystery of the ranch grows deeper said songbird i rather wish we had some officers of the law to consult we could then ride right up to the ranch and make our demands  it may come to that before we get through answered tom  that dolt may not be telling the truth tom  well he has told some truth anyway for if sam and dick are free why dont they show up here  they did their best to make peter poll tell them more concerning himself and those at the ranch but the foolish boy was growing more and more suspicious and would scarcely answer a question  peter wants the fine eating you promised him said he but when they spread before him the best the camp afforded he broke into a wild laugh of derision  call that good he shrieked that is nothing you ought to see one of the spreads at the ranchespecially when the men from washington and chicago come down everything of the best to eat and to drink this is plain cowboy food peter wants something betterroast lamb peas and pie  this is the best we have peter said tom i am sorry you do not care for it so they have feasts at the ranch eh  peter must not tell all he knows the foolish boy started up peter is going  dont go yet cried tom  peter must go to the other ranchboss told him soafter he got through fishing going now and with a sudden jerk he tore himself loose and was off like the wind among the trees  hi cried songbird hadnt we better stop him  tom was already after the dolt but the foolish boy seemed to have legs like those of a deer for swiftness and before they realized it he was out of sight he knew how to run with but little noise so it became almost impossible to follow him  will he go back to the ranch do you think asked fred after the momentary excitement was over  he said something about going to the other ranch returned tom what he meant by it i dont know  well he is gone so we shall have to make the best of it went on fred i trust though that he doesnt get us into trouble  the boys sat down in the temporary camp and there tom and songbird gave all the details of how they had fallen in with peter poll  i suppose those rough characters make him do all sorts of dirty work said fred the boy isnt really responsible  after a long consultation it was decided to leave the neighborhood and move to the other side of red rock ranch this would tend to throw the enemy off the trail if the dolt should go back and relate what had occurred  dis vos gitting so interesting like a story book was hans comment i only vish i could see der last page alretty  we all wish that laughed tom then wed know if the villain dies and the girl marries the millionaire and this sally brought forth a short laugh  the things were packed rapidly and soon they were on horseback and leading the steeds sam and dick had ridden they had to ford the stream where the dolt had been captured and here the horses obtained a refreshing drink  some day i suppose this whole forest will fall before the woodmans ax remarked songbird too bad and then he murmured to himself    the sturdy woodman with his ax   will strike full many a blow   and as the chips go flying fast   hell lay these giants low   until the ground is bare and void   of all this grateful shade    and then the planter beans can plant   with plow and hoe and spade finished tom beans would pay better than trees any day  beans snorted songbird in disgust what have beans to do with poetry and he walked ahead so that he might make up his verses without further interruption  they soon found the ground getting very rough and the tangle through which sam and dick had passed made them do not a little complaining  mine cracious how long vos dis to last hey cried poor hans as he found himself in a tangle from which he could not escape hellup somepody oder i tont vos git out of dis annyhow  hans is stuck on this brushwood sang out fred he loves it so he cant bear to leave it  this way hansy my boy came from tom now then a long pull a strong pull and a pull altogether  with might and main he hauled on the german boys arm and with a tearing sound hans came loose and almost pitched forward on his face  hi hi let go alretty kvick he bawled mine clothes vos most tore off of me he felt of his trousers and the back of his jacket too pad da vos full of vinders now  never mind hansy you need the openings for ventilation returned tom smoothly  vendilations hey vot you know about him hey i vos look like a ragpickers alretty and he surveyed the damaged suit dubiously  now is the time to have your picture taken suggested fred you can send it to your best girl hans  i tont vos got no girls  then send it to your grandma suggested tom blandly maybe shell take pity on you and send you a new suit that would suit wouldnt it  i tont vos do noddings but ven ve go to camp again i make you all sit town und blay tailors answered the german boy and then the whole crowd pushed forward as before  they had to cross a tiny brook and then began to scramble over some rather rough rocks this was hard work for the horses and a consultation was held regarding the advisability of leaving them behind  i would do it in a minute said tom but it may not suit us to come back this way  yes and we may need the horses to ride away on put in fred supposing those men on the ranch come after us we cant get away very well on foot and if we could we wouldnt want to leave the horses behind and so it was decided to go slowly and take the steeds along  it was growing dark and they were afraid they were in for another storm so far there had been no breeze but now the wind began to rush through the trees with a mournful sound  if it does come it will surely be a soaker announced tom when he got to an opening where he could survey the sky perhaps it will pay us to stay in the shelter of the forest  yes and have the lightning bring a tree down on us added fred none of that for me  they were still among the rocks when it began to rain at first the drops did not reach them but as the storm increased the water began to fall in all directions from the branches  we must find some shelter unless we want to be soaked said fred hullo just the thing couldnt be any better if we had it made to order  he pointed to a spot where the rocks arose to a height of twenty or more feet low down was an opening leading to a hollow that was very like a cave  that will do firstrate returned tom it is large enough for the whole crowd  too bad the horses cant get in too said fred but maybe a wetting wont hurt them in this warm weather  the steeds were tied close by and then the boys ran for the shelter under the rocks followed by wags they had just reached it when the storm broke in all its violence and the rain came down in torrents    chapter xxii  in a snakes den  just in time and no mistake remarked songbird as he surveyed the scene outside no use of talking when it rains down here it rains  well a rainstorm isnt a picnic party returned tom i wouldnt care so much if i wasnt so anxious to hear from sam and dick  dot is vot ve all vonts broke in hans  they crouched in the back of the shelter so that the rain might not drive down upon them it was a steady downpour for half an hour when it began to slacken up and the sun looked as if it might break through the clouds once more  we wont be detained so long after all cried fred  i am just as well satisfied began tom and then gave a jump boys look there did you ever see anything like it  they looked in the direction pointed out and each one sprang up as if he had received an electric shock while wags began to bark furiously and small wonder for directly in front of the shelter was a collection of snakes numbering at least thirty or forty they were black brown and green in color and from two to four feet in length some were lying flat while others were curled up in various attitudes  snakes faltered fred and what a lot of them  dere aint no choke apout dis gasped hans his eyes almost as big as saucers vot shall ve do  get your pistols boys came from songbird and he drew his weapon  dont shoot and tom caught the other by the arm if you kill one snake the others will go for us sure what an awful lot of them this locality must be a regular snakes den  if they come in here well all be bitten and if they are poisonous fred tried to go on but could not  there is no telling if they are poisonous or not returned tom one thing is sure i dont want them to sample me and the others said about the same  what to do was at first a question the snakes lay about ten feet from the front of the shelter and in a semicircle so that the boys could not get out excepting by stepping on the reptiles or leaping over them  they are coming closer exclaimed fred a moment later it looks as if they were going to tackle us sure  i have a plan cried tom come here hans and let me boost you up  the others understood and while the funloving rover gave the german boy a boost songbird did the same for fred  the edge of the cliff of rocks was rough and when hoisted up hans and fred were enabled to grasp at several cracks and projections they laid hold vigorously and soon pulled themselves out of harms way  by this time the snakes had wiggled several feet closer to the shelter evidently it was their den and while they wished to get in they did not know exactly what to do about the intruders  can you get a hold questioned songbird as he stood on a flat rock and raised himself into the air a distance of two feet  tom was already trying to do so and soon he was crawling up the edge of the cliff as the rocks were slippery from the rain it was by no means an easy or sure task but he advanced with care and soon joined fred and hans at the top  i am glad we are out of that exclaimed fred ugh how i do hate snakes  i think everybody does returned tom hi songbird he called out coming  ii guess i am stuck was the gaspedout answer the rocks are too slippery for me  well give you a hand up sang out the funloving rover and got down at the edge of the rocks  look out that you dont slip over came in a warning from fred  of you go ofer you land dem snakes your head on put in hans  the words had scarcely been uttered when there came a wild shriek from songbird the poetic youth had lost his hold and slipped to the ground below he came down directly on top of three of the snakes and with an angry hissing they whipped around him  songbird has fallen on the snakes  run for your life sang out tom there goes wags  and songbird did run the moment he could regain his feet one snake got tangled up in the boys legs and was carried along whipping one way and another but it soon lost its hold and then wiggled through the grass to rejoin its fellows in the meantime the dog had disappeared  are you safe called out those at the top of the cliff  iiguess so came in a panting answer but two of them diddid their bebest to bite me  bring the horses around while you are about it said tom and then the three on the cliff walked around to rejoin songbird when they reached him they found the poetic youth trembling from head to foot  never had such an experience in all my life said he why i came down almost headfirst on those snakes i never want such a thing to happen again  ive got no use for snakes said tom i dont know what they are good for excepting to scare folks  i believe they rid the land of many insects  say songbird i tole you vot put in hans with a twinkle in his eye now that the danger was past you vos make a nice poem up apout dem snakes hey  a poem on snakes shivered songbird ugh the idea is enough to give one the creeps  the rain had now ceased completely and soon they were leading their horses forward as before it was very wet in the brushwood and as far as possible they kept to the open spaces the outlook was certainly a dismal one and the boys felt in anything but a good humor  our little trip to mr dentons ranch isnt panning out so beautifully after all remarked fred i thought we were going to have the nicest kind of an outing all told i rather think i would prefer to be back on the houseboat  presently they came out on a road in the rear of red rock ranch there was a ditch to cross and then a line of thorns which gave all more than one scratch  suddenly they were startled by a shot fired at a distance another shot soon followed  what does that mean cried fred wheres the dog  perhaps sam and dick are trying to escape returned songbird  i hope nobody is shooting them put in tom i must say he added i dont like this at all the dog is gone  hadnt we better place the horses in the woods and investigate  no well take the horses along and if there is trouble well use our pistols answered tom firmly  they advanced with caution and soon came to where the road made a turn westward tom uttered an exclamation of surprise and not without good reason  manon the roadflat on his face  is he a spy  is he dead  i dont know answered tom go slowwe may be running into a trap  they advanced with caution not another soul seemed to be in sight and presently they stood over the man he was breathing heavily  looks like a planter observed fred noticing the apparel the stranger wore whats the matter with him  perhaps he was shot let us turn him over  this they proceeded to do and then without warning the man sat up and rubbed his eyes his wig and beard fell off and to toms astonishment there was revealed james monday the government detective  mr monday cried the boy how in the world did you get here  whawho are you stammered the man whawhat hit me  i dont know what hit you i am tom rover dont you remember me  the government official looked perplexed for a moment and then his face brightened  to be sure i remember you rover he stammered but i am all in a twist he brushed his hand over his face i thought i was down and out as the saying goes  did you fire those shots  i fired one shot the other was fired by a man who ran away i believe the villain wanted to take my life the bullet struck a rock and then struck and stunned me and i keeled over  and the man ran away  i suppose so you didnt see him did you  no  where are you bound went on the government official curiously  we are looking for my two brothers sam and dick they went over to the ranch yonder and we have heard that they are being held prisoners    chapter xxiii  james monday takes a hand  after that there was nothing to do but to tell their story in detail to which the government official listened with close attention then he asked them many questions  you are certainly in hard luck said he when they had finished beyond the slightest doubt those men at the ranch are desperate characters and i dont know but what i ought to summon help and arrest them on the spot  den vy not do dot asked hans ve vill hellup too  if those men are what i take them to be i want to catch them redhanded responded james monday  what do you take them to be asked tom  can i trust you boys to keep a secret  yes came from each of the crowd  then ill tell you unless i am very much mistaken the men at red rock ranch are counterfeiters  counterfeiters came in a chorus  so i believe i may be mistaken but all the evidence i have points in that direction i have been following this trail from philadelphia where i caught a fellow passing bad twentydollar bills he confessed that he got the bills from a fellow in washington who claimed to be printing them from some old government plates that story was of course nonsense since no government plates of such a bill are missing i followed the trail to washington and there met a crook named sacord he so i discovered got his money from two men one the owner of this ranch where the bad bills were manufactured was a mystery but by nosing around i soon learned that the owner of the ranch never allowed strangers near his place and that he sometimes had strange pieces of machinery shipped there then i put two and two together and came to the conclusion that the bad bills were printed here now i want to prove it and not only round up the gang but also get possession of the bogus printing plates if the government dont get the plates somebody may keep on manufacturing the bad bills  in that case it is just as important to get the plates as the criminals put in songbird  well this stumps me declared tom no wonder they kept chasing us off  and no wonder sam and dick were made prisoners added fred  i hope the rascals dont do them harm said tom if i thought that id be for moving on the ranch without delay  i think your brothers will be safe enough for the time being came from james monday i am sorry that you let that dolt get away from you  if we had thought it of such importance we should certainly have kept him a prisoner replied songbird  i was watching my chance to get into the ranch house unobserved continued the government official that shot rather floored me but i am going to get in some way he added with determination  listen i think i hear somebody coming cried songbird  let us get to the side of the road said james monday  they did as advised the boys mounting their horses and the government official donning his wig and false beard and taking sams steed soon they were stationed behind a pile of rocks  its a wagon that is coming said tom a minute later i can hear the wheels scraping on the rocks  i think ill investigate on foot said james monday and slipped to the ground once more soon the wagon came in sight it was pulled by a team of strong looking horses and was piled high with boxes on the seat sat an old man  hullo there called out the government official stepping along the trail in the direction of the turnout  the old man was evidently startled and he pulled up with a jerk as he did so the boys rode a little closer  hullo stranger what do you want  i want to talk to you responded james monday  what about and the old man began to grow uncomfortable  where are you bound  what do ye want to know fer  i am curious thats all friend are you afraid to answer me  no i aint im bound fer red rock ranch  what have you on the wagon  all sorts o supplies that came in on the railroad  whats your name  bill cashaw it seems to me youre a curious one you are  do you belong in town or out here  in town ocourse haint i lived there nigh sixtyfour years  do you work steadily for sack todd  no i do a leetle drivin now an then thats all but see here  do you know all the others at the ranch  most on em i dont know the new fellers much  did you intend to stay at the ranch  you mean tonight  yes  not unless sack asked me to stay hes queer about that you know the old man glanced at the boys quite a party o ye haint there  you state positively that you do not belong to the crowd at the ranch resumed the government official  i said so but see here stranger  please get down off that wagon went on james monday quietly  eh  i said get down off that wagon  what fer  because i want you to  say are this a holdup cried the old man in renewed alarm if it are i haint agoin to stand fer it an let me say that sack todd will be after youuns baldheaded fer it  this is not exactly a holdup said the detective with a faint smile get down and i will explain if you try to resist youll only get into trouble  suppose ill have to obey groaned the old man as he climbed down from the seat youuns are five to one on this im like the coon an davy crocketti know when ter come down out o the tree but i dont understand your game stranger  as i said before i dont intend to hurt you mr cashaw but i am after certain information and i rather think you can aid me in getting it  what you want to know  in the first place i want you to tell me all you know about sack todd what does he do at his ranch  humph dont ask me fer i dont know an if i did  and if you did  sacks been a putty good friend ter me stranger lent me a hundred dollars onct when a fire had cleaned me out a feller dont feel much about hurtin his friend  that is so too then you really dont know what is going on at the ranch come now speak the truth and james mondays voice grew stern  well its some sort o patent i guess sack dont want folks to git onto it reckon its a newfangled printing pressone to run by electristityor sumthin like that  he told you that did he  yes but i haint goin to answer no more questions went on the old man and started to mount the wagon seat again  wait said james monday i am sorry but youll have to stay here for the present mr cashaw  you mean you are goin to make me stay here  for a while yes  with the wagon  no ill drive your wagon to the ranch  i aint askin you to do the job  ill do it for nothing answered the government official with a quiet smile  see here i dont understand this at all cried bill cashaw what is yer game anyhow  if you want me to be plain ill tell you i suspect the men at the ranch of a serious crime for all i know you are one of the gang and as bad as the rest if so youre face to face with a long term in prison  crime prison i aint done a thing  if you are innocent you have nothing to fear and you will do what you can to aid me in running down the guilty parties  at this the face of the old man became a study he started to talk stammered and became silent  tell me he burst out suddenly are you an officer  i amworking under the united states government  oh the old man turned pale then let me say as i said afore i aint done nuthin wrong an i dont want to go to prison if them fellers at the ranch are criminals i dont want ter work fer em no more an ill help you to bring em to justice    chapter xxiv  tom carries a letter  after that it was a comparatively easy matter to get the old man to talk and he told james monday and the boys practically all he knew about sack todd and his followers  he said it was commonly supposed that sack todd had some invention that he was jealously guarding some folks thought the man was a bit crazy on the subject of his discoveries and so did not question him much concerning them the machinery and other material which arrived from time to time were all supposed to be parts of the wonderful machine sack todd was having made at various places  while he was talking the old man looked at tom many times in curiosity  might i ask your name he said at length  what do you want to know that for returned tom  because you look so wonderfully like my son budan you talk like him too but buds skin is a bit darker nor yours  my name is tom rover  talking about looking alike broke in fred theres a strong resemblance and he pointed to the detective and the old man of course you dont look quite so old he added to james monday  i am glad that you think we look alike smiled back the government official i was banking on that  what do you mean came from songbird  i will show you in a minute mr cashaw ill trouble you to exchange hats coats and collars with me the detective continued turning to the old man  the latter did not understand but gave up his wearing apparel a moment later and soon james monday was wearing them then the detective rubbed a little dirt on his hands and face and with a black pencil he carried gave himself a few marks around the mouth and eyes  how do you do boys he called out in exact imitation of bill cashaw  wonderful ejaculated tom that will do splendidly  mine cracious i tont vos know vich been you an vich been der old man burst out hans you vos like two pretzels alretty  thats a fine comparison laughed fred and all had to smile over the german youths words  i reckon i know what you intend to do said tom to the government official you want to take the old mans job away from him  yesfor the time being but i dont expect to get paid for it james monday turned to cashaw will you stay with the boys until i return  well now  i want you to stay  that means as how im to stay whether i want to or not eh  you can put it that way if you wish i want to make no trouble for you  sack todd will make trouble if he hears of this returned the old man dubiously  then you had better keep out of sight  will you return my horses and wagon  either that or pay for the turnout  then maybe id better go to town i can say i stopped off at a tavern an sumbuddy drove off with my rig  very well returned the detective but mind you if you dare to play me foul  i wont i wont  then you can go but wait boys let him stay here an hour then he can go  so it was arranged and a few minutes later james monday was on the seat of the wagon and driving off in the style of the old man  he is certainly a good actor murmured tom gazing after the government official i declare the two look like two peas  thats a mighty risky thing to do observed songbird if sack todd and his cronies discover the trick theyll stop at nothing to get square  trust mr monday to take care of himself responded tom i am only hoping he will be able to aid sam and dick  oh we all hope that tom  the boys sat down on some partly dried rocks and began to ask the old man about himself but bill cashaw was too much disturbed mentally to give them much satisfaction  well by hemlock he burst out presently  whats up now queried tom and all of the others looked equally interested  if i didnt go an forgit all about it  forget what  this letter i had fer sack an that was o prime importance too so the trainman said  as the old man spoke he brought forth a letter which he had had stowed away in a pocket of his shirt  whats in the letter asked fred  i dont know its sealed up  i think wed be justified in breaking it open put in songbird those rascals are outlaws  no no dont break it open burst out tom and snatched the communication from the old mans hand ive got a better plan  what plan came from his friends  didnt you say that i looked like your son bud asked tom of bill cashaw  i did  has bud ever been to red rock ranch  three or four times but not lately  does sack todd know him  yes but not very well  then that settles it announced the funloving rover i as bud cashaw am going to deliver the letter at the ranch  tom thats too risky cried fred  i dont think so i can tell them that the letter was left for fatherpointing to bill cashawafter he started for the ranch i dont see how they can help but swallow the story  yes but see here interrupted the old man this aint fair i want you to understand  i know what i am doing mr cashaw and you had better keep quiet watch him fellows  without loss of time tom made his preparations for visiting the mysterious ranch he rubbed some dirt on his face and hands disheveled his hair and turned up one leg of his trousers then he borrowed the rather large headgear that hans wore and pulled it far down over his head  how will that do he drawled say is my pap anywhere around this yere ranch  mine cracious of dot tont beat der irish gasped hans tom you vos make a firstclass detector alretty  he certainly looks like an alabama country boy was freds comment  a few touches more to his disguise and tom was ready to depart for the ranch he called songbird aside  watch that old man he whispered he may not be as innocent as he looks dont let him get to the ranch if he does our cake will be dough  of course you dont expect to catch up to the wagon said songbird  no but if i do ill go ahead anywayif mr monday will let me  it was not long after this that tom left the others he struck out boldly along the poorly defined wagon trail which led over some rough rocks and down into hollows now filled with water the marks of the wagon ahead were plainly to be seen but though the youth walked fast he did not catch sight of the turnout  it was dark by the time he came to the fence that surrounded the ranch buildings he saw bill cashaws wagon standing under a shed two men were unloading the contents they were both strangers to tom  it must be admitted that toms heart beat rapidly as he stepped into view and slouched toward the wagon shed the men started in surprise when they beheld him  say whars my pap he called out didnt he come in on the wagon  its bud cashaw murmured one of the men he raised his voice your old man is in the house with sack todd  tom turned toward the ranch proper and was close to a door when it opened and sack todd came out and faced him at a distance behind the man was james monday  hullo pap sang out tom you forgot that letter from that train handor maybe you didnt see him  the government official stared at tom wondering who he could be  what letter demanded the ranch owner quickly  here it is answered tom and brought it forth sack todd ripped it open quickly and scanned its contents it was short and to the point  look out for government detectives they are on your track one is named james monday there is also a fellow named roverbeware of himnumber 9  utterly unconscious of what he was doing tom had played directly into the hands of sack todd and his evil associates    chapter xxv  in which tom is exposed  boy who gave you this letter demanded the owner of red rock ranch after he had read the communication through twice  his look was a stern one and his gaze seemed to bore tom through and through yet the lad did not flinch he felt that he must play his part to the end  feller give it at the house fer pap he drawled pap he fergot to bring it so i hustled off to do it  humph a nice way to treat a letter of importance muttered sack todd he gave tom another close look who told you your dad was coming here  oh i guessed that drawled tom  come in the house i must question your father about this  i didnt mean no harm mr todd cried the youth in pretended alarm aint it all right  yes come in  sack todd pushed tom toward the doorway of the ranch and the youth went inside he looked around for the government official but that individual was nowhere to be seen  where is bill cashaw asked the ranch owner of two men who were present  i dont knowgetting something to drink i reckon answered one of the men he was standing around a minute ago  sit down here said sack todd turning to tom and at the same time motioning to a chair ill be back in a minute  he disappeared through a doorway and the funloving rover sat down he was in no easy frame of mind for he could plainly see that the letter had disturbed the ranch owner greatly and that the man was suspicious  i hope i havent made a mess of it he reasoned i wonder where sam and dick are  had he had an opportunity he would have left the room and taken a look around the place but the strange men were there and they evidently had their eyes on him  tom had been sitting quietly for five minutes thinking matters over when a side door opened and a young man smoking a cigarette came in on seeing tom he stared in wonder and allowed his cigarette to drop to the floor  tom rover how did you get here  it was dan baxter as impudent and hardfaced as ever he came a step closer and fairly glared at tom  for one brief instant toms selfpossession deserted him then he recovered and stared boldly at baxter  say what you atalkin about he drawled  eh  what you atalkin about i dont know younever see you before  well if that aint the limit burst out the bully you dont know me  an my name aint tim drover went on tom purposely mispronouncing the name  go to grass tom rover you cant play any game on me i know you too well even in that outfit  at that moment sack todd returned he was surprised to find dan baxter talking to tom  do you know bud cashaw he questioned  bud cashaw who is he  this is bud  not much do you know who this is tom rover the brother i was telling you about  tom rover almost shouted the owner of red rock ranch are you certain of this  yes didnt i go to school with him i know him as well as i know my own father  sack todd glared at tom and gave him a close inspection then he shook the youth fiercely  so this is your style eh he snarled first your brothers come to spy on us and now you if i had my way he stopped short where did you get that letter answer me  wasnt it all right drawled tom he scarcely knew how to act  answer me rover i want no more beating about the bush  it belongs to bill cashaw isnt he here  ha sack todd looked around come here he cried to his men watch this boy and dont let him get away under any circumstances i must find bill cashaw perhaps it isnt bill after all  one of the men came forward and caught hold of tom while dan baxter also ranged by the prisoners side to attempt to break away would have been useless and tom did not try it  youll catch it now said the bully maliciously  where are sam and dick  that remains for you to find out  they seem to carry things with a high hand here  its sack todds ranch and he has a right to do as he pleases he didnt invite you or the others to come returned dan baxter with a scowl  in the meantime the owner of red rock ranch was hurrying around in search of the supposed bill cashaw he visited the kitchen and the other rooms and then ran to the barn and other outbuildings but it was all useless the driver of the wagon could not be found  i want all of you to hunt for the wagon driver stormed the ranch owner he must be found  whats wrong now asked andy jimson  everything ive just got a warning read it  the longnosed man did so and drew down the corners of his mouth  this looks bad he said well youve got the three rovers right enough you think  that wagon driver may not be bill cashaw at all  worse and worse sack we must find him by all means  the search was taken up with renewed care and four men kept at it for over an hour then the crowd assembled in the main room of the ranch  he has run away and left the horses and wagon behind said sack todd  i thought he acted rather queer put in one of the men i asked him about cal jessup and he didnt seem to want to answer  he was a spythere is not the least doubt of it came from andy jimson more than likely he was a government detective  while the men were talking the matter over there was the sound of hoof strokes on the road leading to the ranch door and a horseman came up nearly out of breath from hard riding  whats the news phil shouted sack todd nothing wrong i hope  snapper has been arrested and a detective is on your trail shouted back the horseman i was afraid id be too late you want to get ready to vamoose  the men of the ranch crowded around the newcomer and plied him with questions tom tried to catch all that was said but was unable to do so  well have to make short work of this i am afraid he heard sack todd say a little later  what about the boy questioned the longnosed man  he ought to be shot was the coldblooded reply which made tom shiver  shall we put him with the rest  yes  without ceremony poor tom was marched away to the trapdoor a man on each side of him dan baxter came behind  you dont like it do you sneered the bully youll like it still less when you get below its beautifully damp and musty  youre a cheerful brute dan answered tom  hi dont you call me a brute stormed baxter  oh excuse me i didnt mean to insult the dumb creation responded tom baxter you are the limit i suppose you have joined this gang  what if i have  i am sorry for you thats all  oh dont preach  i am not going to for it would be a waste of breath  youll sing pretty small by the time we are through with you growled the bully and then tom was led below and placed in the cell with the others    chapter xxvi  together once more  tom  dick and sam  how in the world did you get here  where are the others  these and a dozen other questions were asked and answered as the three rover boys shook hands over and over again even though prisoners they were delighted to be together once more and doubly delighted to know that each was well  oh these chaps are firstclass rascals said dick after they had settled down a bit they have treated us most shamefully at first they gave us pretty good eating but now they are starving us  starving you cried tom  yesthey want us to tell all we know put in sam they are very suspicious  didnt you try to get away  no use of trying the walls are too solid and so is the door said dick he caught tom by the arm and added in a faint whisper in his brothers ear they are listening we have a hole  then well have to stay here said tom loudly catching his cue instantly  yes and its a shame added sam in an equally loud voice i suppose the others have gone on  certainly said tom calmly i was a chump to remain behindonly i wanted to find you i got hold of a letter by accident  a moment later they heard the guards walk away and then tom told the truth about the letter and sam and dick led him to the hole in the wall  it is not quite big enough to use yet whispered the eldest rover but we hope to have it big enough by tomorrow its slow work when you have got to be on your guard all the while  id like to know what became of the detective returned tom  he must have run away as soon as he saw how affairs were shaping put in dick i hope he rounds up the whole gang  so do i and dan baxter with them answered tom  overhead they could hear a constant tramping of feet and murmur of voices they tried to make out what was being said but could not  left to themselves the three rovers turned to the opening that had been made in the wall a match was lit for a moment so that tom could see just what had been done and then all three set to work to continue the task it was certainly hard work and their progress was exasperatingly slow  if we only had a pick or a crowbar we could get these stones out in no time grunted tom as he pulled away with all his strength  the noise overhead continued and a little later they heard some men come down in another portion of the cellar  we must save the plates at all events they heard sack todd say we cant duplicate them now old messmer is dead  yes save the plates by all means put in andy jimson  do you think the ranch is surrounded asked another of the crowd  it may be  then the sooner we get out the better growled another  the men passed on so that the rover boys could not hear more of the talk  i believe they are going to leave the place whispered sam excitedly  if they go what will they do with us put in tom  perhaps they will force us to go with them answered dick  there was now more bustle and confusion about the ranch and they heard a wagon drive up to a door load up and drive away again then some horses were brought up from the stable  something is doing that is certain murmured dick  he had scarcely spoken when there was a movement at the door of the cell and by the light of a lantern the boys found themselves confronted by sack todd andy jimson and dan baxter  so you think the youngest is the best to take along said sack todd to baxter  yes the family think more of him than of any one answered the bully  all right sam rover come out of that  what do you want me for asked the youngest rover  i want to talk to you  sam walked from the cell and the door was at once fastened as before then sack todd caught the youth by the arm  now march upstairs and be lively about it we have no time to waste  but  no buts now rover well talk later on growled the ranch owner savagely just now ive got my mind full of other things  sam was led to the main floor of the ranch and then without ado his hands were fastened behind him then he was told to march outside here two light wagons were in waiting and he was bundled into one along with jimson and another man and dan baxter the other wagon was loaded with boxes and driven by two men several horses stood by saddled for use  where are we going asked the youngest rover  to the north pole chuckled dan baxter dont you wish you knew  are all the men going to leave  thats their business not yours  you are very kind baxter i guess you dont know yourself  dont i though why im right handandhand with this crowd added the bully boastfully  maybe you only think you are  huh i know what i am doing  youve said that beforeand got tripped up just the same  there wont be any tripup about this  dont be too sure  see here spoke up andy jimson when we get on the road all of you have got to keep quiet  all right mums the world old man answered dan baxter cheerfully  did you hear demanded the longnosed man looking at sam  i did  are you going to mind  i am not your slave  humph do you know what todd said to me he said if the kid wont keep quiet when you tell him shoot him how do you like that  i dont like it  i am going to run no chances with you continued andy jimson you have got to keep very quiet dont you open your mouth once after we get started ive got a pistol handy and i know how to use it  in the meantime several from the ranch were walking around talking in low excited tones then from a distance came a shot followed by two more in rapid succession  the signal cried sack todd boys something is doing now sure we must get away and at once are you all ready  there was a chorus of assents  i think we had better divide the wagons can go by the honeytree route and those on horseback by the swamp road we can meet at the four rocks tomorrow if all goes well  so it was agreed and soon some of the horsemen were off each carrying a load of some kind then the wagons began to move that with the load of boxes going first the turnouts plunged at once into the woods where the darkness was intense they made scarcely any noise for the wagons were rubbertired and the horses wore rubber guards on their shoes  it would be hard to analyze sams feelings as he realized that he was being taken away from the ranch he knew not to where to escape in the darkness was out of the question for the man who sat beside him had his arm linked into his own more than this he felt sure that andy jimson would shoot him at the first sign of trouble  the wagon road wound around in the forest and was in anything but good repair so that poor sam was jounced about until he felt sore all over he did not dare to speak and truth to tell he did not know what to say he realized that if he asked what was to become of his brothers nobody would tell him  presently the wagon began to climb a slight hill the horses tugged away manfully but were exhausted when the top of the rise was gained and had to rest  hullo whats that exclaimed dan baxter as he gazed back in the direction of the ranch  shut up answered the longnosed man warningly  sam could not help but look back the top of the rise was almost bare of trees so his view was a perfect one the sight that met his gaze caused his heart to sink with a sickening dread  red rock ranch was in flames  tom and dick he murmured to himself if they are still prisoners what will become of them    chapter xxvii  the burning of the ranch  left to themselves tom and dick scarcely knew what to do for the time being what was to become of sam they did not know but they felt that the outlook was darker than ever  dick we must get out cried tom at length i cant stand this sort of thing  i cant stand it myself but how are we going to get out that door is like the wall for strength  there was more noise overhead but presently this ceased and all became as quiet as a tomb  what do you make of it now came from the funloving rover  i think they have left the ranch tom  leftfor good  perhaps they know that james monday will make it warm for them that letter put them on their guard  what a fool i was to deliver it dick i ought to be kicked for doing it if we had only opened it and read it  the others must still be on the watch  yes unless they too have been captured  the boys returned to the hole in the wall and to occupy themselves dug away at it harder than ever another stone was loosened and pulled into the cell  were making a little progress anyway sighed tom  hark i hear something said dick a little later listen  they stopped their work and both strained their ears a curious roaring and crackling came from overhead  thats odd mused tom what do you make of it  i am almost afraid to say tom  afraid  yes if it is what i think we may be doomed went on the eldest rover seriously  dick what do you think it is  the crackling of flames they have set the ranch on fire  would they do thatand leave us here it isis inhuman  those men are desperate characters tom and theyd stop at nothing  they continued to listen and soon the roaring and crackling grew plainer then came a dull thud as some timbers fell and a current of air carried some smoke into the cell  we must get outsomehow some way cried dick if we dont well be caught like beasts in a cage a sudden thought struck him tom take up one of the stones  dick lit what was left of the candlewick as he spoke and placed it on the bench then he took up the other stone  now aim for the lock of the door he went on and both throw together ready  yes  one two three  crash both large stones hit the door with tremendous force the barrier was split from end to end but still held firm  again cried dick and once more the stones were hurled in mad desperation there was another crash and the door tottered and came away from the lock then tom threw his weight against it and it burst open fully  a rush of hot air and smoke greeted them as they leaped into the passageway looking up they saw that the flooring above was already burning  we cant go up through the trapdoor said dick we have got to find some other way out  is there another way  i dont know come  the passageway ran in both directions they felt their way along for ten feet to find themselves against another wall  the other way sang out tom phew its getting pretty warm down here isnt it  and smoky answered his brother beginning to cough  they passed the cell again and started down the passageway in the opposite direction twenty feet further on they reached a wooden door bolted on the other side  stumped again muttered tom dick what shall we do now  try to break it down now then with all your might tom  it was their only hope and with increased energy they hurled themselves at the door which bent and creaked then at the fourth onslaught the door flew open and they went sprawling into the underground chamber beyond  here the light from the blazing building could be plainly seen and by this they made out that they were in a regular printing office three footpower presses were there also a quantity of variously colored inks and packages of oddcolored paper  but they could waste no time in investigating  the burning brands were dropping around them and they leaped across the printing room to where they saw another passageway this had a door but the barrier stood wide open  in you go sang out dick it must lead somewhereand anyway we cant stay here  they rushed into the passageway not an instant too soon for a second later there came another crash and the printing room was filled with sparks and bits of burning timber then a cloud of smoke all but choked them  halfblinded and scarcely knowing what they were doing the two rover boys ran on and on down the passageway it had several crooks and turns and more than once they brought up against some stones and dirt in anything but an agreeable fashion but they felt that they were getting away from the fire and smoke and that just then meant everything to them  at last the danger from the conflagration seemed to be passed and they slackened their pace and finally came to a halt both were out of breath  whewhere does this lead to gasped tom  thats a riddle tom but i know it has taken us away from the fire which is a blessing  dick we have had a narrow escape  right you are  those rascals meant to burn us up  they were afraid we knew too much about their affairs  they ought to go to jail for this and dan baxter with them  i wish we were out of this passageway and could find the rest of our crowd  we must find a way out  this was easier said than done they went on once more and soon without warning stepped into water up to their knees  back cried dick who was in advance we dont want to get drowned that would be as bad as being burnt up  we can swim answered tom as he scrambled back  true but i want to know where i am swimming to dont you  tom got out his waterproof match safe and found that it contained just one match this was lit and then he set fire to some leaves from a notebook in his pocket by this light they saw another turn of the passageway leading upward  that must be a way out exclaimed tom and started in the direction followed by his brother  now go slow warned dick when they were once more in darkness the paper having burnt itself out we dont want to run into any more danger if we can avoid it  i am on my guard answered tom  they soon found that the side passage narrowed greatly so that they had to proceed in single file and with heads bent they moved with their hands in front of their heads so as to avoid a possible collision with the rocks along the way  presently dicks hand came in contact with something long and straggling he drew back thinking he had touched a snake but then he grew bolder and found it to be a tree root  that shows we are close to the surface of the ground said he if the worst comes to the worst i fancy we can dig our way upward with our hands  maybe but we dont want this roof to cave in on us dick come on  they continued to go forward but now the passageway was so small that they had to crawl on their hands and knees  this looks as if we were going to be blocked after all said tom  something is ahead whispered dick be quiet  what do you see  there is an opening and i can see a little light and what is more i hear the sounds of voices maybe we have run into our enemies again    chapter xxviii  from one surprise to another  left to themselves in the woods fred songbird and hans scarcely knew what to do to fill in their time  i must say i dont like this dividing up at all remarked fred after a halfhour had passed first it was sam and dick and now it is tom after a while none of us will know where any of the others are even the dog has left us it may be added here that they never saw wags again  vell you cant vos plame tom for drying to find his brudders came from hans i vos do dot mineselluf of i peen him  i hope tom steers clear of trouble said songbird you know how he isthe greatest hand for getting into mischief  the time dragged heavily on their hands and when it grew dark not one of them felt like retiring songbird tried to put on a cheerful front but it was a dismal failure and nobody listened to the rhymes he made half under his breath 230  at last came a whistle repeated several times in rapid succession then a form emerged out of the darkness  who goes there shouted fred  hullo boys was the answering cry and james monday came into the little clearing i was afraid i had lost my way  didnt you see tom they asked  yes i saw himup to the ranch he came with a letter and that spoilt about everything for it was a warning they found out who he was through that baxter and made him a prisoner then i had to sneak away for i knew they were after me too  found out you wasnt me eh put in bill cashaw thought they might that crowd is a clever one wheres my wagon and horses  i had to leave them behind here are your hat and coat ill thank you to give me my own went on the government official and the exchange was quickly made  the boys asked james monday many questions which he answered as best he could but he was in a hurry and told them so  i want to watch that ranch he said but id like one of you to ride to town as hard as you can and take a message for me  ill take the message if there is anything in it came quickly from bill cashaw  no i want one of the boys to take it you can go along if you wish went on james monday he was not quite willing to trust the old man  the matter was discussed hurriedly and it was decided that fred should carry the message and it was written on a slip of paper which the boy tucked away in an inside pocket then off he and the old man started for town both on horseback  the gang at the ranch is a desperate one said the government official when the pair were gone the most i can hope to do is to watch them until help arrives  then you sent for help asked songbird  yes and if the message is properly delivered the help will not be long in arriving  the detective wanted to move closer to the ranch and hans and songbird did as requested taking the horses with them they were as anxious to make a move as was the detective but just then there seemed nothing to do but to wait  suddenly songbird uttered a cry  i smell smoke can the forest be on fire  of it vos ve had besser git owit kvick ejaculated hans i tont vont to burn up nohow  i see a light returned james monday he ran to where there was a cleared space i believe the ranch is on fire he gasped  it is so exclaimed songbird i can see the flames plainly now how did that happen  i dont know let us draw closer i want to see what sack todd and his crowd will do  the government official hurried forward and the two boys followed him bringing along the horses as before soon they were at a spot where they could see the conflagration plainly to their astonishment not a soul appeared around the ranch or the outbuildings  what does this mean asked songbird that gang certainly cant be in the burning building  i know what it means cried the detective and there was something like anguish in his voice they have abandoned the ranch and set fire to it  abandoned the ranch repeated songbird  den vot of der rofer poys asked the german youth  dont ask me said the detective they may have escaped or else he did not finish  do you mean those rascals might leave them in the ranch prisoners asked songbird  its a hard thing to say but you know as mush as i do this knocks my last plan endways i must see if i cant get on the trail of the gang that has run away james monday added will you let me have one of the horses  certainly but  unless i act quickly those men may get miles and miles away and then it will be next to impossible to round them up continued the government official i must go after fred garrison and hurry along that extra help  where shall we meet you  i cant tell exactly we mighthullo whats that  a peculiar sound close at hand caused the detective to pause they heard a flat rock fall down and then to their amazement saw two dirty and begrimed persons emerge from a hole in the ground  who vos dot gasped hans ready to retreat in fright  hullo hans cried tom rover dont you know dick and me we just arrived by the new subway  tom and dick ejaculated songbird truly i must be dreaming  but you are not came from dick as he stepped closer oh but im glad to get out of that hole he added and glad to fall among friends once more  hullo mr monday said tom so you escaped after all thats good have any of you seen anything of sam  sam asked songbird wasnt he with you  he was but the counterfeiters carried him off with them when they left the ranch  then he must still be a prisoner  yes  when we first heard your voices we thought we had run into some of our enemies said dick we were mighty glad to learn otherwise now if sam was only here  we must find him broke in tom and the sooner we get on the trail the better  i was just going away to hurry along some help came from james monday maybe all of you had better remain in the forest on guard until i get back if you spread out you may learn something  a little later the government official hurried off on one of the horses leaving the boys to themselves tom and dick brushed off their clothing and washed up in a nearby pool of water  i think the best thing we can do is to move over to one of the wagon roads said dick well never discover anything in a spot like this  they moved along taking turns at riding on the horses left to them they were still a short distance from one of the trails when they caught sight of a lanterns gleam and soon after they heard the low murmur of voices  somebody is over there that is certain whispered dick dont make any noise fellows  almost holding their breath they crawled forward through the undergrowth and between the rocks and presently gained a point where they could see the outline of a wagon the vehicle had lost one wheel and they could see three persons moving around it inspecting the damage done  this is the worst luck yet they heard a man exclaim  well why didnt you look out for ruts said another  look out how could i look out in such a pitchy darkness  whats to be done asked a third voice  i dont know unless we unhook the team and take turns at riding horseback was the reply  at this juncture dick clutched tom by the arm  two of those fellows are that jimson and dan baxter he whispered and do you know who is in the wagon on the rear seat  no  sam    chapter xxix  on the trail once more  dick and tom were delighted to think that they had gotten on the trail of their brother thus readily and they and their friends withdrew for a short distance that they might hold a consultation without being overheard by their enemies  you are sure its sam questioned songbird i must say it was so dark i couldnt see him  i saw him plainly just as the lantern was flashed his way answered dick he had his hands behind him more than likely they are tied fast or handcuffed  well what do you propose came from tom i move we go in and attack our enemies roughshod it is what they deserve  i second the motion put in songbird  dot is vell enough to dalk apout put in hans put blease tont forgot dat da pistols haf got und da can shoot hey  youve got a pistol too hans  dot is so  and ive got one went on songbird  dick and i can get rocks and sticks said tom well make it warm for them  a few words more and dick and tom managed to find some sticks and stones which suited their purpose then they moved forward once again  at that moment came a cry from a distance followed by a pistol shot the men around the brokendown wagon were instantly on their guard with pistols and a shotgun  shoot the first man who tries to corner us shouted andy jimson dont take any chances  wait cried dick to tom who was on the point of exposing himself dont show yourself now help may be at hand besides those men will shoot as soon as they see us now  what did that shot mean  i dont know maybe it was a signal  if we could only let sam know that we are at hand  further words were cut short by another shot and a moment later four men came riding up at top speed along the wagon trail  hullo whats up here came in the voice of sack todd  had a breakdown growled andy jimson what are you shooting for  just got word that somebody has gone to town for assistance to round us up we must change our plans youll have to let the wagon stay where it is and take to the horses luckily we have some extra ones along be quick  what of the prisoner  wed better let him go  dont you do it cried dan baxter i tell you you can make money by holding him  id like to wring baxters neck for that muttered tom  all right then take him alongat least for the present said sack todd but dont waste time here are the horses  the transfer from the wagon to the horses was quickly accomplished sam was made to mount a steed and andy jimson rode on one side of him and dan baxter on the other the rest of the men rode in front and in the rear and soon the spot where the breakdown had occurred was left behind  now whats to do asked tom ruefully he realized as well as the others that it would have been useless to have attacked such a large crowd  there is but one thing to do tom follow them as soon as they locate we can go back for help they cant travel more than twentyfour hours without stopping and i believe theyll go into hiding as soon as it is daylight  with care they advanced on the trail of those ahead this was a rather difficult task for the lantern had been put out and it was pitchdark tinder the trees more than once their steeds went into a hollow with a jounce that threatened to throw one or another to the ground  if only james monday would appear with about ten men sighed tom couldnt we make it warm for those chaps  he wont be coming back for a long time said songbird he is no wizard even if he is a detective it is only in the sensational fivecent libraries that the noble detective turns up every time he is needed  yes and kills about ten men handrunning added tom with a laugh  at the end of an hours ride through the forest all of the boys were so fagged out they could scarcely keep on horseback it must be remembered that they had to take turns at riding there not being enough steeds to go around  i wish theyd come to a stop muttered songbird i declare if i ever get the chance im going to rest for a week  tont say a vord groaned hans i vos so lame i cant most sit up alretty  let us be thankful if they dont discover that we are following them said dick if they did find it out they would certainly make it warm for us  a little while later the forest was left behind and the party ahead and that in the rear came out on the broad and rolling prairies it was growing cloudy so that the boys kept their enemies in sight with difficulty not daring to draw too close  far away they could see the lights of a town gleaming but these were soon lost to view around a bit of rising ground then they forded a small stream and began to climb the slope of a small hill at the top of which were a series of rocks here they fancied the counterfeiters might halt but they were disappointed the crowd ahead toiled over the hill and then struck off across another section of the rolling plains  i cant ride much further said tom at last i am so tired i am ready to drop  ditto here came from songbird  nevertheless they kept on and thus was the shadowing continued until four oclock in the morning when the party ahead came to a patch of timber on the side of a steep hill here among the trees and rocks they went into a temporary camp  the boys had come as close as they dared and reaching a convenient hillock with a clump of bushes dismounted and threw themselves on the ground  they are going into camp sure enough announced dick after a careful inspection now the question arises what is best to do next  i know what ought to be done answered his brother but i am too tired to do it  go for help asked songbird  exactly but i could no more ride back to town than i could fly  dot is vots der madder mit me put in hans i could schleep standing ub aint it  well ill go for help then said dick but i must have one of the horses  take the best of them dick  the eldest rover inspected the animals and finally chose one that looked fairly fresh  now mind dont get into more trouble while i am gone he said if they move on simply keep them in sight  a few minutes later dick took his departure moving straight for the town they had seen earlier in the night he knew nothing of the trails but trusted to luck not to go astray  ive got to make that town he told himself and do it without wasting time too  soon he found himself utterly alone on the plains and urging his horse forward at the steeds best rate of speeda gallop that was anything but easy to the wornout youth but dick was not thinking of himself his mind was on sam and how his youngest brother might be rescued  whoa there  the command was a most unexpected one coming from out of the darkness and at the word dicks horse came to a standstill for the instant the youth could see nobody but then two horsemen hove into sight each heavily armed  at first dick could not make out who they were but as they drew nearer his heart sank within him one of the newcomers was a man he had seen working around red rock ranch and the other was the negro called watermelon pete the fellow who had given the rovers trouble while on the houseboat    chapter xxx  a roundupconclusion  the man from red rock ranch was very much startled to see dick and stared at the youth for several seconds without speaking  the eldest rover thought for an instant of putting his horse to flight but then realized with a pang that the animal would not be equal to the task  where under the sun did you come from growled the man at last  its dat same fellah cried watermelon pete i dun see him on de ribber an at de ranch too  yes the fellow who was left in a cell at red rock returned the white man how did you escape he went on to dick  smashed the door and came out in a hurry answered dick he saw no harm in telling the truth  where is your brother  what business is that of yours  dont get funny with me growled the man  are you alone he continued peering around in the darkness  you had better find out  why dont you finish him off puller came from the negro aint nobody else around  youre a fine rascal burst out dick if you touch me there is going to be trouble  i reckon youll come with me said the white man harshly we aint goin to run no risks understand if you put anybody on our trail he did not finish face around there he ordered  see here do you think you are treating me fairly asked dick he wished to gain time so that he could think matters over and decide what was best to do  i wont parley the question growled the man face around and do it quick if you want to save your hide  there was no help for it and dick faced around as he did so he caught the sounds of hoof strokes at a distance puller and watermelon pete did not appear to notice them  wait a minute i dropped something said the eldest rover and slid to the ground he pretended to search around got a light  what did you drop  something valuable said dick but did not add that it was only a harness buckle he was straining his ears and heard the hoof strokes coming closer  well hurry up and find it we are not going to stay here until the sun comes up growled puller  a moment later the sounds of horses approaching could be heard plainly dick began to cough loudly but the ears of the negro could not be deceived  listen he said warningly hosses comin suah as yo is boahn  horses cried the white man then we had better make tracks  who is there cried dick at the top of his voice if they were enemies he knew he could be no worse off  shut your mouth howled the white man  hullo was the answering call and in a moment several men dashed up all heavily armed and accompanied by james monday and fred garrison  help called out dick dont let them get away  they are not going to catch me growled puller and struck his horse in the side the animal bounded forward and was followed by that on which the negro was riding scarcely had this been done when a shot rang out and the negro fell from his saddle to the ground  halt in the name of the law cried james monday to puller but the man paid no attention several shots were fired at him but soon the gloom of early morning hid him from view  im more than glad that you have come cried dick to the government official and fred how did you get here so quickly  it was mostly luck answered the detective garrison delivered the message to just the right party and i ran into the crowd just coming away from the town we have got nine men here and all willing to do their utmost to round up that red rock ranch gang  it was soon learned that watermelon pete had been hit in the thigh the wound was not a fatal one but it was destined to put the rascal in the hospital for some time to come  you must follow that fellow who got away and at once said dick to james monday and then he told of what had happened during the night and of where sack todd and his confederates were located  leaving his tired horse behind him the eldest rover mounted the animal watermelon pete had been riding and the whole party minus the negro who was left to take care of himself for the time being started for the rendezvous of the counterfeiters  if you do any shooting be careful and dont hit my brother sam said dick  ill warn the men answered james monday and did so  dick was so tired he could scarcely sit up in the saddle but he longed to see sam rescued and so rode along as best he could  as they neared the spot where tom and his friends were in waiting they heard a faint shout and soon the funloving rover appeared he had heard the distant firing when watermelon pete was hit and was afraid dick had been wounded  good good he shouted when he recognized dick and the government official and fred this is the best yet now i hope we can round up that whole crowd  they continued to advance and as they did so they heard a firing at a distance in the direction of the counterfeiters rendezvous  something has gone wrong there cried dick  something had gone wrong and to the advantage of the rovers as dick and tom afterwards learned sam had been left to take care of himself for a few minutes and by a dexterous twist of his wrists had managed to rid himself of the rope which bound him  watching a favorable moment the youngest rover slid behind a rock and then began to run at his best rate of speed for another shelter some distance away  as soon as his flight was discovered some men went in pursuit and two shots were fired at the boy one grazing his left shoulder but leaving only a scratch  the counterfeiters would have continued to pursue the fleeing one but now a new alarm sounded out and a guard rushed up  a posse is after us called the guard we have got to fight or ride for it  let us fight exclaimed sack todd but this proposition was voted down as it was not known how many were after the evildoers  sack todd was the last man to leap into the saddle as he did so he gritted his teeth hard  they shant capture me he muttered i am not to be taken alive  away went the crowd at a breakneck speed dan baxter in their midst but at the first opportunity the bully turned to the southward and he disappeared when a patch of timber was gained  this is too hot for me he muttered i guess the best thing i can do is to get out of this neighborhood and skip for parts unknown for a while and then he urged his horse still further to the southward until the mists in a swamp in the midst of the timber hid him completely from view  having escaped from his captors sam hardly knew what to do but as he heard a number of shots fired he made up his mind that help must be at hand and so he hurried back on the trail and presently came in sight of the other boys then he set up a mad shout of joy which they quickly echoed  are you perfectly safe sam asked dick riding up  yes although i had a narrow escape and the youngest rover pointed to where the bullet had grazed his shoulder what of the others  all safe and sound sang out tom coming up and james monday and a big posse are after sack todd and his crowd hotfooted  shall we join in asked songbird  i cant go another step answered dick i am more than tired and he sank in a heap on the saddle  you boys stay here and well fix those rascals cried a man of the posse you have done enough  i guess we have said tom we are safe and sound and that is the main thing so far as we are concerned   here let me add a few words more and then bring to a close this tale of the rover boys on the plains  utterly worn out the boys remained where they were until noon of the day which was now dawning at a great distance they heard pistol and gun shots and they knew that some sort of a fight must be going on  they were just preparing to move for town when they saw two of the posse returning with three prisoners each disarmed and with his hands bound behind him one of the prisoners was puller and another andy jimson  we are going to get most of them said one of the posse to the boys but they are a pretty desperate lot  the prisoners were placed in charge of the rovers and their friends and the whole party moved for town without delay while the men of the posse went back to continue the hunt for the counterfeiters in the end every man but sack todd was captured dan baxter was tracked to the edge of the swamp and there his horse was found stuck in the ooze nearby lay the hat of the bully  my opinion is that baxter lost his life trying to get through the swamp said james monday after the hunt had come to a finish  what a horrible end said sam and shivered  perhaps he did lose his life was dicks comment but i shant believe it until i have the direct evidence i guess though ive seen the last of my watch he added  a search was kept up for several days for baxter but it brought no further traces of the misguided youth  he is gone thats sure said tom i must say i never thought hed have such an ending as this  james monday was much chagrined to think that sack todd had slipped him but he was much elated when one of the posse found several packages among the rocks these packages contained all of the printing plates used in the manufacturing of the counterfeit bank notes  the plates are what the government wants most of all he told the boys they were made by an old engraver who was once in the employ of the government the man is too old and shaky to make other plates and as sack todd isnt an engraver himself its not likely he will attempt to go into the business again  as soon as all the criminals were properly jailed and the boys had given their testimony they obtained a good nights rest and then set off for carson dentons plantation the remainder of the trip proved uneventful and when they reached their destination they felt in the best of spirits once more the news of what had occurred had preceded them and they were looked upon as heroes by the girls and mrs laning and mrs stanhope  but you mustnt get into any such trouble again said dora to dick  think if you had been burnt up at that fire cried nellie  or if those bad men had shot you added grace  well we came out of it with a whole skin said tom so we need not complain  and i guess with baxter gone our troubles are about over said sam but he was mistaken in his surmise as we shall learn in the next volume of this series entitled the rover boys in southern waters or the deserted steam yacht in this volume we shall meet all of our young friends again and learn the particulars of a most peculiar happening  when the proper time came the rascals who had been captured were tried and sentenced to various terms of imprisonment all that remained of red rock ranch was confiscated by the government and the paper and printing machinery were destroyed  while at the plantation the boys had much sport hunting and fishing and riding the girls often went along and all too soon it was announced that the houseboat was once more ready for use and the brief outing ashore must come to an end  well take it all in all we have had a good time said dick  yes answered sam although we had a little more excitement than we bargained for  excitement came from tom pooh life wouldnt be worth living without some excitement  and then he set up a merry whistle and with that whistle let us bring this story to a close    the end
