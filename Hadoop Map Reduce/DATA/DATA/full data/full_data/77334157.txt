storytellers to call him the boys own historian would perhaps be a more appropriate title for time has proved that he is more than a storyteller he is a preserver and propagator of history amongst boys  how mr henty has risen to be worthy of these enviable titles is a story which will doubtless possess some amount of interest for all his readers  henty may be said to have begun his preliminary training for his lifework when a boy attending school at westminster even then the germ of his storytelling propensity seems to have evinced itself for he was always awarded the highest marks in english composition  from westminster he went to cambridge where he was enrolled as a student at caius college it is a decided change of scenery and circumstances from cambridge to the crimea but such was the change which took place in mr hentys career at the age of twentyone  an appointment in connection with the commissariat department of the british army took him from the scenes of student life into the excitement of the muscovite war  previous to this however he had written his first novel which he has characterized as very bad no doubt and was of course never published but the plot was certainly a good one  whilst engaged with his duties at the crimea he sent home several descriptive letters of the places people and circumstances passing under his notice his father thinking some of those letters were of more than private interest took a selection of them to the editor of the morning advertiser who after perusal of them was so well pleased with their contents that he at once appointed young henty as war correspondent to the paper in the crimea  the ability with which he discharged his duties in the commissariat department at that time soon found for him another sphere of similar work in connection with the hospital of the italian forces after a short time this was relinquished for engagement in mining work which he first entered into at wales and then in italy  ten years after his crimean correspondence to the morning advertiser he again took to writing and at this time obtained the position of special correspondent to the standard while holding this post he contributed letters and articles on the wars in italy and abyssinia and on the expedition to khiva two novels came from his pen during this time but his attention was mostly devoted to miscellaneous letters and articles  it is a specially interesting incident in the career of mr henty how he came to turn his attention to writing for boys when at home after dinner it was his habit to spend an hour or so with his children in telling them stories and generally amusing them a story begun one day would be so framed as to be continued in the next and so the same story would run on for a few days each days portion forming a sort of chapter until the whole was completed some of the stories continued for weeks mr henty seeing the fascination and interest which these stories had for his own children bethought himself that others might receive from them the same delight and interest if they were put into book form he at once acted upon the suggestion and wrote out a chapter of his story for each day and instead of telling it to his children in an extempore fashion read what he had written when the story was completed the various chapters were placed together and dispatched to a publisher who at once accepted and published it it was in this way the long series of historical stories which has come from his powerful pen was inaugurated and ga henty was awarded the title of the prince of storytellers  there is in this incident a glimpse of the character of our author which endears him to us all the story of his kindly interest in his own children surely creates a liking for him in the hearts of the children of others the man who can spend an hour in telling stories to his little ones and retain their attention and interest has an evident sympathy with and power over the youthful nature time has proved such is the case with ga henty for up to the present he has written close on fifty stories for boys which have been received with unbounded joy and satisfaction by all  as an indication of the reception which his books have met with the following may be quoted from an english paper  ga henty the english writer of juveniles is the most popular writer in england today in point of sales over 150000 copies of his books are sold in a year and in america he sells from 25000 to 50000 during a year  all the world is the sphere from which mr henty draws his pictures and characters for the pleasure of the young almost every country in the world has been studied to do service in this way with the result that within the series of books which mr henty has produced for the young we find such places dealt with as carthage egypt jerusalem scotland spain england afghanistan ashanti ireland france india gibraltar waterloo alexandria venice mexico canada virginia and california doubtless what other countries remain untouched as yet are but so many fields to be attacked and which every lad hopes to see conquered in the same masterly way in which the previous ones have been handled  as a rule much of what boys learn at school is left behind them when classes are given up for the sterner work of the world unless there is a special demand for a certain subject that subject is apt to become a thing of the past both in theory and practice this however is not likely to be the case with history so long as ga henty writes books for boys and boys read them history is his especial forte and that he is able to invest the dry facts of history with life and make them attractive to the modern schoolboy says not a little for his power as a storyteller for boys it is questionable if history has any better means of fixing itself in the minds of youthful readers than as it is read in the pages of ga hentys works there is about it an attraction which cannot be resisted a most unusual circumstance in connection with such a subject all this of course means for mr henty a vast amount of research and study to substantiate his facts and make his situations characters places and points of time authentic to the reader it means a benefit which is incalculable not only as a means of passing a pleasant hour but in reviving or imparting a general knowledge of the history and geography the manners and customs of our own and other lands  there is a noticeable element of freedom which runs through mr hentys books and in this may be said to lie their influence from them lads get an elevating sense of independence and a stimulus to patriotic and manly endeavor his pages provide the purest form of intellectual excitement which it is possible to put into the hands of lads they are always vigorous and healthy and a power for the strengthening of the moral as well as the intellectual life  in the present work the golden canyon a tale of the gold mines mr henty has fully sustained his reputation and we feel certain all boys will read the book with keen interest   the golden canyon    chapter ia run ashore   in the month of august 1856 the bark northampton was lying in the harbor of san diego in spite of the awning spread over her deck the heat was almost unbearable not a breath of wind was stirring in the landlocked harbor and the bare and arid country round the town afforded no relief to the eye the town itself looked mean and povertystricken for it was of comparatively modern growth and contained but a few buildings of importance long low warehouses fringed the shore for here came for shipping vast quantities of hides as san diego which is situated within a few miles of the frontier between the united states and mexico is the sole sheltered port available for shipping between san francisco and the mouth of the gulf of california two or three other ships which were like the northampton engaged in shipping hides lay near her a sickening odor rose from the halfcured skins as they were swung up from boats alongside and lowered into the hold and in spite of the sharp orders of the mates the crew worked slowly and listlessly  this is awful tom a lad of about sixteen in the uniform of a midshipman said to another of about the same age as after the last boat had left the ships sides they leaned against the bulwarks what with the heat and what with the stench and what with the captain and the first mate life is not worth living however only another two or three days and we shall be full up and once off we shall get rid of a good deal of the heat and most of the smell  yes we shall be better off in those respects dick but unfortunately we shant leave the captain and mate behind  no i dont know which i like worst of them it is a contrast to our last sip tom what a good time we had of it on board the zebra the captain was a brick and the mates were all good fellows in fact we have always been fortunate since the day we first came on board together up to now i cant think how the owners ever appointed collet to the command he is not one of their own officers but when halford was taken suddenly ill i suppose they had no others at home to put in his place so had to go outside my father said that mr thompson had told him that they heard that he was a capital sailor and i have no doubt he is he certainly handled her splendidly in that big storm we had rounding the cape i suppose they did not inquire much farther as we took no passengers out to san francisco and were coming out to pick up a cargo of hides here for the return journey but he is a tyrant on board and when i get back i will tell my father and he will let thompson know the sort of fellow collet is it doesnt do one any good making complaints of a captain but my father is such friends with thompson that i know he will tell the other partners that he hears that collet isnt the sort of man they care about having commanding their ships without my name coming into it if he does i cant help it i know thompson will see that i dont sail with collet again anyhow and will get you with me as he has often met you at my fathers and knows what chums we are collet brought williams with him and they were a nice pair i believe the second and third are just as disgusted as we are and as allen is a nephew of one of the partners he will put a spoke in their wheel too when he comes back  well we might be worse off in some respects dick we have two good officers out of the four and we have a very fair crew and we have good grub and the company always victual their ships well and dont put the officers messing into the hands of the captain as they do in some ships  presently mr allen the second officer came up with the two lads  i am going ashore in an hour preston he said to dick if you like you can come with me  thank you sir i should like it very much  i wish you were coming too tom he went on when the officer moved away that is one of the nuisances collet never letting us go ashore together  it is a nuisance the other said heartily of course allen is a very good fellow but one cant have any larks as one could have if we were together  well there are not many larks to be had here at any rate tom it is about the dullest place i ever landed at it is a regular mexican town and except that they do have i suppose sometimes dances and that sort of thing there is really nothing to be done when one does go ashore and the whole place stinks of hides even if one could get away for a day there is no temptation to ride about that desertlooking country with the sun burning down on one no one but a salamander could stand it they are about the roughestlooking lot i ever saw in the town everyone has got something to do with hides one way or the other they have either come in with them from the country or they pack them in the warehouses or they ship them that and mining seem the only two things going on and the miners with their red shirts and pistols and knives look even a rougher lot than the others i took my pistol when last i went ashore i will lend it you this evening  oh i dont want a pistol tom there is no chance of my getting into a row  oh it is just as well to carry one dick when you know that everyone else has got one about him somewhere and a considerable number of them are drunk it is just as well to take one you know it is small and goes in my breast pocket  i will take my stick the one i bought at san francisco it has got an ounce of lead in the knob i would rather have that than a pistol any day  however as dick was standing with the second officer at the top of the gangway tom haldane as he passed by slipped the pistol into his hand and then walked on dick thrust it into his pocket and then descended the ladder it was almost dark now  i have two or three places to go to preston and do not know how long i shall be detained it is just nine oclock now suppose you meet me here at the boat at halfpast ten it will be pleasanter for you to stroll about by yourself than to be waiting about outside houses for me  very well sir i dont think there is much to see in the town but i will take a bit of a stroll outside it is cool and pleasant after the heat of the day  they walked together to the first house that mr allen had to visit then dick strolled on by himself the place abounded with wineshops through the open doors the sound of the strumming of mandolins snatches of spanish song and occasionally voices raised in dispute or anger came out dick felt no inclination to enter any of them had his chum been with him he might have looked in for a few minutes for the fun of the thing but alone he would be the object of remark and might perhaps get involved in a quarrel besides the freshness of the air was so pleasant that he felt disposed for a walk for the moon was shining brightly the stars seemed to hang from the skies and after having been pent up in the ship for the last four days it was pleasant to stretch the limbs in a brisk walk in ten minutes he was outside the town and followed the road for half an hour  it is a comfort he said to himself to have got rid of the smell of hides if ever cholera comes this way i should think it would make a clean sweep of san diego  turning he walked leisurely back he entered the town and had gone but a hundred yards or two when he heard a shout followed by a pistol shot and then in english a cry for help  he dashed down the street toward a group of people who he could see in the moonlight were engaged in a sharp struggle one man was defending himself against four and the oaths and exclamations of these showed that they were mexicans just as he reached them the man they were attacking was struck down and two of his assailants threw themselves upon him  dick rushed upon the men and felled one with a sweeping blow of his stick the other man who was standing up sprang at him knife in hand with a savage oath  so quick was the action that he was upon dick before he had time to strike a blow with his stick he threw up his left arm to guard his head but received a severe gash on the shoulders at the same moment he struck out with his right full into the face of the mexican who as he staggered back fell across the three men on the ground dick seized the opportunity to draw his pistol dropping his stick as he did so as his left arm was disabled it was a doublebarreled pistol and as the three natives rose and rushed at him he shot the first the other two sprang at him and he received a blow that almost paralyzed him he staggered against the wall but had strength to raise his arm and fire again just as the man was about to repeat his blow he fell forward on his face and his other assailant took to his heels a moment later dick himself sank to the ground     chapter iidicks escape   when dick opened his eyes it was broad daylight he was lying in a barely furnished room a surgeon was leaning over him bandaging his wounds while on the other side of the bed stood three redshirted men whose rough beards and belts with bowie knives and pistols showed them to be miners one of them had his face strapped up and his arm in a sling an exclamation of satisfaction burst from him as dicks eyes opened  that is right lad you will do now it has been touch and go with you all night my life aint no pertiklar value to nobody but such as it is you have saved it but i wont talk of that now which ship do you belong to we will let them know at once  the northampton dick said in a whisper  all right dont you talk any more we will get your friends here in no time  but when mr allen came ashore dick was again unconscious the mate fetched two more surgeons who after conferring with the first were all of opinion that although he might possibly recover from his wounds weeks would elapse before he would be convalescent before night fever had set in and it was a fortnight before he was again conscious of what was passing round him he looked feebly round the room one of the redshirted men was attending to a pot over a charcoal fire turning his head he saw standing looking out of the window his friend tom haldane  halloa tom he said in a whisper which however reached the midshipmans ears he turned sharply round and hurried to the bedside  thank god dick you are conscious again dont try to talk old fellow drink this lemonade and then shut your eyes again  dick tried to raise his hand to take the glass but to his surprise found he was unable to do so tom however put it to his lips and poured it down his throat it was cool and pleasant and with a sigh of relief he again closed his eyes and went off into a quiet sleep  when he awoke it was evening the window was open and the fresh air came in making the lamp on the table flicker  how do you feel now old man tom asked  i feel all right he said but i am wonderfully weak i suppose i must have lost a lot of blood has the skipper given you leave to stop with me for the night  tom nodded i will tell you all about it in the morning dick there is some chicken broth dave has been cooking for you you must try and drink a bowl of it and then by tomorrow morning you will be feeling like a giant  dick laughed feebly it will be some time before there is much of a giant about me tom but i feel as if i could drink some broth  the next morning dick woke feeling decidedly stronger raise me up and put some pillows behind me tom it is horrid being fed from a spoon lying on ones back  the man called dave and tom lifted him up as he wished and then the latter fed him with the broth in which some bread had been crumbled  now then dick said when he had finished let us hear what the old man said i suppose he was in a tremendous rage  that he was a brute  why there is my chest what has he sent that ashore for i should think i could be taken on board again today  you wont be taken on board the northampton tom said for by this time she is down somewhere near cape horn  eh dick exclaimed in astonishment why how long have i been here  a fortnight today dick  dick was too surprised to make any remark for some time  but if the northampton has gone how is it that you are here tom  simply because she has gone without me dick the old man was in a furious rage when he heard in the morning what had happened to you of course we were in a great stewi mean the third mate and myselfwhen allen came off at twelve oclock without you after waiting an hour and a half at the wharf for you to turn up we all felt sure that something must have happened or you would never have been all that time late there was a row between allen and the skipper the first thing in the morning allen wanted to go ashore to make inquiries about you and the old man would not let him and said that no doubt you had deserted but that if you came on board again he would have you put in irons  well there was a regular row going on when a boat came off with a man in a red shirt who i know now is one of daves partners and said that you were desperately wounded and that the spanish doctor they had called in thought that you would die so then the old man couldnt help allens going ashore of course he could do nothing as you were insensible but he got two other surgeons their opinion was that you would not get over it but that if you did it would be a long time first when allen got back there was another row he wanted to have you brought on board the captain said that as you had chosen to mix yourself up in a row on shore you might die on shore for anything he cared then i asked for leave to stay with you when the vessel sailed and got sworn at for my pains in the afternoon i filled up your chest chockfull with as many of my things as i could get into it and sent it ashore by the next night we had got all the cargo on board and were to sail by the next morning and i lowered myself down and swam ashore  allen had told me exactly where you were lying so i came here at once and told dave who i was and why i had come ashore and as soon as it was light he took me round to the room the other two had the captain came ashore in the morning and stormed and raved at the consuls but he had better have kept on board i told our friends here all about it and as he went back to the boat again one of them pitched into him and gave him such a tremendous licking that i hear he had to be carried on board as soon as he got on board the northampton sailed so you see here we both are i have written off to your father and mine giving them a full account of the whole affair and saying what a brute collet had been on the whole voyage they will be sure to lay the letters before the firm and as allen and smith will when they are questioned speak out pretty straight you may be sure the old man and his friend the first mate will have to look for a berth somewhere else  it is awfully good of you to have come ashore to nurse me tom  bosh why i have got away from the northampton i found too that as far as nursing was concerned i might as well have stayed on board for dave here and his two mates have one or other of them been with you night and day and they could not have taken more care of you if they had been women still i have been very glad to be here though till three days ago there seemed very little hope of your pulling through it now you have talked enough or rather i have talked enough dick and you had better turn over and get another sleep     chapter iiithe goldseekers   two days later the lad was able to sit up in bed and to enter upon a discussion as to the future with tom and the miner it was begun by the latter  i suppose you will be taking the first ship back as soon as you are strong enough he said  i dont know dave now i am here i should certainly like a run ashore for a few weeks and to see something of the country we have got twenty pounds between us that will last for some time i should think we could get a passage back without having to pay on this side for it and if there was any difficulty about it we could work our way back but tom agrees with me we should like to see something of the country first  i suppose in another fortnight i shall be all right again but there is the doctor to pay i dont know what their charges are here but i expect his bill will be a pretty long one you had better tell him today that we have not got a great deal of cash between us and that as i only want building up now he need not come again  dont you trouble yourself about that dave growled you dont suppose that when you have got yourself cut and sliced about in helping me you are going to have any trouble about doctors we have got a tidy lot at present amongst us and what is ours is yourn we were going to set off among the hills a day or two after the time we had that trouble only of course that stopped it all  please dont stop on my account dick said i shall get on very well now and i was saying to tom as soon as i can get about we will go off somewhere among the hills for one might just as well be lying in an oven as here if you will tell us where you and your mates are working we might find our way there and get a job we are both pretty strong you knowthat is to say when we are welland we have often said that we should like to try our luck goldmining  we aint agoing till you are strong enough to get about dave said so it is no use saying any more about that then if you want to do some mining we will put you in the way of it but we are going on a long expedition which may last months and from which as like as not we shall never come back again however we can easy enough take you with us for a bit and drop you at one of the mining camps and stop there with you till you get accustomed to it or work for a few months with you if you like time is not of much consequence to us  that is awfully good of you dave tom said but as you have lost more than a fortnight at present and i suppose it will be another fortnight before dick is strong enough to travel it isnt fair on you and perhaps you might be able to introduce us to some men going up to the hillsthat is if you think that we could not go with you on this expedition you talk of  that wont be a job for young hands dave said it will be a mighty long journey over a terrible rough country where ones life will be always in ones hands where ones eyes will always be on the lookout for an enemy and one will know that any moment night or day one may hear the war yell of the indians we are going into the heart of arizona to places where not halfadozen white men even counting mexicans as white men have ever set foot at least where not halfadozen have ever come back alive from though maybe there are hundreds who have tried  then i suppose you are going to look for some very rich mine dave  that is so i will tell you how it came about and queerly enough it wur pretty well the same way as your friend and me came together my mates and me were coming down from the hills when we heard a shot fired in a wood ahead of us it wasnt none of our business but we went on at a trot thinking as how some white men had been attacked by greasers  what are greasers tom asked  dave laughed  a greaser is just a mexican why they call them so i dont know but that has been their name always as long as i came in the country well we ran down and came sudden upon two greasers who were kneeling by a man lying in the road and seemed to be searching his pockets we let fly with our colts one of them was knocked over and the other bolted then we went to look at the man in the road he wur a greaser too he had been shot dead i wonder what they shot him for says i maybe it is a private quarrel maybe he had struck it rich and has got a lot of gold in his belt we may as well look it is no use leaving it for that skunk that bolted to come back for he had got about twenty ounces in his belt and we shifted it into our bag and were just going on when zekelthat is one of my matessaid i know this cuss dave its the chap that lived in that village close to where we were working six months ago they said he had been fossicking all over arizona and that he was the only one who ever came back out of a party who went to locate a wonderful rich spot it was said he knew of  he tried over and over again to get up another party but no one would try after that first failure we may just as well search him all over it may be he has got a plan of the place somewhere about him and it is like enough those fellows have killed him on the chance of finding it  so we searched him pretty thorough and at last we found a paper sewn up in the collar of his jacket sure enough it was a plan we did not examine it then for someone might have come along and we might have been accused of the chaps murder so i shoved it into the inside pocket of my shirt and we went on we looked at it that night there was several marks on it and names one of which we had heard of though we had never been so far in the indian country well as you may guess we had some big talks over it and at last we reckoned we would have a try to find it  we had been lucky and had struck it rich at the last place we had been at and we agreed instead of spending our money in a spree or at the monte tables we would fit out an expedition and try it now i believe that attack was made on me to try and get that piece of paper the chap who bolted may like enough have hid himself and watched us and may have seen us find it and me take charge of it we thought more than once since we came down here that we were being dogged by a greaser but we never thought about the paper that evening i had been out by myself which i did not often do for we in general went about together and was going back along that street and was pretty nigh home when someone said in spanish that is the fellow and then five men jumped out with knives in their hands i had just time to whip out my sixshooter and fire once one fellow went down but at the same moment i got a clip across my wrist with a knife and down went the pistol then i got a slice across the head and another on the shoulder and down i went two of them threw themselves on me and i shammed dead knowing that if i moved it was all over with me one of them shoved his hand in my trousers pockets and the other tore my shirt open i heard a sudden row a blow and the fall of a body then one of them came tumbling down on the top of us and knocked the two fellows over then they jumped up and i heard your pistol crack twice and two falls and as i got up on to my feet to lend a hand i saw one of the fellows bolting down the street running off in another direction that was the one i think that came down on the top of us  i have been wondering since then how it was that that fellow fell for you did not fire till they jumped up  dick explained that he had felled one with a blow from the stick and not having time to strike with it again had sent the second staggering over the group with a blow of his fist those are the two that got away i expect he said  i expect so there were four bodies on the groundyours the two fellows you shot and the one i wiped out to begin with  has there been any row about it dick asked  no they take these things quietly if it had been one of my mates and me who had killed three mexicans our story that we had been attacked might not have been believed but as it was certain a young ships officer would not have joined me in falling foul of three natives they just took and buried them and there was an end of it     chapter ivmore plans   i suppose this is daves room dick said when he and his friend were alone  yes from what he said they lodged here together but the other two went somewhere else the day after you were brought in so that the place should be quiet but they come in by turns to sit up with you at night i wish they would take us with them on this expedition dick  i wish they would it would be a splendid adventure and we might come back with no end of gold at any rate after being four months under collet i think we have a right to a holiday i expect they will let us go with them if you make a strong point of it dick  it shant be for want of trying tom anyhow  the lads had their way as soon as the three men saw that they were really bent upon accompanying them they raised no further objections  we shall be glad enough to have you with us dave said and though the work will be toilsome and hard there is nothing in it that two active young chaps like you need be afraid of it is just the injunsthey are the worst kind and have always set themselves against goldseekers that is natural enough for they know that if gold mines were once opened in their country the whites would pour in and they would soon be wiped out anyhow everyone who goes prospecting in that part of arizona knows well enough that he takes his life in his hands  all along the country by the gila river is the stronghold of the apaches the terror of northern mexico many parties of miners have set out but very few have ever come back again but those that have tell of gold richer by a hundred times than ever was seen in california and have brought with them sacks of nuggets to prove it these are men who have had the luck to get in and out without ever having been seen by the injuns the large parties have never succeeded so you see young fellows the odds are strongly agin you still if you like to go with us you are welcome but if the time comes when the redskins have got us shut up in some place we can never get out of alive remember that you are there on your own choice and that we had no hand in getting you into the scrape  we will never blame you whatever comes of it dave if the risk is not too great for you and your comrades it is not too great for us there is nothing in the world we should like so much as such an adventure  well that is settled then and no more words about it we shall be glad to have two more with us and we intended to go alone only because it is not everyone that can be trusted  what do we take with us  we shall each take a horse and a mexican pony to carry our food and traps if everything goes right and we find a bonanza we can load them up on the way back twenty dollars will buy a pony here then you will want a critter each to ride we are not going to get firstrate ones for if the indians come on us it is fighting that we shall have to do not riding among those mountains no shod horse of the plains has a chance with those indian ponies which can climb like goats and go at a gallop along places where a horse from the plains wouldnt dare move then you will want rifles and sixshooters that is about all i am afraid our stock of money will hardly run to it and i think we had better work for a while in one of the diggings to make up what we shall want  we have twenty pounds between us dick said and we can draw on our fathers for twentyfive pounds each the consul here has of course heard of my being wounded and left behind and i expect he wont mind cashing our draft  there will be more than we want the miner said still it is as well to be on the right side if we dont find any gold up there we shall want a little when we get back to keep us going until something turns up  three days later dick was strong enough to go with his friend to the consuls they found that mr allen had spoken about dick and told him that should he recover from his wounds he could cash a draft for him without any fear therefore in half an hour the lads returned to their lodgings with three hundred and fifty dollars having changed their english gold into the currency of the country  you have not got your horses yet i suppose dave  no we shall go up the river about a hundred and twenty miles there we shall buy horses cheaper than we can get them here we have got rifles and colts they are things one cant very well do without in knocking about among the hills i will go round the town and i have no doubt i shall be able to pick you up what you want cheap there are so many men get rubbed out one way or the other that such things are pretty often for sale  the other two miners who during dicks illness had nothing to do but to stroll about the town both knew of men who had rifles or revolvers to dispose of and in a couple of hours the purchases were completed and a considerable stock of ammunition was also bought  i should recommend yer the miner called zekel said as the party were talking matters over that evening to rig yourselves out miner fashion them uniforms looks very nice on board ship but they aint much good for knocking about in the mountains and yer can leave them here and take to them again when yer gets back  the lads thought the advice was good and next day rigged themselves out in red shirts and high boots in which were tucked the bottom of the thick moleskin trousers they also bought jackets of the same material as the troupers  you will be glad of them at night dave said it gets pretty cold up in the mountains when the sun is down and we shant be lighting any fires you bet  they also bought a couple of rough blankets each a spare shirt and two or three pairs of stockings a couple of long bowie knives and two broadbrimmed felt hats     chapter vthe search for the canyon   ten days later the party took passage in a large boat going up the river to santa fe it had come down freighted with hides and the odor still hung about it however by this time they had become accustomed to the smell and scarcely noticed it the boat was manned by six mexicans who sometimes poled it along sometimes when the stream was rapid got ashore and towed from the bank  it took them six days to arrive at santa fe although just inside the united states frontier the population was almost entirely mexican there were however a few american stores containing european goods of all kinds for the use of the natives and such articles as miners or prospectors going up among the hills would require here they had no difficulty in purchasing horses five rough serviceable ponies for the carriage of the baggage were picked up at twenty dollars a piece and five wellmade and wiry horses for their own riding mexican saddles with very high pommels and cantles heavy and cumbersome to look at but very comfortable for long distances were also obtained without difficulty at the stores were bought two sacks of flour and two sides of bacon a frying pan saucepan baking pot and a good supply of tea and sugar four large waterskins five small ones completed their purchases with the exception of shovels picks and pails for washing the gravel  going up among the hills again dave remarked the storekeeper with whom the miners had often dealt before  yes we are going to try a new direction this time and dont want to have to come back directly we have struck anything we have got enough grub here for three or four months reckoning as we shall occasionally get hold of bear or deer meat  well you had better keep clear of the indian country dave they made a raid down south i hear last month and burnt half a dozen mexican villages and they would make short work with you if they came across you anywhere near their country however i suppose you aint going to be fool enough to go that way especially as i see you have got two green hands with you  they are old enough to be useful dave said we can put them to cook and look after the horses if they cant do anything else they are britishers and one of them stood by me pluckily in a mess i got into in san diego so as they had left their ship and were out of a berth i thought i would bring them with me as they had a fancy for seeing a little of mining life before they shipped back again  two days after their arrival at santa fe they started  we will strike due south as if intending to enter mexico one never knows who is watching one dave said the evening before there are always some pretty hard men about these border townsminers who are down on their luck men who have had to run from the northern diggings and such like we may say what we like but they will make a guess that we have located something rich and are going back to work it quietly and keep it to ourselves and like enough some of them will take it in their heads to follow us anyhow we will travel south for a day or two and then turn off sharp to the west it aint as i should grudge anyone else a share in the mine but the more there are the more chance of the injuns finding us besides some of these chaps are so reckless that like as not they would light a big fire if they wanted to cook a loaf of bread we three have been up that way before although not so far as we are going now and we know what we have got to expect and that if we are going to bring our scalps out again we have got to sleep with our eyes open  another fortnights traveling and they had passed the last settlements had left fort mason behind them and had entered the country that the apaches and kindred tribes claimed as their own  the two lads had enjoyed the journey immensely they had traveled about fifteen miles a day their pace being regulated by that of the pack animals during the heat of the day they had all halted in the shade of some clump of tree or bush here the horses had picked up their sustenance grass and leaves while the men slept at night they had camped when they could find such a spot on the banks of a stream then a big fire would be lighted a dough of flour water and soda would be mixed and placed in the baking pot this was put among the red embers which were drawn over the lid so as to bake it from above as well as below then if they had no other meat rashers of bacon would be grilled over the fire and eaten with the hot bread generally however they had been able to purchase a kid or some fowls at one or other of the little villages through which they passed  they always carried with them two of the large skins filled with water in case none should be met with at their halting places this sufficed for tea and for a good drink at night and before starting in the morning for the horses the villages however had become fewer and fewer and at the last through which they had passed they had bought one of the little bullocks of the country cut the flesh into strips and hung it in the sun to dry halting three days for the purpose     chapter vithe map again   now dave said as they finished their meal on the evening after leaving fort mason we have got to consider which course we had better take first we will have another look at the map  this was taken out from a washleather case in which it had been sewn dave carrying it under his shirt by a string that went round his neck it was the first time that the boys had seen it as dave opened it they examined it with much curiosity it was divided in two the upper one appeared to be a general map of the country the lower one a plan of the immediate locality of the spot  it looks very confusing dick said as he examined it  you see the chap as made it did not do it for other people but so that he could find his way back by it this line that runs along the bottom of the other map i take to be the gila which is a big river which runs right through the indian country and falls into the rio grande i have gone up it from that side two or three hundred miles we were a strong party but we had to fight our way back again and lost pretty near half our number you see by the map it lies on the north side of the gila but as the gila is eight or nine hundred miles long that dont help us a great deal and the map wouldnt be any good to us if it was not for this mark here up near the top you see all these things are meant for mountains but as one mountain on a map is just like another we should be downright done if it was not for this mark do you see there are three little jags here close together now i take it those three jags are meant for a mountain the indians call the three sisters which is a mountain with three peaks close together i never saw it myself but i have spoken with miners who have seen it from the north now here you see to the south of the three sisters is a cross and i take it thats the mine you see there is a black line waving about among the mountains that stops at that point i guess that is the line they traveled by  but there is nothing to tell us what scale the map is on dave tom said it may mean five hundred miles from end to end it may mean fifty if it is five hundred it must be seventy or eighty miles from those peaks to the cross if it is fifty it is only seven or eight  that is so dave agreed  have you any idea how far it is from the three peaks to the river  yes i have heard it is about fifty miles north of the gila  well that would make this spot marked from fifteen to twenty miles from them the length of the map would be about two hundred miles and as the peaks are about a quarter of the distance from the righthand side this map begins about a hundred and fifty miles to the west of the peaks i should think it would be at some wellknown place that the maker of this map began some place that he knew he could find again without difficulty  that is so you will see the line begins at a stream running north and south there is a mark here each side of the pathline of course they might mean anything they might mean trees or rocks then look here there are two more dots out here and if you were to draw a line straight through them it would come to the other dots one must be three or four miles off and the other twelve or fifteen the farthest one may be a peak and the one nearer some conspicuous tree or rock in a line with it  yes that is what we make it out to be boston joe said we have the choice of either going up the gila valley and mounting this side stream till we come upon something that agrees with these four marks or of keeping along from the west by a valley about the right distance from the gila  i should not think we can trust much to distances dick said this man was merely sketching out a plan to help him on his way up again should he ever make up a party to return to the mine and though probably these bendings and turnings of the road are to be depended upon the map itself cannot be done to any scale here the peaks are made twice as far from the left side as they are from the river but they may be really four times as far or they may be only the same distance there is no saying at all as he has drawn it the point where the road begins is a good deal more to the south than the peaks are if the scale is correct it is not more than thirty miles at most north of the gila that the path begins you see about halfway between this point and the river are five or six little marks like a v upside down i see there are other marks like these at different places on the map i should say they were meant for indian villages  that is so no doubt dave agreed here is another thing beside them what do you make that out to be dick  it looks to me like a tiny bird it is very small and very badly done but i am pretty sure that that is what is meant what in the world can he have put a bird there for let us look at the other villages he examined them carefully two of them have got figures this one looks like a cat and this is a snakeat least i should think so  i have got it dave exclaimed those are the names of the chiefs i know the names of a good many of their chiefs and theres rattlesnake and the mountain lion among them  and there is the crow too dave boston joe put in  so there is i know he is the chief of the tribes whose country lies this side of the arizona no doubt that is his village now we have it i know pretty well where his place is for i have been further among the hills than that i can find my way there easy enough when we get to the stream his village is built on we have got to hunt along it till we find these marks and then follow on the line he took the crows village is about thirty miles north of the gila that will put these stops sixty miles from the river yes this straightens out the distances pretty considerable for i should say that from them to the three peaks it must be nigh three hundred miles i dont think it is more than a hundred from here to the crows village it should be an easy thing following that marked line but it wont matter if we miss it our course will be pretty nigh due east not as he makes it north for we know the sisters are not more than eighty miles from the gila when we get near them we cant help seeing them then we have only got to follow the direction of this map below there are the peaks well right in front of them is a lower hill with a tree on its top and that tree exactly in line with the middle peak gives us the line and as the tree just touches the bottom of the peak it will give us the distance to within half a mile here are two lines one on each side of the line from the peak through the trees i dont know what they mean but i guess they mark a canyon and when we go up that we can hardly help striking the mine wherever it is i think we have got the thing pretty well down to a point and if we go wrong it is our own fault  shall we have to come back this way dick asked  that must depend upon circumstances dave replied we might make straight north and come down on a pass that crosses the mountains about a hundred and fifty miles north of the sisters but i reckon it would be a terrible journey to undertake with loaded mules then again we might strike east and make either for albuquerque or socorro like enough we may find that our best way     chapter viithe scarcity of water   five days later they reached the stream the miners had all recognized points that they had passed on their former journey and all agreed that it was lower down on this stream that the crows village was situated for the moment this was a matter of inferior importance to them it was enough that they had reached water for they had for the last four days been traversing an arid waste of broken country without as much as a tree under which they could lie during the day they had filled up all their water skins before entering on this region and these had sufficed for them and their animals but for the last two days they had been obliged to husband it what remained tasted so strongly of the skins that at any other time the boys could not have drank it but men and horses were both filled with delight at the sight of the bright clear water the baggage and saddles were removed and the animals were allowed to drink their fill and then to lie down in the stream while their riders enjoyed the luxury of a bath  they had done no cooking for the last four days as no fuel of any sort was to be obtained and they lived upon the dried meat and a drink of flour and water the banks of the stream were well wooded and the animals as soon as their thirst was quenched fell to work upon the grass that grew kneedeep near its banks  we must do some cooking today dave said and a good batch of it there is no saying when it will be safe to cook again we must wait till night and then light the fire in the thickest part of these trees and fasten our blankets up round it to prevent its light being seen we can collect the firewood in readiness before it gets dark  the spot was carefully chosen the horseropes were fastened from tree to tree around it and all the blankets hung on them  we must take it by turns dave said to keep the fire up and go on baking we will make a dozen loaves if we can  as they sat round the fire later on they discussed their next move and agreed that as the river was shallow they would cross it at once and then follow it up stream should they find no landmarks answering to those on the map they would then return and go down the stream  next morning they started again with fifteen loaves done up in a blanket on one of the ponies the journey was toilsome for the river ran in places through gorges where the rocks rose sheer from its edge and they were forced to make considerable detours and to come down upon it again they had traveled they calculated but eight miles up the stream when they came upon a valley running east a small stream ran down it and fell into the river they were following  this looks a likely sort of place dave said it is the sort of valley a party exploring would be likely to follow there is wood water and grass now for the landmarks  they went on until they reached the spot where the stream fell into the river  we cant do better than camp here dave zekel said it has been a rough journey for the ponies and they will be all the better for another good feed  all right dave agreed i dont see any signs of the landmarks but they may be somewhere about we will unsaddle the ponies boys you may as well walk up the stream a bit keep your eyes open but dont go very far away keep your rifles ready for use there is no saying but what some prowling indian may not have caught sight of us as we came along  the boys unslung their rifles which were strapped tightly to their backsthey were already loadedand started up the valley in a quarter of a mile they passed through the low wood which filled the bottom of the valley in front of them was an open space bright with long grass and flowers in the center of this stood two large trees one on either side of the stream they hurried on and when they reached the trees saw to the northwest two peaks one nearer and lower than the other in an exact line as the direction was exactly that of the two dots on the map they had no doubt whatever that they had hit the right spot they returned at once with the news to the men dave had already lighted a fire for in this sheltered valley there was little fear of the slight smoke it made being seen broken up as it was in its passage through the leaves overhead  we have found the marks dick said as they arrived we dont think there can be any mistakes about them  have you that is good and the three men at once went on to the two trees  there is no doubt that is what was meant boston joe said wall i am glad to see themit shows anyhow that we are right in our guesswork as to the map which we never felt quite sure of before seeing them three peaks war the only thing we had to go on and the marks might not have been meant for them arter all now the matter air clear and fixed and we have only got to go ahead  yes we will stick to the line they have traveled as shown in the map but if we miss it it is no great odds we know where we have got to go to and we can find our way there i guess anyhow still their line may be the best they may have had some redskin as their guide who knew the country and took them the best way anyhow we cant do better than try and follow it     chapter viiithe golden valley   it was nearly a month later that the goldseekers arrived at a point due south of the three peaks the journey had been a toilsome one at times they made their way through deep gorges at others they had to climb rocky hills where the horses could scarce obtain a foothold one of their pack ponies had been lost having slipped and fallen over a precipice many hundreds of feet deep and they had lost a day making a long detour to reach the spot where he fell in order to recover the articles he had carried for the first half of the distance they had they believed followed the track marked on the map but they then found themselves at the head of a deep valley from which they could discover no egress and it was therefore clear that they must have misunderstood the marks and have taken a wrong turning somewhere  from this time they had put aside the map and made their way as nearly east as the inequalities of the ground permitted they had no difficulties as to forage for their horses in many of the valleys there was an abundance of coarse grass and among the rocks the aloe and cactus grew thickly and when as was sometimes the case no water was to be found they peeled the thorny skin from the thick juicy leaves and gave the pulp to the animals  for themselves they shot three bears and several small mountain deer there was little fear of the sound of their rifles being heard in these mountain gorges and should the report have reached the ear of an indian he would have supposed that it was the gun of some red hunters there were indeed only two villages marked on the map anywhere near the line they were following as the great bulk of the indians lived on the slopes of the hills on either side of the gila whence they could make their raids into mexico to the south or to new mexico to the east  here among the mountains they could subsist on the proceeds of the chase and the little plantations tended by the women but this offered small attractions to the restless and warlike indians who preferred depending upon the plunder that they could always gather by a raid upon the defenseless mexican villages thus during the whole journey they had not once caught sight of an indian though they had two or three times made out with the aid of a telescope tom had brought with him little clusters of wigwams far away among the hills  there will be more danger when we get near the place zekel said one evening when they were talking it over the redskins know well enough that it is gold the whites who come into their mountains are in search of and i guess they know every place where it is to be found a redskin always has his eyes open a broken branch a stone newly rolled down on a path the ashes of a fire the slightest thing that is new he is sure to notice and the glitter of gold whether in a stream or in a vein would be certain to catch his eye and if this place is specially rich they are safe to know of it and would keep some sort of watch to see that it is not found out by the whites  that is so dave agreed of course we dont know how the party that mexican got the map from got wiped out it may have been on their way back but it is more likely it was at the mine itself and we may find signs of them when we get there i hope they had been at work some time before they were attacked if so we may like enough find a store of gold without the trouble of working for it it is no use to the redskins they dont do any trade with the whites and they dont wear gold ornaments they are wise enough to know that if they were to show much gold about them it would make the whites more eager than ever to come in among their mountains in search of it so if the mexican party gathered some up afore they went under like enough we shall find it  it was with deep satisfaction that they at last caught sight of the mountain with three sharp peaks but it was four days after they first saw it that they reached a point due south of it they were now in a wide valley running east and west to the south a wall of rock rose in a seemingly unbroken line on the northern side of the valley the hills sloped away rising one above another with the peaks of the sisters visible above them all  they had left their animals in charge of boston joe in a clump of trees four miles back as the miners were of opinion that some indian village might lie somewhere in the neighborhood and that it would be safer to make their way on foot one of the many branches of the gila ran along the center of the valley but except in deep pools it was now dry  now we must keep a sharp lookout for marks on the hills dave said we know we are about right as to the line but we may have to go two or three miles north or as much south before we get a mark just bearing on that middle peak stop he broke off suddenly look up there just beyond the shoulder of that hill there are some wigwams sure enough  tom brought his telescope to bear  yes there are about twenty of them but they never can see us at this distance  dont you make any mistake young fellow there aint no saying what an indian can see and what he cant see i reckon their eyes is as good as that glass of yours and i would not guarantee they could not see a rabbit run at this distance there get among those rocks at the foot of the cliff we will make our way along them hiding as much as we can i suppose those are horses away there on the hillside to the right of the village they cant be nothing else  yes they are horses dave  for another half hour they made their way among the rocks and then dick exclaimed suddenly  look dave there is a tree standing by itself at the top of that hill i believe in another fifty yards it will just be on the line of the peaks  i think you are right dick and we have hit the very point at the first try if it is right there must be a break in this wall above us     chapter ixthe tree on the peak   they hastened on now with their eyes fixed on the tree a minute later an exclamation broke from dave who was ahead and the others on joining him saw that the great wall of rock had been split as if by an earthquake the opening was not more than ten yards wide and on looking up a narrow line of sky appeared between the walls of rock looking the other way they saw that the tree on the hill bore exactly on the middle peak the indian village lying just in the same line halfway up the hill  here is the place sure enough dave said there cant be no mistake about it it is just as the map made it the tree on the middle peak and the line from them going right into this canyon look boys there is a stream comes down here in the wet season and runs into the one in the middle of the valley see i can make out gold sparkling in the sand that is how it was the place was found they were prospecting along the valley and they came upon gold and traced it up to the mouth of this canyon  shall we go in now dave dick asked excitedly for they were still standing among the rocks which broke off abruptly opposite the mouth of the canyon those in front of it evidently having been swept away by the torrents flowing down it  no dont go a step forward dick dont let us risk nothing by showing ourselves now we will make our way back as we came to boston and bring up the horses after dark we have not got a chance to throw away i can tell you  at night they returned with the horses two blankets had been cut up and the feet of the animals muffled  if one of them redskins was to come upon our track and saw the print of a horseshoe it would be all up with us zeke said we had best do the same ourselves the heel of boot would be as ugly a mark as a horseshoe we must keep well along at the edge of these fallen rocks like enough they come down here to fetch water up to their village and the further we keep away from the stream the better  the moon was half full which was fortunate as they would otherwise have had great difficulty in finding the narrow gap in the cliff its light too enabled them to avoid rocks that had rolled out farther than the rest once inside the gorge it was pitchdark and they had to feel their way along  in about a hundred yards it began to widen and they soon found themselves in a narrow valley with perpendicular sides which seemed to widen farther up the horses were at once unloaded  now do you lie down dave said i will keep watch at the mouth i dont think there is any danger still we may as well begin as we shall have to go on  well call me up in a couple of hours then zeke said it will begin to get light in about four and as soon as it does we will cover up the tracks  with the first dawn of light the three miners taking their blankets went down to the mouth of the canyon the boys accompanied them to watch their operations it was only in the sand and gravel swept down by the floods from the gorge that any footmarks could be seen these were first leveled and then with the blankets the surface of the sand was carefully swept so as to erase all signs of disturbance before the sun was up the operation was completed twenty or thirty yards up the canyon  that is enough for the present dave said we are safe from anyone passing now let us have a look round up above  they must have been awful careless if they were surprised in here zeke said half a dozen men ought to hold this place against a hull tribe of redskins  that is so boston joe agreed but the greasers are mighty bad watchmen and no doubt they thought they were safe in here that indian village could not have been over on the hill opposite then or it would have been put down on the map  like enough they had been followed dave said if a redskin had caught sight of them he might have followed on their trail for weeks till he found where they were going and then made off to bring his tribe down on them it may be that one has been hanging behind us just in the same way  it is a very unpleasant idea tom said  the redskins ways aint pleasant dave said well let us be moving up the first thing we have got to look for aint gold there is no doubt about that being here somewhere what we have got to look for is if there is any way out of this hole because it is a regular trap and if we were caught here we might hold the gorge for a long time but they would have us at last certain besides they could shoot us down from the top  they proceeded a few hundred yards up the valley and then stopped suddenly on a cleared space of ground in the center lay a score of skeletons some separately some in groups of twos and threes the remnants of the rags that still hung on them showed that they had been mexicans the two lads felt a thrill of horror at this proof of the fate that had befallen their predecessors  wall zeke exclaimed that was something like a surprise there aint no sign they made a fight of it they were just caught in their sleep and never even gathered for resistance well well what fools men are to be sure i shouldnt have believed as even mexicans would have been such fools as to sleep here without putting a guard at the entrance i reckon the redskins must have come down from above somewhere and so caught them unawares well let us be moving on     chapter xwatched   a little higher up the valley narrowed again the sides came closer and closer until they closed in abruptly in a rounded precipice down which in the wet season it was evident that a waterfall leaped from a height above  they didnt come down here dave said if it were anywhere it was near where the attack was made the sides slope away a bit there now keep your eyes skinned and see if you can make out any place where a man might climb up or down our lives may depend on it  just as they reached the old encampment dick said look dave there is a ledge running up behind that bush it seems to me that it joins another ledge halfway up tom and i are accustomed to climbing we will go up a bit and see if it goes anywhere  the two lads stopped as they got behind the bush  it looks like a path here dave it has certainly been trodden  the miners came to the spot  you are right dave said it is a path sure enough animals of some sort come up and downbears i should say maybe goats and lots of them like enough it is the only way they can get down from the top into the valley and they come down to drink  the ridge was wider than it looked being where it started fully two feet across the boys at once set off up it as dick had supposed it met another ledge running along halfway up the face of the hill from below this ledge seemed a mere line but it was really two feet wide in most places and even at the narrowest was not less than a foot two hundred yards along another ascent was met with and after half an hours climbing they found themselves on a level plateau from which they could see across to the three peaks the path was everywhere worn smooth showing that it had been used for ages by animals of some kind  one would almost think it had been cut by hand dick said who would have thought from below that there was such a way as this out of the valley the best of it is that it is good enough for the horses to get up as well as us well thank goodness we have found a back door to that place it was not a pleasant idea that we might be shut up there with the option of being either shot or starved  they would take some time to starve us dick nine horses would last us for a long time  yes but it would come sooner or later tom anyhow i shall feel a great deal more comfortable now i know that there is a way out  but the indians know of it too dick if as dave thinks they came down this way to attack the mexicans  yes that is not such a comfortable idea  well lads what do you make of it dave shouted to them as they approached the bottom  we have been right up to the top the ponies could go anywhere it is narrow in places but we have passed many worse on the way the cliffs never close up so even at the worst places there is room for them to get along with their loads  what is it like at the top  level ground along to the drop of the cliffs hills behind it to the south  well it is a comfort there is a way down into the valley anyhow since you have been gone we have been fossicking about and there is no doubt about the gold it is the richest place any of us have ever seed  have you found water dave  no that is the one thing bad we shall have to go out to fetch water but maybe if we dig in the center of the channel we shall find it the best place to try will be at the end right under where the waterfall comes down in winter there is most always a deep hole in the rock there where the water and stones and so on have come down and pounded away the bed rock we found where the gold comes from too there is a big quartz vein running right up the face of the cliff there it is just full of gold you can see it sparkle everywhere some day when the indians is all wiped out fellows will bring machinery and powder and will have one of the richest mines in the world however that dont concern us i reckon there is enough in this gravel under our feet to make a hundred men rich now boston what do you think is the best thing to do first  see if we can get water dave if we were shut up here without water they would have us in twelve hours so we have got to get enough for ourselves and the horses to drink if we can even if we have to fetch up what we want for the gravel when we have got water the next job will be to make a cradle there are plenty of trees here and we have got our hatchets and we have brought the zinc screens so we have got everything we want i dont say we mightnt pick up a lot in nuggets still i have got a dozen already making i should say over an ounce between them still the others is the real thing to depend on  and there is another thing dave zeke put in we must have a watch we had intended that but we thought we should have only one place to watch now we have found this track up the hill we have two  that is so dave though it is pretty hard on us having two out of five idle still we have got a lesson there boston said pointing to the spot where they had found the skeletons  aye aye it has got to be done dave said well lads will you take the watch today one above and one at the mouth and we will set to work at the water hole  we will toss up which goes up the hill again dick you spin heads tails it is  then i will choose the mouth here you go up to the mouths head  dont you be walking about when you get to the top dave said find some place where you can get a clear view all round and then lie down choose a bit of shade if you can find it when we knock off work and have had a bit of grub i will come up and take your place  it was just getting dusk when dave came up and relieved dick  are you going to stay here all night dick  yes we have agreed i shall keep watch here tonight boston tomorrow night and then i go on again zeke will take the watch below regular he sleeps like a dog and the least noise in the world will wake him so he will do very well can you make out the indian village across there from here  yes quite plainly  you have not been using your glass i hope dave said in alarm  no i forgot to bring it up with me but why shouldnt i  because if the sun were to flash on the glass or brasswork it would be sartin to catch the eye of someone in the village and if it did you may be sure they would send up to see what it was still if you can make out the village it will save us the need for keeping watch in the daytime down below it is from there we have got to expect an attack the most and if you saw them moving out strong you could shout down to us and we should be ready for them at night in course we must watch both places for there may be for anything we know a big village half a mile from here and the attack might come from one way or the other i expect you would rather work than watch dick so you had better arrange to change places with tom in the middle of the day then you can each work half a day you will find that plenty i warrant  did you find water dave  yes plenty of it enough for the horses and the washing too     chapter xihard at work   tom took the first watch in the morning dick rendered all the assistance he could to the men who cut down a couple of the trees that stood in the gorge chopped them into eightfeet lengths and then with wedges split them into boards which they smoothed up with an adze all were accustomed to the work and by nightfall a deep trough was constructed resting upon rockers like a cradle  next morning the work began two men threw the gravel and sand into the cradle the third kept it in motion while whichever of the boys was off watch brought water in two of the pails from the hole  the horses were no trouble finding plenty of coarse grass among the rocks and only requiring watering night and morning thrice a day the contents of the cradle were cleared entirely out and the gold that had sunk to the bottom collected much of it was in fine dust but there was also a large number of nuggets varying in size from a pea to a marble each clearup they obtained on an average eight or nine pounds of gold  the fourth day tom had come down from above at twelve oclock and found that the men had only just finished the clearup and had sat down to have some food  having nothing to do he strolled away to the spot where the mexicans had been massacred a short distance away on some ground at the side of the valley some three or four feet above the ground level of the bottom he saw a charred stump of a pole sticking up he went across to it  i suppose this is where the leader of the party had a tent or rough hut he said  he was confirmed in the belief by a number of bits of charred wood lying round the pole  it was sort of arbor i suppose he said to himself  there were several relics lying about two boots shriveled by fire a tin cup flattened by some weight that had fallen on it a pistol with its stock blackened by fire he called the men to the spot  yes like enough it is as you say dick but it is scarcely worth getting up to look at  no there is not much to look at dave but you have been wondering ever since you came that you had not come upon any of the gold they must have gathered and you said you didnt believe the indians had taken it away now if this was the hut of the leader of the party it struck me that it would most likely be kept here and that it may be buried somewhere under this circle of ashes  tom is right mates dave said that is just where the gold would be kept and there aint much doubt that they would bury it as they got it so as to prevent anyone from taking any of it till it was divided up let us fetch our picks boston and we will soon see if it is here let us try round the post first he went on when the three men fetched their picks it will be either close to the middle of the hut or else on one side under where he made his bed  the ground was sand which had been washed up by an eddy in one of the floods and they had struck but three or four blows with the pick when dave exclaimed  here is something boys  they had brought a shovel with them and throwing aside the sand they saw a piece of leather  it is a bag joe said this is their hoard sure enough  going down on their hands and knees they pulled up bag after bag each about fifty pounds in weight until they had a pile on the surface of eight bags  eureka dave exclaimed as he lifted the last bag out of the hole they had made something like a pile no doubt they were a strong party but even with that they must have been here a couple of months to have got this lot together well boston and he held out his hand we can go east again we have struck it rich at last  you bet joe said briefly  how much is it dick asked  each of them bags weighs about fifty pounds dick  dick looked incredulous and stooped to pick up one of the bags and was astonished at its weight  fifty pounds if it weighs an ounce and there are eight of themfour hundred pounds of gold think of that lad that is pretty nigh eighty pounds apiece i aint good at reckoning but put it rough at two hundred and fifty dollars a pound that is somewhere like two hundred thousand dollars each  forty thousand pounds dick exclaimed it does not seem possible  we aint got it to the settlements yet zeke said quietly them chaps had it and they lost it dont let us figure it up much till we get beyond the sound of the apache warwhoop  well i will go on watch at the mouth dick said and then you can talk things over together  do dick there is a lot more to look after than there was before and it makes one feel one cant be too careful anyhow we wont stay a day longer in this place we will be off tonight  dick went nearly down to the mouth of the narrow gorge he had expected they would find a treasure and although this far exceeded his anticipations he did not feel the excitement the men had shown at the discovery of the treasure he sat down on a rock and amused himself with the thought of the wonder there would be at home suddenly he heard the sound of a horses hoof and grasping his rifle stooped down behind a fallen rock a moment later a mounted indian dashed past the mouth of the rift he was scarce twenty yards away but dick noticed the eagle feathers of his headdress the rifle slung across his shoulder and the leggings decorated with tufts of hair it was but a moment and then he was gone dick waited a minute or two and then ran in to tell the miners they uttered an exclamation of alarm  he went right on dick said he didnt check the speed of his horse or glance my way  that is no sign zeke said the chances are that fellow has happened on our trail maybe a mile maybe fifty back and he has just been following it why should he be riding so close to the cliffs if he was not tracking us  but he didnt look in dick persisted  he warnt such a fool lad he knew well enough that if he glanced round and there was anyone on watch there he would have a bullet through him sartin  what shall we do shall we saddle up at once dave boston joe asked  we may as well pack the horses anyhow boston but we cant go till it is dark if a party like ours were to show up there they would see us from the village sure do you run up dick and keep a lookout with tom at the village you can crawl along if you like nearer to the edge and make out if that fellow is riding there if you see him go there come down with the news and tell tom to hurry down as quick as he can if he sees a party setting out we will have the horses saddled up by the time you are down again     chapter xiiretreat   dick sprang up the hill and as soon as he joined tom astonished him with the account of the discovery of the treasure collected by the other party and also by the news that it was probable that the indians would be speedily upon them all this he told him as he was crawling forward towards the edge of the cliff  there he goes he exclaimed when they neared it do you see him going up the slope toward the village how clear the air is dave says it is six miles there if it is a foot it does not look more than one  well i must go and tell them below mind tom the moment you see a party issue out from there you crawl back to the path and then hurry down as quick as you can but mind you dont tumble in your haste  that settles it dave said when he heard the news if he had been going to that village he would have made for it straight and not come along under the cliffs until he was opposite to it no we have got to fight thats sartin  if we were to mount that path at once dave we could keep them from climbing up if there were hundreds of them  that is so lad but we could not stay there forever and might be took in the rear by another party besides as soon as they find out that we have leftthey will do that pretty soonthey will be straight after us no we have been talking it over while you have been away and we have agreed that we must hold the canyon until it gets dark and then make off no doubt they know of this path but they wont think as we have found it out and they will fancy that they have got us sure like enough as soon as they find we are ready for them here they will send a messenger off to some village up behind us there is one thing he will have a good way to go for we have seen no break in the cliffs for the last twenty miles and maybe they go much farther anyhow we have got to risk it  i should think dick said that anyhow we might as well get the horses up to the top of the path ready to push on as soon as it gets dark they can do it easily enough in daylight but it would be a very awkward job at night  right you are lad that is a capital plan we will do it at once we have got everything wrapped up ready one of us will stay up there with tom so as to guard the top of the path in case any of the redskins should come down before we are ready to go forward three will be enough to hold the canyon  i will undertake the horse job boston joe said as you say three is enough here they will think they are going to take us by surprise and as soon as they find we are ready for them they will draw off fast enough i reckon that fellow has counted our numbers and no redskin will try to force that pass with five western rifles facing him  just as joe began to mount the path leading his horse with the others tied head to tail in a long line behind it tom appeared on the path high up and shouted  thirty or forty horsemen have just left the village and are coming this way  all right tom dick shouted back you are not to come down joe is coming up with the horses  we have got plenty of time yet dave said as soon as the string of horses had started on their way up it aint much past two oclock yet and it will be pretty nigh six hours afore we can make a start there is a good fire and we have kept down thirty pounds of flour we shall have time to bake that into bread before we start we shant have much time for baking when we are once off you can bet your boots  dick looked on with some wonder at the quiet and deliberate manner in which dave mixed his dough  by the way dick the latter said looking up we have divided that lot of gold we got here ourselves into five lots and put one lot into the blankets on each of our riding horses it is like enough that if we carry our own scalps back to the settlements we shant get any of the four baggage ponies there with us there is about twelve pound of gold in each blanket so suppose we have to let the other ponies go we shant have made a bad job out of our journey after all  have you filled the waterskins dave  we filled the five small skins we carry ourselves and one of the others we darent carry each of the horses has got two sacks of gold one of them has got the waterskin two others have got twenty pounds of flour each which will be enough to last us with the loaf we are baking here till we get out of the indian country the others have got the tea and sugar the one with the skin will be the heaviest load at first but the water will soon go so that makes it even everything else we have got to leave behind except a kettle and this baking pan we will take them up as we go now that the loaf is fairly under way we will get ready for the redskins     chapter xiiithe redskin   they took their post behind some rocks in front of them the bottom was composed of sand and gravel the only rock being that behind which dick had crouched close to the entrance  mind we mustnt all fire at once dave said one must always be loading and we will take it in turns to fire of course if they make a rush we must take to our sixshooters but they aint likely to do that i will fire first zeke you follow me i reckon they aint likely to miss either of us  another quarter of an hour passed and then suddenly a mounted indian appeared at the mouth of the canyon he checked his horse and sat gazing up it daves rifle cracked and the indian fell backward from his saddle and a sudden yell of anger and surprise rose outside another moment and a dozen figures appeared at the entrance zeke fired  now dick dave said a moment later and the lad whose rifle was resting on the rock in front of him pulled his trigger and almost immediately dave fired again another moment and the mouth of the canyon was clear another indian lay by the side of the first who had fallen  i reckon all the shots told dave said we could hardly miss that clump now i dont think you will see any more of them they know we are here and they know we are ready for them and it aint in indian nature to throw away their lives charging up a place like this they had reckoned the five first would go down anyhow then they will guess that we have got pistols and the redskins hate sixshooters like poison  the time passed slowly but the quiet in the canyon remained undisturbed  i expect it is as i said zeke they wont attack again by daylight though i dont say as they wont try and crawl up when it gets dark but i dont think as they will if there is a village up in the hill behind us they will send round to it and wait here till they hear a fight begin inside if there aint no village half of them will ride round to come down on us however they wont set about that at once injuns are never in a hurry and they think that they have got us safe in here and can take things easy if it is a long way round and they aint quite sure of the path like enough they wont start until they calculate they will get there at daybreak when they will guess that we shall be all pretty well worn out with keeping watch here  i guess that is about it dave anyhow we can push out as soon as it begins to get too dark for them to see us from the village across therethat is as soon as the sun has gone down behind the hills to the south  dave had from time to time left his post and gone to keep up the fire and to put a fresh batch of dough in the pan and as soon as a shadow fell across the valley he said now we will be off i reckon there is no fear of the redskins getting round for a time but i tell you that gold makes one mighty fidgety  six loaves had been baked and each taking two while dave in addition took the pan and kettle they mounted the path when they reached the tail of the string of horses dave hailed boston joe and a moment later the miners head appeared on the edge of the cliff above them  is it all clear  aye i have seen nothing of themneer a thing moving  well we will go at once joe even a redskins eyes could not make us out from that village now  the horses were at once set in motion as soon as they had left the path the cords were unfastened and the five mounted  which way dave boston joe asked  we had better make west it is lucky we shall have the moon for there is no traveling over the hills in the dark if you dont know the way anyhow we will make straight back at present or we may come upon those fellows riding round we will go in indian file i will go first with a pony tied to mine the two lads will follow then either you zeke or joe can take the last pony and the other one ride in the rear so that you can keep us well in sight and yet be far enough off to use your ears  for an hour they continued their course south the ground rising as they went then they reached a dip running west  we will follow this dave said it is the right direction anyhow and it is as likely to take us down into the valleys again in time  as they proceeded the dip became more decided and after two hours riding the sides narrowed in  we shall strike a watercourse soon dave said turning round to speak to tom who was riding next to him the water that falls here has got to make its way out somewhere and this is the only way as it can go not that there is much water for it is often months without rain  presently they found that the ground was covered with pebbles  there is the watercourse you see dave said  the fall became steeper and steeper and the ground more stony low trees and bushes rose on the slopes on either side  we had best dismount here dave said it is growing mighty steep and we may come upon a sudden fall anywhere and it is mighty difficult to judge about depth in the moonlight  the lads were heartily glad at the order for they had for some time been momentarily expecting that their horses would come down over the bowlders  i will go twenty yards ahead dave said you had better loose the baggageponies and let them pick their own way throw your bridles on your horses necks they will go a deal safer so than if you were leading them the critters can pick their way anywhere if they have got time and can look about  luckily the moon was still high and shot full down upon the path they were traveling even on foot the lads found it difficult to make their way down sometimes they had to climb over heaps of bowlders sometimes to slide down smooth faces of rock so steep that they could not keep their feet upon them and often it seemed so perilous that they would have hesitated to attempt it had they not seen that dave with his two horses kept steadily on below them     chapter xivin the ravine   the lads were surprised at the way their own horses followed sliding on their haunches down the steepest places and picking their way among rocks and bowlders six hours after starting they found themselves in a deep ravine whose sides were covered with trees they had now lost the moon and it was far too dark for them to progress further  we will give them four hours rest dave said that long halt on the path was worse than traveling we shall go three times as fast when we get light to help us as in the dark besides we have got to look for some place where we can double on them we shant find that till we are out of this valley we shall have to be pretty spry if we are going to get away from them they will come along fast when they once take up the trail it has taken us six hours to get down here it wont take them three well i hope we shall get on the move an hour or two before they do if they wait until daylight before advancing there will be a lot of hubbub and talk before they really make up their minds that we have really slipped through their fingers and arrange for a start still by midday we shall be having them behind us if we cant find the way to throw them off  id willingly take twenty ounces for my share of that gold to be paid to me at santa fe boston joe said  so would i joe there aint no denying it we are in a tight place and unless we find some way out of it in the morning my own opinion is that we have only got one chance and that is to leave all the horses behind us and to take our rifles and a loaf of bread each and to start back on foot  i should not wonder if we came to that zeke said but we will hold on for a few hours and anyhow before we leave them we will hide them bags possibly we might come back some day anyhow we could each tote along what we have got in our blankets it aint as if we were going to run all the way from here to the settlements twelve pound weight aint nothing one way or the other  no nor twenty boston agreed i vote if we do have to leave the horses we slip open one of the bags and take another eight pounds or so each twenty pounds aint much for a man to carry besides his gun and ammunition and a chunk of bread well let the rest of you lie down and get a couple of hours sleep i was off once last night  all right wake us directly you see a change in the sky we should give the horses a chunk of bread and a drink each before we start  it seemed to the lads that they had been asleep for five minutes only when they were roused it was but the work of a few minutes to adjust the loads again and to give the horses the bread and water it was still hardly light in the ravine when they were ready to start but all were too anxious to get on to delay a moment as soon as the day had broadened a little they were able to pick their way along on the comparatively level ground beyond the edge of the watercourse and the horses were put into a trot  if we can keep on like this joe said the apaches wont be up to us before night they will know that we have got nigh twelve hours start of them and though they may start off fast at first they will soon settle down into a pace that they can keep up all day  after journeying for three hours they came upon the spot where two other ravines fell into that along which they were journeying  let us hold a council dave said now what do you think had best be donepush straight forward or take one of these other gulches  they seem to run back almost the same line as that ye have been following dick said  all the better lad they will be less inclined to think that we have taken it what do you say zeke  i think we had better push straight on dave if they were coming along in the dark it would be a different thing but they would not go a horses length afore they missed our tracks and even if we muffle the critters feet they are strong enough to send a party each way  so they are zeke but it would be a sight better to fight a third of them than the hull lot  i think that it would be better to push on dave boston joe said there aint no saying where these narrow valleys lead they wind and double every way besides they are dry so i says let us push on till we get into one of the main valleys  well we will do it joe anyhow we may as well do as i say and muffle their feet the injuns will know what we have done when they see the tracks stop here but as you say they wont know whether we have gone straight on or turned up one side or the other i guess most likely they will think that we have turned up anyhow they are sure to divide  no further talking was necessary the blankets were all cut up bunches of dry grass were laced under the horses feet to form a pad and the strips of blankets wound round and round and securely fastened  now on we go again lads dave said setting the example and they rode straight down the ravine ahead of them two hours later the blankets were taken off and thrown among the bushes the rocks having cut through them they were useless any longer to conceal the tracks and they incommoded the horses a mouthful of water was given to the animals and they again started at a brisk pace the sides of the valley were now narrowing in again and becoming much steeper the trees had ceased and the bare rock rose in some places almost precipitously  the water rises high here when there is a storm zeke said you see it is pretty nigh closed up somewhere in front here  all the better dave said we can make a fight for it in a place like that and hold it till dark they cant be far behind us now stop the horses a moment and listen  a faint sound was heard  that is them dave said they aint above a mile behind push on till we find a good place to make a stand     chapter xvrifleshots   another five minutes they entered a gorge so blocked with rocks that had fallen from above that they had the greatest difficulty in leading the horses over them  it could not be better dave said we can stop them here zeke do you go on with dick see how far this goes and what the chances are when we get out of it if you can see any way of climbing the side of the valley come back and tell us then i reckon the best thing will be for you to take the horses down and go straight up leaving dick to tell us exactly where you have gone up then as soon as it is quite dark we will be off and follow you they wont be able to pick up the trail and will guess we have gone straight down the valley anyhow it will give us another twelve hours start  zeke nodded we may as well take the critters down at once he said it may be two or three miles before we can find a place where we can get out of this valley and there aint no use making two journeys of it  somewhat reluctantly dick followed zeke driving the horses before them  they had been gone but five minutes when he heard the crack of a rifle behind them  do you think they are sure to be able to hold that place  they are safe for some time anyhow zeke said as soon as the redskins see they are brought to a stand they will draw off and wait till the bands that have gone up the other valleys join them no doubt as soon as they had made out our tracks again they sent a kipple of men off to fetch them back but i reckon they wouldnt have seen them till they got four or five miles down and by that time the other bands would have been as much farther up the sidevalleys and the messengers would have a long ride before they overtook themten or twelve miles maybeand they would have all that to come down again so they would be pretty well four hours before they had joined the first band and in four hours it will be dark enough for dave to draw off  there they go again  shot after shot echoed among the cliffs the gorge extended for another mile and then widened rapidly a mile and a half farther the sides were clad with trees and the slope although still steep was zeke said possible for horses to scramble up  they will go up there safe enough he said five of them with nothing to carry and the other four aint heavy loaded you see them two trees standing alone on the crest there  i see them zeke  well that is to be your mark you will make them out plainly enough in the moonlight i shall be just down beyond them i need not tell you to be keerful how you go when you get beyond the shelter of the trees below dave will know all about that now you can be off back again  dick started back at a run and in less than half an hour joined the other three among the rocks  found a place lad  yes they have started up  i am glad you are back these fellows look as if they were going to make an attack on us they are about fiveandtwenty of them and i guess they know as well as we do that it will be dark before their friends join them however i dont think they will make a rush they will lose heart when three or four of their number get shot and weaken when it comes to climbing these rocks in face of our sixshooters now do you two lads keep below get down right among the rocks so that you can fire out through some hole between them and directly you have fired get out of the line for a stray bullet might come in  scarcely had the boys taken their position and looked along their barrels when they saw a dozen dark figures spring up among the rocks fifty yards away  two shots were fired by the miners and two of the indians fell forward then one after another the lads fired as they felt sure of their aim while at the same moment two sharper cracks sounded close to them for the colt at forty yards is as deadly a weapon as a rifle three more of the indians fell and the rest sank down behind rocks and opened fire at the position held by the whites these reloaded rapidly  now keep a sharp lookout dave said but dont fire unless they rise again joe and i will make it hot for them as they raise their heads to take aim  the rifles were fired but twice and then the fire of the indians ceased  i think we have accounted for two more joe said we shant hear any more of them seven out of twentyfive is a sharp lesson and the first man who fell was their chief i reckon and they will wait till the subchiefs with the other bands come up now the sooner the sun goes down the better there is one thing it will be dark down here an hour before it is on the hilltops  why shouldnt we fall back at once tom asked  because like enough they will open fire occasionally and if we didnt reply they would think we had made off and would follow us and pick up the trail where the horses left the valley we have got to wait here until it is too dark for them to follow the trail the moment it is dark enough for that we are off  it was just getting dusk when dave said suddenly  there is one of the other bands coming up they are a good bit away yet but i can hear them  dick could only make out a low continuous murmur that sounded to him like a distant waterfall  what do you think joe dave said would it be safe to make a run for it we might beat off the first attack but some of us are safe either to get killed or hurt too badly to travel they will talk for a quarter of an hour at least after they come up and by the time they find we have gone and got their horses over these rocks and got down to the mouth of this gorge it will be too dark for them to follow the tracks  i am with you dave joe said as he discharged his rifle that is one more wiped out he was just going to fire to see whether we were here still that has answered the question now let us be off go as quiet as you can lads and dont make the slightest noise just creep along until we are three or four hundred yards away you may be sure that they are listening  for a quarter of a mile they moved very cautiously  now i think we are safe dave said breaking into a run  at a steady trot they kept on down the gorge just as they reached its mouth they heard a faint yell in the distance  they have found we are off they will be five minutes and more before they have brought up their horses and got over the rocks and they will go pretty cautious because they will be expecting to be ambushed it is getting pretty dark now we shall be in among the trees before they are out     chapter xvion the return   the trees began fully half a mile above the point where zeke had made his way up with the horses and running now at the top of their speed they were among them before the indians issued from the gorge  the fugitives went on at a slower pace among the trees until they heard a warwhoop and knew that the leading indians had passed out  now throw yourselves down dave said and just lie as still as micethe slightest noise would tell them we had taken to the wood we want them to go straight on for a bit  in four or five minutes they heard the tramping of horses and a party of indians rode down the valley  there are over fifty of them dave whispered i expect the other two bands must have come up together now let us get up as high as we can as long as they are galloping they wont hear any little noise we may make but mind how you go lads dont step on a twig dont brush against any dead wood that might crack and mind you dont set a stone rolling  they climbed for ten minutes and then came to a spot where they had a view through the trees down the valley  there they are in a heap about a mile down joe said and the boys in the moonlight could see a dark mass gathered in the middle  they are having a talk over it dave said they know if we held on down the valley they would have overtaken us by this time and they know we have taken to the wood one side or the other i recken they wont think it any use searching for us tonight but maybe they will go straight on for a bit they wont know how long a start the horses may have had and will think we may have had them in the gorge and have mounted and ridden down yes there they go now we can move on again without fear of being heard  half an hour later they joined zeke who was with the horses a hundred yards over the crest of the hill in a line with the two trees  no one hurt he asked as they approached  nary a scratch zeke we have wiped out eight of them the rest have just gone tearing down the valley  well we had best be moving so as to get as far as we can before we lose the moon  that wont be till within an hour of daylight zeke said now which way shall we go  i think we had better keep along the hillside zeke we can travel fast here and can get so far that when they find the trail in the morning and follow us we shall be too far away for them to overtake us before nightfall  so day after day they traveled sometimes in deep ravines sometimes high up among the hills sometimes coming upon a stream and taking in a supply of water and sometimes wellnigh mad with thirst they had cut up two of the empty waterskins and had made rough shoes for their horses and believed that they had entirely thrown their pursuers off the trail winding along on what was little more than a goats track up the steep face of a valley the opposite side of which was a perpendicular cliff they had nearly gained the top when the crack of a rifle was heard from the opposite cliff which was not more than two hundred yards away although the depth of the gorge was fully a thousand feet looking across they saw that nearly opposite to them stood an indian village and that a number of redskins were running toward the edge  hurry up hurry up dave shouted it is too far for them to shoot straight but a stray bullet might hit us push on lads with the ponies we will give them a shot or two our rifles will carry that distance easy enough  the lads pushed on while the three miners opened fire there was but another fifty yards to climb they could hear the sharp ping of the bullets round them one of the ponies gave a sudden start stumbled forward and then rolled over the edge in another minute the rest gained the plateau  oh dick it is one of the treasure ponies tom exclaimed  that is a bad job tom which is it  the gray  better him than the others it was one of his bags that we took the gold out of to make us up twenty pounds each so there aint above seventy pounds lost come on let us get beyond range we dont want to lose any more when they got two or three hundred yards further the three men ran up  one pony has gone i see dave said  yes it is the gray he had only seventy pounds you know so if one was to go it were best it should be him  well let us mount and be off lads like enough those indians will have to ride forty or fifty miles to get round this canyon and come here but anyhow we may as well push on it is lucky the horses have done well the last day or two and that we have got our waterskins full     chapter xviiconclusion   another ten days of arduous toil and in turning a sharp corner in a defile they saw a number of men at work as these heard the sound of the horses feet they threw down their picks and shovels and seized their guns  dont say anything about the gold dave exclaimed to the others it is lucky it is all covered up  as soon as the miners saw that the newcomers were whites they lowered their guns  why where on earth have you come from one of them asked as they rode up  we have been making a prospecting tour among the hills  have you found anything  yes we have found a firstrate place but the apaches drove us off from it when we had been at work only four days and we have had hard work to save our scalps i have no objection to give you the indications for i will not go back again among them ramping apaches not to find solid gold there is the map as i steered by them three points are the three sisters and that tree bears on the mouth of a narrow canyon there is gold there you bet and likewise the skeletons of about thirty mexicans who got killed there three or four years ago now let us have some grub we finished our last ounce of flour yesterday and have been short for the last fortnight  you have had to leave everything behind i see the miner said looking at the eight horses  yes we had to make a clean bolt for it however in the four days we were there we got about seventy pounds of gold and we have stuck to that now you know as much about it as we do there is gold enough to make you all rich but you will have to fight and fight hard to get there and come away again  the horses were unsaddled and picketed dave and joe taking care themselves to unload the three packed ponies and that the flat bags over which blankets had been stuffed should not be noticed they stopped there for two days to rest the horses and then proceeded on their way arriving at pueblo a fortnight later thence they traveled together to santa fe and then hired a wagon and joined a large caravan going across the plains east when they reached st louis they separated a division was made of the gold and the lads started by train for new york and the next day took their passages for england  when dick reached home he was received by his family as one from the dead the northampton had arrived three weeks before and from the report mr allen had given they had slight hopes indeed that dick would recover from his wounds although the letter that tom had written three days after he landed had given them some slight grounds for hope the letter had been shown to the owners of the northampton and as the statements respecting the captain and the first mate were confirmed by mr allen and the third officer the captain and first mate had been summarily discharged from the service  the astonishment of the lads fathers when they found that each lad had brought home a hundred pounds of gold worth about five thousand pounds was great indeed with it shares were bought in the ships of the company and when in time both attained the rank of master they had the satisfaction of sailing in ships in which they held shares neither had any inclination ever to embark again upon the operation of goldmining    the stone chest   or   the secret of cedar island      the stone chest     chapter ia mystery of the

vessel near the coast the wind is rising to a perfect gale just listen to it sing  there was no need to listen the storm was so violent one could scarcely hear aught else the little cottage standing

grew dark and troubled it was an aristocratic face and plainly indicated that the lady had seen better days  yes he was here bob  and what did he say  we must leave on monday the cottage has been sold over our heads  tears stood in mrs cromwells eyes as she spoke  sold  yes my boy he said he could wait no longer he believes as do all in sea cove that your father is dead  perhaps he is sighed bob it is now over six months since the bluebell went down if he escaped in a small boat we should have heard from him before this  oh i cannot believe your father dead bob cried the mother bursting into tears if i thought that she did not finish  bob sat down to the supper table in silence he had little heart to eat and swallowed the food mechanically  bob was seventeen years of age bright handsome and fearless he was mrs cromwells only son and his father had been a sea captain  we say had been for the bluebell had been wrecked some time before and all in sea cove thought the captain deadall saving mrs cromwell who still hoped for his safe returnhoping as it were against hope  years before the cromwells had been rich owning four large trading vessels but bad luck had come and continued until the fortune dwindled down to nothing but the ownership of the old bluebell it was then that the captain had determined on a voyage to alaska taking with him a party of men who wished to explore the new gold mines in that territory  the bluebell was supposed to have gone down in sight of the coast and only two of the survivors had thus far returned  as time went by the little cottage a poor affair at the best was mortgaged to pay outstanding debts it was the last of the cromwell belongings  bob worked at the docks handling freight it was not what he had been brought up to but it was the best employment he could obtain in the vicinity  i dont see whats to be done bob said mrs cromwell during a lull in the storm we must move and i have only three dollars in all  oh i forgot he suddenly exclaimed and pulled a tendollar bill from his pocket here mother is a little to help us  why where in the world did you get that bob she ejaculated  a young gentleman gave it to meinsisted i should take it  what for  he said i saved his life  and did you  well i dont knowperhaps mused bob you see it was captain randolph sumner the gentleman who owns that splendid new yacht down to marceys he fell into the water right in front of the incoming steamer flag and i fished him out just as he was on the point of being struck he was very grateful and made me keep the money although i didnt want it and told him so  that was all bob said he was too modest to mention that randolph sumner had called him a hero and that the crowd standing by had given him a cheer for his bravery  ten dollars is a windfall began mrs cromwell now if wegracious the signal gun bob  boom  bob sprang up from the table he knew that sound only too well  boom  ship has struck mother he cried i must go down and see if i can help in any way  and waiting for no reply the youth grabbed up his cap and storm coat and rushed out into the storm  bob was righta ship had struck away off through the mist and rain he could see the colored lights and the flash of the gun calling for help  the lifeboat men were already out and getting ready to launch their heavy craft  look look the ship is going down  the cry thrilled everyone to the very heart it was true the stately ship was sinking fast down she went and came up again once twice and then no more  the lifeboat went out in a hurry but it was of no avail the storm had done its work and all on board had perished  no not all walking at the foot of the cliff a little later bob heard a low moan and soon came upon the body of an aged seaman jammed in between the rocks the man was fearfully bruised and did nothing but moan as the youth bore him up to the cottage  here he was made as comfortable as possible on a cot it was an hour before he was able to open his eyes  where am i he asked faintly oh the storm i was hit in the backi am dying i know it take me to mrs leon cromwell  at this utterance mrs cromwell and bob were both greatly astonished  i am mrs cromwell sir  you it is not possible  mother tells the truth put in bob what do you want  you are the wife of leon cromwell  i am said the woman  heaven be praised who brought you to me  i brought you to our cottage returned bob you lay unconscious on the rocks  it is the work of providence murmured the sufferer i was on my way hither when the storm overtook the mary lee iia drinki am fainting  water with brandy was brought and the man revived a little he glared strangely at mrs cromwell  i must speak quickly for i am dyingi know it feel it i was sick on board thats why i know the doctor said i couldnt live and the storm has only hastened matters i want to talk to you about your husband  is he alive came from mother and son simultaneously  he isor was three months ago at zaruth on the siberian coastwhere the stone chest was leftwemore drinkquick  again the sufferer had a relapse  the stone chest caused the trouble there was gold and silver and after the wreck  never mind the gold and silver where is my husband interrupted mrs cromwell  i was going to tell you we started forfor the man gasped for breath its my head we started for the coast when the people living there who had seen the stone chest got together andoh  the sufferer fell back in a spasm of pain from which it was almost impossible to revive him at last he spoke again  he was made a prisoner andwater or i diei cant drinkit is growing darkthe papers in my pocket are for youand may heaven forgive me  the man leaped almost to his feet then fell back in another spasm a minute later he was dead with tenderness mother and son cared for the body in one of the seamans pockets was found a packet of papers yellow with age  bob opened the packet and looked over the paper with interest an hour passed then the youth sprang to his feet  mother i am going to cedar island on the siberian coast and to fathers rescue he cried with sudden determination     chapter iioff for zaruth   to siberiacedar island  yes mother from what i can make out father is there a prisoner of some people called the svlachkys and all on account of a wonderful stone chest said to be filled with gold and silver  it cannot be true bob  i think it is this dead sailors name was ruel gross  ruel gross mrs cromwell started i heard of him before your father said he possessed a wonderful secret  he didabout the stone chest the whole truth is so far as i can understand he got father to go up there in search of it after it was found they got into some trouble with the natives and ruel gross abandoned father to his fate here is a handmade map of the locality  pray heaven your father still lives murmured mrs cromwell but you say you are going up there how  i dont know but ill find a way even if i have to go up on a whaler  mrs cromwell shook her head  on the following morning the dead body of the sailor was turned over to the village authorities  between them mother and son decided for the present to say nothing to the simple fisherfolks concerning ruel gross revelation  theyll sneer at usthats all said bob  but bob confided in his chum jack larmore an orphan boy of his own age jack was tremendously interested  say bob ill go along if you say the word he said im sick of sea cove and the mean folks living around here  all right  that noon when bob returned home he found captain sumner present talking to his mother  the captain had come to offer bob a position on his yacht  i would like to goif youre going up the coast said bob i want to get to alaska and then to cedar island off siberia  the rich yacht owner was much astonished he proceeded to draw bob out and an hour later had the youths story in full with mrs cromwell he looked over the papers and map  then he lit a cigar and began to pace up and down the parlor of the cottage  ive half a mind to cruise up there he said to me one place is as good as another i love to roam the wide world over and have already been to the south seas and to the coast of africa what if i should take you up there my boy  will you shouted bob in quick delight do it and you shall have the contents of that stone chestif we can get it  no ill only want my share of it laughed captain sumner  on the next day they talked the matter over once more the captain was a widower with one child a girl of fifteen the girl whose name was viola said she would like to go up the coast to new lands but she would like mrs cromwell or some other lady to go along  persuaded by bob mrs cromwell said she would undertake the trip and before they knew it all arrangements were made  the dart as the yacht was named was sent to san francisco for stores and three days later bob and mrs cromwell and jack larmore left sea cove and left it forever  it is not the purpose of this tale to tell of all that happened ere the dart put to sea on that memorable voyage up the coast to alaska  for awhile all went well on board but one day there was trouble among the crew the trouble grew worse and three of the fellows had to be put into irons  they were let go later on but ever after they showed their ugliness only too plainly  bob and jack were not idle while on board both did their full share of work and both proved themselves good sailors  a strong friendship sprang up between mrs cromwell and viola sumner and the two became almost inseparable  bob found captain sumner a fine man to get along with stern at times but always fair and square he had as he said been a great rover and often told interesting stories of his adventures  as days went by and they got further north it became colder then a storm was encountered which took them many miles out of their course  so suddenly did it fall upon them that the sails were blown to ribbons  viola sumner who was on deck got drenched and nearly drowned she was saved by bob only at peril of his life and carried down into the cabin nearly senseless  and now we find the dart stormbeaten but still watertight blown far out to sea  bob who had just come on deck cast his eye first aloft like the true sailor he was becoming and then around him  not more than half a mile distant towered an immense iceberg its topmost pinnacles glowing in the bright morning sun  other bergs floated to the southward while to both east and west could be seen long floes of rugged ice  the yacht was trying to beat to the northward by making short tacks through the icefloes but as bob could see she made but little way  have we done any good since i went below he asked bok a sailor who was steering  no faith yer honor the current sets so fast to the south that sorra a bit more north do we make in an hour than i could throw a cat by her tail its wearisome work yer honor and be jabers its bitterly cold  bob buttoned his pilot coat closer around him and shivered  you are right bok  hullo bob  our hero looked around and perceived jack larmores head above the companion  come down to breakfast before its cold cried jack  our hero made a bolt down the ladder after his friend  what is your opinion bob about the men asked captain sumner as bob took his place at the table i mean the rascals i had to iron up last week  well sir replied our hero they seem to go about their duty all right but after our experience we must never trust them  its that scoundrel nockey that i mistrust the others are more fools than knaves he will never forgive that flogging i gave him  it served him all right broke in bob when we gave them the choice of taking a couple of dozen or going ashore not one hesitated  well even now we have only eight hands and ourselves  what do you mean to do papa broke in viola surely not go further among these dreadful icebergs i have read that ships are often crushed by them  i should be only too glad to be out of these regions dear but with the wind and current against us i dont know what to do  as soon as breakfast was finished the captain went on deck his eye rested on the floe to the westward  where are your eyes you irish lubber he shouted to the steersman dont you see yon ice closing in on us you ought to have let me know of this  blest if i can see much change muttered bok  but i can the channel is narrowed by half we shall never get clear of it before we are nipped bout ship boys and be smart  all hands bellowed the mate  in a couple of minutes the small crew were on deck hauling in the ropes and halyards  the topsailyards swung round the helm was put hard down  the sails shivered in the wind as the yacht came about  put both the main and foresails on her leeks we must be out of this trap as soon as possible cried the captain  it took some time to get full sail on the dart  once done however she flew onward with the wind on her quarter at a tremendous speed  sixteen knots an hour bravo cried the captain cant she move bob  that she can sir but i cant help dreading this still going through the ice there are few ships except whalers that have penetrated as far as we i should think  right sir but desperate circumstances require desperate means none of us want to spend a winter here and though we happen to be fortunate as to the time of year another month or six weeks will see this sea covered with ice     chapter iiiamong the icebergs   bang crash  at that instant a shock nearly threw them off their feet  viola caught bobs arm and mrs cromwell and the captain almost fell together  we are foul of the ice shouted the mate rushing forward  what roared the captain wheres that rascally lookout down with helm the sea is full of loose ice  for the rest of the day the dart was dodging through hummocks of ice which looked as if a floe had been broken up by a storm  when bob came on deck for his watch at midnight it was intensely dark  a thin scud shut out the light of the stars and moon  he was joined by jack for the two lads usually kept watch together  i am afraid we are in a tight fix said the latter i doubt if we shall ever again find our way home  never say die cried our hero but look whats that yonder  the two chums peered into the darkness ahead  i think there is a blacker spot than the rest over the starboard bow said bob after a while  there are some blue signallights here ill ignite one suggested jack  retiring under shelter of the companionway he struck a light and ignited the blue fire  clambering on to the bulwarks and holding on to the forestay with one hand he held it above his head  right in front of them loomed two bergs not a quarter of a mile apart the sea dashing in spray along their sides  there was not a moment for hesitation  port your helm sang out our hero keep her so he added as he saw the bows of the schooner point for the narrow passage  jack lit another blue light and thumped on the deck to wake those below  in half a minute captain sumner and the mate were beside them  the bergs are closing in on us said the captain quietly go to your helm bok it will be safer  the bergs were more than a mile long and the vessel under easy sail was not making more than six knots an hour  here gentlemen take the halyards and rouse up the topgallant sails i wont trust the crew on deck till the last minute  with the assistance of the man bob had relieved at the wheel they soon had the topgallant sails which had been furled chockablock  it will be a narrow squeak muttered the captain as he glanced at the icebergs whose tops seemed quite close though the bases were yet some distance from the schooner  is there any hope whispered a soft voice in our heros ear  i trust so miss viola he answered see yonder is the end of the ice mountain on the starboard bow  but how close they are  they look closer than they are in reality he replied  all the time he was wondering if their end had really come  suppose the wind were to fail  fortunately for them however caught between the two bergs it rather increased in force than diminished  the icy tops seemed now ready to topple down on the deck  the waves running up the sides of the bergs lifted the vessel on their swell as they rebounded  fifty yards on either side towered the glittering mountains  thirty yards twenty yards and the salt spray of the billows which dashed on the icy cliffs fell on deck  violas hand was clasped in bobs and our hero felt some relief in facing death with her and his mother  call your comrades cried captain sumner to the sailor give them a chance for life come mrs cromwell viola bob jackall of you prepare to jump for the ice when we strike its our only hope     chapter ivthe escape from the icebergs   to captain sumner it looked as if the dart would surely be crushed  be prepared to jump he sang out again  but even as he spoke a strong gust filled the yachts topsails  she plunged forward  the starboard berg was left behind and the sea on that bow was open  bok instantly shifted the helm  the darts head fell away from the danger on the port bow  a few minutes passed  then with a crash as if an earthquake had riven a mountain chain the two bergs met  our hero who with the others was watching with breathless interest saw them rebound  huge blocks and pinnacles of ice thousands of tons in weight fell into the gap between them  before these could rise to the surface the ice mountains had again collided  a crunching rending sound struck the ears of our friends as the two monsters ground their sides against one another  the rugged summits fell into the sea and formed smaller bergs  the yacht was lifted on to the top of the giant waves caused by the concussion then sank into the hollow only to be caught up again by the still higher swell  but the danger was over  after escaping so narrowly being crushed the dart found the sea free from ice and made good way to the southward  however about eight bells on the following day a gale sprang up from the northeast which drove down the eastern floe in dangerous proximity  the waves rose and sheets of spray flew ever the fastdriven schooner  it was so cold that in spite of all the warm clothing they could find on board all hands felt numbed  land ahead was an appalling cry which rang out suddenly  captain sumner himself hurried forward  a rough rocky island the waves dashing in foam against its low cliffs was discerned through the flying spray  already the edge of the eastern floe was crushing itself to pieces against the projecting reefs  on the right or western side was a lane of broken water  to venture into it was very dangerous but seemed their only chance  bok and another sailor were at the wheel  over it went strained down by their united strength and the dart dashed through the breaking water  the western side of the island was about a mile long  twice by porting the helm the little vessel escaped clear of rocks over which the water spurted  as she approached the southern end of the isle bok who had been sent into the foretop shouted that again there was land ahead and that the passage between was full of ice  the captain ascended the shrouds himself halfway to the top  its like a cauldron he exclaimed on descending no ship except perhaps a very powerful steam whaler could live in it  there is only one chance for us he continued we must get under shelter of this island  as the south coast line opened the helm was put down and the vessel was hove to under a high cliff and jutting cape which protected her from the rush of the iceladen current  both anchors were at once let go  fortunately they found good holding ground  all the rest of that day and till dawn the next did the gale rage but as the short night passed the wind sank and by midday it was but a breeze  the current running between the islands soon swept the ice away  but before trusting himself in these strange waters the captain determined to send a boat across to the greater island on which rose a rugged hill of considerable height  both mrs cromwell and viola begged for a run on shore so the larger boat was manned by bok and three seamen bob and jack each taking an oar while the captain and the women occupied the sternsheets     chapter vthe arctic island   once on the island it was seen that the hill rose on its southernmost point  the ground was rocky and covered with deep patches of snow in sheltered places  i dont like the look of that observed the captain that is this years snow once the frost sets in we are done  finding it hard work to traverse the direct route they made for the western shore  here though they had to clamber over hillocks and steep rocks they got along quicker  suddenly bok who was in front uttered a shout  on the others hastening up they saw the cause of his astonishment  beached in a little bay with her topmasts gone and the hulk lying over on the port side was a brig  the water only washed her ruddercase and the captain noticed to his dismay a thin coating of ice fringing the shore of the inlet  not a sign of life was to be seen  we must examine her before we do anything else exclaimed bob  captain sumner looked at his watch  we can spare an hour he said but not more  there was a rush down the steep rocks on to the sand  arriving alongside for some time they could find no means of climbing on board till our hero found a rope hanging from the portbow which on being pulled seemed strong and firm  as soon as he the captain bok and one of the men were on deck which sloped acutely bob called to the ladies to say that he would fetch a chair or something to serve as one and hoist them up  to their surprise the companionway was not blocked with ice and the doorway was shut  it opened easily and our hero was the first to descend  an extraordinary scene presented itself to his eyes directly they got accustomed to the gloom  seated at a table some upright others with their heads sunk in their folded arms which rested on the table were the shrunken bodies of a dozen or more men  so lifelike were they that not until he had summoned up courage to touch one did bob believe them dead  some empty bottles and a cup or two stood on the table  they might have dropped to sleep after a carouse  if they had it was the sleep of death  remembering his promise bob looked around for a chair  not seeing one unoccupied he was obliged to lift up one of the bodies and lay it on a locker  within another locker was found a length of stout rope which seemed uninjured and accompanied by bok he repaired on deck and hastened to the side  the chair was soon rigged and mrs cromwell and viola were hauled on board  to prepare them for the ghastly sight our hero told them and jack what they would see  opening a door at the bulkhead captain sumner closely followed by the two lads and the others stepped into a narrow passage which had berths on each side  passing through a second door they came into a square room in which was built a clay and stone fireplace  the captain stopped short  a fire smoldered on the hearth  hullo cried the captain someone still lives  yonder lies the body of a man exclaimed viola who had crept to bobs side and taken his arm between her hands  dont be afraid he whispered we must be glad that we have arrived in time if indeed we have  the captain and bob advanced to the prostrate mans side  he was lying on a rug of seals skins with another pulled over him under which was a blanket  he lives cried the captain placing his hand over the heart of the unconscious man  after a minute a faint color mantled his white cheek and he heaved a long sigh  presently the eyelids trembled and a moment later he opened them  they rested on the captain who was stooping over him  a look of surprise came into them but they almost immediately closed again  a dose of hot brandy was given  this time he recovered considerably and looked round him inquiringly  you will do now my man cried the captain encouragingly try him with the food he added  mrs cromwell brought the roughly minced meat and soddened bread and placed a spoonful in the sufferers mouth  he swallowed it eagerly  after he had taken some halfdozen spoonfuls he turned his head on the pillow and fell asleep  he will be all right now whispered the captain but someone must stay with him while we ransack the ship  a second door led forward and leaving the watchers the rest of the party passed through it  forward was found a number of great casks such as are used to receive the blubber cut from the whale  she is a whaler evidently exclaimed the captain  in the forecastle there was nothing except some hammocks and a chest or two  we can get warmer clothing than what we possess anyhow remarked the captain now whats the best thing to do  we can carry the man back in a hammock suggested one i doubt it replied the captain what i propose is that some of us stay the night with him and we will return in the morning by which time he will be much stronger  on their return to the square room bob and jack volunteered to remain  this done bok was delegated to bring them some supper  on arriving bok first fastened to the rope the package he had brought which was drawn on board and then the rope was lowered again  be jabers but its cold it is he cried if i might be so bold i would jist suggest that we should go down below how is the dead man  he isnt dead yet replied bob laughing but he is sleeping still i hope you have brought something good for him  good is it theres a tin of soup and another of salmon besides a piece of seal that leeks shot while we were away  then there is a bottle of winethats for yerselves and the sick manand half a bottle of good rum which i hope i may have my share in  faith there is enough to make us as merry and comfortable as if we were waking the dead man below there     chapter vithe madman   taking the things with them they hastily descended the companionway  it was not without a shudder that they passed the many bodies  as they were preparing supper they noticed the sick man stirring  who are you he suddenly muttered  we are americans like yourself replied bob here have something to eat  the mans eyes glistened  give it mequick he exclaimed in a hoarse voice  jack who had warmed some of the soup brought it in a basin he had found with a spoon and a piece of bread  bob took it from him and fed the invalid slowly  more cried the latter when it was finished  not yet replied our hero have a doze and you shall have as much as you want next time  giving him a glass of wine they left him and in a few minutes his regular breathing showed that he slept again  by this time the joint of seal was roasted and the little party of three sat down together  what can that noise come from exclaimed our hero as he stayed his fork halfway to his mouth to listen  i heard it once or twice before returned jack but thought it rats  faith but i hope theres no ghosts here cried bok heaven stand between us and harm  bah dont be foolish its rats sure enough  it was not long after this that the sick man sat up to partake of more food  this done he told his story  he said he belonged to the whaler cross of gold which had been caught in a large icepack  this pack we attempted to cross continued the sailor by dragging our boats over rollers we had brought with us  on the third day however a snowstorm set in and continued for hours  knowing as how time was valuable after a rest we tried to make our way through the drifting snow  but after toiling for a long while we found ourselves back where we started from  the captain i and one or two others wanted to try again but the rest outvoted us  we therefore tried to turn the pack by coasting along it but although we ran over a hundred miles along its edge in a westerly direction never a lead did we come across which offered any hopes of getting through  at length we came to the end where it was joined on to another pack which extended to the south  this we ran along till we saw high land before us  but all the shore was a rampart of old ice so that it was next to impossible to approach  however we killed quantities of seals and saw many whales floating in the open water  we then determined to make once more for the brig and start anew taking an easterly route  but our luck was out we lost many days in finding these islands and when we did get back to them hardly had we got on board than the weather broke up  for days the snow was driven in whirling clouds all around us  the decks were covered feet deep  it was impossible to get out in search of food and we were almost starved  at length the weather cleared up and we with difficulty forced our way on deck  the whole view was changed  a sharp frost had set in and bound the snowcovered country with iron bands  fresh ice had formed round the brig  i dont want to tell of the horrors of that winter  some of us were mad i guess  but what of the men frozen to death in the cabin asked bob  well sir we had built this kitchen and the fireplace and most of us in an evening would sit here and smoke  but dinner and supper was mostly taken in the cabin where the big table was  it was the very bitterest of weather  food at last there was none except a lump of seal  it had been so awfully cold that none had dared venture out hunting  it was my day for being cook and as soon as the joint was done we carried it into the cabin which was warmed with a stove  well go on man exclaimed our hero for the sailor had suddenly stopped in his narrative as if some distant sound had caught his ear  beg pardon sir well in spite of the stove the meat was no sooner cut in slices than it was cold  i took mine back to the fire and rewarmed it  there was still a good supply of rum and i took a swig at the bottle and then whether because of the cold or the rum i dont know but i fell sound asleep in front of the blaze  i woke up numbed with cold  the fire was nearly out and the first thing i did was to make it up  then after heating myself a drop of grog i fell to wondering what had become of my comrades  i stumbled along the passage which felt as cold as the grave and there just as you see them now sat our capn and his crew frozen to death  the fire in the stove was out and the companion door open  i took up one of the bodies after i had recovered my nerve a bit and dragged it along the passage into the kitchen  but i could not restore it to life though i tried hard  so you see sir here have i beenheaven in mercy whats that  the sick sailor had risen to his feet  bob and jack had done the same  bok crouched near the fire with a horrorstruck look in his eyes  its the dead walking maybe he gasped  a muffled thump thump thump was again heard  a minute or more passed  then our hero again seized a brand and made a rush along the cabin passage  jack followed and after him bok  a glance sufficed  the body from the head of the table had disappeared  what can it mean exclaimed jack i dont think i am a coward but this is horrible  something in that sick mans face tells me he has not spoken all the truth we must have it out of him said our hero  but at that moment a mournful howl came from above  rushing to where their arms were stacked bob and jack seized each a rifle and made their way on deck not heeding in their excitement a cry not to fire from horton the sick man  on lifting their eyes aloft they beheld a singularlooking object gazing at them over the edge of the foretop  it appeared to be some huge animal though of what kind they could not make out  scarcely waiting to consider what they were doing bob and jack prepared to fire  a wild shriek echoed along the deck  stop that noise cried bob glancing round and seeing that horton had managed to ascend the companion ladder  bob had thrown up his rifle to his shoulder when the weak voice of the sailor arrested him in the act of firing  for heavens sake sir dont fire its murder nothing else  as horton spoke the object of his solicitude with incredible speed slid down the forestay and disappeared through the scuttle of the forecastle  please sir listen to me  all right only be quick and dont talk such nonsense about its being murder  with their guns in their hands and taking good care to shut the door both at the top and bottom of the companionway the two lads followed bok and horton through the dark deathcabin and passage to the kitchen lit up by the cheerful firelight  now say what you have to and be quick about it cried our hero i cant rest quiet when a huge wild animal is within a few yards of us though how it got there i cant imagine for i thought there were no such things in the polar regions  that animal as you call him is charlow one of our sailors he has gone mad  no more was just then seen or heard of the crazy sailor and the party retired for the balance of the night  when the captain came from the yacht he brought mrs cromwell and viola with him but left them in the small boat  bob quickly repeated hortons tale  we must capture that madman and bind him with ropes said captain sumner  to this all including horton agreed  the descent to where the madman had disappeared was quickly made but he could not be found  hark cried bob suddenly  a wild cry of alarm arose on the cold air coming from off the water  its my mother and miss viola crying for help bob went on  we must get to them at once returned captain sumner  the party were quickly on the snow running toward the small boat bob and jack leading  when they came in sight of the craft a scene met their gaze which filled them with horror  the madman had boarded the boat and was in the act of shoving off  terrorstricken mrs cromwell and viola shrank back on the stern sheets  stop stop yelled bob  with a snarl the madman bent to his work soon the boat was in deep water  in desperation bob leaped into the water after it  ere he could reach the craft the madman picked up the long ice pole and aimed a vicious prod with it at our heros breast  bob was struck squarely and on the instant disappeared beneath the surface with the shrill laugh of the crazy sailor ringing in his ears     chapter viia fearful fall   where am i where are mother and miss viola  it was bob who spoke jack larmore stood over him in the snow  youre all righti got you out of the water jack made answer  and the others  gone  gone in the power of that madman  yes  bob gave a groan and leaped up his breast hurt him not a little  where is captain sumner  the yacht has given chase look  jack pointed up the coast the yacht was disappearing around a distant point  but in a hour the vessel returned the captains sad face told his story he had been unable to catch the crazy fugitive and rescue his daughter and mrs cromwell  what was to be done night came on rapidly and they were compelled to wait until morning  at early dawn bob and jack commenced to climb a nearby hill of ice to look for the small boat  it was perilous work but they did not falter  at length they reached the level summit and glanced down  the yacht looked beautiful as she lay to with her topsails backed and every movement of the figures on deck could be distinctly seen  crossing some rough porous ice they came to the pinnacle  this was rougher than it had looked from below and they found not much difficulty in mounting  soon they reached the summit or rather within a few yards of it where there was a tolerably safe and level spot  with anxious speed bob extended the telescope which he had carried slung over his shoulder  for some time he swept the ocean in vain but at length far to the westward just on the edge of the horizon he caught sight of a white speck which could be nothing but a sail  look jack and tell me what you think he exclaimed  i can see it cried the latter after a lengthened search i agree with youit must be a boatsail anyway its too distant to be a birds wing it must be many miles off  lets make haste and descend cried our hero my chest where the fellow struck me is getting stiff up here in this rare air  most haste less speed  they had reached within twenty feet of the level portion of the berg when our hero slipped  his arm could not bear his weight and he half fell half slid rapidly to the bottom of the peak  are you much hurt old fellow exclaimed jack as soon as he could reach his friends side  only bruised i think just help me up  when assisted to his feet it was evident that bob had twisted his ankle or slightly strained it  misfortunes never come alone he said with a laugh we must get on if i find the descent difficult you must help me  a stream of water from the melting of the ice on the peak ran along in a little channel it had worn to where it came to the ravine  here it fell over in a cascade and divided one part now joined by other trickling streams descended the gorge into the sea the other flowing into the mouth of an ice cavern  the friends had crossed about half the summit of the berg when a sudden gust of wind forming an eddy blew up a cloud of ice dust  these tiny particles stung like needle points when carried by the breeze against the faces of the two boys  they had to stand still and cover their eyes with their hands  when the dust subsided they again hurried forward  at the edge of the ravine a fiercer gust than the first hurled up millions of icy particles  they glittered like a cloud of diamond dust in the suns rays  wishing to escape both the lads dropped on to the lower ledge  its worse here than ever exclaimed bob holding his rifle in one hand and placing the other so as partly to protect his face lets get into yonder cave  they both ran toward itthat is jack ran and bob hobbled after  the former had only just time to see that the floor of the cavern sank at a sharp angle when he felt his feet fly from under him  our hero arriving at the caves mouth at the instant of his friends fall was horrorstruck to see him slide on his side toward the edge of a dark abyss over which the water trickled  help bob cried jack in vain trying to regain his feet  our hero clearly saw the fearful danger of his comrades position  jacks feet were already over the edge  i am gone help he gasped  then with a stifled cry he disappeared over verge of the abyss     chapter viiia remarkable story   jack jack shouted bob  a sound as of falling rocks or ice blocks reached his ears but no answering voice  the echoes of the falling masses died away  bob was filled with dismay at the dreadful ending of his chum  he had reached his gun to him but larmore had been unable to grasp it  he shuddered as he thought of jacks feelings as he felt himself shooting over the precipice  there was nothing to do but to return  he found lame as he was the path extremely difficult  but at length he reached the yacht and told his story  its dreadful said captain sumner first my daughter and your mother and now your friend a young gentleman we all liked and i for one looked on as a comrade for we fought side by side against that rascally crew of ours  the captain was quite affected  when the dart was once more going through the water in the direction in which bob had seen what he took for a boat sail he came to the side of our hero who stood leaning on the afterbulwarks gazing at the berg whose southern point they were now passing  he was a fine young fellow he exclaimed and would have made a good officer  but what are you looking at  a seal sir said bob dont you see it lying in the shade of that block of ice on the ledge lapped by the swell  seals dont lie in the shadethey bask in the sun give me the glass bob  but our hero was already drawing it out to his focus  no sooner did he get it pointed correctly than he uttered a cry of surprise  thats his body he exclaimed at all events a mans body how on earth did it come there  a small boat was still towing astern  bob forgetful of his sprain lowered himself into her and grasped the oars while the captain followed  hold hard shouted the mate  our hero impatiently though he never for a moment expected to find his friend alive complied  in two minutes leeks reappeared and let down a flask into the boat  our hero dashed the oars into the water and the small boat moved faster over the heaving face of the ocean than she had ever done before  dont deceive yourself if it is your friend he cant be alive said the captain as they approached the body of the ledge  it is jack he added a couple of minutes later but how on earth did he come there  another score of vigorous strokes brought the little boat alongside the berg  hardly waiting to fasten the painter they rushed to the body  it was lying on its back and as bob bent over it he noticed a faint tinge of color on the cheek  hes only stunned i believe after all cried our hero  the captain unscrewed the top of the flask and poured a mouthful of wine between the teeth of the senseless lad  in a minute it took effect  jack sighed and opened his eyes  lets get him on board the yacht at once exclaimed the captain  first however he passed his hand along each limb and then felt jacks ribs  the patient winced at the last experiment and uttered a low cry  legs and arms all right muttered the captain as he with our heros help carried the boy to the small boat so if a ribs broken he must consider himself well out of a bad scrape  bob again pulled his hardest and when alongside the yacht his comrade with some difficulty was got on board  it was not until late that evening that jack was able to tell of his wonderful escape  i dont know much about it he said but never shall i forget the awful feeling as i shot over the edge of the precipice  of course i thought that i should fall down a well that penetrated right through the berg into the sea  however instead of that i did not fall a great distance before i came down feet first among a lot of pieces of loose ice or if not loose they gave way with me and together we went clattering down a second slope  all of a sudden i was pulled up by my rifle which was slung round my shoulders getting jammed across the passage  i tried to gain my feet but failed the slope was too smooth and steep  there was but one thing for it and that was to go on  i slipped the sling over my head and away i went again  then came another fall  this nearly knocked me senseless  i just remember another slide then daylight then a last fall and i lost all consciousness only coming to myself to find you leaning over me  how is your side asked the captain your escape was most wonderful another foot farther and you would have been drowned  it was as you say a narrow escape as for my side i must say its rather painful  however on the captain pressing it he came to the conclusion that no ribs were broken  it was bandaged up and jack was able to walk about thankful that things were not worse     chapter ixthe volcano of ice   for three long days the dart bore away northwest the direction in which the last had been seen of the missing boat  luckily its the right course to steer for the siberian coast remarked the captain as he sat over his wine after midday dinner we shall sight the high land tomorrow morning if not before  surely we shall come across the boat in time captain remarked bob  well we have had wonderfully fine weather replied the captain but after all she was but a cutter handled by a lunatic  and he and bob interchanged looks of despair as they ascended the companion ladder  bok go to the foremasthead ordered the captain take the glass and have a look around  the sailor slung the telescope over his shoulder and nimbly mounted the rigging  when he arrived at the topgallantyard he passed his arm round the skypole and adjusting the glass swept the line of the horizon  there was a long pause  deck ahoy  what is it bellowed the captain  sure there is a mist or smoke right ahead and above it i see what looks like the top of a mountain replied the irishman  nothing else  there is a low flat berg  nothing more no sign of a boatsail  nothing the size of a pocket handkerchief yer honor  well we must give up the search for the present and start for the siberian shore but i give you my word bob i shall not give up this hunt for many a week  the wind fell light and the dart did not make more than three knots an hour during that afternoon  the strange misty appearance still hung over the water  they were gradually approaching it and it was not more than a couple of miles ahead when as the sun set the captain and the two boys went to supper leaving leeks in charge of the deck  they had just finished their meal when the latter shouted down the companion for them to come up  an extraordinary scene met their gaze when they reached the deck  the yacht was still in moderately smooth water but a quarter of a mile before her the sea was covered with a thick mist while it was tossed hither and thither in tumbling waves which met and crossed one another in wild confusion  as they looked a thick body of smoke was belched from the midst of the turmoil  port hard aport shouted the captain round with the yards flatten in the jib be smart there  rushing forward followed by bok and jack the captain himself seized the rope and aided the sailors to execute his orders while leeks attended to the jib  bok was at the wheel  when on the new tack the dart was not a cables length from the boiling water  its a subterranean eruption exclaimed the captain looklook yonder  where he pointed from the midst of the curling waves a great black patch of what seemed to be mud rose above the surface  round it were thick columns of smoke which instantly shut it out from view  the wind chopped round and a fierce gust came laden with steam and smoke from the north  the yacht heeled over till her copper sheeting gleamed above the waterline  gasping for breath for a fearful stench accompanied the smoke which enveloped them all on board could do nothing but hold on to whatever was handiest  a rushing roaring sound filled their ears as the dart dashed onward throwing the boiling water in showers of spray over her bows  the men forward were forced to stagger aft  it looked as if the dart was doomed     chapter xthe escape of the dart   for fully ten minutes no one could tell whether the yacht would right herself or not  captain sumner aided by our hero and jack at length found the topgallant halyards and lowered the sail in the peak  we say found for the darkness was intense  then the gallant little vessel as if freed from an overpowering load came up to her bracings  once more she flew with increased speed through the water  a few seconds and the starlit sky again appeared overhead and the rolling smoke wreaths were left behind  heavens cried the captain never in all my life have i seen the like what a death to have escaped  as if exhausted with its own fury the squall subsided as suddenly as it had sprung up the smoke gradually blew away  and there over the starboard quarter some two miles distant lay a long low black island  look look yelled bob suddenly  all eyes followed his outstretched hand  there on the shore rested a familiarlooking boat containing three figuresmrs cromwell viola and the madman  mrs cromwell and viola were waving their hands then assured they were seen both fell back unconscious  as for the mad sailor he never stirred he was dead  it did not take the captain and bob long to reach the women folks they were taken on board the dart and after bob had kissed his mother and the captain had hugged his daughter and both were given food they told their story  when the madman struck bob i nearly fainted said mrs cromwell when i came to he had hoisted the sail and we were leaving the shore the crazy fellow was eating some ship biscuit which lay in a basket  when the madman had appeased his hunger he looked at us for some minutes without speaking  we were dreadfully frightened but he never once came aft to annoy us  he placed some tinned meat and water near us and then sat by the mast singing loudly and rocking himself backward and forward  viola and myself slept in turn but the madman sat in the bow looking out ahead hour after hour  when the wind rose and the waves broke into the cutter he reefed the sail and managed her wonderfully well  still he never spoke  a shower fell and viola and myself collected the water and had a good drink  another time snow fell  this also we collected and put into the barrel  time after time a fresh can of meat was placed out for us  but we ate very sparingly  i think at this period the mans senses were returning to him for soon after he spoke  he told us he did not know where we were but trusted it was off the coast of siberia and that we had every chance of being picked up  he said that his name was charlow and that he had been mate of a brig that had been wrecked but he had gone mad through misery loneliness and want  we had just sighted the coast when first the smoke from your vessel came into view  charlow was very weak but he altered the direction the boat was going and told us how to steer toward you  presently the yacht came in sight and we tried to get him to put us on board but he was too weak and just before bob saw us he breathed his last  such was mrs cromwells narrative and viola corroborated it  a happy day was spent on board of the dart i trust we are never separated again said bob to his mother  so do i bob she returned fondly then she gave a sigh i wonder when we will reach cedar island i see nothing like cedar trees around here  the map has but one cedar on it he returned it must have floated up here in the water and taken root in the ice even captain sumner cant understand that part of it  on the following day the dart again set sail for the coast of siberia  they were well into the sea of kamtchatka and felt that they must soon strike the spot mentioned in ruel gross memorandums if the old sailor had taken his observations correctly  if only we were sure father was alive bob murmured more than once  three days passed and bob was one morning in the foretop when suddenly he gave a wild shout  land ahoy  where away asked captain sumner quickly  for from the deck nothing but icebergs were to be seen  to the northwest sir will you let me have the glass  the glass was quickly brought and adjusted the captain gave one glance  ah bob look  the boy did so and then gave a shout that brought everyone on board on deck  cedar island     chapter xiamong a strange foe   it was true  far off to the northwest they could see the shore of a land that was covered with ice and snow  the snow was of a reddish color and the ice a deep blue  but this was not all nor by far the strangest part of the picture  on the top of a hill amid the snow there stood a large cedar tree  its heavy branches swayed in the breeze mournfully for though standing as if planted the tree was dead  for several minutes those on the dart viewed the scene  then bob broke the spell  do you know what i think he said  i think that dead cedar was stuck up on the hill for a guide  perhaps you are right returned captain sumner one thing is certainwe have reached cedar island as gross called it probably the ground has a russian name a yard long  let us waste no time in getting ashore cried bob my father may be waiting for us  at this the captain said nothing not wishing to hurt the boys feelings but the dart continued on her course and soon they dropped anchor in deep water but a few rods from the edge of the land  bob was the first to enter the small boat he was followed by the captain and jack and two sailors  the shore of the land reached they gazed around curiously  looks deserted said bob in a disappointed tone of voice but come on up to the cedar we may be able to discover something from the top of the hill the ascent was quickly made by bob but scarcely was the top gained than a shout was heard from below  savages  bob was right the sight that met his eyes startled him as he had never been startled before  rushing forward they perceived the yacht surrounded by a halfscore of canoes  two others were drawn up on the beach and half a dozen or more coppercolored savages were standing round the dingy  we must save our boat at any cost cried captain sumner  as they dashed down the hill the savages turned armed with clubs to face them  one was bending a bow but a shot from bobs gun broke his arm  jack also fired and the aborigines all save one took to flight jumping into one of the canoes  this brave chief for such he looked wielding a heavy club with both hands rushed at our hero  bob threw up his gun to parry the blow  the weapon was struck from his hand but the blow fell harmless  before the tall savage could regain his balance bob bounded on him clasping him round the body  but if our hero was strong the native was stronger  dropping his club he seized his adversarys throat and forcing back his head made him relinquish his hold  then seizing him round the waist he flung him at the captain whom he upset at the same instant springing into the sea and swimming after his companions  the whole affair did not last a minute  jack who had reloaded fired upon the overcrowded canoe  two paddles fell into the water and drifted away  no sooner did they clamber on board than they were saluted with a score of spears which stuck in the masts and deck one passing through the fleshy part of a sailors arm  here man go below and bathe it in brandy cried the captain drink some too the rest of you get under shelter of the bulwarks  i have heard that these fellows poison their spears and arrowheads he continued to our hero  will they come back do you think questioned bob  perhapswe must remain on guard  the next few hours were very anxious ones on board of the dart     chapter xiibobs discovery   night came and the hostile natives showed no sign of returning  a strict watch was kept until morning but nothing out of the ordinary happened  in the meantime captain sumner and bob examined the map with great care and also read and reread the papers ruel gross had left behind him  let us go on another tour of exploration said the captain on the following day if those natives come back bok can fire a gun to warn us  the boy readily agreed and they set off without delay  once under the dead cedar tree they looked around them curiously  a short distance further inland they saw a hollow which had evidently at one time been a camp  tin cans were strewn around along with a number of fish and animal bones  i wonder if father and ruel gross once encamped here thought bob  hardly had the idea occurred to him than captain sumner set up a shout  he was pointing to a post set up in the ice to the top of the post was attached a rude sign which read  to the svlachkys campone mile  hurrah heres a discovery cried bob shall we go on  yes but let us advance with extreme caution these svlachkys may be very bad people  undoubtedly there are or they wouldnt keep my father a prisoner rejoined bob  that signpost must be the work of ruel gross went on the captain the savages havent dared to touch it thinking there was something supernatural attached to itsomething to injure them  on went the captain and bob down one hill of ice and up another it was extremely cold but neither minded that  at last they reached a portion of the island that was very uneven great chasms yawned to the right and left of them it was with difficulty that they pushed forward  but they were bound to go on and go they did until at the mouth of what looked like a cave of ice the captain called a halt  listen he whispered i hear voices  bob listened captain sumner was right from the cavern came the sounds of several human tongues  they are not speaking russian said the captain perhaps we have stumbled upon more savages  hardly had he spoken when three human beings came into view  they were bundled up in furs in strong contrast to the other natives who had scarcely any bodycovering  the newcomers were jabbering among themselves at a great rate presently they came to a halt before a large slab of ice  they tugged and pounded on this until the slab fell to one side revealing a strangelooking opening  what are they up to now whispered bob  i dont knowwait  they waited presently the three men disappeared within the opening soon a smoke came out and they saw that firebrands had been lit to light up the scene  that may be the place where the stone chest is kept said bob  more likely it is a burial place replied captain sumner ive seen such spots before maybe theyre preparing for a funeral  cant we get a little closer to them  it would not be safe hark  from a distance they heard the mournful toot of a large horn  thats a funeral horn im sure said the captain if they are coming this way we had betterhullo look  the captain pointed to an opening to their left  a band of men were advancing  they were guarding a prisonera white man who walked in their midst  bob gave the white man one swift look and then shrieked out at the top of his voice  its my father     chapter xiiithe big polar bear   your father cried captain sumner  yes my father repeated bob in high excitement what shall we do  he felt like rushing forward but the captain restrained him  we can do nothing against such a force of men he said waitor he hesitated  what  you or i might go back to the dart for help every man on board can come heavily armed when these people see our number they may be willing to talk reasonably to us  thats so but i hate to leave returned bob they may do some harm to my father in the meantime  then i will go bob but mind keep shady unless they do something very bad  bob promised and without delay captain sumner started on the return to the dart  with a wildly beating heart bob watched the people who held his father a captive  they were marching along silently now and did not stop until the center of the cave of ice was reached  here the party assembled in a circle at a point where there was a slight elevation  two of the men had axes and with these they began to chop at the elevation causing the pieces of ice to fly in all directions  now what are they going to do thought our hero  presently he heard a slight noise behind him somewhat startled he turned around to find himself face to face with a monstrous polar bear  the beast had just discovered bob for a moment he stood still  then with a growl he leaped directly for the astonished youth  had bob not sprung out of the way the bear would have landed on his head  but bob moved with the quickness of lightning and this saved his life  the bear however came down so close to the boys side that our hero had no time left to fire at him  he struck the bear one hasty blow with his gun stock and then ran for dear life  recovering the huge beast came after him  although a heavyweight the bear managed to cover the ground with incredible swiftness  down the side of the icy hill went bob with the bear less than a dozen feet in the rear  the plain below reached bob scarcely knew which way to turn  the bear uttered growl after growl showing that he was working himself up to a perfect fury  i must get to the yacht if possible thought bob and headed in the direction without delay  on and on came the polar bear  he did not seem to gain neither did he lose  so far the race had been about even but bob felt he could not keep up that terrific strain much longer  as he ran he fingered his gun nervously  should he risk a shot  i must do something he said to himself desperately  and wheeling about he took hasty aim and blazed away  the shot was not a bad one the bullet struck the polar bear in the side of the head causing him to stagger back and halt  on went bob again and by the time the bear recovered sufficiently to continue the pursuit he was nearly fifty yards in advance  but the bear was undaunted and on he came as swiftly as before  once bob stumbled and almost gave himself up for lost  but he scrambled up quickly and was relieved to see the bear stop not being able to make out what was about to happen  then on went again until with a cry of terror bob leaped back  he had reached the edge of a swiftly flowing stream which ran between smooth banks of ice  to attempt to leap that body of water would be highly dangerous and to enter it might cost him his life  and now the polar bear was at his very heels     chapter xivthe finding of the stone chest   help help  why he uttered the cry bob could scarcely tell  he did not imagine that any human beings were within sound of his voice  yet it is natural for a person in mortal peril to cry for assistance  luckily his cries were heard  captain sumner was returning from the dart having hastily summoned bok leeks and the others  glancing in the direction he saw the polar bear and then bob  he did not stop to think but taking hasty aim fired  bok also discharged his weapon and hit twice in the neck the beast staggered back  bob now saw his friends and running up the stream joined them  with so many against him the bear tried to flee but a second bullet from the captains gun finished him  oh how thankful i am that you have come cried bob gratefully i thought i was a goner  dont waste time here exclaimed captain sumner these shots will alarm those people we left at the ice cave  that is true said bob come onwe must rescue my father  and he led the way with the captain at his side  it was a rough journey up the side of the hill again and more than once they had to stop to catch their breath  at the top a surprise awaited them  the band of strange people had disappeared  at first bob could scarcely believe his eyes  where are they  gone  but to where i cant see them anywhere  captain sumner shook his head  a telescope was brought into play but it did no good  captors and captive had alike gone no one could tell where  a consultation was held and it was decided to explore the cave before going back to the dart  the descent into the cold spot was not easy and more than once a member of the party was in danger of breaking a leg  the bottom reached they made their way to the place where the men had been at work with their axes  they had cut out a square hole two by three feet and six feet deep  gazing down into the bottom of the hole bob gave a shout  the stone chest as sure as i live  what cried the captain  he too looked into the opening  there rested what at first looked to the a square stone of a whitishblue color  but a closer examination proved that it was really a stone chest having two immense hinges of iron how had the object come there  i believe those people were going to dig it out when our firing frightened them off said captain sumner  let us see what the chest contains returned bob in high curiosity  the others were willing and by the united efforts of the sailors the top of the chest was pried back  a murmur of astonishment went up  the chest contained three iron pots one filled with silver and the others filled with gold  the treasure sure enough ejaculated jack who had come along with the sailors  there are thousands of dollars there said captain sumner  we ought to take the stuff on board of the dart put in bok taint no use to leave it out here  the others agreed with him  in the chest were two furcovered sacks and these the party used filling them up to the top  in the midst of the work a faraway shot was heard two more followed in quick succession  tis an alarm from the yacht cried the captain i told my daughter and mrs cromwell to fire in case anything turned up  without delay the sailors were sent off in advance  captain sumner bob and jack started to follow with the treasure sacks when a shout went up and a band of the hostile savages appeared at the far end of the ice cave  we must run for it yelled bob come onfor the ship  give them a volley first shouted the captain  six shots poured into the advancing troop threw them into confusion  as the treasureseekers turned to run a spear glanced over our heros shoulder and stuck quivering in the ground a dozen yards beyond  at the top of their speed they rushed toward the shore  at first they fancied they were not pursued  after going a hundred yards however a wild yell and the patter of feet told them they would have to do their best  encumbered as they were with both the lads partly disabled and the captain no speedy runner the savages soon gained on them  we must give them another volley panted the captain  though the guns chosen were breechloaders it took some little time to reload them whilst at a run  suddenly bob felt a shock which nearly made him fall  however he recovered himself with a stagger  the sack saved you gasped captain sumner but for that the spear would have pierced your back now wheel round and fire  as they fronted the natives they found that not thirty yards divided them  at that short range every bullet told  three men fell dead and as many were wounded  the captain gave them a couple of shots from his revolver before he once more turned and ran for his life  that accounts for about half them exclaimed our hero  as they gained the head of the beach jack stopped short  go on he gasped my side i am stuck  bob put his arm through that of his friend who had dropped his gun and dragged him onward  the captain turned and fired the remaining chambers of his revolver among the crowd now within a score of yards  the small boat was in waiting and into it they tumbled amid a storm of spears  both the captain and bok who rowed were stuck  our hero seized the oars from the hands of the latter and pulled with all his strength for the yacht  the gunwale of the little boat was almost level with the water  it was slow work  luckily nearly all the enemies spears were exhausted  an arrow pierced bobs cap and the last spear which was thrown again wounded the captain piercing his leg  fortunately the distance was so far that it only entered about an inch and fell out from its own weight  our hero and the captain clambered on board the schooner  jack was exhausted but still clung to his bag of silver  scarcely had they gained the deck when a yell broke from the dark waters around them and spears and arrows fell on all sides  every gun on board was now fired at the savages  yet they came on as if determined to kill every white person in sight     chapter xvbob rescues his fatherconclusion   the savages were pressing close upon the dart something must be done  slip the cable shouted the captain up with the jib topgallant sails and gaff  we must trust to weathering the point he added to the mate if we do we are safe the current will carry us to sea  his orders were executed  the wind fortunately blew from the southward and filling the light sails carried the dart off the shore  the yachts head paid off and answering her helm she with the tide in her favor bore seaward  a few parting shots and the dart now feeling the full force of the wind left the fleet of canoes far behind  the next few hours were employed in the dressing of wounds and making things a little shipshape  it had been a hardfought fight and everyone was tired out  fortunately neither mrs cromwell nor viola had suffered from the attack  long before the crew were able to do anything more darkness set in  bob was very impatient to trace up his father but just now that was impossible  anxiously the boy waited for dawn while his mother wept in silence thinking of her beloved husband  would they save him  at the first signs of morning bob was up and ready for the search  captain sumner and jack were not far behind  the dart proceeded slowly toward land  satisfied that the savages had left the vicinity the party went ashore and once more proceeded toward the cave of ice  a light snow had fallen and all former tracks had been obliterated  in vain they looked about for some trace of the svlachkys  let us go on an exploring tour suggested the captain seeing how badly bob felt  they started off first for the far end of the cavern  they had gone scarcely a dozen rods when the captain called a halt  someone is coming he whispered  a crunching of snow and ice was now plainly to be heard  the party ran for shelter behind a series of ice humps and waited  suddenly a man clad in furs dashed by them running at top speed  father  at that strange cry the man stopped as though shot  who calls he asked but instead of replying bob rushed from his hiding place  my son what does this mean how came you here  we came in search of you father replied bob father and son embraced warmly then captain cromwell turned swiftly  we must fly the svlachkys are coming i just escaped from them  he had just uttered the words when the crowd of strange people came down upon them  the leader started to throw a sharp spear at captain cromwell when bob rushed in and with one welldirected blow of his gun laid the man on his back  a fierce shout went up and a struggle ensued  but the fall of their leader had demoralized the svlachkys and when half a dozen guns and pistols had been fired at them they fled in dismay  after this the party from the dart lost no time in returning to the vessel  bob and his father walked side by side and never were parent and child happier  when mrs cromwell saw her husband alive and well she cried for joy and threw herself into his arms it was a happy time all around  captain cromwells story was a long one in brief it was as follows  when the bluebell went down he and ruel gross escaped on a raft and after several days of suffering reached the coast of siberia  from there they set out for cedar island  the island gained they found the stone chest and then captain cromwell was captured  for a long while the svlachkys held him thinking he knew of more treasures than those already discovered  at last however they grew weary of waiting and had resolved to put him to death when deliverance came as recorded  that there was more treasures was proven later on  the stone chest was taken up and beneath was found a cross of gold that was valued at fifteen thousand dollars  with the treasure on board the dart started southeastward for the united states  in due course of time san francisco was reached and here the treasure was disposed of  each of the sailors belonging to the party was given five hundred dollars besides his pay  jack received five hundred dollars also  the remainder of the money was divided equally between captain sumner and captain cromwell  with his portion of the treasure captain cromwell purchased an interest in another ship and today is fast regaining his lost financial position  bob is with his father and jack larmore sticks to the pair  captain sumner has given up his roving life and has settled down with viola as his housekeeper his residence is but a short distance from that occupied by mrs cromwell so the latter does not want for company when her husband and son are on the ocean  and here let us leave satisfied that in the future all will be well with those who have figured in the story of the stone chest
