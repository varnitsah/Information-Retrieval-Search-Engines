62393712	custom and myth   to e b tylor author of primitive culture these studies of the oldest stories are dedicated     introduction   though some of the essays in this volume have appeared in various serials the majority of them were written expressly for their present purpose and they are now arranged in a designed order  during some years of study of greek indian and savage mythologies i have become more and more impressed with a sense of the inadequacy of the prevalent method of comparative mythology  that method is based on the belief that myths are the result of a disease of language as the pearl is the result of a disease of the oyster  it is argued that men at some period or periods spoke in a singular style of coloured and concrete language and that their children retained the phrases of this language after losing hold of the original meaning  the consequence was the growth of myths about supposed persons whose names had originally been mere appellations  in conformity with this hypothesis the method of comparative mythology examines the proper names which occur in myths  the notion is that these names contain a key to the meaning of the story and that in fact of the story the names are the germs and the oldest surviving part  the objections to this method are so numerous that it is difficult to state them briefly  the attempt however must be made  to desert the path opened by the most eminent scholars is in itself presumptuous the least that an innovator can do is to give his reasons for advancing in a novel direction  if this were a question of scholarship merely it would be simply foolhardy to differ from men like max muller adalbert kuhn breal and many others  but a revolutionary mythologist is encouraged by finding that these scholars usually differ from each other  examples will be found chiefly in the essays styled the myth of cronus a far travelled tale and cupid and psyche  why then do distinguished scholars and mythologists reach such different goals  clearly because their method is so precarious  they all analyse the names in myths but where one scholar decides that the name is originally sanskrit another holds that it is purely greek and a third perhaps is all for an accadian etymology or a semitic derivation  again even when scholars agree as to the original root from which a name springs they differ as much as ever as to the meaning of the name in its present place  the inference is that the analysis of names on which the whole edifice of philological comparative mythology rests is a foundation of shifting sand  the method is called orthodox but among those who practise it there is none of the beautiful unanimity of orthodoxy  these objections are not made by the unscholarly anthropologist alone curtius has especially remarked the difficulties which beset the etymological operation in the case of proper names  peculiarly dubious and perilous is mythological etymology  are we to seek the sources of the divine names in aspects of nature or in moral conceptions in special greek geographical conditions or in natural circumstances which are everywhere the same in dawn with her rays or in clouds with their floods are we to seek the origin of the names of heroes in things historical and human or in physical phenomena 3a professor tiele of leyden says much the same thing the uncertainties are great and there is a constant risk of taking mere jeux desprit for scientific results 3b  every name has if we can discover or conjecture it a meaning  that meaningbe it large or small loud or bright wise or dark swift or slowis always capable of being explained as an epithet of the sun or of the cloud or of both whatever then a name may signify some scholars will find that it originally denoted the cloud if they belong to one school or the sun or dawn if they belong to another faction  obviously this process is a mere jeu desprit  this logic would be admitted in no other science and by similar arguments any name whatever might be shown to be appropriate to a solar hero  the scholarly method has now been applied for many years and what are the results  the ideas attained by the method have been so popularised that they are actually made to enter into the education of children and are published in primers and catechisms of mythology  but what has a discreet scholar to say to the whole business  the difficult task of interpreting mythical names has so far produced few certain resultsso writes otto schrader 4 though schrader still has hopes of better things it is admitted that the present results are highly disputable  in england where one set of these results has become an article of faith readers chiefly accept the opinions of a single etymological school and thus escape the difficulty of making up their minds when scholars differ but differ scholars do so widely and so often that scarcely any solid advantages have been gained in mythology from the philological method  the method of philological mythology is thus discredited by the disputes of its adherents  the system may be called orthodox but it is an orthodoxy which alters with every new scholar who enters the sacred enclosure  even were there more harmony the analysis of names could throw little light on myths  in stories the names may well be and often demonstrably are the latest not the original feature  tales at first told of somebody get new names attached to them and obtain a new local habitation wherever they wander  one of the leading personages to be met in the traditions of the world is really no more thansomebody there is nothing this wondrous creature cannot achieve one only restriction binds him at allthat the name he assumes shall have some sort of congruity with the office he undertakes and even from this he oftentimes breaks loose 5  we may be pretty sure that the adventures of jason perseus oedipous were originally told only of somebody  the names are later additions and vary in various lands  a glance at the essay on cupid and psyche will show that a history like theirs is known where neither they nor their counterparts in the veda urvasi and pururavas were ever heard of while the incidents of the jason legend are familiar where no greek word was ever spoken  finally the names in common use among savages are usually derived from natural phenomena often from clouds sky sun dawn  if then a name in a myth can be proved to mean cloud sky sun or what not and usually one set of scholars find clouds where others see the dawn we must not instantly infer that the myth is a naturemyth  though doubtless the heroes in it were never real people the names are as much common names of real people in the savage state as smith and brown are names of civilised men  for all these reasons but chiefly because of the fact that stories are usually anonymous at first that names are added later and that stories naturally crystallise round any famous name heroic divine or human the process of analysis of names is most precarious and untrustworthy  a story is told of zeus zeus means sky and the story is interpreted by scholars as a sky myth  the modern interpreter forgets first that to the mythmaker sky did not at all mean the same thing as it means to him sky meant not an airy infinite radiant vault but a person and most likely a savage person  secondly the interpreter forgets that the tale say the tale of zeus demeter and the mutilated ram may have been originally anonymous and only later attributed to zeus as unclaimed jests are attributed to sheridan or talleyrand  consequently no heavenly phenomena will be the basis and explanation of the story  if one thing in mythology be certain it is that myths are always changing masters that the old tales are always being told with new names  where for example is the value of a philological analysis of the name of jason  as will be seen in the essay a fartravelled tale the analysis of the name of jason is fanciful precarious disputed while the essence of his myth is current in samoa finland north america madagascar and other lands where the name was never heard and where the characters in the story have other names or are anonymous  for these reasons and others too many to be adduced here i have ventured to differ from the current opinion that myths must be interpreted chiefly by philological analysis of names  the system adopted here is explained in the first essay called the method of folklore  the name folklore is not a good one but comparative mythology is usually claimed exclusively by the philological interpreters  the second essay the bullroarer is intended to show that certain peculiarities in the greek mysteries occur also in the mysteries of savages and that on greek soil they are survivals of savagery  the myth of cronus tries to prove that the first part of the legend is a savage naturemyth surviving in greek religion while the sequel is a set of ideas common to savages  cupid and psyche traces another aryan myth among savage races and attempts to show that the myth may have had its origin in a rule of barbarous etiquette  a fartravelled tale examines a part of the jason myth  this myth appears neither to be an explanation of natural phenomena like part of the myth of cronus nor based on a widespread custom like cupid and psyche  the question is asked whether the story may have been diffused by slow filtration from race to race all over the globe as there seems no reason why it should have been invented separately as a myth explanatory of natural phenomena or of customs might be in many different places  apollo and the mouse suggests hypothetically as a possible explanation of the tie between the god and the beast that apolloworship superseded but did not eradicate totemism  the suggestion is little more than a conjecture  star myths points out that greek myths of stars are a survival from the savage stage of fancy in which such stories are natural  moly and mandragora is a study of the greek the modern and the hottentot folklore of magical herbs with a criticism of a scholarly and philological hypothesis according to which moly is the dogstar and circe the moon  the kalevala is an account of the finnish national poem of all poems that in which the popular as opposed to the artistic spirit is strongest  the kalevala is thus a link between marchen and volkslieder on one side and epic poetry on the other  the divining rod is a study of a european and civilised superstition which is singular in its comparative lack of copious savage analogues  hottentot mythology is a criticism of the philological method applied to savage myth  fetichism and the infinite is a review of mr max mullers theory that a sense of the infinite is the germ of religion and that fetichism is secondary and a corruption  this essay also contains a defence of the evidence on which the anthropological method relies  the remaining essays are studies of the history of the family and of savage art  the essay on savage art is reprinted by the kind permission of messrs cassell  co from two numbers april and may 1882 of the magazine of art  i have to thank the editors and publishers of the contemporary review the cornhill magazine and frasers magazine for leave to republish the early history of the family the divining rod and star myths and the kalevala  a few sentences in the bullroarer and hottentot mythology appeared in essays in the saturday review and some lines of the method of folklore in the guardian  to the editors of those journals also i owe thanks for their courteous permission to make this use of my old articles  to mr e b tylor and mr w r s ralston i must express my gratitude for the kindness with which they have always helped me in all difficulties  i must apologise for the controversial matter in the volume  controversy is always a thing to be avoided but in this particular case when a system opposed to the prevalent method has to be advocated controversy is unavoidable  my respect for the learning of my distinguished adversaries is none the less great because i am not convinced by their logic and because my doubts are excited by their differences  perhaps it should be added that these essays are so to speak only flintflakes from a neolithic workshop  this little book merely skirmishes to change the metaphor in front of a much more methodical attempt to vindicate the anthropological interpretation of myths  but lack of leisure and other causes make it probable that my key to all mythologies will go the way of mr casaubons treatise     the method of folklore   after the heavy rain of a thunderstorm has washed the soil it sometimes happens that a child or a rustic finds a wedgeshaped piece of metal or a few triangular flints in a field or near a road  there was no such piece of metal there were no such flints lying there yesterday and the finder is puzzled about the origin of the objects on which he has lighted  he carries them home and the village wisdom determines that the wedgeshaped piece of metal is a thunderbolt or that the bits of flint are elfshots the heads of fairy arrows  such things are still treasured in remote nooks of england and the thunderbolt is applied to cure certain maladies by its touch  as for the fairy arrows we know that even in ancient etruria they were looked on as magical for we sometimes see their points set as amulets in the gold of etruscan necklaces  in perugia the arrowheads are still sold as charms  all educated people of course have long been aware that the metal wedge is a celt or ancient bronze axehead and that it was not fairies but the forgotten peoples of this island who used the arrows with the tips of flint  thunder is only so far connected with them that the heavy rains loosen the surface soil and lay bare its long hidden secrets  there is a science archaeology which collects and compares the material relics of old races the axes and arrowheads  there is a form of study folklore which collects and compares the similar but immaterial relics of old races the surviving superstitions and stories the ideas which are in our time but not of it  properly speaking folklore is only concerned with the legends customs beliefs of the folk of the people of the classes which have least been altered by education which have shared least in progress  but the student of folklore soon finds that these unprogressive classes retain many of the beliefs and ways of savages just as the hebridean people use spindlewhorls of stone and bake clay pots without the aid of the wheel like modern south sea islanders or like their own prehistoric ancestors 11a  the student of folklore is thus led to examine the usages myths and ideas of savages which are still retained in rude enough shape by the european peasantry  lastly he observes that a few similar customs and ideas survive in the most conservative elements of the life of educated peoples in ritual ceremonial and religious traditions and myths though such remains are rare in england we may note the custom of leading the dead soldiers horse behind his master to the grave a relic of days when the horse would have been sacrificed 11b  we may observe the persistence of the ceremony by which the monarch at his coronation takes his seat on the sacred stone of scone probably an ancient fetich stone  not to speak here of our own religious traditions the old vein of savage rite and belief is found very near the surface of ancient greek religion  it needs but some stress of circumstance something answering to the storm shower that reveals the flint arrowheads to bring savage ritual to the surface of classical religion  in sore need a human victim was only too likely to be demanded while a feastday or a mystery set the greeks dancing serpentdances or beardances like red indians or swimming with sacred pigs or leaping about in imitation of wolves or holding a dogfeast and offering dogs flesh to the gods 12  thus the student of folklore soon finds that he must enlarge his field and examine not only popular european story and practice but savage ways and ideas and the myths and usages of the educated classes in civilised races  in this extended sense the term folklore will frequently be used in the following essays  the idea of the writer is that mythology cannot fruitfully be studied apart from folklore while some knowledge of anthropology is required in both sciences  the science of folklore if we may call it a science finds everywhere close to the surface of civilised life the remains of ideas as old as the stone elfshots older than the celt of bronze  in proverbs and riddles and nursery tales and superstitions we detect the relics of a stage of thought which is dying out in europe but which still exists in many parts of the world  now just as the flint arrowheads are scattered everywhere in all the continents and isles and everywhere are much alike and bear no very definite marks of the special influence of race so it is with the habits and legends investigated by the student of folklore  the stone arrowhead buried in a scottish cairn is like those which were interred with algonquin chiefs  the flints found in egyptian soil or beside the tumulus on the plain of marathon nearly resemble the stones which tip the reed arrow of the modern samoyed  perhaps only a skilled experience could discern in a heap of such arrowheads the specimens which are found in america or africa from those which are unearthed in europe  even in the products of more advanced industry we see early pottery for example so closely alike everywhere that in the british museum mexican vases have ere now been mixed up on the same shelf with archaic vessels from greece  in the same way if a superstition or a riddle were offered to a student of folklore he would have much difficulty in guessing its provenance and naming the race from which it was brought  suppose you tell a folklorist that in a certain country when anyone sneezes people say good luck to you the student cannot say a priori what country you refer to what race you have in your thoughts  it may be florida as florida was when first discovered it may be zululand or west africa or ancient rome or homeric greece or palestine  in all these and many other regions the sneeze was welcomed as an auspicious omen  the little superstition is as widely distributed as the flint arrowheads  just as the object and use of the arrowheads became intelligible when we found similar weapons in actual use among savages so the salutation to the sneezer becomes intelligible when we learn that the savage has a good reason for it  he thinks the sneeze expels an evil spirit  proverbs again and riddles are as universally scattered and the wolufs puzzle over the same devinettes as the scotch schoolboy or the breton peasant  thus for instance the wolufs of senegal ask each other what flies for ever and rests neveranswer the wind  who are the comrades that always fight and never hurt each otherthe teeth  in france as we read in the recueil de calembours the people ask what runs faster than a horse crosses water and is not wetanswer the sun  the samoans put the riddle a man who stands between two ravenous fishesanswer the tongue between the teeth  again there are twenty brothers each with a hat on his headanswer fingers and toes with nails for hats  this is like the french un pere a douze filslan  a comparison of m rollands devinettes with the woluf conundrums of boilat the samoan examples in turners samoa and the scotch enigmas collected by chambers will show the identity of peasant and savage humour  a few examples less generally known may be given to prove that the beliefs of folklore are not peculiar to any one race or stock of men  the first case is remarkable it occurs in mexico and ceylonnor are we aware that it is found elsewhere  in macmillans magazine 15 is published a paper by mrs edwards called the mystery of the pezazi the events described in this narrative occurred on august 28 1876 in a bungalow some thirty miles from badiella  the narrator occupied a new house on an estate called allagalla  her native servants soon asserted that the place was haunted by a pezazi  the english visitors saw and heard nothing extraordinary till a certain night an abridged account of what happened then may be given in the words of mrs edwards     wrapped in dreams i lay on the night in question tranquilly sleeping    but gradually roused to a perception that discordant sounds disturbed    the serenity of my slumber  loth to stir i still dozed on the    sounds however becoming as it seemed more determined to make    themselves heard and i awoke to the consciousness that they proceeded    from a belt of adjacent jungle and resembled the noise that would be    produced by some person felling timber     shutting my ears to the disturbance i made no sign until with an    expression of impatience e suddenly started up when i laid a    detaining grasp upon his arm murmuring that there was no need to    think of rising at presentit must be quite early and the kitchen    cooly was doubtless cutting firewood in good time  e responded    in a tone of slight contempt that no one could be cutting firewood    at that hour and the sounds were more suggestive of felling jungle    and he then inquired how long i had been listening to them  now    thoroughly aroused i replied that i had heard the sounds for some    time at first confusing them with my dreams but soon sufficiently    awakening to the fact that they were no mere phantoms of my    imagination but a reality  during our conversation the noises became    more distinct and loud blow after blow resounded as of the axe    descending upon the tree followed by the crash of the falling timber    renewed blows announced the repetition of the operations on another    tree and continued till several were devastated  it is unnecessary to tell more of the tale  in spite of minute examinations and close search no solution of the mystery of the noises on this or any other occasion was ever found  the natives of course attributed the disturbance to the pezazi or goblin  no one perhaps has asserted that the aztecs were connected by ties of race with the people of ceylon  yet when the spaniards conquered mexico and when sahagun one of the earliest missionaries collected the legends of the people he found them like the cingalese strong believers in the mystic treefelling  we translate sahaguns account of the midnight axe     when so any man heareth the sound of strokes in the night as if one    were felling trees he reckons it an evil boding  and this sound they    call youaltepuztli youalli night and tepuztli copper which    signifies the midnight hatchet  this noise cometh about the time of    the first sleep when all men slumber soundly and the night is still    the sound of strokes smitten was first noted by the templeservants    called tlamacazque at the hour when they go in the night to make    their offering of reeds or of boughs of pine for so was their custom    and this penance they did on the neighbouring hills and that when the    night was far spent  whenever they heard such a sound as one makes    when he splits wood with an axe a noise that may be heard afar off    they drew thence an omen of evil and were afraid and said that the    sounds were part of the witchery of tezeatlipoca that often thus    dismayeth men who journey in the night  now when tidings of these    things came to a certain brave man one exercised in war he drew    near being guided by the sound till he came to the very cause of the    hubbub  and when he came upon it with difficulty he caught it for    the thing was hard to catch natheless at last he overtook that which    ran before him and behold it was a man without a heart and on    either side of the chest two holes that opened and shut and so made    the noise  then the man put his hand within the breast of the figure    and grasped the breast and shook it hard demanding some grace or    gift  as a rule the grace demanded was power to make captives in war  the curious coincidence of the midnight axe occurring in lands so remote as ceylon and mexico and the singular attestation by an english lady of the actual existence of the disturbance makes this youaltepuztli one of the quaintest things in the province of the folklorist  but whatever the cause of the noise or of the beliefs connected with the noise may be no one would explain them as the result of community of race between cingalese and aztecs  nor would this explanation be offered to account for the aztec and english belief that the creaking of furniture is an omen of death in a house  obviously these opinions are the expression of a common state of superstitious fancy not the signs of an original community of origin  let us take another piece of folklore  all northcountry english folk know the kernababy  the custom of the kernababy is commonly observed in england or at all events in scotland where the writer has seen many a kernababy  the last gleanings of the last field are bound up in a rude imitation of the human shape and dressed in some tagrags of finery  the usage has fallen into the conservative hands of children but of old the maiden was a regular image of the harvest goddess which with a sickle and sheaves in her arms attended by a crowd of reapers and accompanied with music followed the last carts home to the farm 18  it is odd enough that the maiden should exactly translate greek the old sicilian name of the daughter of demeter  the maiden has dwindled then among us to the rudimentary kernababy but ancient peru had her own maiden her harvest goddess  here it is easy to trace the natural idea at the basis of the superstitious practice which links the shores of the pacific with our own northern coast  just as a portion of the yulelog and of the christmas bread were kept all the year through a kind of nestegg of plenteous food and fire so the kernababy english or peruvian is an earnest that corn will not fail all through the year till next harvest comes  for this reason the kernababy used to be treasured from autumns end to autumns end though now it commonly disappears very soon after the harvest home  it is thus that acosta describes in grimstons old translation 1604 the peruvian kernababy and the peruvian harvest home     this feast is made comming from the chacra or farme unto the house    saying certaine songs and praying that the mays maize may long    continue the which they call mama cora  what a chance this word offers to etymologists of the old school how promptly they would recognise in mama mothergreek and in coragreek the mother and the maiden the feast of demeter and persephone  however the days of that old school of antiquarianism are numbered  to return to the peruvian harvest home     they take a certaine portion of the most fruitefull of the mays that    growes in their farmes the which they put in a certaine granary which    they do calle pirua with certaine ceremonies watching three nightes    they put this mays in the richest garments they have and being thus    wrapped and dressed they worship this pirua and hold it in great    veneration saying it is the mother of the mays of their inheritances    and that by this means the mays augments and is preserved  in this    moneth they make a particular sacrifice and the witches demand of    this pirua if it hath strength sufficient to continue until the next    yeare and if it answers no then they carry this mays to the farme    to burne whence they brought it according to every mans power then    they make another pirua with the same ceremonies saying that they    renue it to the ende that the seede of the mays may not perish  the idea that the maize can speak need not surprise us the mexican held much the same belief according to sahagun     it was thought that if some grains of maize fell on the ground he who    saw them lying there was bound to lift them wherein if he failed he    harmed the maize which plained itself of him to god saying lord    punish this man who saw me fallen and raised me not again punish him    with famine that he may learn not to hold me in dishonour  well in all this affair of the scotch kernababy and the peruvian mama cora we need no explanation beyond the common simple ideas of human nature  we are not obliged to hold either that the peruvians and scotch are akin by blood nor that at some forgotten time they met each other and borrowed each others superstitions  again when we find odysseus sacrificing a black sheep to the dead 20 and when we read that the ovahereroes in south africa also appease with a black sheep the spirits of the departed we do not feel it necessary to hint that the ovahereroes are of greek descent or have borrowed their ritual from the greeks  the connection between the colour black and mourning for the dead is natural and almost universal  examples like these might be adduced in any number  we might show how in magic negroes of barbadoes make clay effigies of their enemies and pierce them just as greeks did in platos time or the men of accad in remotest antiquity  we might remark the australian black putting sharp bits of quartz in the tracks of an enemy who has gone by that the enemy may be lamed and we might point to boris godunof forbidding the same practice among the russians  we might watch scotch and australians and jews and french and aztecs spreading dust round the body of a dead man that the footprints of his ghost or of other ghosts may be detected next morning  we might point to a similar device in a modern novel where the presence of a ghost is suspected as proof of the similar workings of the australian mind and of the mind of mrs riddell  we shall later turn to ancient greece and show how the serpentdances the habit of smearing the body with clay and other odd rites of the mysteries were common to hellenic religion and to the religion of african australian and american tribes  now with regard to all these strange usages what is the method of folklore  the method is when an apparently irrational and anomalous custom is found in any country to look for a country where a similar practice is found and where the practice is no longer irrational and anomalous but in harmony with the manners and ideas of the people among whom it prevails  that greeks should dance about in their mysteries with harmless serpents in their hands looks quite unintelligible  when a wild tribe of red indians does the same thing as a trial of courage with real rattlesnakes we understand the red mans motives and may conjecture that similar motives once existed among the ancestors of the greeks  our method then is to compare the seemingly meaningless customs or manners of civilised races with the similar customs and manners which exist among the uncivilised and still retain their meaning it is not necessary for comparison of this sort that the uncivilised and the civilised race should be of the same stock nor need we prove that they were ever in contact with each other  similar conditions of mind produce similar practices apart from identity of race or borrowing of ideas and manners  let us return to the example of the flint arrowheads  everywhere neolithic arrowheads are pretty much alike  the cause of the resemblance is no more than this that men with the same needs the same materials and the same rude instruments everywhere produced the same kind of arrowhead  no hypothesis of interchange of ideas nor of community of race is needed to explain the resemblance of form in the missiles  very early pottery in any region is for the same causes like very early pottery in any other region  the same sort of similarity was explained by the same resemblances in human nature when we touched on the identity of magical practices and of superstitious beliefs  this method is fairly well established and orthodox when we deal with usages and superstitious beliefs but may we apply the same method when we deal with myths  here a difficulty occurs  mythologists as a rule are averse to the method of folklore  they think it scientific to compare only the myths of races which speak languages of the same family and of races which have in historic times been actually in proved contact with each other thus most mythologists hold it correct to compare greek slavonic celtic and indian stories because greeks slavs celts and hindoos all speak languages of the same family  again they hold it correct to compare chaldaean and greek myths because the greeks and the chaldaeans were brought into contact through the phoenicians and by other intermediaries such as the hittites  but the same mythologists will vow that it is unscientific to compare a maori or a hottentot or an eskimo myth with an aryan story because maoris and eskimo and hottentots do not speak languages akin to that of greece nor can we show that the ancestors of greeks maoris hottentots and eskimo were ever in contact with each other in historical times  now the peculiarity of the method of folklore is that it will venture to compare with due caution and due examination of evidence the myths of the most widely severed races  holding that myth is a product of the early human fancy working on the most rudimentary knowledge of the outer world the student of folklore thinks that differences of race do not much affect the early mythopoeic faculty  he will not be surprised if greeks and australian blacks are in the same tale  in each case he holds all the circumstances of the case must be examined and considered  for instance when the australians tell a myth about the pleiades very like the greek myth of the pleiades we must ask a number of questions  is the australian version authentic  can the people who told it have heard it from a european  if these questions are answered so as to make it apparent that the australian pleiad myth is of genuine native origin we need not fly to the conclusion that the australians are a lost and forlorn branch of the aryan race  two other hypotheses present themselves  first the human species is of unknown antiquity  in the moderate allowance of 250000 years there is time for stories to have wandered all round the world as the aggry beads of ashanti have probably crossed the continent from egypt as the asiatic jade if asiatic it be has arrived in swiss lakedwellings as an african tradecowry is said to have been found in a cornish barrow as an indian ocean shell has been discovered in a prehistoric bonecave in poland  this slow filtration of tales is not absolutely out of the question  two causes would especially help to transmit myths  the first is slavery and slavestealing the second is the habit of capturing brides from alien stocks and the law which forbids marriage with a woman of a mans own family  slaves and captured brides would bring their native legends among alien peoples  but there is another possible way of explaining the resemblance granting that it is proved of the greek and australian pleiad myth  the object of both myths is to account for the grouping and other phenomena of the constellations  may not similar explanatory stories have occurred to the ancestors of the australians and to the ancestors of the greeks however remote their home while they were still in the savage condition  the best way to investigate this point is to collect all known savage and civilised stellar myths and see what points they have in common  if they all agree in character though the greek tales are full of grace while those of the australians or brazilians are rude enough we may plausibly account for the similarity of myths as we accounted for the similarity of flint arrowheads  the myths like the arrowheads resemble each other because they were originally framed to meet the same needs out of the same material  in the case of the arrowheads the need was for something hard heavy and sharpthe material was flint  in the case of the myths the need was to explain certain phenomenathe material so to speak was an early state of the human mind to which all objects seemed equally endowed with human personality and to which no metamorphosis appeared impossible  in the following essays then the myths and customs of various peoples will be compared even when these peoples talk languages of alien families and have never as far as history shows us been in actual contact  our method throughout will be to place the usage or myth which is unintelligible when found among a civilised race beside the similar myth which is intelligible enough when it is found among savages a mean term will be found in the folklore preserved by the nonprogressive classes in a progressive people  this folklore represents in the midst of a civilised race the savage ideas out of which civilisation has been evolved  the conclusion will usually be that the fact which puzzles us by its presence in civilisation is a relic surviving from the time when the ancestors of a civilised race were in the state of savagery  by this method it is not necessary that some sort of genealogy should be established between the australian and the greek narrators of a similar myth nor between the greek and australian possessors of a similar usage  the hypothesis will be that the myth or usage is common to both races not because of original community of stock not because of contact and borrowing but because the ancestors of the greeks passed through the savage intellectual condition in which we find the australians  the questions may be asked has race nothing then to do with myth  do peoples never consciously borrow myths from each other  the answer is that race has a great deal to do with the development of myth if it be race which confers on a people its national genius and its capacity of becoming civilised  if race does this then race affects in the most powerful manner the ultimate development of myth  no one is likely to confound a homeric myth with a myth from the edda nor either with a myth from a brahmana though in all three cases the substance the original set of ideas may be much the same  in all three you have anthropomorphic gods capable of assuming animal shapes tricky capricious limited in many undivine ways yet endowed with magical powers  so far the mythical gods of homer of the edda of any of the brahmanas are on a level with each other and not much above the gods of savage mythology  this stuff of myth is quod semper quod ubique quod ab omnibus and is the original gift of the savage intellect  but the final treatment the ultimate literary form of the myth varies in each race  homeric gods like red indian thlinkeet or australian gods can assume the shapes of birds  but when we read in homer of the arming of athene the hunting of artemis the vision of golden aphrodite the apparition of hermes like a young man when the flower of youth is loveliest then we recognise the effect of race upon myth the effect of the greek genius at work on rude material  between the olympians and a thlinkeet god there is all the difference that exists between the demeter of cnidos and an image from easter island  again the scandinavian gods when their tricks are laid aside when odin is neither assuming the shape of worm nor of raven have a martial dignity a noble enduring spirit of their own  race comes out in that as it does in the endless sacrifices soma drinking magical austerities and puerile follies of vedic and brahmanic gods the deities of a people fallen early into its sacerdotage and priestly second childhood  thus race declares itself in the ultimate literary form and character of mythology while the common savage basis and stuff of myths may be clearly discerned in the horned and cannibal and shapeshifting and adulterous gods of greece of india of the north  they all show their common savage origin when the poet neglects freyas command and tells of what the gods did in the morning of time  as to borrowing we have already shown that in prehistoric times there must have been much transmission of myth  the migrations of peoples the traffic in slaves the law of exogamy which always keeps bringing alien women into the familiesall these things favoured the migration of myth but the process lies behind history we can only guess at it we can seldom trace a popular legend on its travels  in the case of the cultivated ancient peoples we know that they themselves believed they had borrowed their religions from each other  when the greeks first found the egyptians practising mysteries like their own they leaped to the conclusion that their own rites had been imported from egypt  we who know that both greek and egyptian rites had many points in common with those of mandans zunis bushmen australianspeople quite unconnected with egyptfeel less confident about the hypothesis of borrowing  we may indeed regard adonis and zeus bagaeus and melicertes as importations from phoenicia  in later times too the greeks and still more the romans extended a free hospitality to alien gods and legends to serapis isis the wilder dionysiac revels and so forth  but this habit of borrowing was regarded with disfavour by pious conservatives and was probably in the width of its hospitality at least an innovation  as tiele remarks we cannot derive dionysus from the assyrian daian nisi judge of men a name of the solar god samas without ascertaining that the winegod exercised judicial functions and was a god of the sun  these derivations shocking to common sense are to be distrusted as part of the intoxication of new learning  some assyrian scholars actually derive hades from bit edi or bit hadithough unluckily says tiele there is no such word in the assyrian text  on the whole topic tieles essay 28 deserves to be consulted  granting then that elements in the worship of dionysus aphrodite and other gods may have been imported with the strange aegyptoassyrian vases and jewels of the sidonians we still find the same basis of rude savage ideas  we may push back a god from greece to phoenicia from phoenicia to accadia but at the end of the end we reach a legend full of myths like those which bushmen tell by the campfire eskimo in their dark huts and australians in the shade of the gunyehmyths cruel puerile obscene like the fancies of the savage mythmakers from which they sprang     the bullroarer a study of the mysteries   as the belated traveller makes his way through the monotonous plains of australia through the bush with its level expanses and clumps of grey blue gum trees he occasionally hears a singular sound  beginning low with a kind of sharp tone thrilling through a whirring noise it grows louder and louder till it becomes a sort of fluttering windy roar  if the traveller be a new comer he is probably puzzled to the last degree if he be an englishman countrybred he says to himself why that is the bullroarer  if he knows the colony and the ways of the natives he knows that the blacks are celebrating their tribal mysteries  the roaring noise is made to warn all women to keep out of the way  just as pentheus was killed with the approval of theocritus because he profaned the rites of the womenworshippers of dionysus so among the australian blacks men must at their peril keep out of the way of female and women out of the way of male celebrations  the instrument which produces the sounds that warn women to remain afar is a toy familiar to english country lads  they call it the bullroarer the common bullroarer is an inexpensive toy which anyone can make  i do not however recommend it to families for two reasons  in the first place it produces a most horrible and unexampled din which endears it to the very young but renders it detested by persons of mature age  in the second place the character of the toy is such that it will almost infallibly break all that is fragile in the house where it is used and will probably put out the eyes of some of the inhabitants  having thus i trust said enough to prevent all good boys from inflicting bullroarers on their parents pastors and masters i proceed in the interests of science to show how the toy is made  nothing can be less elaborate  you take a piece of the commonest wooden board say the lid of a packingcase about a sixth of an inch in thickness and about eight inches long and three broad and you sharpen the ends  when finished the toy may be about the shape of a large bayleaf or a fish used as a counter that is how the new zealanders make it or the sides may be left plain in the centre and only sharpened towards the extremities as in an australian example lent me by mr tylor  then tie a strong piece of string about thirty inches long to one end of the piece of wood and the bullroarer the australian natives call it turndun and the greeks called it greek is complete  now twist the end of the string tightly about your finger and whirl the bullroarer rapidly round and round  for a few moments nothing will happen  in a very interesting lecture delivered at the royal institution mr tylor once exhibited a bullroarer  at first it did nothing particular when it was whirled round and the audience began to fear that the experiment was like those chemical ones often exhibited at institutes in the country which contribute at most a disagreeable odour to the education of the populace but when the bullroarer warmed to its work it justified its name producing what may best be described as a mighty rushing noise as if some supernatural being fluttered and buzzed his wings with fearful roar  grownup people of course are satisfied with a very brief experience of this din but boys have always known the bullroarer in england as one of the most efficient modes of making the hideous and unearthly noises in which it is the privilege of youth to delight  the bullroarer has of all toys the widest diffusion and the most extraordinary history  to study the bullroarer is to take a lesson in folklore  the instrument is found among the most widely severed peoples savage and civilised and is used in the celebration of savage and civilised mysteries  there are students who would found on this a hypothesis that the various races that use the bullroarer all descend from the same stock  but the bull roarer is introduced here for the very purpose of showing that similar minds working with simple means towards similar ends might evolve the bullroarer and its mystic uses anywhere there is no need for a hypothesis of common origin or of borrowing to account for this widely diffused sacred object  the bullroarer has been and is a sacred and magical instrument in many and widely separated lands  it is found always as a sacred instrument employed in religious mysteries in new mexico in australia in new zealand in ancient greece and in africa while as we have seen it is a peasantboys plaything in england  a number of questions are naturally suggested by the bullroarer  is it a thing invented once for all and carried abroad over the world by wandering races or handed on from one people and tribe to another  or is the bullroarer a toy that might be accidentally hit on in any country where men can sharpen wood and twist the sinews of animals into string  was the thing originally a toy and is its religious and mystical nature later or was it originally one of the properties of the priest or medicineman which in england has dwindled to a plaything  lastly was this mystical instrument at first employed in the rites of a civilised people like the greeks and was it in some way borrowed or inherited by south africans australians and new mexicans  or is it a mere savage invention surviving like certain other features of the greek mysteries from a distant stage of savagery  our answer to all these questions is that in all probability the presence of the greek or bullroarer in greek mysteries was a survival from the time when greeks were in the social condition of australians  in the first place the bullroarer is associated with mysteries and initiations  now mysteries and initiations are things that tend to dwindle and to lose their characteristic features as civilisation advances  the rites of baptism and confirmation are not secret and hidden they are common to both sexes they are publicly performed and religion and morality of the purest sort blend in these ceremonies  there are no other initiations or mysteries that civilised modern man is expected necessarily to pass through  on the other hand looking widely at human history we find mystic rites and initiations numerous stringent severe and magical in character in proportion to the lack of civilisation in those who practise them  the less the civilisation the more mysterious and the more cruel are the rites  the more cruel the rites the less is the civilisation  the redhot poker with which mr bouncer terrified mr verdant green at the sham masonic rites would have been quite in place a natural instrument of probationary torture in the freemasonry of australians mandans or hottentots  in the mysteries of demeter or bacchus in the mysteries of a civilised people the redhot poker or any other instrument of torture would have been out of place but in the greek mysteries just as in those of south africans red indians and australians the disgusting practice of bedaubing the neophyte with dirt and clay was preserved  we have nothing quite like that in modern initiations  except at sparta greeks dropped the tortures inflicted on boys and girls in the initiations superintended by the cruel artemis 33  but greek mysteries retained the daubing with mud and the use of the bullroarer  on the whole then and on a general view of the subject we prefer to think that the bullroarer in greece was a survival from savage mysteries not that the bullroarer in new mexico new zealand australia and south africa is a relic of civilisation  let us next observe a remarkable peculiarity of the turndun or australian bullroarer  the bullroarer in england is a toy  in australia according to howitt and fison 34 the bullroarer is regarded with religious awe  when on lately meeting with two of the surviving kurnai i spoke to them of the turndun they first looked cautiously round them to see that no one else was looking and then answered me in undertones  the chief peculiarity in connection with the turndun is that women may never look upon it  the chepara tribe who call it bribbun have a custom that if seen by a woman or shown by a man to a woman the punishment to both is death  among the kurnai the sacred mystery of the turndun is preserved by a legend which gives a supernatural sanction to secrecy  when boys go through the mystic ceremony of initiation they are shown turnduns or bullroarers and made to listen to their hideous din  they are then told that if ever a woman is allowed to see a turndun the earth will open and water will cover the globe  the old men point spears at the boys eyes saying if you tell this to any woman you will die you will see the ground broken up and like the sea if you tell this to any woman or to any child you will be killed  as in athens in syria and among the mandans the delugetradition of australia is connected with the mysteries  in gippsland there is a tradition of the deluge  some children of the kurnai in playing about found a turndun which they took home to the camp and showed the women  immediately the earth crumbled away and it was all water and the kurnai were drowned  in consequence of all this mummery the australian women attach great sacredness to the very name of the turndun  they are much less instructed in their own theology than the men of the tribe  one woman believed she had heard pundjel the chief supernatural being descend in a mighty rushing noise that is in the sound of the turndun when boys were being made men or initiated 35  on turnduns the australian sorcerers can fly up to heaven  turnduns carved with imitations of water flowers are used by medicinemen in rainmaking  new zealand also has her bullroarers some of them carved in relief are in the christy museum and one is engraved here  i have no direct evidence as to the use of these maori bullroarers in the maori mysteries  their employment however may perhaps be provisionally inferred  one can readily believe that the new zealand bullroarer may be whirled by any man who is repeating a karakia or charm to raise the wind     loud wind    lasting wind    violent whistling wind    dig up the calm reposing sky       come come  in new zealand 36a the natives regarded the wind as an indication of the presence of their god a superstition not peculiar to maori religion  the cold wind felt blowing over the hands at spiritualistic seances is also regarded by psychical researchers as an indication of the presence of supernatural beings  the windy roaring noise made by the bullroarer might readily be considered by savages either as an invitation to a god who should present himself in storm or as a proof of his being at hand  we have seen that this view was actually taken by an australian woman  the hymn called breath or haha a hymn to the mystic wind is pronounced by maori priests at the moment of the initiation of young men in the tribal mysteries  it is a mere conjecture and possibly enough capable of disproof but we have a suspicion that the use of the mystica vannus iacchi was a mode of raising a sacred wind analogous to that employed by whirlers of the turndun 36b  servius the ancient commentator on virgil mentions among other opinions thisthat the vannus was a sieve and that it symbolised the purifying effect of the mysteries  but it is clear that servius was only guessing and he offers other explanations among them that the vannus was a crate to hold offerings primitias frugum  we have studied the bullroarer in australia we have caught a glimpse of it in england  its existence on the american continent is proved by letters from new mexico and by a passage in mr frank cushings adventures in zuni 37  in zuni too among a semicivilised indian tribe or rather a tribe which has left the savage for the barbaric condition we find the bullroarer  here too the instrumenta slat mr gushing calls itis used as a call to the ceremonial observance of the tribal ritual  the zunis have various orders of a more or less sacred and sacerdotal character  mr cushing writes     these orders were engaged in their annual ceremonials of which little    was told or shown me but at the end of four days i heard one    morning a deep whirring noise  running out i saw a procession of    three priests of the bow in plumed helmets and closelyfitting    cuirasses both of thick buckskingorgeous and solemn with sacred    embroideries and warpaint begirt with bows arrows and warclubs    and each distinguished by his badge of degreecoming down one of the    narrow streets  the principal priest carried in his arms a wooden    idol ferocious in aspect yet beautiful with its decorations of    shell turquoise and brilliant paint  it was nearly hidden by    symbolic slats and prayersticks most elaborately plumed  he was    preceded by a guardian with drawn bow and arrows while another    followed twirling the sounding slat which had attracted alike my    attention and that of hundreds of the indians who hurriedly flocked    to the roofs of the adjacent houses or lined the street bowing their    heads in adoration and scattering sacred prayermeal on the god and    his attendant priests  slowly they wound their way down the hill    across the river and off toward the mountain of thunder  soon an    identical procession followed and took its way toward the western    hills  i watched them long until they disappeared and a few hours    afterward there arose from the top of thunder mountain a dense    column of smoke simultaneously with another from the more distant    western mesa of uhanami or mount of the beloved     then they told me that for four days i must neither touch nor eat    flesh or oil of any kind and for ten days neither throw any refuse    from my doors nor permit a spark to leave my house for this was the    season of the year when the grandmother of men fire was precious  here then in zuni we have the bullroarer again and once more we find it employed as a summons to the mysteries  we do not learn however that women in zuni are forbidden to look upon the bullroarer  finally the south african evidence which is supplied by letters from a correspondent of mr tylors proves that in south africa too the bull roarer is employed to call the men to the celebration of secret functions  a minute description of the instrument and of its magical power to raise a wind is given in theals kaffir folklore p 209  the bullroarer has not been made a subject of particular research very probably later investigations will find it in other parts of the modern world besides america africa new zealand and australia  i have myself been fortunate enough to encounter the bullroarer on the soil of ancient greece and in connection with the dionysiac mysteries  clemens of alexandria and arnobius an early christian father who follows clemens describe certain toys of the child dionysus which were used in the mysteries  among these are turbines greek and greek  the ordinary dictionaries interpret all these as whippingtops adding that greek is sometimes a magic wheel  the ancient scholiast on clemens however writes the greek is a little piece of wood to which a string is fastened and in the mysteries it is whirled round to make a roaring noise 39  here in short we have a brief but complete description of the bullroarer of the australian turndun  no single point is omitted  the greek like the turndun is a small object of wood it is tied to a string when whirled round it produces a roaring noise and it is used at initiations  this is not the end of the matter  in the part of the dionysiac mysteries at which the toys of the child dionysus were exhibited and during which as it seems the greek or bullroarer was whirred the performers daubed themselves all over with clay  this we learn from a passage in which demosthenes describes the youth of his hated adversary aeschines  the mother of aeschines he says was a kind of wise woman and dabbler in mysteries  aeschines used to aid her by bedaubing the initiate over with clay and bran 40a the word greek here used by demosthenes is explained by harpocration as the ritual term for daubing the initiated  a story was told as usual to explain this rite  it was said that when the titans attacked dionysus and tore him to pieces they painted themselves first with clay or gypsum that they might not be recognised  nonnus shows in several places that down to his time the celebrants of the bacchic mysteries retained this dirty trick  precisely the same trick prevails in the mysteries of savage peoples  mr winwood reade 40b reports the evidence of mongilomba  when initiated mongilomba was severely flogged in the fetich house as young spartans were flogged before the animated image of artemis and then he was plastered over with goatdung  among the natives of victoria 40c the body of the initiated is bedaubed with clay mud charcoal powder and filth of every kind  the girls are plastered with charcoal powder and white clay answering to the greek gypsum  similar daubings were performed at the mysteries by the mandans as described by catlin and the zunis made raids on mr cushings black paint and chinese ink for like purposes  on the congo mr johnson found precisely the same ritual in the initiations  here then not to multiply examples we discover two singular features in common between greek and savage mysteries  both greeks and savages employ the bullroarer both bedaub the initiated with dirt or with white paint or chalk  as to the meaning of the latter very unaryan practice one has no idea  it is only certain that war parties of australian blacks bedaub themselves with white clay to alarm their enemies in night attacks  the phocians according to herodotus viii 27 adopted the same aisy stratagem as captain costigan has it  tellies the medicineman greek chalked some sixty phocians whom he sent to make a night attack on the thessalians  the sentinels of the latter were seized with supernatural horror and fled and after the sentinels went the army in the same way in a night attack among the australian kurnai 41a they all rapidly painted themselves with pipeclay red ochre is no use it cannot frighten an enemy  if then greeks in the historic period kept up australian tactics it is probable that the ancient mysteries of greece might retain the habit of daubing the initiated which occurs in savage rites  come now as herodotus would say i will show once more that the mysteries of the greeks resemble those of bushmen  in lucians treatise on dancing 41b we read i pass over the fact that you cannot find a single ancient mystery in which there is not dancing    to prove this i will not mention the secret acts of worship on account of the uninitiated  but this much all men know that most people say of those who reveal the mysteries that they dance them out  here liddell and scott write rather weakly to dance out let out betray probably of some dance which burlesqued these ceremonies  it is extremely improbable that in an age when it was still forbidden to reveal the greek or secret rites those rites would be mocked in popular burlesques  lucian obviously intends to say that the matter of the mysteries was set forth in ballets daction  now this is exactly the case in the surviving mysteries of the bushmen  shortly after the rebellion of langalibaleles tribe mr orpen the chief magistrate in st johns territory made the acquaintance of qing one of the last of an all but exterminated tribe  qing had never seen a white man except fighting when he became mr orpens guide  he gave a good deal of information about the myths of his people but refused to answer certain questions  you are now asking the secrets that are not spoken of  mr orpen asked do you know the secrets  qing replied no only the initiated men of that dance know these things  to dance this or that means to be acquainted with this or that mystery the dances were originally taught by cagn the mantis or grasshopper god  in many mysteries qing as a young man was not initiated  he could not dance them out 42  there are thus undeniably close resemblances between the greek mysteries and those of the lowest contemporary races  as to the bullroarer its recurrence among greeks zunis kamilaroi maoris and south african races would be regarded by some students as a proof that all these tribes had a common origin or had borrowed the instrument from each other  but this theory is quite unnecessary  the bullroarer is a very simple invention  anyone might find out that a bit of sharpened wood tied to a string makes when whirred a roaring noise  supposing that discovery made it is soon turned to practical use  all tribes have their mysteries  all want a signal to summon the right persons together and warn the wrong persons to keep out of the way the church bell does as much for us so did the shaken seistron for the egyptians  people with neither bells nor seistra find the bullroarer with its mysterious sound serve their turn  the hiding of the instrument from women is natural enough  it merely makes the alarm and absence of the curious sex doubly sure  the stories of supernatural consequences to follow if a woman sees the turndun lend a sanction  this is not a random theory without basis  in brazil the natives have no bullroarer but they have mysteries and the presence of the women at the mysteries of the men is a terrible impiety  to warn away the women the brazilians make loud devilmusic on what are called jurupari pipes  now just as in australia the women may not see the jurupari pipes on pain of death  when the sound of the jurupari pipes is heard as when the turndun is heard in australia every woman flees and hides herself  the women are always executed if they see the pipes  mr alfred wallace bought a pair of these pipes but he had to embark them at a distance from the village where they were procured  the seller was afraid that some unknown misfortune would occur if the women of his village set eyes on the juruparis 44  the conclusion from all these facts seems obvious  the bullroarer is an instrument easily invented by savages and easily adopted into the ritual of savage mysteries  if we find the bullroarer used in the mysteries of the most civilised of ancient peoples the most probable explanation is that the greeks retained both the mysteries the bullroarer the habit of bedaubing the initiate the torturing of boys the sacred obscenities the antics with serpents the dances and the like from the time when their ancestors were in the savage condition  that more refined and religious ideas were afterwards introduced into the mysteries seems certain but the rites were in many cases simply savage  unintelligible except as survivals when found among hellenes they become intelligible enough among savages because they correspond to the intellectual condition and magical fancies of the lower barbarism  the same sort of comparison the same kind of explanation will account as we shall see for the savage myths as well as for the savage customs which survived among the greeks     the myth of cronus   in a maori pah when a little boy behaves rudely to his parents he is sometimes warned that he is as bad as cruel tutenganahau  if he asks who tutenganahau was he is told the following story  in the beginning the heaven rangi and the earth papa were the father and mother of all things  in these days the heaven lay upon the earth and all was darkness  they had never been separated  heaven and earth had children who grew up and lived in this thick night and they were unhappy because they could not see  between the bodies of their parents they were imprisoned and there was no light  the names of the children were tumatuenga tane mahuta tutenganahau and some others  so they all consulted as to what should be done with their parents rangi and papa  shall we slay them or shall we separate them  go to said tumatuenga let us slay them  no cried tane mahuta let us rather separate them  let one go upwards and become a stranger to us let the other remain below and be a parent to us  only tawhiri matea the wind had pity on his own father and mother  then the fruitgods and the wargod and the seagod for all the children of papa and rangi were gods tried to rend their parents asunder  last rose the forest god cruel tutenganahau  he severed the sinews which united heaven and earth rangi and papa  then he pushed hard with his head and feet  then wailed heaven and exclaimed earth wherefore this murder  why this great sin  why destroy us  why separate us  but tane pushed and pushed rangi was driven far away into the air  they became visible who had hitherto been concealed between the hollows of their parents breasts  only the stormgod differed from his brethren he arose and followed his father rangi and abode with him in the open spaces of the sky  this is the maori story of the severing of the wedded heaven and earth the cutting of them asunder was the work of tutenganahau and his brethren and the conduct of tutenganahau is still held up as an example of filial impiety 46a  the story is preserved in sacred hymns of very great antiquity and many of the myths are common to the other peoples of the pacific 46b  now let us turn from new zealand to athens as she was in the days of pericles  socrates is sitting in the porch of the king archon when euthyphro comes up and enters into conversation with the philosopher after some talk euthyphro says you will think me mad when i tell you whom i am prosecuting and pursuing  why has the fugitive wings asks socrates  nay he is not very volatile at his time of life  who is he  my father  good heavens you dont mean that  what is he accused of  murder socrates  then euthyphro explains the case which quaintly illustrates greek civilisation  euthyphros father had an agricultural labourer at naxos  one day this man in a drunken passion killed a slave  euthyphros father seized the labourer bound him threw him into a ditch and then sent to athens to ask a diviner what should be done with him  before the answer of the diviner arrived the labourer literally died in a ditch of hunger and cold  for this offence euthyphro was prosecuting his own father  socrates shows that he disapproves and euthyphro thus defends the piety of his own conduct the impious whoever he may be ought not to go unpunished  for do not men regard zeus as the best and most righteous of gods  yet even they admit that zeus bound his own father cronus because he wickedly devoured his sons and that cronus too had punished his own father uranus for a similar reason in a nameless manner  and yet when i proceed against my father people are angry with me  this is their inconsistent way of talking when the gods are concerned and when i am concerned  here socrates breaks in  he cannot away with these stories about the gods and so he has just been accused of impiety the charge for which he died  socrates cannot believe that a god cronus mutilated his father uranus but euthyphro believes the whole affair i can tell you many other things about the gods which would quite amaze you 48        we have here a typical example of the way in which mythology puzzled the early philosophers of greece  socrates was anxious to be pious and to respect the most ancient traditions of the gods  yet at the very outset of sacred history he was met by tales of gods who mutilated and bound their own parents  not only were such tales hateful to him but they were of positively evil example to people like euthyphro  the problem remained how did the fathers of the athenians ever come to tell such myths        let us now examine the myth of cronus and the explanations which have been given by scholars  near the beginning of things according to hesiod whose cosmogony was accepted in greece earth gave birth to heaven  later heaven uranus became the husband of gaea earth  just as rangi and papa in new zealand had many children so had uranus and gaea  as in new zealand some of these children were gods of the various elements  among them were oceanus the deep and hyperion the sunas among the children of earth and heaven in new zealand were the wind and the sea  the youngest child of the greek heaven and earth was cronus of crooked counsel who ever hated his mighty sire  now even as the children of the maori heaven and earth were concealed between the hollows of their parents breasts so the greek heaven used to hide his children from the light in the hollows of earth  both earth and her children resented this and as in new zealand the children conspired against heaven taking earth however into their counsels  thereupon earth produced iron and bade her children avenge their wrongs 49a  now fear fell on all of them except cronus who like tutenganahau was all for action  cronus determined to end the embraces of heaven and earth but while the maori myth conceives of heaven and earth as of two beings which have never been separated before hesiod makes heaven amorously approach his wife from a distance  then cronus stretched out his hand armed with a sickle of iron or steel and mutilated uranus  thus were heaven and earth practically divorced  but as in the maori myth one of the children of heaven clave to his sire so in greek oceanus remained faithful to his father 49b  this is the first portion of the myth of cronus  can it be denied that the story is well illustrated and explained by the new zealand parallel the myth of the cruelty of tutenganahau  by means of this comparison the meaning of the myth is made clear enough  just as the new zealanders had conceived of heaven and earth as at one time united to the prejudice of their children so the ancestors of the greeks had believed in an ancient union of heaven and earth  both by greeks and maoris heaven and earth were thought of as living persons with human parts and passions their union was prejudicial to their children and so the children violently separated the parents  this conduct is regarded as impious and as an awful example to be avoided in maori pahs  in naxos on the other hand euthyphro deemed that the conduct of cronus deserved imitation  if ever the maoris had reached a high civilisation they would probably have been revolted like socrates by the myth which survived from their period of savagery  mr tylor well says 50a just as the adzes of polished jade and the cloaks of tied flaxfibre which these new zealanders were using but yesterday are older in their place in history than the bronze battleaxes and linen mummycloths of ancient egypt so the maori poets shaping of nature into naturemyth belongs to a stage of intellectual history which was passing away in greece fiveand twenty centuries ago  the mythmakers fancy of heaven and earth as father and mother of all things naturally suggested the legend that they in old days abode together but have since been torn asunder        that this view of heaven and earth is natural to early minds mr tylor proves by the presence of the myth of the union and violent divorce of the pair in china 50b  puangku is the chinese cronus or tutenganahau  in india 50c dyaus and prithivi heaven and earth were once united and were severed by indra their own child  this then is our interpretation of the exploit of cronus  it is an old surviving naturemyth of the severance of heaven and earth a myth found in china india new zealand as well as in greece  of course it is not pretended that chinese and maoris borrowed from indians and greeks or came originally of the same stock  similar phenomena presenting themselves to be explained by human minds in a similar stage of fancy and of ignorance will account for the parallel myths  the second part of the myth of cronus was like the first a stumbling block to the orthodox in greece  of the second part we offer no explanation beyond the fact that the incidents in the myth are almost universally found among savages and that therefore in greece they are probably survivals from savagery  the sequel of the myth appears to account for nothing as the first part accounts for the severance of heaven and earth  in the sequel a worldwide marchen or tale seems to have been attached to cronus or attracted into the cycle of which he is centre without any particular reason beyond the law which makes detached myths crystallise round any celebrated name  to look further is perhaps chercher raison ou il ny en a pas  the conclusion of the story of cronus runs thushe wedded his sister rhea and begat childrendemeter hera hades poseidon and lastly zeus  and mighty cronus swallowed down each of them each that came to their mothers knees from her holy womb with this intent that none other of the proud children of uranus should hold kingly sway among the immortals  cronus showed a ruling fathers usual jealousy of his heirs it was a case of friedrich wilhelm and friedrich  but cronus acting in a way natural in a story perhaps first invented by cannibals swallowed his children instead of merely imprisoning them  heaven and earth had warned him to beware of his heirs and he could think of no safer plan than that which he adopted  when rhea was about to become the mother of zeus she fled to crete  here zeus was born and when cronus in pursuit of his usual policy asked for the baby he was presented with a stone wrapped up in swaddling bands  after swallowing the stone cronus was easy in his mind but zeus grew up administered a dose to his father and compelled him to disgorge  the stone came forth first as he had swallowed it last 52a   the other children also emerged all alive and well  zeus fixed the stone at delphi where long after the christian era pausanias saw it 52b  it was not a large stone pausanias tells us and the delphians used to anoint it with oil and wrap it up in wool on feastdays  all greek temples had their fetichstones and each stone had its legend  this was the story of the delphian stone and of the fetichism which survived the early years of christianity  a very pretty story it is  savages more frequently smear their fetichstones with red paint than daub them with oil but the latter as we learn from theophrastuss account of the superstitious man was the greek ritual        this anecdote about cronus was the stumblingblock of the orthodox greek the jest of the sceptic and the butt of the early christian controversialists  found among bushmen or australians the narrative might seem rather wild but it astonishes us still more when it occurs in the holy legends of greece  our explanation of its presence there is simple enough  like the erratic blocks in a modern plain like the flint heads in a meadow the story is a relic of a very distant past  the glacial age left the boulders on the plain the savage tribes of long ago left the arrowheads the period of savage fancy left the story of cronus and the rites of the fetichstone  similar rites are still notoriously practised in the south sea islands in siberia in india and africa and melanesia by savages  and by savages similar tales are still told        we cannot go much lower than the bushmen and among bushman divine myths is room for the swallowing trick attributed to cronus by hesiod  the chief divine character in bushman myth is the mantis insect  his adopted daughter is the child of kwai hemm a supernatural character the all devourer  the mantis gets his adopted daughter to call the swallower to his aid but kwai hemm swallows the mantis the godinsect  as zeus made his own wife change herself into an insect for the convenience of swallowing her there is not much difference between bushman and early greek mythology  kwai hemm is killed by a stratagem and all the animals whom he has got outside of in a long and voracious career troop forth from him alive and well like the swallowed gods from the maw of cronus 54a  now story for story the bushman version is much less offensive than that of hesiod  but the bushman story is just the sort of story we expect from bushmen whereas the hesiodic story is not at all the kind of tale we look for from greeks  the explanation is that the greeks had advanced out of a savage state of mind and society but had retained their old myths myths evolved in the savage stage and in harmony with that condition of fancy  among the kaffirs 54b we find the same swallowmyth  the igongqongqo swallows all and sundry a woman cuts the swallower with a knife and people came out and cattle and dogs in australia a god is swallowed  as in the myth preserved by aristophanes in the birds the australians believe that birds were the original gods and the eagle especially is a great creative power  the moon was a mischievous being who walked about the world doing what evil he could  one day he swallowed the eaglegod  the wives of the eagle came up and the moon asked them where he might find a well  they pointed out a well and as he drank they hit the moon with a stone tomahawk and out flew the eagle 54c  this is oddly like grimms tale of the wolf and the kids  the wolf swallowed the kids their mother cut a hole in the wolf let out the kids stuffed the wolf with stones and sewed him up again  the wolf went to the well to drink the weight of the stones pulled him in and he was drowned  similar stories are common among the red indians and mr im thurn has found them in guiana how savages all over the world got the idea that men and beasts could be swallowed and disgorged alive and why they fashioned the idea into a divine myth it is hard to say  mr tylor in primitive culture 55a adds many examples of the narrative  the basutos have it it occurs some five times in callaways zulu nursery tales  in greenland the eskimo have a shape of the incident and we have all heard of the escape of jonah  it has been suggested that night covering up the world gave the first idea of the swallowing myth  now in some of the stories the night is obviously conceived of as a big beast which swallows all things  the notion that night is an animal is entirely in harmony with savage metaphysics  in the opinion of the savage speculator all things are men and animals  ils se persuadent que non seulement les hommes et les autres animaux mais aussi que toutes les autres choses sont animees says one of the old jesuit missionaries in canada 55b  the wind was formerly a person he became a bird say the bushmen  g oo ka kui a very respectable bushman whose name seems a little hard to pronounce once saw the windperson at haarfontein  savages then are persuaded that night sky cloud fire and so forth are only the schein or sensuous appearance of things that in essence are men or animals  a good example is the bringing of night to vanua lava by qat the culturehero of melanesia  at first it was always day and people tired of it  qat heard that night was at the torres islands and he set forth to get some  qong night received qat well blackened his eyebrows showed him sleep and sent him off with fowls to bring dawn after the arrival of night should make dawn a necessary  next day qats brothers saw the sun crawl away west and presently night came creeping up from the sea  what is this cried the brothers  it is night said qat sit down and when you feel something in your eyes lie down and keep quiet  so they went to sleep  when night had lasted long enough qat took a piece of red obsidian and cut the darkness and the dawn came out 56  night is more or less personal in this tale and solid enough to be cut so as to let the dawn out  this savage conception of night as the swallower and disgorger might start the notion of other swallowing and disgorging beings  again the bushmen and other savage peoples account for certain celestial phenomena by saying that a big star has swallowed his daughter and spit her out again  while natural phenomena explained on savage principles might give the data of the swallowmyth we must not conclude that all beings to whom the story is attached are therefore the night  on this principle cronus would be the night and so would the wolf in grimm  for our purposes it is enough that the feat of cronus is a feat congenial to the savage fancy and repugnant to the civilised greeks who found themselves in possession of the myth  beyond this and beyond the inference that the cronus myth was first evolved by people to whom it seemed quite natural that is by savages we do not pretend to go in our interpretation        to end our examination of the myth of cronus we may compare the solutions offered by scholars  as a rule these solutions are based on the philological analysis of the names in the story  it will be seen that very various and absolutely inconsistent etymologies and meanings of cronus are suggested by philologists of the highest authority  these contradictions are unfortunately rather the rule than the exception in the etymological interpretation of myths        the opinion of mr max muller has always a right to the first hearing from english inquirers  mr muller naturally examines first the name of the god whose legend he is investigating  he writes there is no such being as kronos in sanskrit  kronos did not exist till long after zeus in greece  zeus was called by the greeks the son of time greek this is a very simple and very common form of mythological expression  it meant originally not that time was the origin or source of zeus but greek or greek was used in the sense of connected with time representing time existing through all time  derivatives in greek and greek took in later times the more exclusive meaning of patronymics     when this the meaning of greek as equivalent to ancient of days ceased to be understood    people asked themselves the question why is zeus called greek  and the natural and almost inevitable answer was because he is the son the offspring of a more ancient god kronos  this may be a very old myth in greece but the misunderstanding which gave rise to it could have happened in greece only  we cannot expect therefore a god kronos in the veda  to expect greek in the veda would certainly be sanguine  when this myth of kronos had once been started it would roll on irresistibly  if zeus had once a father called kronos kronos must have a wife  it is added as confirmation that the name of greek belongs originally to zeus only and not to his later in hesiod elder brothers poseidon and hades 58a  mr muller says in his famous essay on comparative mythology 58b how can we imagine that a few generations before that time the age of solon the highest notions of the godhead among the greeks were adequately expressed by the story of uranos maimed by kronosof kronos eating his children swallowing a stone and vomiting out alive his whole progeny  among the lowest tribes of africa and america we hardly find anything more hideous and revolting  we have found a good deal of the sort in africa and america where it seems not out of place  one objection to mr mullers theory is that it makes the mystery no clearer  when greeks were so advanced in hellenism that their own early language had become obsolete and obscure they invented the god greek to account for the patronymic as they deemed it greek son of greek  but why did they tell such savage and revolting stories about the god they had invented  mr muller only says the myth would roll on irresistibly  but why did the rolling myth gather such very strange moss  that is the problem and while mr mullers hypothesis accounts for the existence of a god called greek it does not even attempt to show how fullblown greeks came to believe such hideous stories about the god        this theory therefore is of no practical service  the theory of adalbert kuhn one of the most famous of sanskrit scholars and author of die herabkunft des feuers is directly opposed to the ideas of mr muller  in cronus mr muller recognises a god who could only have come into being among greeks when the greeks had begun to forget the original meaning of derivatives in greek and greek  kuhn on the other hand derives greek from the same root as the sanskrit krana 59 krana means it appears der fur sich schaffende he who creates for himself and cronus is compared to the indian pragapati about whom even more abominable stories are told than the myths which circulate to the prejudice of cronus  according to kuhn the swallowmyth means that cronus the lord of light and dark powers swallows the divinities of light  but in place of zeus that is according to kuhn of the daylight sky he swallows a stone that is the sun  when he disgorges the stone the sun he also disgorges the gods of light whom he had swallowed  i confess that i cannot understand these distinctions between the father and lord of light and dark cronus and the beings he swallowed  nor do i find it easy to believe that mythmaking man took all those distinctions or held those views of the creator  however the chief thing to note is that mr mullers etymology and kuhns etymology of cronus can hardly both be true which as their systems both depend on etymological analysis is somewhat discomfiting  the next etymological theory is the daring speculation of mr brown  in the great dionysiak myth 60a mr brown writes i regard kronos as the equivalent of karnos karnaios karnaivis the horned god assyrian karnu hebrew keren horn hellenic kronos or karnos  mr brown seems to think that cronus is the ripening power of harvest and also a wily savage god in which opinion one quite agrees with him  why the name of cronus should mean horned when he is never represented with horns it is hard to say  but among the various foreign gods in whom the greeks recognised their own cronus one hea regarded by berosos as kronos seems to have been hornwearing 60b  horns are lacking in seb and il if not in baal hamon though mr brown would like to behorn them  let us now turn to preller 61a  according to preller kronos is connected with greek to fulfil to bring to completion  the harvest month the month of ripening and fulfilment was called greek in some parts of greece and the jolly harvestfeast with its memory of saturns golden days was named greek  the sickle of cronus the sickle of harvesttime works in well with this explanation and we have a kind of pun in homer which points in the direction of prellers derivation from greek     greek  and in sophocles tr 126     greek  preller illustrates the mutilation of uranus by the maori tale of tutenganahau  the childswallowing he connects with punic and phoenician influence and semitic sacrifices of men and children  porphyry 61b speaks of human sacrifices to cronus in rhodes and the greeks recognised cronus in the carthaginian god to whom children were offered up  hartung 61c takes cronus when he mutilates uranus to be the fire of the sun scorching the sky of spring  this again is somewhat out of accord with schwartzs idea that cronus is the stormgod the cloudswallowing deity his sickle the rainbow and the blood of uranus the lightning 61d  according to prof sayce again 62a the blood drops of uranus are raindrops  cronus is the sungod piercing the dark cloud which is just the reverse of schwartzs idea  prof sayce sees points in common between the legend of moloch or of baal under the name of moloch and the myth of cronus  but moloch he thinks is not a god of phoenician origin but a deity borrowed from the primitive accadian population of babylonia  mr isaac taylor again explains cronus as the sky which swallows and reproduces the stars  the story of the sickle may be derived from the crescent moon the silver sickle or from a crescentshaped piece of meteoric ironfor in this theory the fetich stone of delphi is a piece of that substance        it will be observed that any one of these theories if accepted is much more minute in detail than our humble suggestion  he who adopts any one of them knows all about it  he knows that cronus is a purely greek god or that he is connected with the sanskrit krana which tiele 62b unhappily says is a very dubious word  or the mythologist may be quite confident that cronus is neither greek nor in any sense sanskrit but phoenician  a not less adequate interpretation assigns him ultimately to accadia  while the inquirer who can choose a system and stick to it knows the exact nationality of cronus he is also well acquainted with his character as a naturegod  he may be time or perhaps he is the summer heat and a horned god or he is the harvest god or the god of storm and darkness or the midnight skythe choice is wide or he is the lord of dark and light and his children are the stars the clouds the summer months the lightpowers or what you will the mythologist has only to make his selection  the system according to which we tried to interpret the myth is less ondoyant et divers  we do not even pretend to explain everything  we do not guess at the meaning and root of the word cronus  we only find parallels to the myth among savages whose mental condition is fertile in such legends  and we only infer that the myth of cronus was originally evolved by persons also in the savage intellectual condition  the survival we explain as in a previous essay we explained the survival of the bullroarer by the conservatism of the religious instinct     cupid psyche and the sunfrog   once upon a time there lived a king and a queen says the old woman in apuleius beginning the tale of cupid and psyche with that ancient formula which has been dear to so many generations of children  in one shape or other the tale of cupid and psyche of the woman who is forbidden to see or to name her husband of the man with the vanished fairy bride is known in most lands even among barbarians  according to the story the mystic prohibition is always broken the hidden face is beheld light is brought into the darkness the forbidden name is uttered the bride is touched with the tabooed metal iron and the union is ended  sometimes the pair are reunited after long searchings and wanderings sometimes they are severed for ever  such are the central situations in tales like that of cupid and psyche  in the attempt to discover how the ideas on which this myth is based came into existence we may choose one of two methods  we may confine our investigations to the aryan peoples among whom the story occurs both in the form of myth and of household tale  again we may look for the shapes of the legend which hide like peau dane in disguise among the rude kraals and wigwams and in the strange and scanty garb of savages if among savages we find both narratives like cupid and psyche and also customs and laws out of which the myth might have arisen we may provisionally conclude that similar customs once existed among the civilised races who possess the tale and that from these sprang the early forms of the myth  in accordance with the method hitherto adopted we shall prefer the second plan and pursue our quest beyond the limits of the aryan peoples  the oldest literary shape of the tale of psyche and her lover is found in the rig veda x 95  the characters of a singular and cynical dialogue in that poem are named urvasi and pururavas  the former is an apsaras a kind of fairy or sylph the mistress and a folle maitresse too of pururavas a mortal man 65  in the poem urvasi remarks that when she dwelt among men she ate once a day a small piece of butter and therewith well satisfied went away  this slightly reminds one of the common idea that the living may not eat in the land of the dead and of persephones tasting the pomegranate in hades  of the dialogue in the rig veda it may be said in the words of mr toots that the language is coarse and the meaning is obscure  we only gather that urvasi though she admits her sensual content in the society of pururavas is leaving him like the first of the dawns that she goes home again hard to be caught like the winds  she gives her lover some hope howeverthat the gods promise immortality even to him the kinsman of death as he is  let thine offspring worship the gods with an oblation in heaven shalt thou too have joy of the festival  in the rig veda then we dimly discern a parting between a mortal man and an immortal bride and a promise of reconciliation  the story of which this vedic poem is a partial dramatisation is given in the brahmana of the yajur veda  mr max muller has translated the passage 66a  according to the brahmana urvasi a kind of fairy fell in love with pururavas and when she met him she said embrace me three times a day but never against my will and let me never see you without your royal garments for this is the manner of women 66b  the gandharvas a spiritual race kinsmen of urvasi thought she had lingered too long among men  they therefore plotted some way of parting her from pururavas  her covenant with her lord declared that she was never to see him naked  if that compact were broken she would be compelled to leave him  to make pururavas break this compact the gandharvas stole a lamb from beside urvasis bed pururavas sprang up to rescue the lamb and in a flash of lightning urvasi saw him naked contrary to the manner of women  she vanished  he sought her long and at last came to a lake where she and her fairy friends were playing in the shape of birds urvasi saw pururavas revealed herself to him and according to the brahmana part of the strange vedic dialogue was now spoken  urvasi promised to meet him on the last night of the year a son was to be the result of the interview  next day her kinsfolk the gandharvas offered pururavas the wish of his heart  he wished to be one of them  they then initiated him into the mode of kindling a certain sacred fire after which he became immortal and dwelt among the gandharvas  it is highly characteristic of the indian mind that the story should be thus worked into connection with ritual  in the same way the bhagavata purana has a long silly and rather obscene narrative about the sacrifice offered by pururavas and the new kind of sacred fire  much the same ritual tale is found in the vishnu purana iv 6 19  before attempting to offer our own theory of the legend we must examine the explanations presented by scholars  the philological method of dealing with myths is well known  the hypothesis is that the names in a myth are stubborn things and that as the whole narrative has probably arisen from forgetfulness of the meaning of language the secret of a myth must be sought in analysis of the proper names of the persons  on this principle mr max muller interprets the myth of urvasi and pururavas their loves separation and reunion  mr muller says that the story expresses the identity of the morning dawn and the evening twilight 68  to prove this the names are analysed  it is mr mullers object to show that though even in the veda urvasi and pururavas are names of persons they were originally appellations and that urvasi meant dawn and pururavas sun  mr mullers opinion as to the etymological sense of the names would be thought decisive naturally by lay readers if an opposite opinion were not held by that other great philologist and comparative mythologist adalbert kuhn admitting that the etymology of urvasi is difficult mr muller derives it from uru wide greek and a root as  to pervade  now the dawn is widely pervading and has in sanskrit the epithet uruki fargoing  mr muller next assumes that eurykyde eurynome eurydike and other heroic greek female names are names of the dawn but this it must be said is merely an assumption of his school  the main point of the argument is that urvasi means fargoing and that the far and wide splendour of dawn is often spoken of in the veda however the best proof that urvasi was the dawn is the legend told of her and of her love to pururavas a story that is true only of the sun and the dawn i 407  we shall presently see that a similar story is told of persons in whom the dawn can scarcely be recognised so that the best proof is not very good  the name of pururavas again is an appropriate name for a solar hero     pururavas meant the same as greek endowed with much light for though rava is generally used of sound yet the root ru which means originally to cry is also applied to colour in the sense of a loud or crying colour that is red 69a  violet also according to sir g w cox 69b is a loud or crying colour  the word greek as applied to colour is traced by professor max muller to the root i as denoting a crying hue that is a loud colour  it is interesting to learn that our aryan fathers spoke of loud colours and were so sensitive as to think violet loud  besides pururavas calls himself vasistha which as we know is a name of the sun and if he is called aido the son of ida the same name is elsewhere given 69c to agni the fire  the conclusion of the argument is that antiquity spoke of the naked sun and of the chaste dawn hiding her face when she had seen her husband  yet she says she will come again  and after the sun has travelled through the world in search of his beloved when he comes to the threshold of death and is going to end his solitary life she appears again in the gloaming the same as the dawn as eos in homer begins and ends the day and she carries him away to the golden seats of the immortals 69d  kuhn objects to all this explanation partly on what we think the inadequate ground that there is no necessary connection between the story of urvasi thus interpreted and the ritual of sacred firelighting connections of that sort were easily invented at random by the compilers of the brahmanas in their existing form  coming to the analysis of names kuhn finds in urvasi a weakening of urvanki uru  anc like yuvaca from yuvanka latin juvencus    the accent is of no decisive weight  kuhn will not be convinced that pururavas is the sun and is unmoved by the ingenious theory of a crying colour denoted by his name and the inference supported by such words as rufus that crying colours are red and therefore appropriate names of the red sun  the connection between pururavas and agni fire is what appeals to kuhnand in short where mr muller sees a myth of sun and dawn kuhn recognises a firemyth  roth again whose own name means red far from thinking that urvasi is the chaste dawn interprets her name as die geile that is lecherous lascivious lewd wanton obscene while pururavas as the roarer suggests the bull in rut  in accordance with these views roth explains the myth in a fashion of his own 70a  here then as kuhn says we have three essentially different modes of interpreting the myth 70b all three founded on philological analysis of the names in the story  no better example could be given to illustrate the weakness of the philological method  in the first place that method relies on names as the primitive relics and germs of the tale although the tale may occur where the names have never been heard and though the names are presumably late additions to a story in which the characters were originally anonymous  again the most illustrious etymologists differ absolutely about the true sense of the names  kuhn sees fire everywhere and firemyths mr muller sees dawn and dawnmyths schwartz sees storm and stormmyths and so on  as the orthodox teachers are thus at variance so that there is no safety in orthodoxy we may attempt to use our heterodox method  none of the three scholars whose views we have glanced atneither roth kuhn nor mr mullerlays stress on the saying of urvasi never let me see you without your royal garments for this is the custom of women 71  to our mind these words contain the gist of the myth  there must have been at some time a custom which forbade women to see their husbands without their garments or the words have no meaning  if any custom of this kind existed a story might well be evolved to give a sanction to the law  you must never see your husband naked think what happened to urvasishe vanished clean away  this is the kind of warning which might be given  if the customary prohibition had grown obsolete the punishment might well be assigned to a being of another a spiritual race in which old human ideas lingered as the neolithic dread of iron lingers in the welsh fairies  our method will be to prove the existence of singular rules of etiquette corresponding to the etiquette accidentally infringed by pururavas  we shall then investigate stories of the same character as that of urvasi and pururavas in which the infringement of the etiquette is chastised  it will be seen that in most cases the bride is of a peculiar and perhaps supernatural race  finally the tale of urvasi will be taken up again will be shown to conform in character to the other stories examined and will be explained as a myth told to illustrate or sanction a nuptial etiquette  the lives of savages are bound by the most closelywoven fetters of custom  the simplest acts are tabooed a strict code regulates all intercourse  married life especially moves in the strangest fetters there will be nothing remarkable in the wide distribution of a myth turning on nuptial etiquette if this law of nuptial etiquette proves to be also widely distributed  that it is widely distributed we now propose to demonstrate by examples  the custom of the african people of the kingdom of futa is or was even stricter than the vedic custom of womenwives never permit their husbands to see them unveiled for three years after their marriage 72  in his travels to timbuctoo i 94 caillie says that the bridegroom is not allowed to see his intended during the day  he has a tabooed hut apart and if he is obliged to come out he covers his face  he remains with his wife only till daybreaklike cupidand flees like cupid before the light  among the australians the chief deity if deity such a being can be called pundjel has a wife whose face he has never seen probably in compliance with some primaeval etiquette or taboo 73a  among the yorubas conventional modesty forbids a woman to speak to her husband or even to see him if it can be avoided 73b  of the iroquois lafitau says ils nosent aller dans les cabanes particulieres ou habitent leurs epouses que durant lobscurite de la nuit 73c  the circassian women live on distant terms with their lords till they become mothers 73d  similar examples of reserve are reported to be customary among the fijians  in backward parts of europe a strange custom forbids the bride to speak to her lord as if in memory of a time when husband and wife were always of alien tribes and as among the caribs spoke different languages  in the bulgarian volkslied the sun marries grozdanka a mortal girl her mother addresses her thus     grozdanka mothers treasure mine    for nine long years i nourished thee    for nine months see thou do not speak    to thy first love that marries thee  m dozon who has collected the bulgarian songs says that this custom of prolonged silence on the part of the bride is very common in bulgaria though it is beginning to yield to a sense of the ludicrous 74a  in sparta and in crete as is well known the bridegroom was long the victim of a somewhat similar taboo and was only permitted to seek the company of his wife secretly and in the dark like the iroquois described by lafitau  herodotus tells us i 146 that some of the old ionian colonists brought no women with them but took wives of the women of the carians whose fathers they had slain  therefore the women made a law for themselves and handed it down to their daughters that they should never sit at meat with their husbands and that none should ever call her husband by his name  in precisely the same way in zululand the wife may not mention her husbands name just as in the welsh fairy tale the husband may not even know the name of his fairy bride on pain of losing her for ever  these ideas about names and freakish ways of avoiding the use of names mark the childhood of languages according to mr max muller 74b and therefore the childhood of society  the kaffirs call this etiquette hlonipa  it applies to women as well as men  a kaffir bride is not called by her own name in her husbands village but is spoken of as mother of so and so even before she has borne a child the universal superstition about names is at the bottom of this custom the aleutian islanders according to dall are quite distressed when obliged to speak to their wives in the presence of others  the fijians did not know where to look when missionaries hinted that a man might live under the same roof as his wife 75a  among the turkomans for six months a year or two years a husband is only allowed to visit his wife by stealth  the number of these instances could probably be increased by a little research  our argument is that the widely distributed myths in which a husband or a wife transgresses some customsees the others face or body or utters the forbidden namemight well have arisen as tales illustrating the punishment of breaking the rule  by a very curious coincidence a breton sailors tale of the cupid and psyche class is confessedly founded on the existence of the rule of nuptial etiquette 75b  in this story the son of a boulogne pilot marries the daughter of the king of nazwherever that may be  in naz a man is never allowed to see the face of his wife till she has borne him a childa modification of the futa rule  the inquisitive french husband unveils his wife and like psyche in apuleius drops wax from a candle on her cheek  when the pair return to naz the king of that country discovers the offence of the husband and by the aid of his magicians transforms the frenchman into a monster  here we have the old formulathe infringement of a taboo and the magical punishmentadapted to the ideas of breton peasantry  the essential point of the story for our purpose is that the veiling of the bride is the custom of women in the mysterious land of naz  cest lusage du pays les maris ne voient leurs femmes sans voile que lorsquelles sont devenues meres  now our theory of the myth of urvasi is simply this the custom of women which pururavas transgresses is probably a traditional aryan law of nuptial etiquette lusage du pays once prevalent among the people of india  if our view be correct then several rules of etiquette and not one alone will be illustrated in the stories which we suppose the rules to have suggested  in the case of urvasi and pururavas the rule was not to see the husband naked  in cupid and psyche the husband was not to be looked upon at all  in the wellknown myth of melusine the bride is not to be seen naked  melusine tells her lover that she will only abide with him dum ipsam nudam non viderit 76a  the same taboo occurs in a dutch marchen 76b  we have now to examine a singular form of the myth in which the strange bride is not a fairy or spiritual being but an animal  in this class of story the husband is usually forbidden to perform some act which will recall to the bride the associations of her old animal existence  the converse of the tale is the wellknown legend of the forsaken merman  the king of the sea permits his human wife to go to church  the ancient sacred associations are revived and the woman returns no more     she will not come though you call all day    come away come away  now in the tales of the animal bride it is her associations with her former life among the beasts that are not to be revived and when they are reawakened by the commission of some act which she has forbidden or the neglect of some precaution which she has enjoined she like urvasi disappears        the best known example of this variant of the tale is the story of bheki in sanskrit  mr max muller has interpreted the myth in accordance with his own method 77  his difficulty is to account for the belief that a king might marry a frog  our ancestors he remarks were not idiots how then could they tell such a story  we might reply that our ancestors if we go far enough back were savages and that such stories are the staple of savage myth  mr muller however holds that an accidental corruption of language reduced aryan fancy to the savage level  he explains the corruption thus we find in sanskrit that bheki the frog was a beautiful girl and that one day when sitting near a well she was discovered by a king who asked her to be his wife she consented on condition that he should never show her a drop of water  one day being tired she asked the king for water the king forgot his promise brought water and bheki disappeared  this myth mr muller holds began with a short saying such as that bheki the sun will die at the sight of water as we should say that the sun will set when it approaches the water from which it rose in the morning  but how did the sun come to be called bheki the frog  mr muller supposes that this name was given to the sun by some poet or fisherman  he gives no evidence for the following statement it can be shown that frog was used as a name for the sun  now at sunrise and sunset when the sun was squatting on the water it was called the frog  at what historical period the sanskritspeaking race was settled in seats where the sun rose and set in water we do not know and chapter and verse are needed for the statement that frog was actually a name of the sun  mr mullers argument however is that the sun was called the frog that people forgot that the frog and sun were identical and that frog or bheki was mistaken for the name of a girl to whom was applied the old saw about dying at sight of water  and so says mr muller the change from sun to frog and from frog to man which was at first due to the mere spell of language would in our nursery tales be ascribed to miraculous charms more familiar to a later age  as a matter of fact magical metamorphoses are infinitely more familiar to the lowest savages than to people in a later age  magic as castren observes belongs to the lowest known stages of civilisation  mr mullers theory however is thisthat a sanskritspeaking people living where the sun rose out of and set in some ocean called the sun as he touched the water bheki the frog and said he would die at the sight of water  they ceased to call the sun the frog or bheki but kept the saying bheki will die at sight of water  not knowing who or what bheki might be they took her for a frog who also was a pretty wench  lastly they made the story of bhekis distinguished wedding and mysterious disappearance  for this interpretation historical and linguistic evidence is not offered  when did a sanskritspeaking race live beside a great sea  how do we know that frog was used as a name for sun        we have already given our explanation  to the savage intellect man and beast are on a level and all savage myth makes men descended from beasts while stories of the loves of gods in bestial shape or the unions of men and animals incessantly occur  unnatural as these notions seem to us no ideas are more familiar to savages and none recur more frequently in indoaryan scandinavian and greek mythology  an extant tribe in northwest america still claims descent from a frog  the wedding of bheki and the king is a survival in sanskrit of a tale of this kind  lastly bheki disappears when her associations with her old amphibious life are revived in the manner she had expressly forbidden        our interpretation may be supported by an ojibway parallel  a hunter named otterheart camping near a beaver lodge found a pretty girl loitering round his fire  she keeps his wigwam in order and lays his blanket near the deerskin she had laid for herself  good he muttered this is my wife  she refuses to eat the beavers he has shot but at night he hears a noise krch krch as if beavers were gnawing wood  he sees by the glimmer of the fire his wife nibbling birch twigs  in fact the good little wife is a beaver as the pretty indian girl was a frog  the pair lived happily till spring came and the snow melted and the streams ran full  then his wife implored the hunter to build her a bridge over every stream and river that she might cross dryfooted for she said if my feet touch water this would at once cause thee great sorrow  the hunter did as she bade him but left unbridged one tiny runnel  the wife stumbled into the water and as soon as her foot was wet she immediately resumed her old shape as a beaver her son became a beaverling and the brooklet changing to a roaring river bore them to the lake  once the hunter saw his wife again among her beast kin  to thee i sacrificed all she said and i only asked thee to help me dryfooted over the waters  thou didst cruelly neglect this  now i must remain for ever with my people        this tale was told to kohl by an old insignificant squaw among the ojibways 80a  here we have a precise parallel to the tale of bheki the frogbride and here the reason of the prohibition to touch water is made perfectly unmistakable  the touch magically revived the brides old animal life with the beavers  or was the indian name for beaver temakse once a name for the sun 80b  a curious variant of this widely distributed marchen of the animal bride is found in the mythical genealogy of the raja of chutia nagpur a chief of the naga or snake race  it is said that raja janameja prepared a yajnya or great malevolently magical incantation to destroy all the people of the serpent race  to prevent this annihilation the supernatural being pundarika nag took a human form and became the husband of the beautiful parvati daughter of a brahman  but pundarika nag being a serpent by nature could not divest himself even in human shape of his forked tongue and venomed breath  and just as urvasi could not abide with her mortal lover after he transgressed the prohibition to appear before her naked so pundarika nag was compelled by fate to leave his bride if she asked him any questions about his disagreeable peculiarities  she did at last ask questions in circumstances which made pundarika believe that he was bound to answer her  now the curse came upon him he plunged into a pool like the beaver and vanished  his wife became the mother of the serpent rajas of chutia nagpur  pundarika nag in his proper form as a great hooded snake guarded his firstborn child  the crest of the house is a hooded snake with human face 81a  here then we have many examples of the disappearance of the bride or bridegroom in consequence of infringement of various mystic rules sometimes the beloved one is seen when he or she should not be seen sometimes as in a maori story the bride vanishes merely because she is in a bad temper 81b  among the red men as in sanskrit the taboo on water is broken with the usual results  now for an example in which the rule against using names is infringed 82a  this formula constantly occurs in the welsh fairy tales published by professor rhys 82b  thus the heir of corwrion fell in love with a fairy they were married on the distinct understanding that the husband was not to know her name    and was not to strike her with iron on pain of her leaving him at once  unluckily the man once tossed her a bridle the iron bit touched the wife and she at once flew through the air and plunged headlong into corwrion lake  a number of tales turning on the same incident are published in cymmrodor v i  in these we have either the taboo on the name or the taboo on the touch of iron  in a widely diffused superstition iron drives away devils and ghosts according to the scholiast on the eleventh book of the odyssey and the oriental djinn also flee from iron 82c  just as water is fatal to the aryan frogbride and to the red indian beaverwife restoring them to their old animal forms so the magic touch of iron breaks love between the welshman and his fairy mistress the representative of the stone age  in many tales of fairybrides they are won by a kind of force  the lover in the familiar welsh and german marchen sees the swanmaidens throw off their swan plumage and dance naked  he steals the feather garb of one of them and so compels her to his love  finally she leaves him in anger or because he has broken some taboo  far from being peculiar to aryan mythology this legend occurs as mr farrer has shown 83a in algonquin and bornoese tradition  the red indian story told by schoolcraft in his algic researches is most like the aryan version but has some native peculiarities  wampee was a great hunter who on the lonely prairie once heard strains of music  looking up he saw a speck in the sky the speck drew nearer and nearer and proved to be a basket containing twelve heavenly maidens  they reached the earth and began to dance inflaming the heart of wampee with love  but wampee could not draw near the fairy girls in his proper form without alarming them  like zeus in his love adventures wampee exercised the medicinemans power of metamorphosing himself  he assumed the form of a mouse approached unobserved and caught one of the dancing maidens  after living with wampee for some time she wearied of earth and by virtue of a mystic chain of verse she ascended again to her heavenly home  now is there any reason to believe that this incident was once part of the myth of pururavas and urvasi  was the fairylove urvasi originally caught and held by pururavas among her naked and struggling companions though this does not appear to have been much noticed it seems to follow from a speech of pururavas in the vedic dialogue 83b x 95 8 9  mr max muller translates thus when i the mortal threw my arms round those flighty immortals they trembled away from me like a trembling doe like horses that kick against the cart 84a  ludwigs rendering suits our viewthat pururavas is telling how he first caught urvasistill better when i the mortal held converse with the immortals who had laid aside their raiment like slippery serpents they glided from me like horses yoked to the car  these words would well express the adventure of a lover among the naked flying swanmaidens an adventure familiar to the red men as to persian legends of the peris  to end our comparison of myths like the tale of cupid and psyche we find an example among the zulus  here 84b the mystic lover came in when all was dark and felt the damsels face  after certain rites in the morning he went away he speaking continually the girl not seeing him  during all those days he would not allow the girl sic when she said she would light a fire  finally after a magical ceremony he said light the fire and stood before her revealed a shining shape  this has a curious resemblance to the myth of cupid and psyche but a more curious detail remains  in the zulu story of ukcombekcansini the friends of a bride break a taboo and kill a tabooed animal  instantly like urvasi and her companions in the yajur veda the bride and her maidens disappear and are turned into birds 84c  they are afterwards surprised in human shape and the bride is restored to her lover  here we conclude having traced parallels to cupid and psyche in many non aryan lands  our theory of the myth does not rest on etymology  we have seen that the most renowned scholars max muller kuhn roth all analyse the names urvasi and pururavas in different ways and extract different interpretations  we have found the story where these names were probably never heard of  we interpret it as a tale of the intercourse between mortal men and immortal maids or between men and metamorphosed animals as in india and north america  we explain the separation of the lovers as the result of breaking a taboo or law of etiquette binding among men and women as well as between men and fairies        the taboos are to see the beloved unveiled to utter his or her name to touch her with a metal terrible to ghosts and spirits or to do some action which will revive the associations of a former life  we have shown that rules of nuptial etiquette resembling these in character do exist and have existed even among greeksas where the milesian like the zulu women made a law not to utter their husbands names  finally we think it a reasonable hypothesis that tales on the pattern of cupid and psyche might have been evolved wherever a curious nuptial taboo required to be sanctioned or explained by a myth  on this hypothesis the stories may have been separately invented in different lands but there is also a chance that they have been transmitted from people to people in the unknown past of our scattered and wandering race  this theory seems at least as probable as the hypothesis that the meaning of an aryan proverbial statement about sun and dawn was forgotten and was altered unconsciously into a tale which is found among various nonaryan tribes  that hypothesis again learned and ingenious as it is has the misfortune to be opposed by other scholarly hypotheses not less ingenious and learned        as for the sunfrog we may hope that he has sunk for ever beneath the western wave     a fartravelled tale   a modern novelist has boasted that her books are read from tobolsk to tangiers  this is a wide circulation but the widest circulation in the world has probably been achieved by a story whose author unlike ouida will never be known to fame  the tale which we are about to examine is perhaps of all myths the most widely diffused yet there is no ready way of accounting for its extraordinary popularity  any true naturemyth any myth which accounts for the processes of nature or the aspects of natural phenomena may conceivably have been invented separately wherever men in an early state of thought observed the same facts and attempted to explain them by telling a story  thus we have seen that the earlier part of the myth of cronus is a naturemyth setting forth the cause of the separation of heaven and earth  starmyths again are everywhere similar because men who believed all nature to be animated and personal accounted for the grouping of constellations in accordance with these crude beliefs 87  once more if a story like that of cupid and psyche be found among the most diverse races the distribution becomes intelligible if the myth was invented to illustrate or enforce a widely prevalent custom  but in the following story no such explanation is even provisionally acceptable  the gist of the tale which has many different openings and conclusions in different places may be stated thus a young man is brought to the home of a hostile animal a giant cannibal wizard or a malevolent king  he is put by his unfriendly host to various severe trials in which it is hoped that he will perish  in each trial he is assisted by the daughter of his host  after achieving the adventures he elopes with the girl and is pursued by her father  the runaway pair throw various common objects behind them which are changed into magical obstacles and check the pursuit of the father  the myth has various endings usually happy in various places  another form of the narrative is known in which the visitors to the home of the hostile being are not wooers of his daughter but brothers of his wife 88  the incidents of the flight in this variant are still of the same character  finally when the flight is that of a brother from his sisters malevolent ghost in hades japan or of two sisters from a cannibal mother or stepmother zulu and samoyed the events of the flight and the magical aids to escape remain little altered  we shall afterwards see that attempts have been made to interpret one of these narratives as a naturemyth but the attempts seem unsuccessful  we are therefore at a loss to account for the wide diffusion of this tale unless it has been transmitted slowly from people to people in the immense unknown prehistoric past of the human race        before comparing the various forms of the myth in its first shapethat which tells of the mortal lover and the giants or wizards daughterlet us give the scottish version of the story  this version was written down for me many years ago by an aged lady in morayshire  i published it in the revue celtique but it is probably new to storycomparers in its broad scotch variant    nicht nought nothing      there once lived a king and a queen  they were long married and had    no bairns but at last the queen had a bairn when the king was away    in far countries  the queen would not christen the bairn till the    king came back and she said we will just call him nicht nought    nothing until his father comes home  but it was long before he came    home and the boy had grown a nice little laddie  at length the king    was on his way back but he had a big river to cross and there was a    spate and he could not get over the water  but a giant came up to    him and said if you will give me nicht nought nothing i will carry    you over the water on my back  the king had never heard that his son    was called nicht nought nothing and so he promised him  when the    king got home again he was very happy to see his wife again and his    young son  she told him that she had not given the child any name but    nicht nought nothing until he should come home again himself  the    poor king was in a terrible case  he said what have i done  i    promised to give the giant who carried me over the river on his back    nicht nought nothing  the king and the queen were sad and sorry but    they said when the giant comes we will give him the henwifes    bairn he will never know the difference  the next day the giant    came to claim the kings promise and he sent for the henwifes    bairn and the giant went away with the bairn on his back  he    travelled till he came to a big stone and there he sat down to rest    he said     hidge hodge on my back what time of day is it  the poor little    bairn said it is the time that my mother the henwife takes up the    eggs for the queens breakfast     the giant was very angry and dashed the bairn on the stone and killed    it              the same adventure is repeated with the gardeners son              then the giant went back to the kings house and said he would    destroy them all if they did not give him nicht nought nothing this    time  they had to do it and when he came to the big stone the giant    said what time of day is it  nicht nought nothing said it is the    time that my father the king will be sitting down to supper  the    giant said ive got the richt ane noo and took nicht nought    nothing to his own house and brought him up till he was a man     the giant had a bonny dochter and she and the lad grew very fond of    each other  the giant said one day to nicht nought nothing ive    work for you tomorrow  there is a stable seven miles long and seven    miles broad and it has not been cleaned for seven years and you must    clean it tomorrow or i will have you for my supper     the giants dochter went out next morning with the lads breakfast    and found him in a terrible state for aye as he cleaned out a bit it    aye fell in again  the giants dochter said she would help him and    she cried a the beasts of the field and a the fowls o the air and    in a minute they a came and carried awa everything that was in the    stable and made a clean before the giant came home  he said shame    for the wit that helped you but i have a worse job for you    tomorrow  then he told nicht nought nothing that there was a loch    seven miles long and seven miles deep and seven miles broad and he    must drain it the next day or else he would have him for his supper    nicht nought nothing began early next morning and tried to lave the    water with his pail but the loch was never getting any less and he    did no ken what to do but the giants dochter called on all the fish    in the sea to come and drink the water and very soon they drank it    dry  when the giant saw the work done he was in a rage and said    ive a worse job for you tomorrow there is a tree seven miles high    and no branch on it till you get to the top and there is a nest and    you must bring down the eggs without breaking one or else i will have    you for my supper  at first the giants dochter did not know how to    help nicht nought nothing but she cut off first her fingers and then    her toes and made steps of them and he clomb the tree and got all    the eggs safe till he came to the bottom and then one was broken  the    giants dochter advised him to run away and she would follow him  so    he travelled till he came to a kings palace and the king and queen    took him in and were very kind to him  the giants dochter left her    fathers house and he pursued her and was drowned  then she came to    the kings palace where nicht nought nothing was  and she went up    into a tree to watch for him  the gardeners dochter going to draw    water in the well saw the shadow of the lady in the water and    thought it was herself and said if im so bonny if im so brave    do you send me to draw water  the gardeners wife went out and she    said the same thing  then the gardener went himself and brought the    lady from the tree and led her in  and he told her that a stranger    was to marry the kings dochter and showed her the man and it was    nicht nought nothing asleep in a chair  and she saw him and cried to    him waken waken and speak to me  but he would not waken and    syne she cried     i cleaned the stable i laved the loch and i clamb the tree          and all for the love of thee          and thou wilt not waken and speak to me     the king and the queen heard this and came to the bonny young lady    and she said     i canna get nicht nought nothing to speak to me for all that i can    do     then were they greatly astonished when she spoke of nicht nought    nothing and asked where he was and she said he that sits there in    the chair  then they ran to him and kissed him and called him their    own dear son and he wakened and told them all that the giants    dochter had done for him and of all her kindness  then they took her    in their arms and kissed her and said she should now be their    dochter for their son should marry her     and they lived happy all their days  in this variant of the story which we may use as our text it is to be noticed that a lacuna exists  the narrative of the flight omits to mention that the runaways threw things behind them which became obstacles in the giants way  one of these objects probably turned into a lake in which the giant was drowned 92  a common incident is the throwing behind of a comb which changes into a thicket  the formula of leaving obstacles behind occurs in the indian collection the kathasarit sagara vii xxxix  the battle of the birds in campbells tales of the west highlands is a very copious gaelic variant  russian parallels are vasilissa the wise and the water king and the king bear 93a  the incident of the flight and the magical obstacles is found in japanese mythology 93b  the ugly woman of hades is sent to pursue the hero he casts down his black headdress and it is instantly turned into grapes he fled while she was eating them  again he cast down his multitudinous and closetoothed comb and it instantly turned into bamboo sprouts  in the gaelic version the pursuer is detained by talkative objects which the pursued leave at home and this marvel recurs in zululand and is found among the bushmen  the zulu versions are numerous 93c  oddly enough in the last variant the girl performs no magic feat but merely throws sesamum on the ground to delay the cannibals for cannibals are very fond of sesamum 93d        here then we have the remarkable details of the flight in zulu gaelic norse malagasy 93e russian italian japanese  of all incidents in the myth the incidents of the flight are most widely known but the whole connected series of eventsthe coming of the wooer the love of the hostile beings daughter the tasks imposed on the wooer the aid rendered by the daughter the flight of the pair the defeat or destruction of the hostile beingall these or most of these are extant in due sequence among the following races  the greeks have the tale the people of madagascar have it the lowland scotch the celts the russians the italians the algonquins the finns and the samoans have it  now if the story were confined to the aryan race we might account for its diffusion by supposing it to be the common heritage of the indoeuropean peoples carried everywhere with them in their wanderings  but when the tale is found in madagascar north america samoa and among the finns while many scattered incidents occur in even more widely severed races such as zulus bushmen japanese eskimo samoyeds the aryan hypothesis becomes inadequate  to show how closely all things considered the aryan and nonaryan possessors of the tale agree let us first examine the myth of jason        the earliest literary reference to the myth of jason is in the iliad vii 467 xxiii 747  here we read of euneos a son whom hypsipyle bore to jason in lemnos  already even in the iliad the legend of argos voyage has been fitted into certain wellknown geographical localities  a reference in the odyssey xii 72 has a more antique ring we are told that of all barques argo alone escaped the jaws of the rocks wandering which clashed together and destroyed ships  argo escaped it is said because jason was dear to hera  it is plain from various fragmentary notices that hesiod was familiar with several of the adventures in the legend of jason  in the theogony 993998 hesiod mentions the essential facts of the legend how jason carried off from aeetes his daughter after achieving the adventures many and grievous which were laid upon him  at what period the home of aeetes was placed in colchis it is not easy to determine  mimnermus a contemporary of solon makes the home of aeetes lie on the brink of ocean a very vague description 95  pindar on the other hand in the splendid fourth pythian ode already knows colchis as the scene of the loves and flight of jason and medea       long were it for me to go by the beaten track says pindar and i know a certain short path  like pindar we may abridge the tale of jason  he seeks the golden fleece in colchis aeetes offers it to him as a prize for success in certain labours  by the aid of medea the daughter of aeetes the wizardking jason tames the firebreathing oxen yokes them to the plough and drives a furrow  by medeas help he conquers the children of the teeth of the dragon subdues the snake that guards the fleece of gold and escapes but is pursued by aeetes  to detain aeetes medea throws behind the mangled remains of her own brother apsyrtos and the colchians pursue no further than the scene of this bloody deed  the savagery of this act survives even in the work of a poet so late as apollonius rhodius iv 477 where we read how jason performed a rite of savage magic mutilating the body of apsyrtos in a manner which was believed to appease the avenging ghost of the slain  thrice he tasted the blood thrice spat it out between his teeth a passage which the scholiast says contains the description of an archaic custom popular among murderers  beyond tomi where a popular etymology fixed the cutting up of apsyrtos we need not follow the fortunes of jason and medea  we have already seen the wooer come to the hostile being win his daughters love achieve the adventures by her aid and flee in her company delaying by a horrible device the advance of the pursuers  to these incidents in the tale we confine our attention  many explanations of the jason myth have been given by scholars who thought they recognised elemental phenomena in the characters  as usual these explanations differ widely  whenever a myth has to be interpreted it is certain that one set of scholars will discover the sun and the dawn where another set will see the thundercloud and lightning  the moon is thrown in at pleasure  sir g w cox determines 96 that the name jason iason must be classed with the many others iasion iamus iolaus iaso belonging to the same root  well what is the root apparently the root is the root i as denoting a crying colour that is a loud colour ii 81  seemingly i 229 violet is a loud colour and wherever you have the root i you have the violettinted morning from which the sun is born  medea is the daughter of the sun and most likely in her beneficent aspect is the dawn  but ii 81 note ios has another meaning which as a spear represents the fardarting ray of the sun so that in one way or another jason is connected with the violettinted morning or with the suns rays  this is the gist of the theory of sir george cox  preller 97a is another scholar with another set of etymologies  jason is derived he thinks from greek to heal because jason studied medicine under the centaur chiron  this is the view of the scholiast on apollonius rhodius i 554  jason to prellers mind is a form of asclepius a spirit of the spring with its soft suns and fertile rains medea is the moon  medea on the other hand is a lightning goddess in the opinion of schwartz 97b  no philological reason is offered meanwhile in sir george coxs system the equivalent of medea in her beneficent aspect is the dawn  we must suppose it seems that either the soft spring rains and the moon or the dawn and the sun or the lightning and the thundercloud in one arrangement or another irresistibly suggested to early aryan minds the picture of a wooer arriving in a hostile home winning a maidens love achieving adventures by her aid fleeing with her from her angry father and delaying his pursuit by various devices  why the spring the moon the lightning the dawnany of them or all of themshould have suggested such a tale let scholars determine when they have reconciled their own differences  it is more to our purpose to follow the myth among samoans algonquins and finns  none of these races speak an aryan language and none can have been beguiled into telling the same sort of tale by a disease of aryan speech  samoa where we find our story is the name of a group of volcanic islands in central polynesia  they are about 3000 miles from sidney were first observed by europeans in 1722 and are as far removed as most spots from direct aryan influences  our position is however that in the shiftings and migrations of peoples the jason tale has somehow been swept like a piece of driftwood on to the coasts of samoa  in the islands the tale has an epical form and is chanted in a poem of twenty six stanzas  there is something greek in the free and happy life of the samoanssomething greek too in this myth of theirs  there was once a youth siati famous for his singing a young thamyris of samoa  but as according to homer the muses met thamyris the thracian and made an end of his singing for he boasted and said that he would vanquish even the muses if he sang against them so did the samoan god of song envy siati the god and the mortal sang a match the daughter of the god was to be the mortals prize if he proved victorious  siati won and he set off riding on a shark as arion rode the dolphin to seek the home of the defeated deity  at length he reached the shores divine and thither strayed puapae daughter of the god looking for her comb which she had lost  siati said she how camest thou hither  i am come to seek the songgod and to wed his daughter  my father said the maiden is more a god than a man eat nothing he hands you never sit on a high seat lest death follow  so they were united in marriage  but the god like aeetes was wroth and began to set siati upon perilous tasks build me a house and let it be finished this very day else death and the oven await thee 99a  siati wept but the gods daughter had the house built by the evening the other adventures were to fight a fierce dog and to find a ring lost at sea  just as the scotch giants daughter cut off her fingers to help her lover so the samoan gods daughter bade siati cut her body into pieces and cast her into the sea  there she became a fish and recovered the ring  they set off to the gods house but met him pursuing them with the help of his other daughter  puapae and siati threw down the comb and it became a bush of thorns in the way to intercept the god and puanli the other daughter  next they threw down a bottle of earth which became a mountain and then followed their bottle of water and that became a sea and drowned the god and puanli 99b  this old samoan song contains nearly the closest savage parallel to the various household tales which find their heroic and artistic shape in the jason saga  still more surprising in its resemblances is the malagasy version of the narrative  in the malagasy story the conclusion is almost identical with the winding up of the scotch fairy tale  the girl hides in a tree her face seen reflected in a well is mistaken by women for their own faces and the recognition follows in due course 99c  like most red indian versions of popular tales the algonquin form of the jason saga is strongly marked with the peculiarities of the race  the story is recognisable and that is all  the opening as usual differs from other openings  two children are deserted in the wilderness and grow up to manhood  one of them loses an arrow in the water the elder brother panigwun wades after it  a magical canoe flies past an old magician who is alone in the canoe seizes panigwun and carries him off  the canoe fleets along like the barques of the phaeacians at the will of the magician and reaches the isle where like the samoan god of song he dwells with his two daughters  here my daughter said he is a young man for your husband  but the daughter knew that the proposed husband was but another victim of the old mans magic arts  by the daughters advice panigwun escaped in the magic barque consoled his brother and returned to the island  next day the magician mishosha set the young man to hard tasks and perilous adventures  he was to gather gulls eggs but the gulls attacked him in dense crowds  by an incantation he subdued the birds and made them carry him home to the island  next day he was sent to gather pebbles that he might be attacked and eaten by the king of the fishes  once more the young man like the finnish ilmarinen in pohjola subdued the mighty fish and went back triumphant  the third adventure as in nicht nought nothing was to climb a tree of extraordinary height in search of a birds nest  here again the youth succeeded and finally conspired with the daughters to slay the old magician  lastly the boy turned the magician into a sycamore tree and won his daughter the other daughter was given to the brother who had no share in the perils 101  here we miss the incident of the flight and the magicians daughter though in love with the hero does not aid him to perform the feats  perhaps an algonquin brave would scorn the assistance of a girl  in the kalevala the old hero wainamoinen and his friend ilmarinen set off to the mysterious and hostile land of pohjola to win a bride  the maiden of pohjola loses her heart to ilmarinen and by her aid he bridles the wolf and bear ploughs a field of adders with a plough of gold and conquers the gigantic pike that swims in the styx of finnish mythology  after this point the story is interrupted by a long sequel of popular bridal songs and in the wandering course of the rather aimless epic the flight and its incidents have been forgotten or are neglected  these incidents recur however in the thread of somewhat different plots  we have seen that they are found in japan among the eskimo among the bushmen the samoyeds and the zulus as well as in hungarian magyar celtic and other european household tales  the conclusion appears to be that the central part of the jason myth is incapable of being explained either as a naturemyth or as a myth founded on a disease of language  so many languages could not take the same malady in the same way nor can we imagine any series of natural phenomena that would inevitably suggest this tale to so many diverse races  we must suppose therefore either that all wits jumped and invented the same romantic series of situations by accident or that all men spread from one centre where the story was known or that the story once invented has drifted all round the world  if the last theory be approved of the tale will be like the indian ocean shell found lately in the polish bonecave 102a or like the egyptian beads discovered in the soil of dahomey  the story will have been carried hither and thither in the remotest times to the remotest shores by traders by slaves by captives in war or by women torn from their own tribe and forcibly settled as wives among alien peoples  stories of this kind are everywhere the natural property of mothers and grandmothers  when we remember how widely diffused is the law of exogamy which forbids marriage between a man and woman of the same stock we are impressed by the number of alien elements which must have been introduced with alien wives  where husband and wife as often happened spoke different languages the woman would inevitably bring the hearthside tales of her childhood among a people of strange speech  by all these agencies working through dateless time we may account for the diffusion if we cannot explain the origin of tales like the central arrangement of incidents in the career of jason 102b     apollo and the mouse   why is apollo especially the apollo of the troad he who showered the darts of pestilence among the greeks so constantly associated with a mouse  the very name smintheus by which his favourite priest calls on him in the iliad i 39 might be rendered mouse apollo or apollo lord of mice  as we shall see later mice lived beneath the altar and were fed in the holy of holies of the god and an image of a mouse was placed beside or upon his sacred tripod  the ancients were puzzled by these things and as will be shown accounted for them by mousestories greek so styled by eustathius the mediaeval interpreter of homer  following our usual method let us ask whether similar phenomena occur elsewhere in countries where they are intelligible  did insignificant animals elsewhere receive worship were their effigies elsewhere placed in the temples of a purer creed  we find answers in the history of peruvian religion  after the spanish conquest of peru one of the european adventurers don garcilasso de la vega married an inca princess  their son also named garcilasso was born about 1540  his famous book commentarias reales contains the most authentic account of the old peruvian beliefs garcilasso was learned in all the learning of the europeans and as an inca on the mothers side had claims on the loyalty of the defeated race  he set himself diligently to collect both their priestly and popular traditions and his account of them is the more trustworthy as it coincides with what we know to have been true in lands with which garcilasso had little acquaintance        to garcilassos mind peruvian religion seems to be divided into two periodsthe age before and the age which followed the accession of the incas and their establishment of sunworship as the creed of the state in the earlier period the preinca period he tells us an indian was not accounted honourable unless he was descended from a fountain river or lake or even from the sea or from a wild animal such as a bear lion tiger eagle or the bird they call cuntur condor or some other bird of prey 104a  to these worshipful creatures men offered what they usually saw them eat i 53  but men were not content to adore large and dangerous animals  there was not an animal how vile and filthy soever that they did not worship as a god including lizards toads and frogs  in the midst of these superstitions the incas appeared  just as the tribes claimed descent from animals great or small so the incas drew their pedigree from the sun which they adored like the gens of the aurelii in rome 104b  thus every indian had his pacarissa or as the north american indians say totem 105a a natural object from which he claimed descent and which in a certain degree he worshipped  though sunworship became the established religion worship of the animal pacarissas was still tolerated  the suntemples also contained huacas or images of the beasts which the indians had venerated 105b  in the great temple of pachacamac the most spiritual and abstract god of peruvian faith they worshipped a shefox and an emerald  the devil also appeared to them and spoke in the form of a tiger very fierce 105c  this toleration of an older and cruder in subordination to a purer faith is a very common feature in religious evolution  in catholic countries to this day we may watch in holy week the adonis feast described by theocritus 105d and the procession and entombment of the old god of spring  the incas had the good policy to collect all the tribal animal gods into their temples in and round cuzco in which the two leading gods were the master of life and the sun  did a process of this sort ever occur in greek religion and were older animal gods ever collected into the temples of such deities as apollo        while a great deal of scattered evidence about many animals consecrated to greek gods points in this direction it will be enough for the present to examine the case of the sacred mice  among races which are still in the totemistic stage which still claim descent from animals and from other objects a peculiar marriage law generally exists or can be shown to have existed  no man may marry a woman who is descended from the same ancestral animal and who bears the same totemname and carries the same badge or family crest as himself  a man descended from the crane and whose family name is crane cannot marry a woman whose family name is crane  he must marry a woman of the wolf or turtle or swan or other name and her children keep her family title not his  thus if a crane man marries a swan woman the children are swans and none of them may marry a swan they must marry turtles wolves or what not and their children again are turtles or wolves  thus there is necessarily an eternal come and go of all the animal names known in a district  as civilisation advances these rules grow obsolete  people take their names from the father as among ourselves  finally the dwellers in a given district having become united into a local tribe are apt to drop the various animal titles and to adopt as the name of the whole tribe the name of the chief or of the predominating family let us imagine a district of some twenty miles in which there are crane wolf turtle and swan families  long residence together and common interests have welded them into a local tribe  the chief is of the wolf family and the tribe sinking family differences and family names calls itself the wolves  such tribes were probably in the beginning the inhabitants of the various egyptian towns which severally worshipped the wolf or the sheep or the crocodile and abstained religiously except on certain sacrificial occasions from the flesh of the animal that gave them its name 107        it has taken us long to reach the sacred mice of greek religion but we are now in a position to approach their august divinity  we have seen that the sunworship superseded without abolishing the tribal pacarissas in peru and that the huacas or images of the sacred animals were admitted under the roof of the temple of the sun  now it is recognised that the temples of the sminthian apollo contained images of sacred mice among other animals and our argument is that here perhaps we have another example of the peruvian religious evolution  just as in peru the tribes adored vile and filthy animals just as the solar worship of the incas subordinated these just as the huacas of the beasts remained in the temples of the peruvian sun so we believe the tribes along the mediterranean coasts had at some very remote prehistoric period their animal pacarissas these were subordinated to the religion to some extent solar of apollo and the huacas or animal idols survived in apollos temples        if this theory be correct we shall probably find the mouse for example revered as a sacred animal in many places  this would necessarily follow if the marriage customs which we have described ever prevailed on greek soil and scattered the mousename far and wide 108a  traces of the mouse families and of adoration if adoration there was of the mouse would linger on in the following shapes1 places would be named from mice and mice would be actually held sacred in themselves 2 the mousename would be given locally to the god who superseded the mouse  3 the figure of the mouse would be associated with the god and used as a badge or a kind of crest or local mark in places where the mouse has been a venerated animal  4 finally myths would be told to account for the sacredness of a creature so undignified  let us take these considerations in their order  1 if there were local mice tribes deriving their name from the worshipful mouse certain towns settled by these tribes would retain a reverence for mice  in chrysa a town of the troad according to heraclides ponticus mice were held sacred the local name for mouse being greek  many places bore this mousename according to strabo 108b  this is precisely what would have occurred had the mouse totem and the mouse stock been widely distributed 108c  the scholiast 109a mentions sminthus as a place in the troad  strabo speaks of two places deriving their name from sminthus or mouse near the sminthian temple and others near larissa in rhodes and lindus the mouse placename recurs and in many other districts greek  strabo x 486 names caressus and poeessa in ceos among the other places which had sminthian temples and presumably were once centres of tribes named after the mouse  here then are a number of localities in which the mouse apollo was adored and where the old mousename lingered  that the mice were actually held sacred in their proper persons we learn from aelian  the dwellers in hamaxitus of the troad worship mice says aelian  in the temple of apollo smintheus mice are nourished and food is offered to them at the public expense and white mice dwell beneath the altar 109b  in the same way we found that the peruvians fed their sacred beasts on what they usually saw them eat  2 the second point in our argument has already been sufficiently demonstrated  the mousename smintheus was given to apollo in all the places mentioned by strabo and many others  3 the figure of the mouse will be associated with the god and used as a badge or crest or local mark in places where the mouse has been a venerated animal  the passage already quoted from aelian informs us that there stood an effigy of the mouse beside the tripod of apollo  in chrysa according to strabo xiii 604 the statue of apollo smintheus had a mouse beneath his foot  the mouse on the tripod of apollo is represented on a basrelief illustrating the plague and the offerings of the greeks to apollo smintheus as described in the first book of the iliad 110a        the mouse is a not uncommon local badge or crest in greece  the animals whose figures are stamped on coins like the athenian owl are the most ancient marks of cities  it is a plausible conjecture that just as the iroquois when they signed treaties with the europeans used their totemsbear wolf and turtleas seals 110b so the animals on archaic greek city coins represented crests or badges which at some far more remote period had been totems  the argives according to pollux 110c stamped the mouse on their coins 110d  as there was a temple of apollo smintheus in tenedos we naturally hear of a mouse on the coins of the island 111a  golzio has published one of these mouse coins  the people of metapontum stamped their money with a mouse gnawing an ear of corn  the people of cumae employed a mouse dormant  paoli fancied that certain mice on roman medals might be connected with the family of mus but this is rather guesswork 111b  we have now shown traces at least of various ways in which an early tribal religion of the mousethe mouse pacarissa as the peruvians saidmay have been perpetuated  when we consider that the superseding of the mouse by apollo must have occurred if it did occur long before homer we may rather wonder that the mouse left his mark on greek religion so long  we have seen mice revered a god with a mousename the mousename recurring in many places the huaca or idol of the mouse preserved in the temples of the god and the mousebadge used in several widely severed localities  it remains 4 to examine the myths about mice  these in our opinion were probably told to account for the presence of the huaca of the mouse in temples and for the occurrence of the animal in religion and his connection with apollo  a singular mousemyth narrated by herodotus is worth examining for reasons which will appear later though the events are said to have happened on egyptian soil 111c  according to herodotus one sethos a priest of hephaestus ptah was king of egypt  he had disgraced the military class and he found himself without an army when sennacherib invaded his country  sethos fell asleep in the temple and the god appearing to him in a vision told him that divine succour would come to the egyptians 112a  in the night before the battle fieldmice gnawed the quivers and shieldhandles of the foe who fled on finding themselves thus disarmed  and now says herodotus there standeth a stone image of this king in the temple of hephaestus and in the hand of the image a mouse and there is this inscription let whoso looketh on me be pious  prof sayce 112b holds that there was no such person as sethos but that the legend is evidently egyptian not greek and the name of sennacherib as well as the fact of the assyrian attack is correct  the legend also though egyptian is an echo of the biblical account of the destruction of the assyrian army an account which omits the mice  as to the mice here says prof sayce we have to do again with the greek dragomen sic  the story of sethos was attached to the statue of some deity which was supposed to hold a mouse in its hand  it must have been easy to verify this supposition but mr sayce adds mice were not sacred in egypt nor were they used as symbols or found on the monuments  to this remark we may suggest some exceptions  apparently this one mouse was found on the monuments  wilkinson iii 264 says mice do occur in the sculptures but they were not sacred  rats however were certainly sacred and as little distinction is taken in myth between rats and mice as between rabbits and hares  the rat was sacred to ra the sungod and like all totems was not to be eaten 113a  this association of the rat and the sun cannot but remind us of apollo and his mouse  according to strabo a certain city of egypt did worship the shrewmouse  the athribitae or dwellers in crocodilopolis are the people to whom he attributes this cult which he mentions xvii 813 among the other local animalworships of egypt 113b  several porcelain examples of the fieldmouse sacred to horus commonly called apollo by the greeks may be seen in the british museum  that rats and fieldmice were sacred in egypt then we may believe on the evidence of the ritual of strabo and of many relics of egyptian art  herodotus moreover is credited when he says that the statue had a mouse on its hand  elsewhere it is certain that the story of mice gnawing the bowstrings occurs frequently as an explanation of mouseworship  one of the trojan mousestories ranthat emigrants had set out in prehistoric times from crete  the oracle advised them to settle wherever they were attacked by the children of the soil  at hamaxitus in the troad they were assailed in the night by mice which ate all that was edible of their armour and bowstrings  the colonists made up their mind that these mice were the children of the soil settled there and adored the mouse apollo 114a  a myth of this sort may either be a story invented to explain the mousename or a mouse tribe like the red indian wolves or crows may actually have been settled on the spot and may even have resisted invasion 114b  another myth of the troad accounted for the worship of the mouse apollo on the hypothesis that he had once freed the land from mice like the pied piper of hamelin whose pipe still serviceable is said to have been found in his grave by men who were digging a mine 114c  stories like these stories attributing some great deliverance to the mouse or some deliverance from mice to the god would naturally spring up among people puzzled by their own worship of the mousegod or of the mouse  we have explained the religious character of mice as the relics of a past age in which the mouse had been a totem and mouse family names had been widely diffused  that there are and have been mice totems and mouse family names among semitic stocks round the mediterranean is proved by prof robertson smith 115a achbor the mouse is an edomite name apparently a stock name as the jerboa and another mousename are among the arabs  the same name occurs in judah  where totemism exists the members of each stock either do not eat the ancestral animal at all or only eat him on rare sacrificial occasions  the totem of a hostile stock may be eaten by way of insult  in the case of the mouse isaiah seems to refer to one or other of these practices lxvi they that sanctify themselves and purify themselves in the gardens behind one tree in the midst eating swines flesh and the abomination and the mouse shall be consumed together saith the lord  this is like the egyptian prohibition to eat the abominable that is tabooed or forbidden rat of ra  if the unclean animals of israel were originally the totems of each clan then the mouse was a totem 115b for the chosen people were forbidden to eat the weasel and the mouse and the tortoise after his kind  that unclean beasts beasts not to be eaten were originally totems prof robertson smith infers from ezekiel viii 10 11 where we find seventy of the elders of israelthat is the heads of housesworshipping in a chamber which had on its walls the figures of all manner of unclean tabooed creeping things and quadrupeds even all the idols of the house of israel  some have too hastily concluded that the mouse was a sacred animal among the neighbouring philistines after the philistines had captured the ark and set it in the house of dagon the people were smitten with disease  they therefore in accordance with a wellknown savage magical practice made five golden representations of the diseased part and five golden mice as a trespass offering to the lord of israel and so restored the ark 116 such votive offerings are common still in catholic countries and the mice of gold by no means prove that the philistines had ever worshipped mice        turning to india from the mediterranean basin and the aryan semitic and egyptian tribes on its coasts we find that the mouse was the sacred animal of rudra  the mouse rudra is thy beast says the yajur veda as rendered by grohmann in his apollo smintheus  grohmann recognises in rudra a deity with most of the characteristics of apollo  in later indian mythology the mouse is an attribute of ganeca who like apollo smintheus is represented in art with his foot upon a mouse  such are the chief appearances of the mouse in ancient religion  if he really was a semitic totem it may perhaps be argued that his prevalence in connection with apollo is the result of a semitic leaven in hellenism  hellenic invaders may have found semitic mousetribes at home and incorporated the alien stock deity with their own apolloworship  in that case the mouse while still originally a totem would not be an aryan totem  but probably the myths and rites of the mouse and their diffusion are more plausibly explained on our theory than on that of de gubernatis the pagan sungod crushes under his foot the mouse of night  when the cats away the mice may play the shadows of night dance when the moon is absent 117a  this is one of the quaintest pieces of mythological logic  obviously when the cat the moon is away the mice the shadows cannot play there is no light to produce a shadow  as usually chances the scholars who try to resolve all the features of myth into physical phenomena do not agree among themselves about the mouse  while the mouse is the night according to m de gubernatis in grohmanns opinion the mouse is the lightning  he argues that the lightning was originally regarded by the aryan race as the flashing tooth of a beast especially of a mouse  afterwards men came to identify the beast with his teeth and behold the lightning and the mouse are convertible mythical terms  now it is perfectly true that savages regard many elemental phenomena from eclipses to the rainbow as the result of the action of animals  the rainbow is a serpent 117b thunder is caused by the thunderbird who has actually been shot in dacotah and who is familiar to the zulus while rain is the milk of a heavenly cowan idea recurring in the zend avesta  but it does not follow because savages believe in these meteorological beasts that all the beasts in myth were originally meteorological  man raised a serpent to the skies perhaps but his interest in the animal began on earth not in the clouds  it is excessively improbable and quite unproved that any race ever regarded lightning as the flashes of a mouses teeth  the hypothesis is a jeu desprit like the opposite hypothesis about the mouse of night  in these and all the other current theories of the sminthian apollo the widely diffused worship of ordinary mice and such small deer has been either wholly neglected or explained by the first theory of symbolism that occurred to the conjecture of a civilised observer  the facts of savage animalworship and their relations to totemism seem still unknown to or unappreciated by scholars with the exception of mr sayce who recognises totemism as the origin of the zoomorphic element in egyptian religion  our explanation whether adequate or not is not founded on an isolated case  if apollo superseded and absorbed the worship of the mouse he did no less for the wolf the ram the dolphin and several other animals whose images were associated with his own  the greek religion was more refined and anthropomorphic than that of egypt  in egypt the animals were still adored and the images of the gods had bestial heads  in greece only a few gods and chiefly in very archaic statues had bestial heads but beside the other deities the sculptor set the owl eagle wolf serpent tortoise mouse or whatever creature was the local favourite of the deity 118a  probably the deity had in the majority of cases superseded the animal and succeeded to his honours  but the conservative religious sentiment retained the beast within the courts and in the suit and service of the anthropomorphic god 118b  the process by which the god ousted the beasts may perhaps be observed in samoa  there as dr turner tells us in his samoa each family has its own sacred animal which it may not eat  if this law be transgressed the malefactor is supernaturally punished in a variety of ways  but while each family has thus its totem four or five different families recognise in owl crab lizard and so on incarnations of the same god say of tongo  if tongo had a temple among these families we can readily believe that images of the various beasts in which he was incarnate would be kept within the consecrated walls  savage ideas like these if they were ever entertained in greece would account for the holy animals of the different deities  but it is obvious that the phenomena which we have been studying may be otherwise explained  it may be said that the sminthian apollo was only revered as the enemy and opponent of mice  st gertrude whose heart was eaten by mice has the same role in france 119  the worship of apollo and the badge of the mouse would on this principle be diffused by colonies from some centre of the faith  the images of mice in apollos temples would be nothing more than votive offerings  thus in the church of a saxon town the verger shows a silver mouse dedicated to our lady  this is the greatest of our treasures says the verger  our town was overrun with mice till the ladies of the city offered this mouse of silver  instantly all the mice disappeared  and are you such fools as to believe that the creatures went away because a silver mouse was dedicated asked a prussian officer  no replied the verger rather neatly or long ago we should have offered a silver prussian     star myths   artemus ward used to say that while there were many things in the science of astronomy hard to be understood there was one fact which entirely puzzled him  he could partly perceive how we weigh the sun and ascertain the component elements of the heavenly bodies by the aid of spectrum analysis  but what beats me about the stars he observed plaintively is how we come to know their names  this question or rather the somewhat similar question how did the constellations come by their very peculiar names has puzzled professor pritchard and other astronomers more serious than artemus ward  why is a group of stars called the bear or the swan or the twins or named after the pleiades the fair daughters of the giant atlas 121  these are difficulties that meet even children when they examine a celestial globe  there they find the figure of a bear traced out with lines in the intervals between the stars of the constellations while a very imposing giant is so drawn that orions belt just fits his waist  but when he comes to look at the heavens the infant speculator sees no sort of likeness to a bear in the stars nor anything at all resembling a giant in the neighbourhood of orion  the most eccentric modern fancy which can detect what shapes it will in clouds is unable to find any likeness to human or animal forms in the stars and yet we call a great many of the stars by the names of men and beasts and gods  some resemblance to terrestrial things it is true everyone can behold in the heavens  corona for example is like a crown or as the australian black fellows know it is like a boomerang and we can understand why they give it the name of that curious curved missile  the milky way again does resemble a path in the sky our english ancestors called it watling streetthe path of the watlings mythical giantsand bushmen in africa and red men in north america name it the ashen path or the path of souls  the ashes of the path of course are supposed to be hot and glowing not dead and black like the ashpaths of modern runninggrounds  other and more recent names for certain constellations are also intelligible  in homers time the greeks had two names for the great bear they called it the bear or the wain and a certain fanciful likeness to a wain may be made out though no resemblance to a bear is manifest  in the united states the same constellation is popularly styled the dipper and every one may observe the likeness to a dipper or toddyladle  but these resemblances take us only a little way towards appellations  we know that we derive many of the names straight from the greek but whence did the greeks get them  some it is said from the chaldaeans but whence did they reach the chaldaeans  to this we shall return later but as to early greek starlore goguet the author of lorigine des lois a rather learned but too speculative work of the last century makes the following characteristic remarks the greeks received their astronomy from prometheus  this prince as far as history teaches us made his observations on mount caucasus  that was the eighteenth centurys method of interpreting mythology  the myth preserved in the prometheus bound of aeschylus tells us that zeus crucified the titan on mount caucasus  the french philosopher rejecting the supernatural elements of the tale makes up his mind that prometheus was a prince of a scientific bent and that he established his observatory on the frosty caucasus  but even admitting this why did prometheus give the stars animal names  goguet easily explains this by a hypothetical account of the manners of primitive men  the earliest peoples he says must have used writing for purposes of astronomical science  they would be content to design the constellations of which they wished to speak by the hieroglyphical symbols of their names hence the constellations have insensibly taken the names of the chief symbols  thus a drawing of a bear or a swan was the hieroglyphic of the name of a star or group of stars  but whence came the name which was represented by the hieroglyphic  that is precisely what our author forgets to tell us  but he remarks that the meaning of the hieroglyphic came to be forgotten and the symbols gave rise to all the ridiculous tales about the heavenly signs  this explanation is attained by the process of reasoning in a vicious circle from hypothetical premises ascertained to be false  all the known savages of the world even those which have scarcely the elements of picturewriting call the constellations by the names of men and animals and all tell ridiculous tales to account for the names  as the starstories told by the greeks the ancient egyptians and other civilised people of the old world exactly correspond in character and sometimes even in incident with the starstories of modern savages we have the choice of three hypotheses to explain this curious coincidence perhaps the starstories about nymphs changed into bears and bears changed into stars were invented by the civilised races of old and gradually found their way amongst people like the eskimo and the australians and bushmen  or it may be insisted that the ancestors of australians eskimo and bushmen were once civilised like the greeks and egyptians and invented starstories still remembered by their degenerate descendants  these are the two forms of the explanation which will be advanced by persons who believe that the starstories were originally the fruit of the civilised imagination  the third theory would be that the ridiculous tales about the stars were originally the work of the savage imagination and that the greeks chaldaeans and egyptians when they became civilised retained the old myths that their ancestors had invented when they were savages  in favour of this theory it may be said briefly that there is no proof that the fathers of australians eskimo and bushmen had ever been civilised while there is a great deal of evidence to suggest that the fathers of the greeks had once been savages 125  and if we incline to the theory that the star myths are the creation of savage fancy we at once learn why they are in all parts of the world so much alike  just as the flint and bone weapons of rude races resemble each other much more than they resemble the metal weapons and the artillery of advanced peoples so the mental products the fairy tales and myths of rude races have everywhere a strong family resemblance  they are produced by men in similar mental conditions of ignorance curiosity and credulous fancy and they are intended to supply the same needs partly of amusing narrative partly of crude explanation of familiar phenomena  now it is time to prove the truth of our assertion that the starstories of savage and of civilised races closely resemble each other  let us begin with that wellknown group the pleiades  the peculiarity of the pleiades is that the group consists of seven stars of which one is so dim that it seems entirely to disappear and many persons can only detect its presence through a telescope  the greeks had a myth to account for the vanishing of the lost pleiad  the tale is given in the catasterismoi stories of metamorphoses into stars attributed to eratosthenes  this work was probably written after our era but the author derived his information from older treatises now lost  according to the greek myth then the seven stars of the pleiad were seven maidens daughters of the giant atlas  six of them had gods for lovers poseidon admired two of them zeus three and ares one but the seventh had only an earthly wooer and when all of them were changed into stars the maiden with the mortal lover hid her light for shame  now let us compare the australian story  according to mr dawson australian aborigines a writer who understands the natives well their knowledge of the heavenly bodies greatly exceeds that of most white people and is taught by men selected for their intelligence and information  the knowledge is important to the aborigines on their night journeys so we may be sure that the natives are careful observers of the heavens and are likely to be conservative of their astronomical myths  the lost pleiad has not escaped them and this is how they account for her disappearance  the pirt kopan noot tribe have a tradition that the pleiades were a queen and her six attendants  long ago the crow our canopus fell in love with the queen who refused to be his wife  the crow found that the queen and her six maidens like other australian gins were in the habit of hunting for white edible grubs in the bark of trees  the crow at once changed himself into a grub just as jupiter and indra used to change into swans horses ants or what not and hid in the bark of a tree  the six maidens sought to pick him out with their wooden hooks but he broke the points of all the hooks  then came the queen with her pretty bone hook he let himself be drawn out took the shape of a giant and ran away with her  ever since there have only been six stars the six maidens in the pleiad  this story is well known by the strictest inquiry to be current among the blacks of the west district and in south australia  mr tylor whose opinion is entitled to the highest respect thinks that this may be a european myth told by some settler to a black in the greek form and then spread about among the natives  he complains that the story of the loss of the brightest star does not fit the facts of the case  we do not know and how can the australians know that the lost star was once the brightest  it appears to me that the australians remarking the disappearances of a star might very naturally suppose that the crow had selected for his wife that one which had been the most brilliant of the cluster  besides the wide distribution of the tale among the natives and the very great change in the nature of the incidents seem to point to a native origin  though the main conceptionthe loss of one out of seven maidensis identical in greek and in murri the manner of the disappearance is eminently hellenic in the one case eminently savage in the other  however this may be nothing of course is proved by a single example  let us next examine the stars castor and pollux  both in greece and in australia these are said once to have been two young men  in the catasterismoi already spoken of we read the twins or dioscouroithey were nurtured in lacedaemon and were famous for their brotherly love wherefore zeus desiring to make their memory immortal placed them both among the stars  in australia according to mr brough smyth aborigines of victoria turree castor and wanjel pollux are two young men who pursue purra and kill him at the commencement of the great heat  coonar toorung the mirage is the smoke of the fire by which they roast him  in greece it was not castor and pollux but orion who was the great hunter placed among the stars  among the bushmen of south africa castor and pollux are not young men but young women the wives of the eland the great native antelope  in greek starstories the great bear keeps watch homer says on the hunter orion for fear of a sudden attack  but how did the bear get its name in greece  according to hesiod the oldest greek poet after homer the bear was once a lady daughter of lycaon king of arcadia  she was a nymph of the train of chaste artemis but yielded to the love of zeus and became the ancestress of all the arcadians that is bearfolk  in her bestial form she was just about to be slain by her own son when zeus rescued her by raising her to the stars  here we must notice first that the arcadians like australians red indians bushmen and many other wild races and like the bedouins believed themselves to be descended from an animal  that the early egyptians did the same is not improbable for names of animals are found among the ancestors in the very oldest genealogical papyrus 128 as in the genealogies of the old english kings  next the arcadians transferred the ancestral bear to the heavens and in doing this they resembled the peruvians of whom acosta says they adored the star urchuchilly feigning it to be a ram and worshipped two others and say that one of them is a sheep and the other a lamb    others worshipped the star called the tiger  they were of opinion that there was not any beast or bird upon the earth whose shape or image did not shine in the heavens  but to return to our bears  the australians have properly speaking no bears though the animal called the native bear is looked up to by the aborigines with superstitious regard  but among the north american indians as the old missionaries lafitau and charlevoix observed the four stars in front of our constellation are a bear those in the tail are hunters who pursue him the small star apart is the pot in which they mean to cook him  it may be held that the red men derived their bear from the european settlers  but as we have seen an exact knowledge of the stars has always been useful if not essential to savages and we venture to doubt whether they would confuse their nomenclature and sacred traditions by borrowing terms from trappers and squatters  but if this is improbable it seems almost impossible that all savage races should have borrowed their whole conception of the heavenly bodies from the myths of greece it is thus that egede a missionary of the last century describes the eskimo philosophy of the stars the notions that the greenlanders have as to the origin of the heavenly lightsas sun moon and starsare very nonsensical in that they pretend they have formerly been as many of their own ancestors who on different accounts were lifted up to heaven and became such glorious celestial bodies  again he writes their notions about the stars are that some of them have been men and others different sorts of animals and fishes  but every reader of ovid knows that this was the very mythical theory of the greeks and romans the egyptians again worshipped osiris isis and the rest as ancestors and there are even modern scholars like mr loftie in his essay of scarabs who hold osiris to have been originally a real historical person  but the egyptian priests who showed plutarch the grave of osiris showed him too the stars into which osiris isis and horus had been metamorphosed  here then we have greeks egyptians and eskimo all agreed about the origin of the heavenly lights all of opinion that they have formerly been as many of their own ancestors  the australian general theory is of the good men and women after the deluge pundjel a kind of zeus or rather a sort of prometheus of australian mythology made stars  sorcerers biraark can tell which stars were once good men and women  here the sorcerers have the same knowledge as the egyptian priests  again just as among the arcadians the progenitors of the existing tribes whether birds or beasts or men were set in the sky and made to shine as stars 130  we have already given some australian examples in the stories of the pleiades and of castor and pollux  we may add the case of the eagle  in greece the eagle was the bird of zeus who carried off ganymede to be the cupbearer of olympus  among the australians this same constellation is called totyarguil he was a man who when bathing was killed by a fabulous animal a kind of kelpie as orion in greece was killed by the scorpion  like orion he was placed among the stars  the australians have a constellation named eagle but he is our sinus or dogstar  the indians of the amazon are in one tale with the australians and eskimo  dr silva de coutinho informs me says professor hartt 131 that the indians of the amazonas not only give names to many of the heavenly bodies but also tell stories about them  the two stars that form the shoulders of orion are said to be an old man and a boy in a canoe chasing a peixe boi by which name is designated a dark spot in the sky near the above constellation  the indians also know monkeystars cranestars and palmtree stars  the bushmen almost the lowest tribe of south africa have the same star lore and much the same myths as the greeks australians egyptians and eskimo  according to dr bleek stars and even the sun and moon were once mortals on earth or even animals or inorganic substances which happened to get translated to the skies  the sun was once a man whose armpit radiated a limited amount of light round his house  some children threw him into the sky and there he shines  the homeric hymn to helios in the same way as mr max muller observes looks on the sun as a halfgod almost a hero who had once lived on earth  the pointers of the southern cross were two men who were lions just as callisto in arcadia was a woman who was a bear  it is not at all rare in those queer philosophies as in that of the scandinavians to find that the sun or moon has been a man or woman  in australian fable the moon was a man the sun a woman of indifferent character who appears at dawn in a coat of red kangaroo skins the present of an admirer  in an old mexican text the moon was a man across whose face a god threw a rabbit thus making the marks in the moon 132a  many separate races seem to recognise the figure of a hare where we see the man in the moon  in a buddhist legend an exemplary and altruistic hare was translated to the moon  to the common people in india the spots on the moon look like a hare and chandras the god of the moon carries a hare hence the moon is called sasin or sasanka haremark  the mongolians also see in these shadows the figure of a hare 132b  among the eskimo the moon is a girl who always flees from her cruel brother the sun because he disfigured her face  elsewhere the sun is the girl beloved by her own brother the moon she blackens her face to avert his affection  on the rio branco and among the tomunda the moon is a girl who loved her brother and visited him in the dark  he detected her wicked passion by drawing his blackened hand over her face  the marks betrayed her and as the spots on the moon remain to this day 133  among the new zealanders and north american indians the sun is a great beast whom the hunters trapped and thrashed with cudgels  his blood is used in some new zealand incantations and according to an egyptian myth was kneaded into clay at the making of man  but there is no end to similar sunmyths in all of which the sun is regarded as a man or even as a beast  to return to the stars  the red indians as schoolcraft says hold many of the planets to be transformed adventurers  the iowas believed stars to be a sort of living creatures  one of them came down and talked to a hunter and showed him where to find game  the gallinomeros of central california according to mr bancroft believe that the sun and moon were made and lighted up by the hawk and the coyote who one day flew into each others faces in the dark and were determined to prevent such accidents in the future  but the very oddest example of the survival of the notion that the stars are men or women is found in the pax of aristophanes  trygaeus in that comedy has just made an expedition to heaven  a slave meets him and asks him is not the story true then that we become stars when we die  the answer is certainly and trygaeus points out the star into which ios of chios has just been metamorphosed  aristophanes is making fun of some popular greek superstition  but that very superstition meets us in new zealand  heroes says mr taylor were thought to become stars of greater or less brightness according to the number of their victims slain in fight  the aryan race is seldom far behind when there are ludicrous notions to be credited or savage tales to be told  we have seen that aristophanes in greece knew the eskimo doctrine that stars are souls of the dead  the persians had the same belief 134a all the unnumbered stars were reckoned ghosts of men 134b  the german folklore clings to the same belief stars are souls when a child dies god makes a new star  kaegi quotes 134c the same idea from the veda and from the satapatha brahmana the thoroughly australian notion that good men become stars  for a truly savage conception it would be difficult in south africa or on the amazons to beat the following story from the aitareya brahmana iii 33 pragapati the master of life conceived an incestuous passion for his own daughter  like zeus and indra and the australian wooer in the pleiad tale he concealed himself under the shape of a beast a roebuck and approached his own daughter who had assumed the form of a doe  the gods in anger at the awful crime made a monster to punish pragapati  the monster sent an arrow through the gods body he sprang into heaven and like the arcadian bear this aryan roebuck became a constellation  he is among the stars of orion and his punisher also now a star is like the greek orion a hunter  the daughter of pragapati the doe became another constellation and the avenging arrow is also a set of stars in the sky what follows about the origin of the gods called adityas is really too savage to be quoted by a chaste mythologist  it would be easy to multiply examples of this stage of thought among aryans and savages  but we have probably brought forward enough for our purpose and have expressly chosen instances from the most widely separated peoples  these instances it will perhaps be admitted suggest if they do not prove that the greeks had received from tradition precisely the same sort of legends about the heavenly bodies as are current among eskimo and bushmen new zealanders and iowas  as much indeed might be inferred from our own astronomical nomenclature  we now give to newly discovered stars names derived from distinguished people as georgium sidus or herschel or again merely technical appellatives as alpha beta and the rest  we should never think when some new planet swims into our ken of calling it kangaroo or rabbit or after the name of some hero of romance as rob roy or count fosco  but the names of stars which we inherit from greek mythologythe bear the pleiads castor and pollux and so forthare such as no people in our mental condition would originally think of bestowing  when callimachus and the courtly astronomers of alexandria pretended that the golden locks of berenice were raised to the heavens that was a mere piece of flattery constructed on the inherited model of legends about the crown corona of ariadne  it seems evident enough that the older greek names of stars are derived from a time when the ancestors of the greeks were in the mental and imaginative condition of iowas kanekas bushmen murri and new zealanders  all these and all other savage peoples believe in a kind of equality and intercommunion among all things animate and inanimate stones are supposed in the pacific islands to be male and female and to propagate their species  animals are believed to have human or superhuman intelligence and speech if they choose to exercise the gift stars are just on the same footing and their movements are explained by the same ready system of universal anthropomorphism  stars fishes gods heroes men trees clouds and animals all play their equal part in the confused dramas of savage thought and savage mythology  even in practical life the change of a sorcerer into an animal is accepted as a familiar phenomenon and the power of soaring among the stars is one on which the australian biraark or the eskimo shaman most plumes himself it is not wonderful that things which are held possible in daily practice should be frequent features of mythology  hence the ready invention and belief of starlegends which in their turn fix the names of the heavenly bodies  nothing more except the extreme tenacity of tradition and the inconvenience of changing a widely accepted name is needed to account for the human and animal names of the stars  the greeks received from the dateless past of savage intellect the myths and the names of the constellations and we have taken them without inquiry from the greeks thus it happens that our celestial globes are just as queer menageries as any globes could be that were illustrated by australians or american indians by bushmen or peruvian aborigines or eskimo  it was savages we may be tolerably certain who first handed to science the names of the constellations and provided greece with the raw material of her astronomical mythsas bacon prettily says that we listen to the harsh ideas of earlier peoples blown softly through the flutes of the grecians  this position has been disputed by mr brown in a work rather komically called the law of kosmic order  mr browns theory is that the early accadians named the zodiacal signs after certain myths and festivals connected with the months  thus the crab is a figure of the darkness power which seized the akkadian solar hero dumuzi and which is constantly represented in monstrous and drakontic form  the bull again is connected with night and darkness in relation to the horned moon and is for other reasons a nocturnal potency  few stars to tell the truth are diurnal potencies  mr browns explanations appear to me farfetched and unconvincing  but granting that the zodiacal signs reached greece from chaldaea mr brown will hardly maintain that australians melanesians iowas amazon indians eskimo and the rest borrowed their human and animal stars from akkadia  the belief in animal and human stars is practically universal among savages who have not attained the akkadian degree of culture  the belief as mr tylor has shown 137 is a natural result of savage ideas  we therefore infer that the akkadians too probably fell back for starnames on what they inherited from the savage past  if the greeks borrowed certain starnames from the akkadians they also like the aryans of india retained plenty of savage starmyths of their own fables derived from the earliest astronomical guesses of early thought  the first moment in astronomical science arrives when the savage looking at a star says like the child in the nursery poem how i wonder what you are  the next moment comes when the savage has made his first rough practical observations of the movements of the heavenly body  his third step is to explain these to himself  now science cannot offer any but a fanciful explanation beyond the sphere of experience  the experience of the savage is limited to the narrow world of his tribe and of the beasts birds and fishes of his district  his philosophy therefore accounts for all phenomena on the supposition that the laws of the animate nature he observes are working everywhere  but his observations misguided by his crude magical superstitions have led him to believe in a state of equality and kinship between men and animals and even inorganic things  he often worships the very beasts he slays he addresses them as if they understood him he believes himself to be descended from the animals and of their kindred  these confused ideas he applies to the stars and recognises in them men like himself or beasts like those with which he conceives himself to be in such close human relations  there is scarcely a bird or beast but the red indian or the australian will explain its peculiarities by a myth like a page from ovids metamorphoses  it was once a man or a woman and has been changed to bird or beast by a god or a magician  men again have originally been beasts in his philosophy and are descended from wolves frogs or serpents or monkeys  the heavenly bodies are traced to precisely the same sort of origin and hence we conclude come their strange animal names and the strange myths about them which appear in all ancient poetry  these names in turn have curiously affected human beliefs  astrology is based on the opinion that a mans character and fate are determined by the stars under which he is born  and the nature of these stars is deduced from their names so that the bear should have been found in the horoscope of dr johnson  when giordano bruno wrote his satire against religion the famous spaccio della bestia trionfante he proposed to banish not only the gods but the beasts from heaven  he would call the stars not the bear or the swan or the pleiads but truth mercy justice and so forth that men might be born not under bestial but moral influences  but the beasts have had too long possession of the stars to be easily dislodged and the tenure of the bear and the swan will probably last as long as there is a science of astronomy  their names are not likely again to delude a philosopher into the opinion of aristotle that the stars are animated  this argument had been worked out to the writers satisfaction when he chanced to light on mr max mullers explanation of the name of the great bear  we have explained that name as only one out of countless similar appellations which men of every race give to the stars  these names again we have accounted for as the result of savage philosophy which takes no great distinction between man and the things in the world and looks on stars beasts birds fishes flowers and trees as men and women in disguise  mr mullers theory is based on philological considerations  he thinks that the name of the great bear is the result of a mistake as to the meaning of words  there was in sanskrit he says 140 a root ark or arch meaning to be bright  the stars are called riksha that is bright ones in the veda  the constellations here called the rikshas in the sense of the bright ones would be homonymous in sanskrit with the bears  remember also that apparently without rhyme or reason the same constellation is called by greeks and romans the bear     there is not the shadow of a likeness with a bear  you will now perceive the influence of words on thought or the spontaneous growth of mythology  the name riksha was applied to the bear in the sense of the bright fuscous animal and in that sense it became most popular in the later sanskrit and in greek and latin  the same name in the sense of the bright ones had been applied by the vedic poets to the stars in general and more particularly to that constellation which in the northern parts of india was the most prominent  the etymological meaning the bright stars was forgotten the popular meaning of riksha bear was known to everyone  and thus it happened that when the greeks had left their central home and settled in europe they retained the name of arktos for the same unchanging stars but not knowing why those stars had originally received that name they ceased to speak of them as arktoi or many bears and spoke of them as the bear  this is a very good example of the philological way of explaining a myth if once we admit that ark or arch in the sense of bright and of bear existed not only in sanskrit but in the undivided aryan tongue and that the name riksha bear became in that sense most popular in greek and latin this theory seems more than plausible  but the explanation does not look so well if we examine not only the aryan but all the known myths and names of the bear and the other stars  professor sayce a distinguished philologist says we may not compare nonaryan with aryan myths  we have ventured to do so however in this paper and have shown that the most widely severed races give the stars animal names of which the bear is one example  now if the philologists wish to persuade us that it was decaying and halfforgotten language which caused men to give the names of animals to the stars they must prove their case on an immense collection of instanceson iowa kaneka murri maori brazilian peruvian mexican egyptian eskimo instances  it would be the most amazing coincidence in the world if forgetfulness of the meaning of their own speech compelled tribes of every tongue and race to recognise men and beasts cranes cockatoos serpents monkeys bears and so forth in the heavens  how came the misunderstood words always to be misunderstood in the same way  does the philological explanation account for the enormous majority of the phenomena  if it fails we may at least doubt whether it solves the one isolated case of the great bear among the greeks and romans  it must be observed that the philological explanation of mr muller does not clear up the arcadian story of their own descent from a shebear who is now a star  yet similar stories of the descent of tribes from animals are so widespread that it would be difficult to name the race or the quarter of the globe where they are not found  are they all derived from misunderstood words meaning bright these considerations appear to be a strong argument for comparing not only aryan but all attainable myths  we shall often find if we take a wide view that the philological explanation which seemed plausible in a single case is hopelessly narrow when applied to a large collection of parallel cases in languages of various families  finally in dealing with star myths we adhere to the hypothesis of mr tylor from savagery up to civilisation akkadian greek or english there may be traced in the mythology of the stars a course of thought changed indeed in application yet never broken in its evident connection from first to last  the savage sees individual stars as animate beings or combines stargroups into living celestial creatures or limbs of them or objects connected with them while at the other extremity of the scale of civilisation the modern astronomer keeps up just such ancient fancies turning them to account in useful survival as a means of mapping out the celestial globe     moly and mandragora   i have found out a new cure for rheumatism said the lady beside whom it was my privilege to sit at dinner  you carry a potato about in your pocket  some one has written an amusing account of the behaviour of a man who is finishing a book  he takes his ideas everywhere with him and broods over them even at dinner in the pauses of conversation  but here was a lady who kindly contributed to my studies and offered me folklore and survivals in cultivated kensington  my mind had strayed from the potato cure to the new zealand habit of carrying a baked yam at night to frighten away ghosts and to the old english belief that a bit of bread kept in the pocket was sovereign against evil spirits  why should ghosts dread the food of mortals when it is the custom of most races of mortals to feed ancestral ghosts  the human mind works pretty rapidly and all this had passed through my brain while i replied in tones of curiosity a potato  yes but it is not every potato that will do  i heard of the cure in the country and when we came up to town and my husband was complaining of rheumatism i told one of the servants to get me a potato for mr johnsons rheumatism  yes maam said the man but it must be a stolen potato  i had forgotten that  well one cant ask ones servants to steal potatoes  it is easy in the country where you can pick one out of anybodys field  and what did you do  i asked  oh i drove to covent garden and ordered a lot of fruit and flowers  while the man was not looking i stole a potatoa very little one  i dont think there was any harm in it  and did mr johnson try the potato cure  yes he carried it in his pocket and now he is quite well  i told the doctor and he says he knows of the cure but he dares not recommend it  how oddly superstitions survive  the central idea of this modern folly about the potato is that you must pilfer the root  let us work the idea of the healing or magical herb backwards from kensington to european folklore and thence to classical times to homer and to the hottentots turning first to germany we note the beliefs not about the potato but about another vegetable the mandrake  of all roots in german superstition the alraun or mandrake is the most famous  the herb was conceived of in the savage fashion as a living human person a kind of old witchwife 144  again the root has a human shape  if a hereditary thief who has preserved his chastity gets hung the broadleafed yellowflowered mandrake grows up in his likeness beneath the gallows from which he is suspended  the mandrake like the moly the magical herb of the odyssey is hard for men to dig  he who desires to possess a mandrake must stop his ears with wax so that he may not hear the deathly yells which the plant utters as it is being dragged out of the earth  then before sunrise on a friday the amateur goes out with a dog all black makes three crosses round the mandrake loosens the soil about the root ties the root to the dogs tail and offers the beast a piece of bread  the dog runs at the bread drags out the mandrake root and falls dead killed by the horrible yell of the plant  the root is now taken up washed with wine wrapped in silk laid in a casket bathed every friday and clothed in a little new white smock every new moon  the mandrake acts if thus considerately treated as a kind of familiar spirit  every piece of coin put to her over night is found doubled in the morning gipsy folklore and the folklore of american children keep this belief in doubling deposits  the gipsies use the notion in what they call the great trick  some foolish rustic makes up his money in a parcel which he gives to the gipsy  the latter after various ceremonies performed returns the parcel which is to be buried  the money will be found doubled by a certain date  of course when the owner unburies the parcel he finds nothing in it but brass buttons  in the same way and with pious confidence the american boy buries a marble in a hollow log uttering the formula what hasnt come here come whats here stay here and expects to find all the marbles he has ever lost 145  let us follow the belief in magical roots into the old pagan world  the ancients knew mandragora and the superstitions connected with it very well  dioscorides mentions mandragorus or antimelon or dircaea or circaea and says the egyptians call it apemoum and pythagoras anthropomorphon  in digging the root pliny says there are some ceremonies observed first they that goe about this worke look especially to this that the wind be not in their face but blow upon their backs  then with the point of a sword they draw three circles round about the plant which don they dig it up afterwards with their face unto the west  pliny says nothing of the fetich qualities of the plant as credited in modern and mediaeval germany but mentions sufficient it is with some bodies to cast them into sleep with the smel of mandrago  this is like shakespeares poppy and mandragora and all the drowsy syrups of the world  plato and demosthenes 146a also speak of mandragora as a soporific  it is more to the purpose of magic that columella mentions the halfhuman mandragora  here we touch the origin of the mandrake superstitions  the roots have a kind of fantastic resemblance to the human shape pliny describes them as being of a fleshy substance and tender  now it is one of the recognised principles in magic that things like each other however superficially affect each other in a mystic way and possess identical properties  thus in melanesia according to mr codrington 146b a stone in the shape of a pig of a breadfruit of a yam was a most valuable find because it made pigs prolific and fertilised breadfruit trees and yamplots  in scotland too stones were called by the names of the limbs they resembled as eyestane headstane  a patient washed the affected part of his body and rubbed it well with the stone corresponding 147a  in precisely the same way the mandrake root being thought to resemble the human body was credited with human and superhuman powers josephus mentions 147b a plant not easily caught which slips away from them that wish to gather it and never stands still till certain repulsive rites are performed  these rites cannot well be reported here but they are quite familiar to red indian and to bushman magic  another way to dig the plant spoken of by josephus is by aid of the dog as in the german superstition quoted from grimm  aelian also recommends the use of the dog to pluck the herb aglaophotis which shines at night 147c  when the dog has dragged up the root and died of terror his body is to be buried on the spot with religious honours and secret sacred rites  so much for mandragora which like the healing potato has to be acquired stealthily and with peril  now let us examine the homeric herb moly  the plant is thus introduced by homer in the tenth book of the odyssey circe has turned odysseuss men into swine  he sets forth to rescue them trusting only to his sword  the god hermes meets him and offers him a charmed herb this herb of grace greek whereby he may subdue the magic wiles of circe  the plant is described by homer with some minuteness  it was black at the root but the flower was like to milk  moly the gods call it but it is hard for mortal men to dig howbeit with the gods all things are possible  the etymologies given of moly are almost as numerous as the etymologists  one derivation from the old turanian tongue of accadia will be examined later  the scholiast offers the derivation greek to make charms of no avail but this is exactly like professor blackies etymological discovery that erinys is derived from greek he might as well derive critic from criticise 148  the scholiast adds that moly caused death to the person who dragged it out of the ground  this identification of moly with mandrake is probably based on homers remark that moly is hard to dig  the black root and white flower of moly are quite unlike the yellow flower and white fleshy root ascribed by pliny to mandrake  only confusion is caused by regarding the two magical herbs as identical  but why are any herbs or roots magical  while some scholars like de gubernatis seek an explanation in supposed myths about clouds and stars it is enough for our purpose to observe that herbs really have medicinal properties and that untutored people invariably confound medicine with magic  a plant or root is thought to possess virtue not only when swallowed in powder or decoction but when carried in the hand  st johns wort and rowan berries like the homeric moly still make evil charms of none avail     rowan ash and red threed    keep the devils from their speed  says the scotch rhyme  any fanciful resemblance of leaf or flower or root to a portion of the human body any analogy based on colour will give a plant reputation for magical virtues  this habit of mind survives from the savage condition  the hottentots are great herbalists  like the greeks like the germans they expect supernatural aid from plants and roots  mr hahn in his tsui goam the supreme being of the khoi khoi p 82 gives the following examples     dapper in his description of africa p 621 tells ussome of them    wear round the neck roots which they find far inland in rivers and    being on a journey they light them in a fire or chew them if they    must sleep the night out in the field  they believe that these roots    keep off the wild animals  the roots they chew are spit out around    the spot where they encamp for the night and in a similar way if they    set the roots alight they blow the smoke and ashes about believing    that the smell will keep the wild animals off     i had often occasion to observe the practice of these superstitious    ceremonies especially when we were in a part of the country where we    heard the roaring of the lions or had the day previously met with the    footprints of the king of the beasts     the korannas also have these roots as safeguards with them  if a    commando a warlike expedition goes out every man will put such    roots in his pockets and in the pouch where he keeps his bullets    believing that the arrows or bullets of the enemy have no effect but    that his own bullets will surely kill the enemy  and also before they    lie down to sleep they set these roots alight and murmur my    grandfathers root bring sleep on the eyes of the lion and leopard    and the hyena  make them blind that they cannot find us and cover    their noses that they cannot smell us out  also if they have    carried off large booty or stolen cattle of the enemy they light    these roots and say we thank thee our grandfathers root that thou    hast given us cattle to eat  let the enemy sleep and lead him on the    wrong track that he may not follow us until we have safely escaped     another sort of shrub is called abib  herdsmen especially carry    pieces of its wood as charms and if cattle or sheep have gone astray    they burn a piece of it in the fire that the wild animals may not    destroy them  and they believe that the cattle remain safe until they    can be found the next morning  schweinfurth found the same belief in magic herbs and roots among the bongoes and niam niams in the heart of africa  the bongoes believe like the homeric greeks that certain roots ward off the evil influences of spirits  like the german amateurs of the mandrake they assert that there is no other resource for obtaining communication with spirits except by means of certain roots i 306  our position is that the english magical potato the german mandrake the greek moly are all survivals from a condition of mind like that in which the hottentots still pray to roots  now that we have brought mandragora and moly into connection with the ordinary magical superstitions of savage peoples let us see what is made of the subject by another method  mr r brown the learned and industrious author of the great dionysiak myth has investigated the traditions about the homeric moly  he first 151 turns to aryan philology  many guesses at the etymology of moly have been made curtius suggests greek akin to greek soft  this does not suit mr brown who to begin with is persuaded that the herb is not a magical herb sans phrase like those which the hottentots use but that the basis of the myth is simply the effect of night upon the world of day  now as moly is a name in use among the gods mr brown thinks we may fairly examine the hypothesis of a foreign origin of the term anyone who holds that certain greek gods were borrowed from abroad may be allowed to believe that the gods used foreign words and as mr brown points out there are foreign elements in various homeric names of imported articles peoples persons and so forth  where then is a foreign word like moly which might have reached homer  by a long process of research mr brown finds his word in ancient akkadian  from professor sayce he borrows a reference to apuleius barbarus about whose life nothing is known and whose date is vague  apuleius barbarus may have lived about four centuries after our era and he says that wild rue was called moly by the cappadocians  rue like rosemary and indeed like most herbs has its magical repute and if we supposed that homers moly was rue there would be some interest in the knowledge  rue was called herb of grace in english holy water was sprinkled with it and the name is a translation of homers greek  perhaps rue was used in sprinkling because in prechristian times rue had by itself power against sprites and powers of evil  our ancestors may have thought it as well to combine the old charm of rue and the new christian potency of holy water  thus there would be a distinct analogy between homeric moly and english herb of grace  euphrasy and rue were employed to purge and purify mortal eyes  pliny is very learned about the magical virtues of rue  just as the stolen potato is sovran for rheumatism so rue stolen thriveth the best  the samoans think that their most valued vegetables were stolen from heaven by a samoan visitor 152a  it is remarkable that rue according to pliny is killed by the touch of a woman in the same way as according to josephus the mandrake is tamed 152b  these passages prove that the classical peoples had the same extraordinary superstitions about women as the bushmen and red indians  indeed pliny 152c describes a magical manner of defending the crops from blight by aid of women which is actually practised in america by the red men 152d  here then are proofs enough that rue was magical outside of cappadocia but this is not an argument on mr browns lines  the cappadocians called rue moly what language he asks was spoken by the cappadocians  prof sayce who knows so many tongues says that we know next to nothing of the language of the cappadocians or of the moschi who lived in the same locality  but where prof sayce is the hittites if we may say so respectfully are not very far off  in this case he thinks the moschi though he admits we know next to nothing about it seem to have spoken a language allied to that of the cappadocians and hittites that is to say it is not impossible that the language of the moschi about which next to nothing is known may have been allied to that of the cappadocians about which we know next to nothing  all that we do know in this case is that four hundred years after christ the dwellers in cappadocia employed a word moly which had been greek for at least twelve hundred years  but mr brown goes on to quote that one of the languages of which we know next to nothing hittite was probably allied to protoarmenian and perhaps lykian and was above all not semitic  in any case the cuneiform mode of writing was used in cappadocia at an early period  as even professor sayce declines to give more than a tentative reading of a cappadocian cuneiform inscription it seems highly rash to seek in this direction for an interpretation of a homeric word moly used in cappadocia very many centuries after the tablets were scratched  but on the evidence of the babylonian character of the cuneiform writing on cappadocian tablets mr brown establishes a connection between the people of accadia who probably introduced the cuneiform style and the people of cappadocia  the connection amounts to this  twelve hundred years after homer the inhabitants of cappadocia are said to have called rue moly  at some unknown period the accadians appear to have influenced the art of writing in cappadocia apparently mr brown thinks it not too rash to infer that the cappadocian use of the word moly is not derived from the greeks but from the accadians  now in accadian according to mr brown mul means star hence ulu or mulu  greek the mysterious homerik countercharm to the charms of kirke p 60  mr browns theory therefore is that moly originally meant star  circe is the moon odysseus is the sun and what watches over the solar hero at night when exposed to the hostile lunar power but the stars especially the dogstar  the truth is that homers moly whatever plant he meant by the name is only one of the magical herbs in which most peoples believe or have believed  like the scottish rowan or like st johns wort it is potent against evil influences  people have their own simple reasons for believing in these plants and have not needed to bring down their humble early botany from the clouds and stars  we have to imagine on the other hand if we follow mr brown that in some unknown past the cappadocians turned the accadian word for a star into a local name of a plant that this word reached homer that the supposed old accadian myth of the star which watches over the solar hero retained its vitality in greek and leaving the star clung to the herb that homer used an akkado kappadokian myth and that many ages after the accadian starname in its perverted sense of rue survived in cappadocia  this structure of argument is based on tablets which even prof sayce cannot read and on possibilities about the alliances of tongues concerning which we know next to nothing  a method which leaves on one side the common natural widelydiffused beliefs about the magic virtue of herbs beliefs which we have seen at work in kensington and in central africa to hunt for moly among stars and undeciphered kappadokian inscriptions seems a dubious method  we have examined it at full length because it is a specimen of an erudite but as we think a mistaken way in folklore  m halevys warnings against the shifting mythical theories based on sciences so new as the lore of assyria and akkadia are by no means superfluous akkadian is rapidly become as ready a key to all locks as aryan was a few years ago     kalevala or the finnish national epic   it is difficult to account for the fact that the scientific curiosity which is just now so busy in examining all the monuments of the primitive condition of our race should in england at least have almost totally neglected to popularise the kalevala or national poem of the finns besides its fresh and simple beauty of style its worth as a storehouse of every kind of primitive folklore being as it is the production of an urvolk a nation that has undergone no violent revolution in language or institutionsthe kalevala has the peculiar interest of occupying a position between the two kinds of primitive poetry the ballad and the epic  so much difficulty has been introduced into the study of the first developments of song by confusing these distinct sorts of composition under the name of popular poetry that it may be well in writing of a poem which occupies a middle place between epic and ballad to define what we mean by each  the author of our old english art of poesie begins his work with a statement which may serve as a text poesie says puttenham writing in 1589 is more ancient than the artificiall of the greeks and latines coming by instinct of nature and used by the savage and uncivill who were before all science and civilitie  this is proved by certificate of merchants and travellers who by late navigations have surveyed the whole world and discovered large countries and strange people wild and savage affirming that the american the perusine and the very canniball do sing and also say their highest and holiest matters in certain riming versicles  puttenham is here referring to that instinct of primitive men which compels them in all moments of highwrought feeling and on all solemn occasions to give utterance to a kind of chant 157a  such a chant is the song of lamech when he had slain a man to his wounding  so in the norse sagas grettir and gunnar sing when they have anything particular to say and so in the marchenthe primitive fairy tales of all nationsscraps of verse are introduced where emphasis is wanted  this craving for passionate expression takes a more formal shape in the lays which among all primitive peoples as among the modern greeks today 157b are sung at betrothals funerals and departures for distant lands  these songs have been collected in scotland by scott and motherwell their danish counterparts have been translated by mr prior  in greece m fauriel and dr ulrichs in provence damase arbaud in italy m nigra in servia talvj in france gerard de nervalhave done for their separate countries what scott did for the border  professor child of harvard is publishing a beautiful critical collection of english volkslieder with all known variants from every country  a comparison of the collections proves that among all european lands the primitive versicles of the people are identical in tone form and incident  it is this kind of early expression of a peoples lifecareless abrupt brief as was necessitated by the fact that they were sung to the accompaniment of the dancethat we call ballads  these are distinctly and in every sense popular poems and nothing can cause greater confusion than to apply the same title popular to early epic poetry  ballads are short a long ballad as mr matthew arnold has said creeps and halts  a true epic on the other hand is long and its tone is grand noble and sustained  ballads are not artistic while the form of the epic whether we take the hexameter or the rougher laisse of the french chansons de geste is full of conscious and admirable art lastly popular ballads deal with vague characters acting and living in vague places while the characters of an epic are heroes of definite station whose descendants are still in the land whose home is a recognisable place ithaca or argos  now though these two kinds of early poetrythe ballad the song of the people the epic the song of the chiefs of the people of the ruling raceare distinct in kind it does not follow that they have no connection that the nobler may not have been developed out of the materials of the lower form of expression and the value of the kalevala is partly this that it combines the continuity and unison of the epic with the simplicity and popularity of the ballad and so forms a kind of link in the history of the development of poetry  this may become clearer as we proceed to explain the literary history of the finnish national poem  sixty years ago it may be said no one was aware that finland possessed a national poem at all  her peoplewho claim affinity with the magyars of hungary but are possibly a backwave of an earlier tide of populationhad remained untouched by foreign influences since their conquest by sweden and their somewhat lax and wholesale conversion to christianity events which took place gradually between the middle of the twelfth and the end of the thirteenth centuries  under the rule of sweden the finns were left to their quiet life and undisturbed imaginings among the forests and lakes of the region which they aptly called pohja the end of things while their educated classes took no very keen interest in the native poetry and mythology of their race  at length the annexation of finland by russia in 1809 awakened national feeling and stimulated research into the songs and customs which were the heirlooms of the people  it was the policy of russia to encourage rather than to check this return on a distant past and from the north of norway to the slopes of the altai ardent explorers sought out the fragments of unwritten early poetry  these runes or runots were chiefly sung by old men called runoias to beguile the weariness of the long dark winters  the custom was for two champions to engage in a contest of memory clasping each others hands and reciting in turn till he whose memory first gave in slackened his hold  the kalevala contains an instance of this practice where it is said that no one was so hardy as to clasp hands with wainamoinen who is at once the orpheus and the prometheus of finnish mythology  these runoias or rhapsodists complain of course of the degeneracy of human memory they notice how any foreign influence in religion or politics is destructive to the native songs of a race 160  as for the lays of old time a thousand have been scattered to the wind a thousand buried in the snow    as for those which the munks the teutonic knights swept away and the prayer of the priest overwhelmed a thousand tongues were not able to recount them  in spite of the losses thus caused and in spite of the suspicious character of the finns which often made the task of collection a dangerous one enough materials remained to furnish dr lonnrot the most noted explorer with thirtyfive runots or cantos  these were published in 1835 but later research produced the fifteen cantos which make up the symmetrical fifty of the kalevala  in the task of arranging and uniting these dr lonnrot played the part traditionally ascribed to the commission of pisistratus in relation to the iliad and odyssey  dr lonnrot is said to have handled with singular fidelity the materials which now come before us as one poem not absolutely without a certain unity and continuous thread of narrative  it is this unity so faint compared with that of the iliad and odyssey which gives the kalevala a claim to the title of epic  it cannot be doubted that at whatever period the homeric poems took shape in greece they were believed to record the feats of the supposed ancestors of existing families  thus for example pisistratus as a descendant of the nelidae had an interest in securing certain parts at least of the iliad and the odyssey from oblivion  the same family pride embellished and preserved the epic poetry of early france  there were in france but three heroic houses or gestes and three corresponding cycles of epopees  now in the kalevala there is no trace of the influence of family feeling it was no ones peculiar care and pride to watch over the records of the fame of this or that hero  the poem begins with a cosmogony as wild as any indian dream of creation and the human characters who move in the story are shadowy inhabitants of no very definite lands whom no family claim as their forefathers  the very want of this idea of family and aristocratic pride gives the kalevala a unique place among epics  it is emphatically an epic of the people of that class whose life contains no element of progress no break in continuity which from age to age preserves in solitude and close communion with nature the earliest beliefs of grey antiquity  the greek epic on the other hand has as m preller 161 points out nothing to do with natural man but with an ideal world of heroes with sons of the gods with consecrated kings heroes elders a kind of specific race of men  the people exist only as subsidiary to the great houses as a mere background against which stand out the shining figures of heroes as a race of beings fresh and rough from the hands of nature with whom and with whose concerns the great houses and their bards have little concern  this feelingso universal in greece and in the feudal countries of mediaeval europe that there are two kinds of men the golden and the brazen race as plato would have called themis absent with all its results in the kalevala  among the finns we find no trace of an aristocracy there is scarcely a mention of kings or priests the heroes of the poem are really popular heroes fishers smiths husbandmen medicinemen or wizards exaggerated shadows of the people pursuing on a heroic scale not war but the common daily business of primitive and peaceful men  in recording their adventures the kalevala like the shield of achilles reflects all the life of a race the feasts the funerals the rites of seedtime and harvest of marriage and death the hymn and the magical incantation  were this all the epic would only have the value of an exhaustive collection of the popular ballads which as we have seen are a poetical record of the intenser moments in the existence of unsophisticated tribes  but the kalevala is distinguished from such a collection by presenting the ballads as they are produced by the events of a continuous narrative and thus it takes a distinct place between the aristocratic epics of greece or of the franks and the scattered songs which have been collected in scotland sweden denmark greece and italy  besides the interest of its unique position as a popular epic the kalevala is very valuable both for its literary beauties and for the confused mass of folklore which it contains  here old cosmogonies attempts of man to represent to himself the beginning of things are mingled with the same wild imaginings as are found everywhere in the shape of fairytales  we are hurried from an account of the mystic egg of creation to a hymn like that of the ambarval brothers to a strangely familiar scrap of a nursery story to an incident which we remember as occurring in almost identical words in a scotch ballad  we are among a people which endows everything with human characters and life which is in familiar relations with birds and beasts and even with rocks and plants  ravens and wolves and fishes of the sea sun moon and stars are kindly or churlish drops of blood find speech man and maid change to snake or swan and resume their forms ships have magic powers like the ships of the phaeacians  then there is the oddest confusion of every stage of religious development we find a supreme god delighting in righteousness ukko the lord of the vault of air who stands apart from men and sends his son wainamoinen to be their teacher in music and agriculture  across this faith comes a religion of petrified abstractions like those of the roman pantheon  there are gods of colour a goddess of weaving a goddess of mans blood besides elemental spirits of woods and waters and the manes of the dead  meanwhile the working faith of the people is the belief in magicgenerally a sign of the lower culture  it is supposed that the knowledge of certain magic words gives power over the elemental bodies which obey them it is held that the will of a distant sorcerer can cross the lakes and plains like the breath of a fantastic frost with power to change an enemy to ice or stone  traces remain of the worship of animals there is a hymn to the bear a dance like the beardance of the american indians and another hymn tells of the birth and power of the serpent  across all and closing all comes a hostile account of the origin of christianitythe end of joy and music  how primitive was the condition of the authors of this medley of beliefs is best proved by the survival of the custom called exogamy 164a  this custom which is not peculiar to the finns but is probably a universal note of early society prohibits marriage between members of the same tribe  consequently the main action such as it is of the kalevala turns on the efforts made by the men of kaleva to obtain brides from the hostile tribe of pohja 164b  further proof of ancient origin is to be found in what is the great literary beauty of the poemits pure spontaneity and simplicity  it is the production of an intensely imaginative race to which song came as the most natural expression of joy and sorrow terror or triumpha class which lay near to natures secret and was not out of sympathy with the wild kin of woods and waters     these songs says the prelude were found by the wayside and    gathered in the depths of the copses blown from the branches of the    forest and culled among the plumes of the pinetrees  these lays    came to me as i followed the flocks in a land of meadows honeysweet    and of golden hills     the cold has spoken to me and the rain    has told me her runes the winds of heaven the waves of the sea have    spoken and sung to me the wild birds have taught me the music of    many waters has been my master  the metre in which the epic is chanted resembles to an english ear that of mr longfellows hiawathathere is assonance rather than rhyme and a very musical effect is produced by the liquid character of the language and by the frequent alliterations  this rough outline of the main characteristics of the kalevala we shall now try to fill up with an abstract of its contents  the poem is longer than the iliad and much of interest must necessarily be omitted but it is only through such an abstract that any idea can be given of the sort of unity which does prevail amid the most utter discrepancy  in the first place what is to be understood by the word kalevala  the affix la signifies abode  thus tuonela is the abode of tuoni the god of the lower world and as kaleva means heroic magnificent kalevala is the home of heroes  the poem is the record of the adventures of the people of kalevalaof their strife with the men of pohjola the place of the worlds end  we may fancy two old runoias or singers clasping hands on one of the first nights of the finnish winter and beginning what probably has never been accomplished the attempt to work through the kalevala before the return of summer  they commence ab ovo or rather before the egg  first is chanted the birth of wainamoinen the benefactor and teacher of men  he is the son of luonnotar the daughter of nature who answers to the first woman of the iroquois cosmogony  beneath the breath and touch of wind and tide she conceived a child but nine ages of man passed before his birth while the mother floated on the formless and the multiform waters  then ukko the supreme god sent an eagle which laid her eggs in the maidens bosom and from these eggs grew earth and sky sun and moon star and cloud  then was wainamoinen born on the waters and reached a barren land and gazed on the new heavens and the new earth  there he sowed the grain that is the bread of man chanting the hymn used at seedtime calling on the mother earth to make the green herb spring and on ukko to send clouds and rain  so the corn sprang and the golden cuckoowhich in finland plays the part of the popinjay in scotch ballads or of the three golden birds in greek folksongscame with his congratulations  in regard to the epithet golden it may be observed that gold and silver in the finnish epic are lavished on the commonest objects of daily life  this is a universal note of primitive poetry and is not a peculiar finnish idiom as m leouzon le duc supposes nor as mr tozer seems to think in his account of romaic ballads a trace of oriental influence among the modern greeks  it is common to all the ballads of europe as m ampere has pointed out and may be observed in the chanson de roland and in homer  while the corn ripened wainamoinen rested from his labours and took the task of orpheus  he sang says the kalevala of the origin of things of the mysteries hidden from babes that none may attain to in this sad life in the hours of these perishable days  the fame of the runoias singing excited jealousy in the breast of one of the men around him of whose origin the kalevala gives no account  this man joukahainen provoked him to a trial of song boasting like empedocles or like one of the old celtic bards that he had been all things  when the earth was made i was there when space was unrolled i launched the sun on his way  then was wainamoinen wroth and by the force of his enchantment he rooted joukahainen to the ground and suffered him not to go free without promising him the hand of his sister aino  the mother was delighted but the girl wept that she must now cover her long locks her curls her glory and be the wife of the old imperturbable wainamoinen  it is in vain that her mother offers her dainty food and rich dresses she flees from home and wanders till she meets three maidens bathing and joins them and is drowned singing a sad song ah never may my sister come to bathe in the seawater for the drops of the sea are the drops of my blood  this wild idea occurs in the romaic ballad greek where a drop of blood on the lips of the drowned girl tinges all the waters of the world  to return to the fate of aino  a swift hare runs as in the zulu legend of the origin of death with the tale of sorrow to the maidens mother and from the mothers tears flow rivers of water and therein are isles with golden hills where golden birds make melody  as for the old the imperturbable runoia he loses his claim to the latter title he is filled with sorrow and searches through all the elements for his lost bride  at length he catches a fish which is unknown to him who like atlas knew the depths of all the seas  the strange fish slips from his hands a tress of hair of drowned maidens hair floats for a moment on the foam and too late he recognises that there was never salmon yet that shone so fair above the nets at sea  his lost bride has been within his reach and now is doubly lost to him  suddenly the waves are cloven asunder and the mother of nature and of wainamoinen appears to comfort her son like thetis from the deep  she bids him go and seek in the land of pohjola a bride alien to his race  after many a wild adventure wainamoinen reaches pohjola and is kindly entreated by loutri the mother of the maiden of the land  but he grows homesick and complains almost in dantes words of the bitter bread of exile  loutri will only grant him her daughters hand on condition that he gives her a sampo  a sampo is a mysterious engine that grinds meal salt and money  in fact it is the mill in the wellknown fairy tale why the sea is salt 169  wainamoinen cannot fashion this mill himself he must seek aid at home from ilmarinen the smith who forged the iron vault of hollow heaven as the hero returns to kalevala he meets the lady of the rainbow seated on the arch of the sky weaving the golden thread  she promises to be his if he will accomplish certain tasks and in the course of those he wounds himself with an axe  the wound can only be healed by one who knows the mystic words that hold the secret of the birth of iron  the legend of this evil birth how iron grew from the milk of a maiden and was forged by the primeval smith ilmarinen to be the bane of warlike men is communicated by wainamoinen to an old magician  the wizard then solemnly curses the iron as a living thing and invokes the aid of the supreme god ukko thus bringing together in one prayer the extremes of early religion  then the hero is healed and gives thanks to the creator in whose hands is the end of a matter  returning to kalevala wainamoinen sends ilmarinen to pohjola to make the sampo a mill for corn one day for salt the next for money the next the fatal treasure is concealed by loutri and is obviously to play the part of the fairy hoard in the nibelungen lied  with the eleventh canto a new hero ahti or lemminkainen and a new cycle of adventures is abruptly introduced  lemminkainen is a profligate wanderer with as many loves as hercules  the fact that he is regarded as a form of the seagod makes it strange that his most noted achievement the seduction of the whole female population of his island should correspond with a like feat of krishnas  sixteen thousand and one hundred says the vishnu purana was the number of the maidens and into so many forms did the son of madhu multiply himself so that every one of the damsels thought that he had wedded her in her single person krishna is the sun of course and the maidens are the dewdrops 170 it is to be hoped that lemminkainens connection with seawater may save him from the solar hypothesis  his first regular marriage is unhappy and he is slain in trying to capture a bride from the people of pohjola the black waters of the river of forgetfulness sweep him away and his comb which he left with his mother bursts out bleedinga frequent incident in russian and other fairy tales  in many household tales the hero before setting out on a journey erects a stick which will fall down when he is in distress or death  the natives of australia use this form of divination in actual practice tying round the stick some of the hair of the person whose fate is to be ascertained  then like demeter seeking persephone the mother questions all the beings of the world and their answers show a wonderful poetic sympathy with the silent life of nature  the moon said i have sorrows enough of my own without thinking of thy child  my lot is hard my days are evil  i am born to wander companionless in the night to shine in the season of frost to watch through the endless winter to fade when summer comes as king  the sun is kinder and reveals the place of the heros body  the mother collects the scattered limbs the birds bring healing balm from the heights of heaven and after a hymn to the goddess of mans blood lemminkainen is made sound and well as the scattered fragments of no more a man were united by the spell of medea like those of osiris by isis or of the fair countess by the demon blacksmith in the russian marchen or of the carib hero mentioned by mr mclennan 171 or of the ox in the south african household tale  with the sixteenth canto we return to wainamoinen who like all epic heroes visits the place of the dead tuonela  the maidens who play the part of charon are with difficulty induced to ferry over a man bearing no mark of death by fire or sword or water  once among the dead wainamoinen refusesbeing wiser than psyche or persephoneto taste of drink  this taboo is found in japanese melanesian and red indian accounts of the homes of the dead  thus the hero is able to return and behold the stars  arrived in the upper world he warns men to beware of perverting innocence of leading astray the pure of heart they that do these things shall be punished eternally in the depths of tuoni  there is a place prepared for evildoers a bed of stones burning rocks of fire worms and serpents  this speech throws but little light on the question of how far a doctrine of rewards and punishments enters into primitive ideas of a future state  the kalevala as we possess it is necessarily though faintly tinged with christianity and the peculiar vices which are here threatened with punishment are not those which would have been most likely to occur to the early heathen singers of this runot  wainamoinen and ilmarinen now go together to pohjola but the fickle maiden of the land prefers the young forger of the sampo to his elder and imperturbable companion  like a northern medea or like the mastermaid in dr dasents tales from the norse or like the hero of the algonquin tale and the samoan ballad she aids her alien lover to accomplish the tasks assigned to him  he ploughs with a plough of gold the adderclose or field of serpents he bridles the wolf and the bear of the lower world and catches the pike that swim in the waters of forgetfulness after this the parents cannot refuse their consent the weddingfeast is prepared and all the world except the seduisant lemminkainen is bidden to the banquet  the narrative now brings in the ballads that are sung at a finnish marriage  first the soninlaw enters the house of the parents of the bride saying peace abide with you in this illustrious hall  the mother answers peace be with you even in this lowly hut  then wainamoinen began to sing and no man was so hardy as to clasp hands and contend with him in song  next follow the songs of farewell the mother telling the daughter of what she will have to endure in a strange home thy life was soft and delicate in thy fathers house  milk and butter were ready to thy hand thou wert as a flower of the field as a strawberry of the wood all care was left to the pines of the forest all wailing to the wind in the woods of barren lands  but now thou goest to another home to an alien mother to doors that grate strangely on their hinges  my thoughts the maiden replies are as a dark night of autumn as a cloudy day of winter my heart is sadder than the autumn night more weary than the winter day  the maid and the bridegroom are then lyrically instructed in their duties the girl is to be longsuffering the husband to try five years gentle treatment before he cuts a willow wand for his wifes correction  the bridal party sets out for home a new feast is spread and the bridegroom congratulated on the courage he must have shown in stealing a girl from a hostile tribe  while all is merry the mischievous lemminkainen sets out an unbidden guest for pohjola  on his way he encounters a serpent which he slays by the song of serpentcharming  in this mystic chain of verse the serpent is not addressed as the gentle reptile god of southern peoples but is spoken of with all hatred and loathing black creeping thing of the low lands monster flecked with the colours of death thou that hast on thy skin the stain of the sterile soil get thee forth from the path of a hero  after slaying the serpent lemminkainen reaches pohjola kills one of his hosts and fixes his head on one of a thousand stakes for human skulls that stood about the house as they might round the hut of a dyak in borneo  he then flees to the isle of saari whence he is driven for his heroic profligacy and by the hatred of the only girl whom he has not wronged  this is a very pretty touch of human nature  he now meditates a new incursion into pohjola  the mother of pohjola it is just worth noticing that the leadership assumed by this woman points to a state of society when the family was scarcely formed calls to her aid her child the frost but the frost is put to shame by a hymn of the invaders a song against the cold the serpent was his fostermother the serpent with her barren breasts the wind of the north rocked his cradle and the icewind sang him to sleep in the midst of the wild marshland where the wells of the waters begin  it is a curious instance of the animism the vivid power of personifying all the beings and forces of nature which marks the kalevala that the cold speaks to lemminkainen in human voice and seeks a reconciliation  at this part of the epic there is an obvious lacuna  the story goes to kullervo a luckless man who serves as shepherd to ilmarinen  thinking himself illtreated by the heroic smiths wife the shepherd changes his flock into bears and wolves which devour their mistress  then he returns to his own home where he learns that his sister has been lost for many days and is believed to be dead  travelling in search of her he meets a girl loves her and all unwittingly commits an inexpiable offence  then says the kalevala came up the new dawn and the maiden spoke saying what is thy race bold young man and who is thy father  kullervo said i am the wretched son of kalerva but tell me what is thy race and who is thy father  then said the maiden i am the wretched daughter of kalerva  ah would god that i had died then might i have grown with the green grass and blossomed with the flowers and never known this sorrow  with this she sprang into the midst of the foaming waves and found peace in tuoni and rest in the waters of forgetfulness  then there was no word for kullervo but the bitter moan of the brother in the terrible scotch ballad of the bonny hind and no rest but in death by his own sword where grass grows never on his sisters tomb  the epic now draws to a close  ilmarinen seeks a new wife in pohja and endeavours with wainamoinens help to recover the mystic sampo  on the voyage the runoia makes a harp out of the bones of a monstrous fish so strange a harp that none may play it but himself  when he played all fourfooted things came about him and the white birds dropped down like a storm of snow  the maidens of the sun and the moon paused in their weaving and the golden thread fell from their hands  the ancient one of the seawater listened and the nymphs of the wells forgot to comb their loose locks with the golden combs  all men and maidens and little children wept amid the silent joy of nature nay the great harper wept and of his tears were pearls made  in the war with pohjola the heroes were victorious but the sampo was broken in the fight and lost in the sea and that perhaps is why the sea is salt  fragments were collected however and loutri furious at the success of the heroes of kalevala sent against them a bear destructive as the boar of calydon  but wainamoinen despatched the monster and the body was brought home with the beardance and the hymn of the bear  oh otso cry the singers be not angry that we come near thee  the bear the honeyfooted bear was born in lands between sun and moon and he died not by mens hands but of his own will  the finnish savants are probably right who find here a trace of the beast worship which in many lands has placed the bear among the number of the stars  propitiation of the bear is practised by red indians by the ainos of japan and in the case of the native bear by australians the red indians have a myth to prove that the bear is immortal does not die but after his apparent death rises again in another body  there is no trace however that the finns claimed like the danes descent from the bear  the lapps a people of confused belief worshipped him along with thor christ the sun and the serpent 176  but another cult an alien creed is approaching kalevala  there is no part of the epic more strange than the closing canto which tells in the wildest language and through the most exaggerated forms of savage imagination the tale of the introduction of christianity  marjatta was a maiden as pure as the dew is as holy as stars are that live without stain  as she fed her flocks and listened to the singing of the golden cuckoo a berry fell into her bosom  after many days she bore a child and the people despised and rejected her and she was thrust forth and her babe was born in a stable and cradled in the manger  who should baptize the babe  the god of the wilderness refused and wainamoinen would have had the young child slain  then the infant rebuked the ancient demigod who fled in anger to the sea and with his magic song he built a magic barque and he sat therein and took the helm in his hand the tide bore him out to sea and he lifted his voice and sang times go by and suns shall rise and set and then shall men have need of me and shall look for the promise of my coming that i may make a new sampo and a new harp and bring back sunlight and moonshine and the joy that is banished from the world  then he crossed the waters and gained the limits of the sea and the lower spaces of the sky  here the strange poem ends at its strangest moment with the cry which must have been uttered so often but is heard here alone of a people reluctantly deserting the gods that it has fashioned in its own likeness for a faith that has not sprung from its needs or fears  yet it cherishes the hope that this tyranny shall pass over they are gods and behold they shall die and the waves be upon them at last  as the kalevala and as all relics of folklore all marchen and ballads prove the lower mythologythe elemental beliefs of the peopledo survive beneath a thin covering of christian conformity  there are in fact in religion as in society two worlds of which the one does not know how the other lives  the class whose literature we inherit under whose institutions we live at whose shrines we worship has changed as outworn raiment its manners its gods its laws has looked before and after has hoped and forgotten has advanced from the wilder and grosser to the purest faith  beneath the progressive class and beneath the waves of this troublesome world there exists an order whose primitive form of human life has been far less changeful a class which has put on a mere semblance of new faiths while halfconsciously retaining the remains of immemorial cults  obviously as m fauriel has pointed out in the case of the modern greeks the life of such folk contains no element of progress admits no break in continuity  conquering armies pass and leave them still reaping the harvest of field and river religions appear and they are baptized by thousands but the lower beliefs and dreads that the progressive class has outgrown remain unchanged  thus to take the instance of modern greece the high gods of the divine race of achilles and agamemnon are forgotten but the descendants of the penestae the villeins of thessaly still dread the beings of the popular creed the nereids the cyclopes and the lamia 178  the last lesson we would attempt to gather from the kalevala is this that a comparison of the thoroughly popular beliefs of all countries the beliefs cherished by the nonliterary classes whose ballads and fairy tales have only recently been collected would probably reveal a general identity concealed by diversity of name among the lesser people of the skies the elves fairies cyclopes giants nereids brownies lamiae it could then be shown that some of these spirits survive among the lower beings of the mythology of what the germans call a culturvolk like the greeks or romans  it could also be proved that much of the narrative element in the classic epics is to be found in a popular or childish form in primitive fairy tales  the question would then come to be have the higher mythologies been developed by artistic poets out of the materials of a race which remained comparatively untouched by culture or are the lower spirits and the more simple and puerile forms of myth degradations of the inventions of a cultivated class     the divining rod   there is something remarkable and not flattering to human sagacity in the periodical resurrection of superstitions  houses for example go on being haunted in country districts and no educated man notices the circumstance  then comes a case like that of the drummer of tedworth or the cock lane ghost and society is deeply moved philosophers plunge into controversy and he who grubs among the dusty tracts of the past finds a world of fugitive literature on forgotten bogies  chairs move untouched by human hands and tables walk about in lonely castles of savoy and no one marks them till a day comes when the furniture of some american cottage is similarly afflicted and then a shoddy new religion is based on the phenomenon  the latest revival among old beliefs is faith in the divining rod  our liberal shepherds give it a shorter name and so do our conservative peasants calling the rod of jacob the twig  to work the twig is rural english for the craft of dousterswivel in the antiquary and perhaps from this comes our slang expression to twig or divine the hidden meaning of another  recent correspondence in the newspapers has proved that whatever may be the truth about the twig belief in its powers is still very prevalent respectable people are not ashamed to bear signed witness of its miraculous powers of detecting springs of water and secret mines  it is habitually used by the miners in the mendips as mr woodward found ten years ago and forked hazel divining rods from the mendips are a recognised part of ethnological collections  there are two ways of investigating the facts or fancies about the rod  one is to examine it in its actual operationa task of considerable labour which will doubtless be undertaken by the society for psychical research the other and easier way is to study the appearances of the divining wand in history and that is what we propose to do in this article  when a superstition or belief is widely spread in europe as the faith in the divining rod certainly is in germany rods are hidden under babies clothes when they are baptized we naturally expect to find traces of it in ancient times and among savages all over the modern world  we have already examined in the bullroarer a very similar example  we saw that there is a magical instrumenta small fishshaped piece of thin flat wood tied to a thongwhich when whirled in the air produces a strange noise a compound of roar and buzz  this instrument is sacred among the natives of australia where it is used to call together the men and to frighten away the women from the religious mysteries of the males  the same instrument is employed for similar purposes in new mexico and in south africa and new zealandparts of the world very widely distant from each other and inhabited by very diverse races  it has also been lately discovered that the greeks used this toy which they called greek in the mysteries of dionysus and possibly it may be identical with the mystica vannus iacchi virgil georgics i 166 the conclusion drawn by the ethnologist is that this object called turndun by the australians is a very early savage invention probably discovered and applied to religious purposes in various separate centres and retained from the age of savagery in the mystic rites of greeks and perhaps of romans  well do we find anything analogous in the case of the divining rod  future researches may increase our knowledge but at present little or nothing is known of the divining rod in classical ages and not very much though that little is significant among uncivilised races  it is true that in all countries rods or wands the latin virga have a magical power  virgil obtained his mediaeval repute as a wizard because his name was erroneously connected with virgula the magic wand  but we do not actually know that the ancient wand of the enchantress circe in homer or the wand of hermes was used like the divining rod to indicate the whereabouts of hidden wealth or water  in the homeric hymn to hermes line 529 apollo thus describes the caduceus or wand of hermes thereafter will i give thee a lovely wand of wealth and riches a golden wand with three leaves which shall keep thee ever unharmed  in later art this wand or caduceus is usually entwined with serpents but on one vase at least the wand of hermes is simply the forked twig of our rustic miners and waterfinders  the same form is found on an engraved etruscan mirror 183  now was a wand of this form used in classical times to discover hidden objects of value  that wands were used by scythians and germans in various methods of casting lots is certain but that is not the same thing as the working of the twig  cicero speaks of a fabled wand by which wealth can be procured but he says nothing of the method of its use and possibly was only thinking of the rod of hermes as described in the homeric hymn already quoted  there was a roman play by varro called virgula divina but it is lost and throws no light on the subject  a passage usually quoted from seneca has no more to do with the divining rod than with the telephone  pliny is a writer extremely fond of marvels yet when he describes the various modes of finding wells of water he says nothing about the divining wand  the isolated texts from scripture which are usually referred to clearly indicate wands of a different sort if we except hosea iv 12 the passage used as motto by the author of lettres qui decouvrent lillusion des philosophes sur la baguette 1696  this text is translated in our bible my people ask counsel at their stocks and their staff declareth unto them  now we have here no reference to the search for wells and minerals but to a form of divination for which the modern twig has ceased to be applied  in rural england people use the wand to find water but not to give advice or to detect thieves or murderers but as we shall see the rod has been very much used for these purposes within the last three centuries  this brings us to the moral powers of the twig and here we find some assistance in our inquiry from the practices of uncivilised races  in 1719 john bell was travelling across asia he fell in with a russian merchant who told him of a custom common among the mongols  the russian had lost certain pieces of cloth which were stolen out of his tent  the kutuchtu lama ordered the proper steps to be taken to find out the thief one of the lamas took a bench with four feet and after turning it in several directions at last it pointed directly to the tent where the stolen goods were concealed  the lama now mounted across the bench and soon carried it or as was commonly believed it carried him to the very tent where he ordered the damask to be produced  the demand was directly complied with for it is vain in such cases to offer any excuse 184a  here we have not a wand indeed but a wooden object which turned in the direction not of water or minerals but of human guilt  a better instance is given by the rev h rowley in his account of the mauganja 184b  a thief had stolen some corn  the medicineman or sorcerer produced two sticks which he gave to four young men two holding each stick  the medicineman danced and sang a magical incantation while a zebratail and a rattle were shaken over the holders of the sticks  after a while the men with the sticks had spasmodic twitchings of the arms and legs these increased nearly to convulsions     according to the native idea it was the sticks which were possessed primarily and through them the men who could hardly hold them  the sticks whirled and dragged the men round and round like mad through bush and thorny shrub and over every obstacle nothing stopped them their bodies were torn and bleeding  at last they came back to the assembly whirled round again and rushed down the path to fall panting and exhausted in the hut of one of a chiefs wives  the sticks rolling to her very feet denounced her as a thief  she denied it but the medicineman answered the spirit has declared her guilty the spirit never lies  the woman however was acquitted after a proxy trial by ordeal a cock used as her proxy threw up the muavi or ordealpoison  here the points to be noted are first the violent movement of the sticks which the men could hardly hold next the physical agitation of the men  the former point is illustrated by the confession of a civil engineer writing in the times  this gentleman had seen the rod successfully used for water he was asked to try it himself and he determined that it should not twist in his hands if an ocean rolled under his feet  twist it did however in spite of all his efforts to hold it when he came above a concealed spring  another example is quoted in the quarterly review vol xxii p 374  a narrator in whom the editor had implicit confidence mentions how when a lady held the twig just over a hidden well the twig turned so quick as to snap breaking near her fingers  there seems to be no indiscretion in saying as the statement has often been printed before that the lady spoken of in the quarterly review was lady milbanke mother of the wife of byron dr hutton the geologist is quoted as a witness of her success in the search for water with the divining rod  he says that in an experiment at woolwich the twigs twisted themselves off below her fingers which were considerably indented by so forcibly holding the rods between them 186  next the violent excitement of the four young men of the mauganja is paralleled by the physical experience of the lady quoted in the quarterly review  a degree of agitation was visible in her face when she first made the experiment she says this agitation was great when she began to practise the art or whatever we are to call it  again in lettres qui decouvrent lillusion p 93 we read that jacques aymar who discovered the lyons murderer in 1692 se sent tout emufeels greatly agitatedwhen he comes on that of which he is in search  on page 97 of the same volume the body of the man who holds the divining rod is described as violently agitated  when aymar entered the room where the murder to be described later was committed his pulse rose as if he were in a burning fever and the wand turned rapidly in his hands lettres p 107  but the most singular parallel to the performance of the african wizard must be quoted from a curious pamphlet already referred to a translation of the old french verge de jacob written annotated and published by a mr thomas welton  mr welton seems to have been a believer in mesmerism animal magnetism and similar doctrines but the coincidence of his story with that of the african sorcerer is none the less remarkable  it is a coincidence which must almost certainly be undesigned  mr weltons wife was what modern occult philosophers call a sensitive  in 1851 he wished her to try an experiment with the rod in a garden and sent a maidservant to bring a certain stick that stood behind the parlour door  in great terror she brought it to the garden her hand firmly clutched on the stick nor could she let it go      the stick was given to mrs welton and it drew her with very considerable force to nearly the centre of the garden to a bed of poppies where she stopped  here water was found and the gardener who had given up his lease as there was no well in the garden had the lease renewed  we have thus evidence to show and much more might be adduced that the belief in the divining rod or in analogous instruments is not confined to the european races  the superstition or whatever we are to call it produces the same effects of physical agitation and the use of the rod is accompanied with similar phenomena among mongols english people frenchmen and the natives of central africa  the same coincidences are found in almost all superstitious practices and in the effects of these practices on believers  the chinese use a form of planchette which is half a divining roda branch of the peach tree and spiritualism is more than threequarters of the religion of most savage tribes a maori seance being more impressive than anything the civilised sludge can offer his credulous patrons  from these facts different people draw different inferences  believers say that the wide distribution of their favourite mysteries is a proof that there is something in them  the incredulous look on our modern twigs and turningtables and ghost stories as mere survivals from the stage of savage culture or want of culture when the fancy of halfstarved man was active and his reason uncritical  the great authority for the modern history of the divining rod is a work published by m chevreuil in paris in 1854  m chevreuil probably with truth regarded the wand as much on a par with the turningtables which in 1854 attracted a good deal of attention  he studied the topic historically and his book with a few accessible french tracts and letters of the seventeenth century must here be our guide  a good deal of m chevreuils learning it should be said is reproduced in mr baring goulds curious myths of the middle ages but the french author is much more exhaustive in his treatment of the topic  m chevreuil could find no earlier book on the twig than the testament du frere basil valentin a holy man who flourished the twig about 1413 but whose treatise is possibly apocryphal  according to basil valentin the twig was regarded with awe by ignorant labouring men which is still true paracelsus though he has a reputation for magical daring thought the use of the twig uncertain and unlawful and agricola in his de re metallica 1546 expresses a good deal of scepticism about the use of the rod in mining  a traveller of 1554 found that the wand was not usedand this seems to have surprised himin the mines of macedonia most of the writers of the sixteenth century accounted for the turning of the rod by sympathy which was then as favourite an explanation of everything as evolution is today  in 1630 the baron de beau soleil of bohemia his name sounds rather bohemian came to france with his wife and made much use of the rod in the search for water and minerals  the baroness wrote a little volume on the subject afterwards reprinted in a great storehouse of this lore la physique occulte of vallemont kircher a jesuit made experiments which came to nothing but gaspard schott a learned writer cautiously declined to say that the devil was always at the bottom of it when the rod turned successfully  the problem of the rod was placed before our own royal society by boyle in 1666 but the society was not more successful here than in dealing with the philosophical difficulty proposed by charles ii  in 1679 de saint remain deserting the old hypothesis of secret sympathies explained the motion of the rod supposing it to move by the action of corpuscules  from this time the question became the playing ground of the cartesian and other philosophers  the struggle was between theories of atoms magnetism corpuscules electric effluvia and so forth on one side and the immediate action of devils or of conscious imposture on the other  the controversy comparatively simple as long as the rod only indicated hidden water or minerals was complicated by the revival of the savage belief that the wand could smell out moral offences  as long as the twig turned over material objects you could imagine sympathies and effluvia at pleasure  but when the wand twirled over the scene of a murder or dragged the expert after the traces of the culprit fresh explanations were wanted  le brun wrote to malebranche on july 8 1689 to tell him that the wand only turned over what the holder had the intention of discovering 190  if he were following a murderer the wand goodnaturedly refused to distract him by turning over hidden water  on the other hand vallemont says that when a peasant was using the wand to find water it turned over a spot in a wood where a murdered woman was buried and it conducted the peasant to the murderers house  these events seem inconsistent with le bruns theory of intention  malebranche replied in effect that he had only heard of the turning of the wand over water and minerals that it then turned if turn it did by virtue of some such force as electricity that if such force existed the wand would turn over open water  but it does not so turn and as physical causes are constant it follows that the turning of the rod cannot be the result of a physical cause  the only other explanation is an intelligent causeeither the will of an impostor or the action of a spirit  good spirits would not meddle with such matters therefore either the devil or an impostor causes the motion of the rod if it does move at all  this logic of malebranches is not agreeable to believers in the twig but there the controversy stood till in 1692 jacques aymar a peasant of dauphine by the use of the twig discovered one of the lyons murderers  though the story of this singular event is pretty well known it must here be briefly repeated  no affair can be better authenticated and our version is abridged from the relations of monsieur le procureur du roi monsieur labbe de la garde monsieur panthot doyen des medecins de lyon et monsieur aubert avocat celebre  on july 5 1692 a vintner and his wife were found dead in the cellar of their shop at lyons  they had been killed by blows from a hedgingknife and their money had been stolen  the culprits could not be discovered and a neighbour took upon him to bring to lyons a peasant out of dauphine named jacques aymar a man noted for his skill with the divining rod  the lieutenantcriminel and the procureur du roi took aymar into the cellar furnishing him with a rod of the first wood that came to hand  according to the procureur du roi the rod did not move till aymar reached the very spot where the crime had been committed  his pulse then rose and the wand twisted rapidly  guided by the wand or by some internal sensation aymar now pursued the track of the assassins entered the court of the archbishops palace left the town by the bridge over the rhone and followed the right bank of the river  he reached a gardeners house which he declared the men had entered and some children confessed that three men whom they described had come into the house one sunday morning  aymar followed the track up the river pointed out all the places where the men had landed and to make a long story short stopped at last at the door of the prison of beaucaire  he was admitted looked at the prisoners and picked out as the murderer a little hunchback had the children described a hunchback who had just been brought in for a small theft  the hunchback was taken to lyons and he was recognised on the way by the people at all the stages where he had stopped  at lyons he was examined in the usual manner and confessed that he had been an accomplice in the crime and had guarded the door aymar pursued the other culprits to the coast followed them by sea landed where they had landed and only desisted from his search when they crossed the frontier  as for the hunchback he was broken on the wheel being condemned on his own confession  it does not appear that he was put to the torture to make him confess  if this had been done his admissions would of course have been as valueless as those of the victims in trials for witchcraft  this is in brief the history of the famous lyons murders  it must be added that many experiments were made with aymar in paris and that they were all failures  he fell into every trap that was set for him detected thieves who were innocent failed to detect the guilty and invented absurd excuses alleging for example that the rod would not indicate a murderer who had confessed or who was drunk when he committed his crime  these excuses seem to annihilate the wild contemporary theory of chauvin and others that the body of a murderer naturally exhales an invisible matiere meurtrierepeculiar indestructible atoms which may be detected by the expert with the rod  something like the same theory we believe has been used to explain the pretended phenomena of haunted houses  but the wildest philosophical credulity is staggered by a matiere meurtriere which is disengaged by the body of a sober but not by that of an intoxicated murderer which survives tempests in the air and endures for many years but is dissipated the moment the murderer confesses  believers in aymar have conjectured that his real powers were destroyed by the excitements of paris and that he took to imposture but this is an effort of too easy goodnature  when vallemont defended aymar 1693 in the book called la physique occulte he declared that aymar was physically affected to an unpleasant extent by matiere meurtriere but was not thus agitated when he used the rod to discover minerals  we have seen that if modern evidence can be trusted holders of the rod are occasionally much agitated even when they are only in search of wells the story gave rise to a prolonged controversy and the case remains a judicial puzzle but little elucidated by the confession of the hunchback who may have been insane or morbid or vexed by constant questioning till he was weary of his life  he was only nineteen years of age  the next use of the rod was very much like that of tipping and turning tables  experts held it as did le pere menestrier 1694 questions were asked and the wand answered by turning in various directions  by way of showing the inconsistency of all philosophies of the wand it may be said that one girl found that it turned over concealed gold if she held gold in her hand while another found that it indicated the metal so long as she did not carry gold with her in the quest  in the search for water ecclesiastics were particularly fond of using the rod  the marechal de boufflers dug many wells and found no water on the indications of a rod in the hands of the prieur de dorenic near guise in 1700 a cure near toulouse used the wand to answer questions which like planchette it often answered wrong  the great sourcier or water finder of the eighteenth century was one bleton  he declared that the rod was a mere index and that physical sensations of the searcher communicated themselves to the wand  this is the reverse of the african theory that the stick is inspired while the men who hold it are only influenced by the stick  on the whole bletons idea seems the less absurd but bleton himself often failed when watched with scientific care by the incredulous  paramelle who wrote on methods of discovering wells in 1856 came to the conclusion that the wand turns in the hands of certain individuals of peculiar temperament and that it is very much a matter of chance whether there are or are not wells in the places where it turns  on the whole the evidence for the turning of the wand is a shade better than that for the magical turning of tables  if there are no phenomena of this sort at all it is remarkable that the belief in them is so widely diffused  but if the phenomena are purely subjective owing to the conscious or unconscious action of nervous patients then they are precisely of the sort which the cunning medicineman observes and makes his profit out of even in the earliest stages of society  once introduced these practices never die out among the conservative and unprogressive class of peasants and every now and then they attract the curiosity of philosophers or win the belief of the credulous among the educated classes  then comes as we have lately seen a revival of ancient superstition  for it were as easy to pluck the comet out of the sky by the tail as to eradicate superstition from the mind of man  perhaps one good word may be said for the divining rod  considering the chances it has enjoyed the rod has done less mischief than might have been expected  it might very well have become in europe as in asia and africa a kind of ordeal or method of searching for and trying malefactors  men like jacques aymar might have played on a larger scale the part of hopkins the witchfinder  aymar was indeed employed by some young men to point out by help of the wand the houses of ladies who had been more frail than faithful  but at the end of the seventeenth century in france this research was not regarded with favour and put the final touch on the discomfiture of aymar  so far as we know the hunchback of lyons was the only victim of the twig who ever suffered in civilised society  it is true that in rural england the movements of a bible suspended like a pendulum have been thought to point out the guilty  but even that evidence is not held good enough to go to a jury     hottentot mythology   what makes mythology mythological in the true sense of the word is what is utterly unintelligible absurd strange or miraculous  so says mr max muller in the january number of the nineteenth century for 1882 mens attention would never have been surprised into the perpetual study and questioning of mythology if it had been intelligible and dignified and if its report had been in accordance with the reason of civilised and cultivated races  what mythologists wish to discover is the origin of the countless disgusting amazing and incongruous legends which occur in the myths of all known peoples  according to mr muller     there are only two systems possible in which the irrational element in    mythology can be accounted for  one school takes the irrational as a    matter of fact and if we read that daphne fled before phoebus and    was changed into a laurel tree that school would say that there    probably was a young lady called aurora like for instance aurora    konigsmark that a young man called robin or possibly a man with red    hair pursued her and that she hid behind a laurel tree that happened    to be there  this was the theory of euhemeros reestablished by the    famous abbe bernier mr muller doubtless means banier and not quite    extinct even now  according to another school the irrational element    in mythology is inevitable and due to the influence of language on    thought so that many of the legends of gods and heroes may be    rendered intelligible if only we can discover the original meaning of    their proper names  the followers of this school try to show that    daphne the laurel tree was an old name for the dawn and that    phoibos was one of the many names of the sun who pursued the dawn    till she vanished before his rays  of these two schools the former    has always appealed to the mythologies of savage nations as showing    that gods and heroes were originally human beings worshipped after    their death as ancestors and as gods while the latter has confined    itself chiefly to an etymological analysis of mythological names in    greek latin and sanskrit and other languages such as had been    sufficiently studied to admit of a scientific grammatical and    etymological treatment  this is a long text for our remarks on hottentot mythology but it is necessary to prove that there are not two schools only of mythologists that there are inquirers who neither follow the path of the abbe banier nor of the philologists but a third way unknown to or ignored by mr muller  we certainly were quite unaware that banier and euhemeros were very specially concerned as mr muller thinks with savage mythology but it is by aid of savage myths that the school unknown to mr muller examines the myths of civilised peoples like the greeks  the disciples of mr muller interpret all the absurdities of greek myth the gods who are beasts on occasion the stars who were men the men who become serpents or deer the deities who are cannibals and parricides and adulterers as the result of the influence of aryan speech upon aryan thought  men in mr mullers opinion had originally pure ideas about the gods and expressed them in language which we should call figurative the figures remained when their meaning was lost the names were then supposed to be gods the nomina became numina and out of the inextricable confusion of thought which followed the belief in cannibal bestial adulterous and incestuous gods was evolved  that is mr mullers hypothesis with him the evolution a result of a disease of language has been from early comparative purity to later religious abominations  opposed to him is what may be called the school of mr herbert spencer the modern euhemerism which recognises an element of historical truth in myths as if the characters had been real characters and which in most gods beholds ancestral ghosts raised to a higher power  there remains a third system of mythical interpretation though mr muller says only two methods are possible  the method in this third case is to see whether the irrational features and elements of civilised greek myth occur also in the myths of savages who speak languages quite unlike those from whose diseases mr muller derives the corruption of religion  if the same features recur are they as much in harmony with the mental habits of savages such as bushmen and hottentots as they are out of accord with the mental habits of civilised greeks  if this question can be answered in the affirmative then it may be provisionally assumed that the irrational elements of savage myth are the legacy of savage modes of thought and have survived in the religion of greece from a time when the ancestors of the greeks were savages  but inquirers who use this method do not in the least believe that either greek or savage gods were for the more part originally real men  both greeks and savages have worshipped the ghosts of the dead  both greeks and savages assign to their gods the miraculous powers of transformation and magic which savages also attribute to their conjurers or shamans  the mantle if he had a mantle of the medicineman has fallen on the god but zeus or indra was not once a real medicineman  a number of factors combine in the conception of indra or zeus as either god appears in sanskrit or greek literature of earlier or later date  our school does not hold anything so absurd as that daphne was a real girl pursued by a young man but it has been observed that among most savage races metamorphoses like that of daphne not only exist in mythology but are believed to occur very frequently in actual life  men and women are supposed to be capable of turning into plants as the bamboo in sarawak into animals and stones and stars and those metamorphoses happen as contemporary eventsfor example in samoa 200  when mr lane was living at cairo and translating the arabian nights he found that the people still believed in metamorphosis  any day just as in the arabian nights a man might find himself turned by an enchanter into a pig or a horse  similar beliefs not derived from language supply the matter of the senseless incidents in greek myths  savage mythology is also full of metamorphoses  therefore the mythologists whose case we are stating when they find identical metamorphoses in the classical mythologies conjecture that these were first invented when the ancestors of the aryans were in the imaginative condition in which a score of rude races are today  this explanation they apply to many other irrational elements in mythology  they do not say something like the events narrated in these stories once occurred nor a disease of language caused the belief in such events but these stories were invented when men were capable of believing in their occurrence as a not unusual sort of incident  philologists attempt to explain the metamorphoses as the result of some oblivion and confusion of language  apollo they say was called the wolfgod lukeios by accident his name really meant the god of light  a similar confusion made the seven shiners into the seven bears 201  these explanations are distrusted partly because the area to be covered by them is so vast  there is scarcely a star tree or beast but it has been a man or woman once if we believe civilised and savage myth  two or three possible examples of myths originating in forgetfulness of the meaning of words even if admitted do not explain the incalculable crowd of metamorphoses  we account for these by saying that to the savage mind which draws no hard and fast line between man and nature all such things are possible possible enough at least to be used as incidents in story  again as has elsewhere been shown the laxity of philological reasoning is often quite extraordinary while lastly philologists of the highest repute flatly contradict each other about the meaning of the names and roots on which they agree in founding their theory 202a  by way of an example of the philological method as applied to savage mythology we choose a book in many ways admirable dr hahns tsuni goam the supreme being of the khoi khoi 202b  this book is sometimes appealed to as a crushing argument against the mythologists who adopt the method we have just explained  let us see if the blow be so very crushing  to put the case in a nutshell the hottentots have commonly been described as a race which worshipped a dead chief or conjurertsui goab his name is meaning wounded knee a not unlikely name for a savage dr hahn on the other hand labours to show that the hottentots originally worshipped no dead chief but as a symbol of the infinite the red dawn  the meaning of the name red dawn he says was lost the words which meant red dawn were erroneously supposed to mean wounded knee and thus arose the adoration and the myths of a dead chief or wizard tsui goab wounded knee  clearly if this can be proved it is an excellent case for the philological school an admirable example of a myth produced by forgetfulness of the meaning of words  our own opinion is that even if tsui goab originally meant red dawn the being as now conceived of by his adorers is bedizened in the trappings of the dead medicineman and is worshipped just as ghosts of the dead are worshipped  thus whatever his origin his myth is freely coloured by the savage fancy and by savage ideas and we ask no more than this colouring to explain the wildest greek myths  what truly primitive religion was we make no pretence to know  we only say that whether greek religion arose from a pure fountain or not its stream had flowed through and been tinged by the soil of savage thought before it widens into our view in historical times  but it will be shown that the logic which connects tsui goab with the red dawn is far indeed from being cogent  tsui goab is thought by the hottentots themselves to be a dead man and it is admitted that among the hottentots dead men are adored  cairns are still objects of worship 203a and tsui goab lies beneath several cairns  again soothsayers are believed in p 24 and tsui goab is regarded as a deceased soothsayer  as early as 1655 a witness quoted by hahn saw women worshipping at one of the cairns of heitsi eibib another supposed ancestral being  kolb the old dutch traveller found that the hottentots like the bushmen revered the mantis insect  this creature they called gaunab  they also had some moon myths practised adoration of the moon and danced at dawn  thunberg 1792 saw the cairnworship and on asking its meaning was told that a hottentot lay buried there 203b  thunberg also heard of the worship of the mantis or grey grasshopper  in 1803 liechtenstein noted the cairnworship and was told that a renowned hottentot doctor of old times rested under the cairn appleyards account of the name god in khoi khoi or hottentot deserves quoting in full     hottentot tsoeikoap    namaqua tsoeikoap    koranna tshukoab and the author adds this is the word from which    the kafirs have probably derived their utixo a term which they have    universally applied like the hottentots to designate the divine    being since the introduction of christianity  its derivation is    curious  it consists of two words which together mean the wounded    knee  it is said to have been originally applied to a doctor or    sorcerer of considerable notoriety and skill amongst the hottentots or    namaquas some generations back in consequence of his having received    some injury in his knee  having been held in high repute for    extraordinary powers during life he appeared to be invoked even after    death as one who could still relieve and protect and hence in    process of time he became nearest in idea to their first conceptions    of god  other missionaries make old wounded knee a good sort of being on the whole who fights gaunab a bad being  dr moffat heard that tsui kuap was a notable warrior who once received a wound in the knee  sir james alexander 204 found that the namaquas believed their great father lay below the cairns on which they flung boughs  this great father was heitsi eibib and like other medicinemen he could take many forms  like tsui goab he died several times and rose again  hahn gives p 61 a long account of the wounded knee from an old chief and a story of the battle between tsui goab who lives in a beautiful heaven and gaunab who lives in a dark heaven  as this chief had dwelt among missionaries very long we may perhaps discount his remarks on heaven as borrowed  hahn thinks they refer to the red sky in which tsui goab lived and to the black sky which was the home of gaunab  the two characters in this crude religious dualism thus inhabit light and darkness respectively        as far as we have gone tsui goab like heitsi eibib among the namas is a dead sorcerer whose graves are worshipped while with a common inconsistency he is also thought of as dwelling in the sky  even christians often speak of the dead with similar inconsistency  tsui goabs worship is intelligible enough among a people so credulous that they took hahn himself for a conjurer p 81 and so given to ancestor worship that hahn has seen them worship their own fathers graves and expect help from men recently dead pp 112 113  but while the khoi khoi think that tsui goab was once a real man we need not share their euhemerism  more probably like unkulunkulu among the zulus tsui goab is an ideal imaginary ancestral sorcerer and god  no one man requires many graves and tsui goab has more than osiris possessed in egypt 205  if the egyptians in some immeasurably distant past were once on the level of namas and hottentots they would worship osiris at as many barrows as heitsi eibib and tsui goab are adored  in later times the numerous graves of one being would require explanation and explanations would be furnished by the myth that the body of osiris was torn to pieces and each fragment buried in a separate tomb  again lame gods occur in greek australian and brazilian creeds and the very coincidence of tsui goabs lameness makes us sceptical about his claims to be a real dead man  on the other hand when hahn tells us that epical myths are now sung in the dances in honour of warriors lately slain p 103 and that similar dances and songs were performed in the past to honour tsui goab this looks more as if tsui goab had been an actual person  against this we must set p 105 the belief that tsui goab made the first man and woman and was the prometheus of the hottentots        so far dr hahn has given us facts which entirely fit in with our theory that an ancestorworshipping people believing in metamorphosis and sorcery adores a god who is supposed to be a deceased ancestral sorcerer with the power of magic and metamorphosis  but now dr hahn offers his own explanation  according to the philological method he will study the names of the persons until we arrive at the naked root and original meanings of the words  starting then with tsui goab whom all evidence declares to be a dead lame conjurer and warrior dr hahn avers that tsui goab originally tsuni goam was the name by which the red men called the infinite  as the frenchman said of the derivation of jour from dies we may hint that the infinite thus transformed into a lame hottentot bushdoctor is diablement change en route  to a dead lame sorcerer from the infinite is a fall indeed  the process of the decline is thus described  tsui goab is composed of two roots tsu and goa  goa means to go on to come on  in khoi khoi goab means the coming on one the dawn and goab also means the knee  dr hahn next writes making a logical leap of extraordinary width it is now obvious that goab in tsui goab cannot be translated with kneewhy notbut we have to adopt the other metaphorical meaning the approaching day ie the dawn  where is the necessity  in ordinary philology we should here demand a number of attested examples of goab in the sense of dawn but in khoi khoi we cannot expect such evidence as there are probably no texts  next after arbitrarily deciding that all khoi khois misunderstand their own tongue for that is what the rendering here of goab by dawn comes to dr hahn examines tsu in tsui  tsu means sore wounded painful as in wounded kneetsui goab  this does not help dr hahn for wounded dawn means nothing  but he reflects that a wound is red tsu means wounded therefore tsu means red therefore tsui goab is the red dawn  qed  this kind of reasoning is obviously fallacious  dr hahns point could only be made by bringing forward examples in which tsu is employed to mean red in khoi khoi  of this use of the word tsu he does not give one single instance though on this point his argument depends  his etymology is not strengthened by the fact that tsui goab has once been said to live in the red sky  a red house is not necessarily tenanted by a red man  still less is the theory supported by the hymn which says tsui goab paints himself with red ochre  most idols from those of the samoyeds to the greek images of dionysus are and have been daubed with red  by such reasoning is tsui goab proved to be the red dawn while his gifts of prophecy which he shares with all soothsayers are accounted for as attributes of dawn of the vedic saranyu  turning from tsui goab to his old enemy gaunab we learn that his name is derived from gau to destroy and according to old hottentot ideas no one was the destroyer but the night p 126  there is no apparent reason why the destroyer should be the night and the night alone any more than why a lame broken knee should be red p 126  besides p 85 gaunab is elsewhere explained not as the night but as the malevolent ghost which is thought to kill people who die what we call a natural death  unburied men change into this sort of vampire just as elpenor in the odyssey threatens if unburied to become mischievous there is another gaunab the mantis insect which is worshipped by hottentots and bushmen p 92  it appears that the two gaunabs are differently pronounced  however that may be a race which worships an insect might well worship a dead medicineman        the conclusion then to be drawn from an examination of hottentot mythology is merely this that the ideas of a people will be reflected in their myths  a people which worships the dead believes in sorcerers and in prophets and in metamorphosis will have for its god if he can be called a god a being who is looked on as a dead prophet and sorcerer  he will be worshipped with such rites as dead men receive he will be mixed up in such battles as living men wage and will be credited with the skill which living sorcerers claim  all these things meet in the legend of tsui goab the socalled supreme being of the hottentots  his connection with the dawn is not supported by convincing argument or evidence  the relation of the dawn to the infinite again rests on nothing but a theory of mr max mullers 209  his adversary though recognised as the night is elsewhere admitted to have been originally a common vampire  finally the hottentots a people not much removed from savagery have a mythology full of savage and even disgusting elements  and this is just what we expect from hottentots  the puzzle is when we find myths as low as the story of the incest of heitsi eibib among the greeks  the reason for this coincidence is that in dr hahns words the same objects and the same phenomena in nature will give rise to the same ideas whether social or mythical among different races of mankind especially when these races are in the same welldefined state of savage fancy and savage credulity  dr hahns book has been regarded as a kind of triumph over inquirers who believe that ancestorworship enters into myth and that the purer element in myth is the later  but where is the triumph  even on dr hahns own showing ancestorworship among the hottentots has swamped the adoration of the infinite  it may be said that dr hahn has at least proved the adoration of the infinite to be earlier than ancestorworship but it has been shown that his attempt to establish a middle stage to demonstrate that the worshipped ancestor was really the red dawn is not logical nor convincing  even if that middle stage were established it is a far cry from the worship of dawn supposed by the australians to be a woman of bad character in a cloak of red possumskin to the adoration of the infinite  our own argument has been successful if we have shown that there are not only two possible schools of mythological interpretationthe euhemeristic led by mr spencer and the philological led by mr max muller  we have seen that it is possible to explain the legend of tsui goab without either believing him to have been a real historical person as mr spencer may perhaps believe or his myth to have been the result of a disease of language as mr muller supposes  we have explained the legend and worship of a supposed dead conjurer as natural to a race which believes in conjurers and worships dead men  whether he was merely an ideal ancestor and warrior or whether an actual man has been invested with what divine qualities tsui goab enjoys it is impossible to say but if he ever lived he has long been adorned with ideal qualities and virtues which he never possessed the conception of the powerful ancestral ghost has been heightened and adorned with some novel attributes of power the conception of the infinite has not been degraded by forgetfulness of language to the estate of an ancestral ghost with a game leg        if this view be correct myth is the result of thought far more than of a disease of language  the comparative importance of language and thought was settled long ago in our sense by no less a person than pragapati the sanskrit master of life  now a dispute once took place between mind and speech as to which was the better of the two  both mind and speech said i am excellent  mind said surely i am better than thou for thou dost not speak anything that is not understood by me and since thou art only an imitator of what is done by me and a follower in my wake i am surely better than thou speech said surely i am better than thou for what thou knowest i make known i communicate  they went to appeal to pragapati for his decision  he pragapati decided in favour of mind saying to speech mind is indeed better than thou for thou art an imitator of its deeds and a follower in its wake and inferior surely is he who imitates his betters deeds and follows in his wake  so saith the satapatha brahmana 211     fetichism and the infinite   what is the true place of fetichism to use a common but unscientific term in the history of religious evolution  some theorists have made fetichism that is to say the adoration of odds and ends with which they have confused the worship of animals of mountains and even of the earth the first moment in the development of worship  others again think that fetichism is a corruption of religion in africa as elsewhere  the latter is the opinion of mr max muller who has stated it in his hibbert lectures on the origin and growth of religion especially as illustrated by the religions of india  it seems probable that there is a middle position between these two extremes  students may hold that we hardly know enough to justify us in talking about the origin of religion while at the same time they may believe that fetichism is one of the earliest traceable steps by which men climbed to higher conceptions of the supernatural  meanwhile mr max muller supports his own theory that fetichism is a parasitical growth a corruption of religion by arguments mainly drawn from historical study of savage creeds and from the ancient religious documents of india  these documents are to english investigators ignorant of sanskrit a book sealed with seven seals  the vedas are interpreted in very different ways by different oriental scholars  it does not yet appear to be known whether a certain word in the vedic funeral service means goat or soul  mr max mullers rendering is certain to have the first claim on english readers and therefore it is desirable to investigate the conclusions which he draws from his vedic studies  the ordinary anthropologist must first however lodge a protest against the tendency to look for primitive matter in the vedas  they are the elaborate hymns of a specially trained set of poets and philosophers living in an age almost of civilisation  they can therefore contain little testimony as to what man while still primitive thought about god the world and the soul  one might as well look for the first germs of religion for primitive religion strictly so called in hymns ancient and modern as in the vedas  it is chiefly however by way of deductions from the vedas that mr max muller arrives at ideas which may be briefly and broadly stated thus he inclines to derive religion from mans sense of the infinite as awakened by natural objects calculated to stir that sense  our position is on the other hand that the germs of the religious sense in early man are developed not so much by the vision of the infinite as by the idea of power  early religions in short are selfish not disinterested  the worshipper is not contemplative so much as eager to gain something to his advantage  in fetiches he ignorantly recognises something that possesses power of an abnormal sort and the train of ideas which leads him to believe in and to treasure fetiches is one among the earliest springs of religious belief  mr mullers opinion is the very reverse he believes that a contemplative and disinterested emotion in the presence of the infinite or of anything that suggests infinitude or is mistaken for the infinite begets human religion while of this religion fetichism is a later corruption        in treating of fetichism mr muller is obliged to criticise the system of de brosses who introduced this rather unfortunate term to science in an admirable work le culte des dieux fetiches 1760  we call the work admirable because considering the contemporary state of knowledge and speculation de brossess book is brilliant original and only now and then rash or confused  mr muller says that de brosses holds that all nations had to begin with fetichism to be followed afterwards by polytheism and monotheism  this sentence would lead some readers to suppose that de brosses in his speculations was looking for the origin of religion but in reality his work is a mere attempt to explain a certain element in ancient religion and mythology  de brosses was well aware that heathen religions were a complex mass a concretion of many materials  he admits the existence of regard for the spirits of the dead as one factor he gives sabaeism a place as another  but what chiefly puzzles him and what he chiefly tries to explain is the worship of odds and ends of rubbish and the adoration of animals mountains trees the sun and so forth  when he masses all these worships together and proposes to call them all fetichism a term derived from the portuguese word for a talisman de brosses is distinctly unscientific  but de brosses is distinctly scientific when he attempts to explain the animal worship of egypt and the respect paid by greeks and romans to shapeless stones as survivals of older savage practices  the position of de brosses is this old mythology and religion are a tissue of many threads  sabaeism adoration of the dead mythopoeic fancy have their part in the fabric  among many african tribes a form of theism islamite or christian or selfdeveloped is superimposed on a mass of earlier superstitions  among these superstitions is the worship of animals and plants and the cult of rough stones and of odds and ends of matter  what is the origin of this element so prominent in the religion of egypt and present if less conspicuous in the most ancient temples of greece  it is the survival answers de brosses of ancient practices like those of untutored peoples as brazilians samoyeds negroes whom the egyptians and pelasgians once resembled in lack of culture  this briefly stated is the hypothesis of de brosses  if he had possessed our wider information he would have known that among savage races the worships of the stars of the dead and of plants and animals are interlaced by the strange metaphysical processes of wild men  he would perhaps have kept the supernatural element in magical stones feathers shells and so on apart from the triple thread of sabaeism ghostworship and totemism with its later development into the regular worship of plants and animals  it must be recognised however that de brosses was perfectly well aware of the confused and manifold character of early religion  he had a clear view of the truth that what the religious instinct has once grasped it does not as a rule abandon but subordinates or disguises when it reaches higher ideas  and he avers again and again that men laid hold of the coarser and more material objects of worship while they themselves were coarse and dull and that as civilisation advanced they as a rule subordinated and disguised the ruder factors in their system  here it is that mr max muller differs from de brosses  he holds that the adoration of stones feathers shells and as i understand him the worship of animals are even among the races of africa a corruption of an earlier and purer religion a parasitical development of religion  however mr max muller himself held for a long time what he calls de brossess theory of fetichism  what made him throw the theory overboard  it was the fact that while in the earliest accessible documents of religious thought we look in vain for any very clear traces of fetichism they become more and more frequent everywhere in the later stages of religious development and are certainly more visible in the later corruptions of the indian religion beginning with the atharvana than in the earliest hymns of the rig veda  now by the earliest accessible documents of religious thought professor max muller means the hymns of the rig veda  these hymns are composed in the most elaborate metre by sages of old repute who i presume occupied a position not unlike that of the singers and seers of israel  they lived in an age of tolerably advanced cultivation  they had wide geographical knowledge they had settled government  they dwelt in states  they had wealth of gold of grain and of domesticated animals  among the metals they were acquainted with that which in most countries has been the latest workedthey used iron poles in their chariots  how then can the hymns of the most enlightened singers of a race thus far developed be called the earliest religious documents  oldest they may be the oldest that are accessible but that is a very different thing  how can we possibly argue that what is absent in these hymns is absent because it had not yet come into existence  is it not the very office of pii vates et phoebo digna locuti to purify religion to cover up decently its rude shapes as the unhewn stone was concealed in the fane of apollo of delos  if the race whose noblest and oldest extant hymns were pure exhibits traces of fetichism in its later documents may not that as easily result from a recrudescence as from a corruption  professor max muller has still moreover to explain how the process of corruption which introduced the same fetichistic practices among samoyeds brazilians kaffirs and the people of the atharvana veda came to be everywhere identical in its results  here an argument often urged against the anthropological method may be shortly disposed of  you examine savages people say but how do you know that these savages were not once much more cultivated that their whole mode of life religion and all is not debased and decadent from an earlier standard  mr muller glances at this argument which however cannot serve his purpose  mr muller has recognised that savage or nomadic languages represent a much earlier state of language than anything that we find for example in the oldest hebrew or sanskrit texts  for this reason he says 218 the study of what i call nomad languages as distinguished from state languages becomes so instructive  we see in them what we can no longer expect to see even in the most ancient sanskrit or hebrew  we watch the childhood of language with all its childish freaks  yes adds the anthropologist and for this reason the study of savage religions as distinguished from state religions becomes so instructive  we see in them what we can no longer expect to see even in the most ancient sanskrit or hebrew faiths  we watch the childhood of religion with all its childish freaks  if this reasoning be sound when the kaffir tongue is contrasted with ancient sanskrit it should be sound when the kaffir faith is compared with the vedic faith  by parity of reasoning the religious beliefs of peoples as much less advanced than the kaffirs as the kaffirs are less advanced than the vedic peoples should be still nearer the infancy of faith still nearer the beginning  we have been occupied perhaps too long with de brosses and our apology for de brosses  let us now examine as shortly as possible mr max mullers reasons for denying that fetichism is a primitive form of religion  the negative side of his argument being thus disposed of it will then be our business to consider 1 his psychological theory of the subjective element in religion and 2 his account of the growth of indian religion  the conclusion of the essay will be concerned with demonstrating that mr max mullers system assigns little or no place to the superstitious beliefs without which in other countries than india society could not have come into organised existence        in his polemic against fetichism it is not always very easy to see against whom mr muller is contending  it is one thing to say that fetichism is a primitive form of religion and quite another to say that it is the very beginning of all religion  occasionally he attacks the comtian theory which i think is not now held by many people who study the history of man and which i am not concerned to defend  he says that the portuguese navigators who discovered among the negroes no other trace of any religious worship except what they called the worship of feiticos concluded that this was the whole of the religion of the negroes p 61  mr muller then goes on to prove that no religion consists of fetichism only choosing his examples of higher elements in negro religion from the collections of waitz  it is difficult to see what bearing this has on his argument  de brosses p 20 shows that he at least was well aware that many negro tribes have higher conceptions of the deity than any which are implied in fetichworship even if no tribe in the world is exclusively devoted to fetiches the argument makes no progress  perhaps no extant tribe is in the way of using unpolished stone weapons and no others but it does not follow that unpolished stone weapons are not primitive  it is just as easy to maintain that the purer ideas have by this time been reached by aid of the steppingstones of the grosser as that the grosser are the corruption of the purer  mr max muller constantly asserts that the human mind advanced by small and timid steps from what is intelligible to what is at first sight almost beyond comprehension p 126  among the objects which aided man to take these small and timid steps he reckons rivers and trees which excited he says religious awe  what he will not suppose is that the earliest small and timid steps were not unaided by such objects as the fetichist treasuresstones shells and so forth which suggest no idea of infinity  stocks he will admit but not if he can help it stones of the sort that negroes and kanekas and other tribes use as fetiches  his reason is that he does not see how the scraps of the fetichist can appeal to the feeling of the infinite which feeling is in his theory the basis of religion  after maintaining what is readily granted that negroes have a religion composed of many elements mr muller tries to discredit the evidence about the creeds of savages and discourses on the many minute shades of progress which exist among tribes too often lumped together as if they were all in the same condition  here he will have all scientific students of savage life on his side  it remains true however that certain elements of savage practice fetichism being one of them are practically ubiquitous  thus when mr muller speaks of the influence of public opinion in biassing the narrative of travellers we must not forget that the strongest evidence about savage practice is derived from the undesigned coincidence of the testimonies of all sorts of men in all ages and all conditions of public opinion  illiterate men ignorant of the writings of each other bring the same reports from various quarters of the globe wrote millar of glasgow  when sailors merchants missionaries describe as matters unprecedented and unheard of such institutions as polyandry totemism and so forth the evidence is so strong because the witnesses are so astonished  they do not know that anyone but themselves has ever noticed the curious facts before their eyes  and when mr muller tries to make the testimony about savage faith still more untrustworthy by talking of the absence of recognised authority among savages do not let us forget that custom greek is a recognised authority and that the punishment of death is inflicted for transgression of certain rules  these rules generally speaking are of a religious nature and the religion to which they testify is of the sort known too vaguely as fetichistic  let us keep steadily before our minds when people talk of lack of evidence that we have two of the strongest sorts of evidence in the world for the kind of religion which least suits mr mullers argument1 the undesigned coincidences of testimony 2 the irrefutable witness and sanction of elementary criminal law  mr mullers own evidence is that muchdisputed work where all men see what they want to see as in the clouds and where many see systematised fetichismthe veda 222  the first step in mr max mullers polemic was the assertion that fetichism is nowhere unmixed  we have seen that the fact is capable of an interpretation that will suit either side  stages of culture overlap each other  the second step in his polemic was the effort to damage the evidence  we have seen that we have as good evidence as can be desired in the third place he asks what are the antecedents of fetichworship he appears to conceive himself to be arguing with persons p 127 who have taken for granted that every human being was miraculously endowed with the concept of what forms the predicate of every fetich call it power spirit or god  if there are reasoners so feeble they must be left to the punishment inflicted by mr muller  on the other hand students who regard the growth of the idea of power which is the predicate of every fetish as a slow process as the result of various impressions and trains of early halfconscious reasoning cannot be disposed of by the charge that they think that every human being was miraculously endowed with any concept whatever  they at least will agree with mr max muller that there are fetiches and fetiches that to one reverence is assigned for one reason to another for another unfortunately it is less easy to admit that mr max muller has been happy in his choice of ancient instances  he writes p 99 sometimes a stock or a stone was worshipped because it was a forsaken altar or an ancient place of judgment sometimes because it marked the place of a great battle or a murder or the burial of a king  here he refers to pausanias book i 28 5 and viii 13 3 223  in both of these passages pausanias it is true mentions stonesin the first passage stones on which men stood greek in the second barrows heaped up in honour of men who fell in battle  in neither case however do i find anything to show that the stones were worshipped  these stones then have no more to do with the argument than the milestones which certainly exist on the dover road but which are not the objects of superstitious reverence  no the fetichstones of greece were those which occupied the holy of holies of the most ancient temples the mysterious fanes within dark cedar or cypress groves to which men were hardly admitted  they were the stones and blocks which bore the names of gods hera or apollo names perhaps given as de brosses says to the old fetichistic objects of worship after the anthropomorphic gods entered hellas  this at least is the natural conclusion from the fact that the apollo and hera of untouched wood or stone were confessedly the oldest  religion possessing an old fetich did not run the risk of breaking the run of luck by discarding it but wisely retained and renamed it  mr max muller says that the unhewn lump may indicate a higher power of abstraction than the worship paid to the work of phidias but in that case all the savage adorers of rough stones may be in a stage of more abstract thought than these contemporaries of phidias who had such very hard work to make greek thought abstract  mr muller founds a very curious argument on what he calls the ubiquity of fetichism  like de brosses he compiles from pausanias a list of the rude stones worshipped by the early greeks  he mentions various examples of fetichistic superstitions in rome  he detects the fetichism of popular catholicism and of russian orthodoxy among the peasants here he cries in religions the history of which is known to us fetichism is secondary and why should fetiches in africa where we do not know the earlier development of religion be considered as primary what a singular argument  according to pausanias this fetichism if fetichism it is was primary in greece  the oldest temples in their holiest place held the oldest fetich  in rome it is at least probable that fetichism as in greece was partly a survival partly a new growth from the primal root of human superstitions  as to catholicism the records of councils the invectives of the church show us that from the beginning the secondary religion in point of time the religion of the church laboured vainly to suppress and had in part to tolerate the primary religion of childish superstitions  the documents are before the world  as to the russians the history of their conversion is pretty well known  jaroslaf or vladimir or some other evangelist had whole villages baptized in groups and the pagan peasants naturally kept up their primary semisavage ways of thought and worship under the secondary varnish of orthodoxy  in all mr max mullers examples then fetichism turns out to be primary in point of time secondary only as subordinate to some later development of faith or to some lately superimposed religion  accepting his statement that fetichism is ubiquitous we have the most powerful a priori argument that fetichism is primitive  as religions become developed they are differentiated it only fetichism that you find the same everywhere  thus the bow and arrow have a wide range of distribution the musket one not so wide the martinihenry rifle a still narrower range it is the primitive stone weapons that are ubiquitous that are found in the soil of england egypt america france greece as in the hands of dieyries and admiralty islanders  and just as rough stone knives are earlier than iron ones though the same race often uses both so fetichism is more primitive than higher and purer faiths though the same race often combines fetichism and theism  no one will doubt the truth of this where weapons are concerned but mr max muller will not look at religion in this way  mr max mullers remarks on zoolatry as de brosses calls it or animal worship require only the briefest comment  de brosses very unluckily confused zoolatry with other superstitions under the head of fetichism this was unscientific but is it scientific of mr max muller to discuss animalworship without any reference to totemism  the worship of sacred animals is found in every part of the globe to be part of the sanction of the most stringent and important of all laws the laws of marriage  it is an historical truth that the society of ashantees choctaws australians is actually constructed by the operation of laws which are under the sanction of various sacred plants and animals 226  there is scarcely a race so barbarous that these laws are not traceable at work in its society nor a people especially an ancient people so cultivated that its laws and religion are not full of strange facts most easily explained as relics of totemism  now note that actual living totemism is always combined with the rudest ideas of marriage with almost repulsive ideas about the family  presumably this rudeness is earlier than culture and therefore this form of animalworship is one of the earliest religions that we know  the almost limitless distribution of the phenomena their regular development their gradual disappearance all point to the fact that they are all very early and everywhere produced by similar causes  of all these facts mr max muller only mentions onethat many races have called themselves snakes and he thinks they might naturally adopt the snake for ancestor and finally for god  he quotes the remark of diodorus that the snake may either have been made a god because he was figured on the banners or may have been figured on the banners because he was a god to which de brosses with his usual sense rejoinswe represent saints on our banners because we revere them we do not revere them because we represent them on our banners  in a discussion about origins and about the corruption of religion it would have been well to account for institutions and beliefs almost universally distributed  we know what de brosses did not that zoolatry is inextricably blent with laws and customs which surely must be early if not primitive because they make the working faith of societies in which male descent and the modern family are not yet established  anyone who wishes to show that this sort of society is a late corruption not an early stage in evolution towards better things has a difficult task before him which however he must undertake before he can prove zoolatry to be a corruption of religion  as to the worship of ancestral and embodied human spirits which it has been so plausibly argued is the first moment in religion mr max muller dismisses it here in eleven lines and a half  an isolated but important allusion at the close of his lectures will be noticed in its place  the end of the polemic against the primitiveness of fetichism deals with the question whence comes the supernatural predicate of the fetich  if a negro tells us his fetich is a god whence got he the idea of god many obvious answers occur  mr muller says speaking of the indians p 205 the concept of gods was no doubt growing up while men were assuming a more and more definite attitude towards these semitangible and intangible objectstrees rivers hills the sky the sun and so on which he thinks suggested and developed by aid of a kind of awe the religious feeling of the infinite  we too would say that among people who adore fetiches and ghosts the concept of gods no doubt silently grew up as men assumed a more and more definite attitude towards the tangible and intangible objects they held sacred  again negroes have had the idea of god imported among them by christians and islamites so that even if they did not climb as de brosses grants that many of them do to purer religious ideas unaided these ideas are now familiar to them and may well be used by them when they have to explain a fetich to a european  mr max muller explains the origin of religion by a term the infinite  which he admits the early people would not have comprehended  the negro if he tells a white man that a fetich is a god transposes terms in the same unscientific way  mr muller asks how do these people when they have picked up their stone or their shell pick up at the same time the concepts of a supernatural power of spirit of god and of worship paid to some unseen being  but who says that men picked up these ideas at the same time  these ideas were evolved by a long slow complicated process  it is not at all impossible that the idea of a kind of luck attached to this or that object was evolved by dint of meditating on a mere series of lucky accidents  such or such a man having found such an object succeeded in hunting fishing or war by degrees similar objects might be believed to command success  thus burglars carry bits of coal in their pockets for luck  this random way of connecting causes and effects which have really no interrelation is a common error of early reasoning  mr max muller says that this process of reasoning is far more in accordance with modern thought if so modern thought has little to be proud of  herodotus however describes the process of thought as consecrated by custom among the egyptians  but there are many other practical ways in which the idea of supernatural power is attached to fetiches  some fetichstones have a superficial resemblance to other objects and thus on the magical system of reasoning are thought to influence these objects  others again are pointed out as worthy of regard in dreams or by the ghosts of the dead 230  to hold these views of the origin of the supernatural predicate of fetiches is not to take for granted that every human being was miraculously endowed with the concept of what forms the predicate of every fetich  thus we need not be convinced by mr max muller that fetichism though it necessarily has its antecedents in the human mind is a corruption of religion  it still appears to be one of the most primitive steps towards the idea of the supernatural  what then is the subjective element of religion in man  how has he become capable of conceiving of the supernatural  what outward objects first awoke that dormant faculty in his breast  mr max muller answers that man has the faculty of apprehending the infinitethat by dint of this faculty he is capable of religion and that sensible objects tangible semitangible intangible first roused the faculty to religious activity at least among the natives of india  he means however by the infinite which savages apprehend not our metaphysical conception of the infinite but the mere impression that there is something beyond  every thing of which his senses cannot perceive a limit is to a primitive savage or to any man in an early stage of intellectual activity unlimited or infinite  thus in all experience the idea of a beyond is forced on men  if mr max muller would adhere to this theory then we should suppose him to mean what we hold to be more or less true that savage religion like savage science is merely a fanciful explanation of what lies beyond the horizon of experience  for example if the australians mentioned by mr max muller believe in a being who created the world a being whom they do not worship and to whom they pay no regard for indeed he has become decrepit their theory is scientific not religious  they have looked for the causes of things and are no more religious in so doing than newton was when he worked out his theory of gravitation  the term infinite is wrongly applied because it is a term of advanced thought used in explanation of the ideas of men who mr max muller says were incapable of conceiving the meaning of such a concept  again it is wrongly applied because it has some modern religious associations which are covertly and fallaciously introduced to explain the supposed emotions of early men  thus mr muller says p 177he is giving his account of the material things that awoke the religious facultythe mere sight of the torrent or the stream would have been enough to call forth in the hearts of the early dwellers on the earth    a feeling that they were surrounded on all sides by powers invisible infinite or divine  here if i understand mr muller infinite is used in our modern sense  the question is how did men ever come to believe in powers infinite invisible divine  if mr mullers words mean anything they mean that a dormant feeling that there were such existences lay in the breast of man and was wakened into active and conscious life by the sight of a torrent or a stream  how to use mr mullers own manner did these people when they saw a stream have mentally at the same time a feeling of infinite powers  if this is not the expression of a theory of innate religion a theory which mr muller disclaims it is capable of being mistaken for that doctrine by even a careful reader  the feeling of powers infinite invisible divine must be in the heart or the mere sight of a river could not call it forth  how did the feeling get into the heart  that is the question  the ordinary anthropologist distinguishes a multitude of causes a variety of processes which shade into each other and gradually produce the belief in powers invisible infinite and divine  what tribe is unacquainted with dreams visions magic the apparitions of the dead  add to these the slow action of thought the conjectural inferences the guesses of crude metaphysics the theories of isolated men of religious and speculative genius  by all these and other forces manifold that emotion of awe in presence of the hills the stars the sea is developed  mr max muller cuts the matter shorter  the early inhabitants of earth saw a river and the mere sight of the torrent called forth the feelings which to us seem to demand ages of the operation of causes disregarded by mr muller in his account of the origin of indian religion  the mainspring of mr mullers doctrine is his theory about apprehending the infinite  early religion or at least that of india was in his view the extension of an idea of vastness a disinterested emotion of awe 233a  elsewhere we think early religion has been a development of ideas of force an interested search not for something wide and far and hard to conceive but for something practically strong for good and evil  mr muller taking no count in this place of fetiches ghosts dreams and magic explains that the sense of wonderment was wakened by objects only semitangible trees which are taller than we are whose roots are beyond our reach and which have a kind of life in them  we are dealing with a quartenary it may be a tertiary troglodyte says mr muller  if a tertiary troglodyte was like a modern andaman islander a kaneka a dieyrie would he stand and meditate in awe on the fact that a tree was taller than he or had a kind of life an unknown and unknowable yet undeniable something 233b  why this is the sentiment of modern germany and perhaps of the indian sages of a cultivated period  a troglodyte would look for a possum in the tree he would tap the trunk for honey he would poke about in the bark after grubs or he would worship anything odd in the branches  is mr muller not unconsciously transporting a kind of modern malady of thought into the midst of people who wanted to find a dinner and who might worship a tree if it had a grotesque shape that for them had a magical meaning or if boilyas lived in its boughs but whose practical way of dealing with the problem of its life was to burn it round the stem chop the charred wood with stone axes and use the bark branches and leaves as they happened to come handy  mr muller has a long list of semitangible objects overwhelming and overawing like the tree  there are mountains where even a stout heart shivers before the real presence of the infinite there are rivers those instruments of so sudden a religious awakening there is earth  these supply the material for semideities  then come sky stars dawn sun and moon in these we have the germs of what hereafter we shall have to call by the name of deities  before we can transmute with mr muller these objects of a somewhat vague religious regard into a kind of gods we have to adopt noires philological theories and study the effects of auxiliary verbs on the development of personification and of religion  noires philological theories are still i presume under discussion  they are necessary however to mr mullers doctrine of the development of the vague sense of the infinite wakened by fine old trees and high mountains into devas and of devas which means shining ones into the vedic gods  our troglodyte ancestors and their sweet feeling for the spiritual aspect of landscape are thus brought into relation with the rishis of the vedas the sages and poets of a pleasing civilisation  the reverence felt for such comparatively refined or remote things as fire the sun wind thunder the dawn furnished a series of steppingstones to the vedic theology if theology it can be called  it is impossible to give each step in detail the process must be studied in mr mullers lectures  nor can we discuss the later changes of faith  as to the processes which produced the fetichistic corruption that universal and everywhere identical form of decay mr muller does not afford even a hint  he only says that when the indians found that their old gods were mere names they built out of the scattered bricks a new altar to the unknown goda statement which throws no light on the parasitical development of fetichism  but his whole theory is deficient if having called fetichism a corruption he does not show how corruption arose how it operated and how the disease attacked all religions everywhere  we have contested step by step many of mr mullers propositions  if space permitted it would be interesting to examine the actual attitude of certain contemporary savages bushmen and others towards the sun contemporary savages may be degraded they certainly are not primitive but their legends at least are the oldest things they possess  the supernatural elements in their ideas about the sun are curiously unlike those which according to mr muller entered into the development of aryan religion  the last remark which has to be made about mr mullers scheme of the development of aryan religion is that the religion as explained by him does not apparently aid the growth of society nor work with it in any way  let us look at a subbarbaric societysay that of zululand of new zealand of the iroquois league or at a savage society like that of the kanekas or of those australian tribes about whom we have very many interesting and copious accounts  if we begin with the australians we observe that society is based on certain laws of marriage enforced by capital punishment  these laws of marriage forbid the intermixing of persons belonging to the stock which worships this or that animal or plant  now this rule as already observed made the gentile system as mr morgan erroneously calls it the system which gradually reduces tribal hostility by making tribes homogeneous  the same system with the religious sanction of a kind of zoolatry is in force and has worked to the same result in africa asia america and australia while a host of minute facts make it a reasonable conclusion that it prevailed in europe  among these facts certain peculiarities of greek and roman and hindoo marriage law greek latin and english tribal names and a crowd of legends are the most prominent 236  mr max mullers doctrine of the development of indian religion while admitting the existence of snake or naga tribes takes no account of the action of this universal zoolatry on religion and society  after marriage and after tribal institutions look at rank  is it not obvious that the religious elements magic and necromancy left out of his reckoning by mr muller are most powerful in developing rank  even among those democratic paupers the fuegians the doctorwizard of each party has much influence over his companions  among those other democrats the eskimo a class of wizards called angakuts become a kind of civil magistrates because they can cause fine weather and can magically detect people who commit offences  thus the germs of rank in these cases are sown by the magic which is fetichism in action  try the zulus the heaven is the chiefs he can call up clouds and storms hence the sanction of his authority  in new zealand every rangatira has a supernatural power  if he touches an article no one else dares to appropriate it for fear of terrible supernatural consequences  a head chief is tapued an inch thick and perfectly unapproachable  magical power abides in and emanates from him  by this superstition an aristocracy is formed and property the property at least of the aristocracy is secured  among the red indians as schoolcraft says priests and jugglers are the persons that make war and have a voice in the sale of the land  mr e w robertson says much the same thing about early scotland  if odin was not a god with the gifts of a medicine man and did not owe his chiefship to his talent for dealing with magic he is greatly maligned  the irish brehons also sanctioned legal decisions by magical devices afterwards condemned by the church  among the zulus the itongo spirit dwells with the great man he who dreams is the chief of the village  the chief alone can read in the vessel of divination  the kaneka chiefs are medicinemen  here then in widely distant regions in early european american melanesian african societies we find those factors in religion which the primitive aryans are said to have dispensed with helping to construct society rank property  is it necessary to add that the ancestral spirits still rule the present from the past and demand sacrifice and speak to him who dreams who therefore is a strong force in society if not a chief  mr herbert spencer mr tylor m fustel de coulanges a dozen others have made all this matter of common notoriety  as hearne the traveller says about the copper river indians it is almost necessary that they who rule them should profess something a little supernatural to enable them to deal with the people  the few examples we have given show how widely and among what untutored races the need is felt  the rudimentary government of early peoples requires and by aid of dreams necromancy medicine ie fetiches tapu and so forth obtains a supernatural sanction  where is the supernatural sanction that consecrated the chiefs of a race which woke to the sense of the existence of infinite beings in face of trees rivers the dawn the sun and had none of the socalled late and corrupt fetichism that does such useful social work  to the student of other early societies mr mullers theory of the growth of aryan religion seems to leave society without cement and without the most necessary sanctions  one man is as good as another before a tree a river a hill  the savage organisers of other societies found out fetiches and ghosts that were respecters of persons  zoolatry is intertwisted with the earliest and most widespread law of prohibited degrees  how did the hindoos dispense with the aid of these superstitions  well they did not quite dispense with them  mr max muller remarks almost on his last page 376 that in india also    the thoughts and feelings about those whom death had separated from us for a time supplied some of the earliest and most important elements of religion  if this was the case surely the presence of those elements and their influence should have been indicated along with the remarks about the awfulness of trees and the suggestiveness of rivers  is nothing said about the spirits of the dead and their cult in the vedas much is said of course  but were it otherwise then other elements of savage religion may also have been neglected there and it will be impossible to argue that fetichism did not exist because it is not mentioned  it will also be impossible to admit that the hibbert lectures give more than a onesided account of the origin of indian religion  the perusal of mr max mullers book deeply impresses one with the necessity of studying early religions and early societies simultaneously if it be true that early indian religion lacked precisely those superstitions so childish so grotesque and yet so useful which we find at work in contemporary tribes and which we read of in history the discovery is even more remarkable and important than the author of the hibbert lectures seems to suppose  it is scarcely necessary to repeat that the negative evidence of the vedas the religious utterances of sages made in a time of what we might call heroic culture can never disprove the existence of superstitions which if current in the former experience of the race the hymnists as barth observes would intentionally ignore  our object has been to defend the primitiveness of fetichism  by this we do not mean to express any opinion as to whether fetichism in the strictest sense of the word was or was not earlier than totemism than the worship of the dead or than the involuntary sense of awe and terror with which certain vast phenomena may have affected the earliest men  we only claim for the powerful and ubiquitous practices of fetichism a place among the early elements of religion and insist that what is so universal has not yet been shown to be a corruption of something older and purer  one remark of mr max mullers fortifies these opinions  if fetichism be indeed one of the earliest factors of faith in the supernatural if it be in its rudest forms most powerful in proportion to other elements of faith among the least cultivated races and that mr muller will probably allowamong what class of cultivated peoples will it longest hold its ground  clearly among the least cultivated among the fishermen the shepherds of lonely districts the peasants of outlying landsin short among the people  neglected by sacred poets in the culminating period of purity in religion it will linger among the superstitions of the rustics  there is no real break in the continuity of peasant life the modern folklore is in many points the savage ritual  now mr muller when he was minimising the existence of fetichism in the rig veda the oldest collection of hymns admitted its existence in the atharvana p 60 241  on p 151 we read the atharvavedasanhita is a later collection containing besides a large number of rig veda verses some curious relics of popular poetry connected with charms imprecations and other superstitious usages the italics are mine and are meant to emphasise this factwhen we leave the sages the rishis and look at what is popular look at what that class believed which of savage practice has everywhere retained so much we are at once among the charms and the fetiches  this is precisely what one would have expected  if the history of religion and of mythology is to be unravelled we must examine what the unprogressive classes in europe have in common with australians and bushmen and andaman islanders  it is the function of the people to retain in folklore these elements of religion which it is the high duty of the sage and the poet to purify away in the fire of refining thought  it is for this very reason that ritual has though mr max muller curiously says that it seems not to possess an immense scientific interest  ritual holds on with the tenacity of superstition to all that has ever been practised  yet when mr muller wants to know about origins about actual ancient practice he deliberately turns to that great collection of ancient poetry the rig veda which has no special reference to sacrificial acts not to the brahmanas which are full of ritual  to sum up briefly1 mr mullers arguments against the evidence for and the primitiveness of fetichism seem to demonstrate the opposite of that which he intends them to prove  2 his own evidence for primitive practice is chosen from the documents of a cultivated society  3 his theory deprives that society of the very influences which have elsewhere helped the tribe the family rank and priesthoods to grow up and to form the backbone of social existence     the early history of the family   what are the original forms of the human family  did man begin by being monogamous or polygamous but in either case the master of his own home and the assured central point of his family relations  or were the unions of the sexes originally shifting and precarious so that the wisest child was not expected to know his own father and family ties were reckoned through the mother alone  again setting aside the question of what was primitive and original did the needs and barbarous habits of early men lead to a scarcity of women and hence to polyandry that is the marriage of one woman to several men with the consequent uncertainty about male parentage  once more admitting that these loose and strange relations of the sexes do prevail or have prevailed among savages is there any reason to suppose that the stronger races the aryan and semitic stocks ever passed through this stage of savage customs  these are the main questions debated between what we may call the historical and the anthropological students of ancient customs  when sir henry maine observed in 1861 that it was difficult to say what society of men had not been originally based on the patriarchal family he went of course outside the domain of history  what occurred in the very origin of human society is a question perhaps quite inscrutable  certainly history cannot furnish the answer  here the anthropologist and physiologist come in with their methods and even those we think can throw but an uncertain light on the very origin of institutions and on strictly primitive man  for the purposes of this discussion we shall here restate the chief points at issue between the adherents of sir henry maine and of mr mlennan between historical and anthropological inquirers  1  did man originally live in the patriarchal family or did he live in more or less modified promiscuity with uncertainty of bloodties and especially of male parentage  2  did circumstances and customs at some time compel or induce man whatever his original condition to resort to practices which made paternity uncertain and so caused kinship to be reckoned through women  3  granting that some races have been thus reduced to matriarchal forms of the familythat is to forms in which the woman is the permanent recognised centreis there any reason to suppose that the stronger peoples like the aryans and the semites ever passed through a stage of culture in which female not male kinship was chiefly recognised probably as a result of polyandry of many husbands to one wife  on this third question it will be necessary to produce much evidence of very different sorts evidence which at best can perhaps only warrant an inference or presumption in favour of one or the other opinion  for the moment the impartial examination of testimony is more important and practicable than the establishment of any theory  1  did man originally live in the patriarchal family the male being master of his female mate or mates and of his children  on this first point sir henry maine in his new volume 247a may be said to come as near proving his case as the nature and matter of the question will permit  bachofen mlennan and morgan all started from a hypothetical state of more or less modified sexual promiscuity  bachofens evidence which may be referred to later was based on a great mass of legends myths and travellers tales chiefly about early aryan practices  he discovered hetarismus as he called it or promiscuity among lydians etruscans persians thracians cyrenian nomads egyptians scythians troglodytes nasamones and so forth  mr mlennans view is perhaps less absolutely stated than sir henry maine supposes  mlennan says 247b that there has been a stage in the development of the human races when there was no such appropriation of women to particular men when in short marriage as it exists among civilised nations was not practised  marriage in this sense was yet undreamt of  mr mlennan adds pp 130 131 as among other gregarious animals the unions of the sexes were probably in the earliest times loose transitory and in some degree promiscuous  sir henry maine opposes to mr mlennans theory the statement of mr darwin from all we know of the passions of all male quadrupeds promiscuous intercourse in a state of nature is highly improbable 248 on this first question let us grant to sir henry maine to mr darwin and to common sense that if the very earliest men were extremely animal in character their unions while they lasted were probably monogamous or polygamous  the sexual jealousy of the male would secure that result as it does among many other animals  let the first point then be scored to sir henry maine let it be granted that if man was created perfect he lived in the monogamous family before the fall and that if he was evolved as an animal the unchecked animal instincts would make for monogamy or patriarchal polygamy in the strictly primitive family  2  did circumstances and customs ever or anywhere compel or induce man whatever his original condition to resort to practices which made paternity uncertain and so caused the absence of the patriarchal family kinship being reckoned through women  if this question be answered in the affirmative and if the sphere of action of the various causes be made wide enough it will not matter much to mr mlennans theory whether the strictly primitive family was patriarchal or not  if there occurred a fall from the primitive family and if that fall was extremely general affecting even the aryan race mr mlennans adherents will be amply satisfied  their object is to show that the family even in the aryan race was developed through a stage of loose savage connections  if that can be shown they do not care much about primitive man properly so called  sir henry maine admits as a matter of fact that among certain races in certain districts circumstances have overridden the sexual jealousy which secures the recognition of male parentage  where women have been few and where poverty has been great jealousy has been suppressed even in the venice of the eighteenth century  sir h maine says the usage that of polyandrymany husbands to a single wife seems to me one which circumstances overpowering morality and decency might at any time call into existence  it is known to have arisen in the native indian army  the question now is what are the circumstances that overpower morality and decency and so produce polyandry with its necessary consequences when it is a recognised institutionthe absence of the patriarchal family and the recognition of kinship through women any circumstances which cause great scarcity of women will conduce to those results  mr mlennans opinion was that the chief cause of scarcity of women has been the custom of female infanticideof killing little girls as bouches inutiles  sir henry maine admits that the cause assigned by mlennan is a vera causait is capable of producing the effects 249  mr mlennan collected a very large mass of testimony to prove the wide existence of this cause of paucity of women  till that evidence is published i can only say that it was sufficient in mr mlennans opinion to demonstrate the wide prevalence of the factor which is the mainspring of his whole system 250a  how frightfully female infanticide has prevailed in india everyone may read in the official reports of col mpherson and other english authorities  mr fisons kamilaroi and kurnai contains some notable though not to my mind convincing arguments on the other side  sir henry maine adduces another cause of paucity of women the wanderings of our race and expeditions across sea 250b  this cause would not however be important enough to alter forms of kinship where the invaders like the early english in britain found a population which they could conquer and whose women they could appropriate  apart from any probable inferences that may be drawn from the presumed practice of female infanticide actual ascertained facts prove that many races do not now live or that recently they did not live in the patriarchal or modern family  they live or did live in polyandrous associations  the thibetans the nairs the early inhabitants of britain according to caesar and many other races 251 as well as the inhabitants of the marquesas islands and the iroquois according to lafitau practise or have practised polyandry  we now approach the third and really important problem3  is there any reason to suppose that the stronger peoples like the aryans and the semites ever passed through a stage of culture in which female not male kinship was chiefly recognised probably as a result of polyandry  now the nature of the evidence which affords a presumption that aryans have all passed through australian institutions such as polyandry is of extremely varied character  much of it may undoubtedly be explained away  but such strength as the evidence has which we do not wish to exaggerate is derived from its convergence to one pointnamely the anterior existence of polyandry and the matriarchal family among aryans before and after the dawn of real history  for the sake of distinctness we may here number the heads of the evidence bearing on this question  we have  1  the evidence of inference from the form of capture in bridal ceremonies  2  the evidence from exogamy the law which forbids marriage between persons of the same family name  3  the evidence from totemismthat is the derivation of the family name and crest or badge from some natural object plant or animal 252 persons bearing the name may not intermarry nor as a rule may they eat the object from which they derive their family name and from which they claim to be descended  4  the evidence from the gens of rome or greek of ancient greece in connection with totemism  5  the evidence from myth and legend  6  the evidence from direct historical statements as to the prevalence of the matriarchal family and inheritance through the maternal line  to take these various testimonies in their order let us begin with  1  the form of capture in bridal ceremonies  that this form survived in sparta crete in hindoo law in the traditions of ireland in the popular rustic customs of wales is not denied  if we hold with mr mlennan that scarcity of women produced by female infanticide or otherwise is the cause of the habit of capturing wives we may see in survivals of this ceremony of capture among aryans a proof of early scarcity of women and of probable polyandry  but an opponent may argue like mr j a farrer in primitive manners that the ceremony of capture is mainly a concession to maiden modesty among early races  here one may observe that the girls of savage tribes are notoriously profligate and immodest about illicit connections  only honourable marriage brings a blush to the cheek of these young persons this is odd but in the present state of the question we cannot lean on the evidence of the ceremony of capture  we cannot demonstrate that it is derived from a time when paucity of women made capture of brides necessary  thus honours are easy in this first deal  2  the next indication is very curious and requires much more prolonged discussion  the custom of exogamy was first noted and named by mr mlennan  exogamy is the prohibition of marriage within the supposed bloodkinship as denoted by the family name  such marriage among many backward races is reckoned incestuous and is punishable by death certain peculiarities in connection with the family name have to be noted later  now sir henry maine admits that exogamy as thus defined exists among the hindoos  a hindoo may not marry a woman belonging to the same gotra all members of the gotra being theoretically supposed to have descended from the same ancestor  the same rule prevails in china there are in china large bodies of related clansmen each generally bearing the same clanname  they are exogamous no man will marry a woman having the same clanname with himself  it is admitted by sir henry maine that this wide prohibition of marriage was the early aryan rule while advancing civilisation has gradually permitted marriage within limits once forbidden  the greek church now according to mr mlennan and the catholic church in the past forbade intermarriages as far as relationship could be known  the hindoo rule appears to go still farther and to prohibit marriage as far as the common gotra name seems merely to indicate relationship  as to the ancient romans plutarch says formerly they did not marry women connected with them by blood any more than they now marry aunts or sisters  it was long before they would even intermarry with cousins plutarch also remarks that in times past romans did not marry greek and if we may render this women of the same gens the exogamous prohibition in rome was as complete as among the hindoos  i do not quite gather from sir henry maines account of the slavonic house communities pp 254 255 whether they dislike all kindred marriages or only marriage within the greater bloodthat is within the kinship on the male side  he says the south slavonians bring their wives into the group in which they are socially organised from a considerable distance outside     every marriage which requires an ecclesiastical dispensation is regarded as disreputable  on the whole wide prohibitions of marriage are archaic the widest are savage the narrowest are modern and civilised  thus the hindoo prohibition is old barbarous and wide  the barbarous aryan says sir henry maine is generally exogamous  he has a most extensive table of prohibited degrees  thus exogamy seems to be a survival of barbarism the question for us is can we call exogamy a survival from a period when owing to scarcity of women and polyandry clear ideas of kinship were impossible  if this can be proved exogamous aryans either passed through polyandrous institutions or borrowed a savage custom derived from a period when ideas of kinship were obscure  if we only knew the origin of the prohibition to marry within the family name all would be plain sailing  at present several theories of the origin of exogamy are before the world  mr morgan the author of ancient society inclines to trace the prohibition to a great early physiological discovery acted on by primitive men by virtue of a contrat social  early man discovered that children of unsound constitutions were born of nearly related parents  mr morgan says primitive men very early discovered the evils of close interbreeding  elsewhere mr morgan writes intermarriage in the gens was prohibited to secure the benefits of marrying out with unrelated persons  this arrangement was a product of high intelligence and mr morgan calls it a reform  let us examine this very curious theory  first mr morgan supposes early man to have made a discovery the evils of the marriage of near kin which evades modern physiological science  modern science has not determined that the marriages of kinsfolk are pernicious  is it credible that savages should discover a fact which puzzles science  it may be replied that modern care nursing and medical art save children of near marriages from results which were pernicious to the children of early man  secondly mr morgan supposes that barbarous man so notoriously reckless of the morrow as he is not only made the discovery of the evils of interbreeding but acted on it with promptitude and selfdenial thirdly mr morgan seems to require for the enforcement of the exogamous law a contrat social  the larger communities meet and divide themselves into smaller groups within which wedlock is forbidden  this social pact is like a return to the ideas of rousseau  fourthly the hypothesis credits early men with knowledge and discrimination of near degrees of kin which they might well possess if they lived in patriarchal families  but it represents that they did not act on their knowledge  instead of prohibiting marriage between parents and children cousins nephews and aunts uncles and nieces they prohibited marriage within the limit of the name of the kin  this is still the hindoo rule and if the romans really might not at one time marry within the gens it was the roman rule  now observe this rule fails to effect the very purpose for which ex hypothesi it was instituted  where the family name goes by the male side marriages between cousins are permitted as in india and china  these are the very marriages which some theorists now denounce as pernicious  but if the family name goes by the female side marriages between halfbrothers and halfsisters are permitted as in ancient athens and among the hebrews of abrahams time  once more the exogamous prohibition excludes in china america africa australia persons who are in no way akin according to our ideas from intermarriage  thus mr doolittle writes 256 males and females of the same surname will never intermarry in china  cousins who have not the same ancestral surname may intermarry  though the ancestors of persons of the same surname have not known each other for thousands of years they may not intermarry  the hindoo gotra rule produces the same effects  for all these reasons and because of the improbability of the physiological discovery and of the moral reform which enforced it and again because the law is not of the sort which people acquainted with near degrees of kinship would make and once more because the law fails to effect its presumed purpose while it does attain ends at which it does not aimwe cannot accept mr morgans suggestion as to the origin of exogamy  mr mlennan did not live to publish a subtle theory of the origin of exogamy which he had elaborated  in studies in ancient history he hazarded a conjecture based on female infanticide     we believe the restrictions on marriage to be connected with the    practice in early times of female infanticide which rendering women    scarce led at once to polyandry within the tribe and the capturing    of women from without     hence the cruel custom which leaving    the primitive human hordes with very few young women of their own    occasionally with none and in any case seriously disturbing the    balance of the sexes within the hordes forces them to prey upon one    another for wives  usage induced by necessity would in time    establish a prejudice among the tribes observing it a prejudice    strong as a principle of religionas every prejudice relating to    marriage is apt to beagainst marrying women of their own stock  mr mlennan describes his own hypothesis as a suggestion thrown out at what it was worth 258  in his later years as we have said he developed a very subtle and ingenious theory of the origin of exogamy still connecting it with scarcity of women but making use of various supposed stages and processes in the development of the law  that speculation remains unpublished  to myself the suggestion given in studies in ancient history seems inadequate  i find it difficult to conceive that the frequent habit of stealing women should indispose men to marry the native women they had at hand  that this indisposition should grow into a positive law and the infringement of the law be regarded as a capital offence seems still more inconceivable  my own impression is that exogamy may be connected with some early superstition or idea of which we have lost the touch and which we can no longer explain  thus far the consideration of exogamy has thrown no clear light on the main questionthe question whether the customs of civilised races contain relics of female kinship  on sir henry maines theory of exogamy that aryan custom is unconnected with female kinship polyandry and scarcity of women  on mr mlennans theory exogamy is the result of scarcity of women and implies polyandry and female kinship  but neither theory has seemed satisfactory  yet we need not despair of extracting some evidence from exogamy and that evidence on the whole is in favour of mr mlennans general hypothesis  1 the exogamous prohibition must have first come into force when kinship was only reckoned on one side of the family  this is obvious whether we suppose it to have arisen in a society which reckoned by male or by female kinship  in the former case the law only prohibits marriage with persons of the fathers in the second case with persons of the mothers family name and these only it recognises as kindred  2 our second point is much more important  the exogamous prohibition must first have come into force when kinship was so little understood that it could best be denoted by the family name  this would be selfevident if we could suppose the prohibition to be intended to prevent marriages of relations had the authors of the prohibition been acquainted with the nature of near kinships they would simply as we do have forbidden marriage between persons in those degrees  the very nature of the prohibition on the other hand shows that kinship was understood in a manner all unlike our modern system  the limit of kindred was everywhere the family name a limit which excludes many real kinsfolk and includes many who are not kinsfolk at all  in australia especially and in america india and africa to a slighter extent that definition of kindred by the family name actually includes alligators smoke paddy melons rain crayfish sardines and what you please 259  will anyone assert then that people among whom the exogamous prohibition arose were organised on the system of the patriarchal family which permits the nature of kinship to be readily understood at a glance  is it not plain that the exogamous prohibition confessedly aryan must have arisen in a stage of culture when ideas of kindred were confused included kinship with animals and plants and were to us almost if not quite unintelligible  it is even possible as mr mlennan says 260 that the prejudice against marrying women of the same group may have been established before the facts of blood relationship had made any deep impression on the human mind  how the exogamous prohibition tends to confirm this view will next be set forth in our consideration of totemism  the evidence from totemismtotemism is the name for the custom by which a stock scattered through many local tribes claims descent from and kindred with some plant animal or other natural object  this object of which the effigy is sometimes worn as a badge or crest members of the stock refuse to eat  as a general rule marriage is prohibited between members of the stockbetween all that is who claim descent from the same object and wear the same badge  the exogamous limit therefore is denoted by the stockname and crest and kinship is kinship in the wolf bear potato or whatever other object is recognised as the original ancestor  finally as a general rule the stockname is derived through the mother and where it is derived through the father there are proofs that the custom is comparatively modern  it will be acknowledged that this sort of kindred which is traced to a beast bird or tree which is recognised in every person bearing the same stockname which is counted through females and which governs marriage customs is not the sort of kindred which would naturally arise among people regulated on the patriarchal or monandrous family system  totemism however is a widespread institution prevailing all over the north of the american continent also in peru according to garcilasso de la vega in guiana the negroes have brought it from the african gold coast where it is in full force as it also is among the bechuanas in india among hos garos kassos and oraons in the south sea islands where it has left strong traces in mangaia in siberia and especially in the great island continent of australia  the semitic evidences for totemism animalworship exogamy descent claimed through females are given by professor robertson smith in the journal of philology ix 17 animal worship and animal tribes among the arabs and in the old testament many other examples of totemism might be adduced especially from egypt but we must restrict ourselves to the following questions  1  what light is thrown on the original form of the family by totemism  2 where we find survivals of totemism among civilised races may we conclude that these races through scarcity of women had once been organised on other than the patriarchal model  as to the first question we must remember that the origin and determining causes of totemism are still unknown  mr mlennans theory of the origin of totemism has never been published  it may be said without indiscretion that mr mlennan thought totemism arose at a period when ideas of kinship scarcely existed at all  men only thought of marking one off from another as garcilasso de la vega says the totem was but a badge worn by all the persons who found themselves existing in close relations perhaps in the same cave or set of caves  people united by contiguity and by the blind sentiment of kinship not yet brought into explicit consciousness might mark themselves by a badge and might thence derive a name and later might invent a myth of their descent from the object which the badge represented  i do not know whether it has been observed that the totems are as a rule objects which may be easily drawn or tattooed and still more easily indicated in gesturelanguage  some interesting facts will be found in the first annual report of the bureau of ethnology p 458 washington 1881 here we read how the crow tribe is indicated in signlanguage by the hands held out on each side striking the air in the manner of flying the bunaks another bird tribe are indicated by an imitation of the cry of the bird  in mentioning the snakes the hand imitates the crawling motion of the serpent and the fingers pointed up behind the ear denote the wolves  plainly names of the totem sort are well suited to the convenience of savages who converse much in gesturelanguage  above all the very nature of totemism shows that it took its present shape at a time when men animals and plants were conceived of as physically akin when names were handed on through the female line when exogamy was the rule of marriage and when the family theoretically included all persons bearing the same family name that is all who claimed kindred with the same plant animal or object whether the persons are really akin or not  these ideas and customs are not the ideas natural to men organised in the patriarchal family  the second question now arises can we infer from survivals of totemism among aryans that these aryans had once been organised on the full totemistic principle probably with polyandry and certainly with female descent  where totemism now exists in full force there we find exogamy and derivation of the family name through women the latter custom indicating uncertainty of male parentage in the past  are we to believe that the same institutions have existed wherever we find survivals of totemism  if this be granted and if the supposed survivals of totemism among aryans be accepted as genuine then the aryans have distinctly come through a period of kinship reckoned through women with all that such an institution implies  for indications that the aryans of greece and india have passed through the stage of totemism the reader may be referred to mr mlennans worship of plants and animals fortnightly review 1869 1870  the evidence there adduced is not all of the same value and the papers are only a hasty rough sketch based on the first testimonies that came to hand  probably the most important survival of totemism in greek legend is the body of stories about the amours of zeus in animal form  various noble houses traced their origin to zeus or apollo who as a bull tortoise serpent swan or ant had seduced the mother of the race  the mother of the arcadians became a shebear like the mother of the bear stock of the iroquois  as we know plenty of races all over the world who trace their descent from serpents tortoises swans and so forth it is a fair hypothesis that the ancestors of the greeks once believed in the same fables  in later times the swan serpent ant or tortoise was explained as an avatar of zeus  the process by which an anthropomorphic god or hero succeeds to the exploits of animals of theriomorphic gods and heroes is the most common in mythology and is illustrated by actual practice in modern india  when the brahmins convert a pigworshipping tribe of aboriginals they tell their proselytes that the pig was an avatar of vishnu  the same process is found active where the japanese have influenced the savage ainos and persuaded them that their bear or dogfather was a manifestation of a deity  we know from plutarch theseus that in addition to families claiming descent from divine animals one athenian greek the ioxidae revered an ancestral plant the asparagus  a vaguer indication of totemism may perhaps be detected in the ancient theriomorphic statues of greek gods as the ramzeus and the horseheaded demeter and in the various animals and plants which were sacred to each god and represented as his companions  the hints of totemism among the ancient irish are interesting  one hero conaire was the son of a bird and before his birth his father the bird told the woman his mother that the child must never eat the flesh of fowls  thy son shall be named conaire and that son shall not kill birds 265a  the hero cuchullain being named after the dog might not eat the flesh of the dog and came by his ruin after transgressing this totemistic taboo  races named after animals were common in ancient ireland  the reddeer and the wolves were tribes dwelling near ossory and professor rhys from the frequency of dog names inclines to believe in a dog totem in erin  according to the ancient irish wonders of eri in the book of glendaloch the descendants of the wolf are in ossory and they could still transform themselves into wolves 265b  as to our anglosaxon ancestors there is little evidence beyond the fact that the patronymic names of many of the early settlements of billings arlings and the rest are undeniably derived from animals and plants  the manner in which those names are scattered locally is precisely like what results in america africa and australia from the totemistic organisation 265c  in italy the ancient custom by which animals were the leaders of the ver sacrum or armed migration is well known  the piceni had for their familiar animal or totem if we may call it so a woodpecker the hirpini were like the descendants of the wolf in ossory and practised a wolfdance in which they imitated the actions of the animal  such is a summary of the evidence which shows that aryans had once been totemists therefore savages and therefore again had probably been in a stage when women were scarce and each woman had many husbands  evidence from the gens or greekthere is no more puzzling topic in the history of the ancient world than the origin and nature of the community called by the romans the gens and by the greeks the greek to the present writer it seems that no existing community of men neither totem kin nor clan nor house community nor gotra precisely answers to the gens or the greek  our information about these forms of society is slight and confused  the most essential thing to notice for the moment is the fact that both in greece and rome the greek and gens were extremely ancient so ancient that the greek was decaying in greece when history begins while in rome we can distinctly see the rapid decadence and dissolution of the gens  in the laws of the twelve tables the gens is a powerful and respected corporation  in the time of cicero the nature of the gens is a matter but dimly understood  tacitus begins to be confused about the gentile nomenclature  in the empire gentile law fades away  in greece especially at athens the early political reforms transferred power from the greek to a purely local organisation the deme  the greek of historical times did not announce his greek in his name as the romans always did but gave his own name that of his father and that of his deme  thus we may infer that in greek and roman society the greek and gens were dying not growing organisations  in very early times it is probable that foreign gentes were adopted en bloc into the roman commonwealth  very probably too a great family on entering the roman bond may have assumed by a fiction the character and name of a gens  but that roman society in historical times or that greek society could evolve a new gens or greek in a normal natural way seems excessively improbable  keeping in mind the antique and obsolescent character of the gens and greek let us examine the theories of the origin of these associations the romans themselves knew very little about the matter  cicero quotes the dictum of scaevola the pontifex according to which the gens consisted of all persons of the same gentile name who were not in any way disqualified 267  thus in america or australia or africa all persons bearing the same totem name belong to that totem kin  festus defines members of a gens as persons of the same stock and same family name  varro says in illustration of the relationships of words and cases ab aemilio homines orti aemilii sunt gentiles  the two former definitions answer to the conception of a totem kin which is united by its family name and belief in identity of origin  varro adds the element in the roman gens of common descent from one male ancestor such was the conception of the gens in historical times  it was in its way an association of kinsfolk real or supposed  according to the laws of the twelve tables the gentiles inherited the property of an intestate man without agnates and had the custody of lunatics in the same circumstances  the gens had its own sacellum or chapel and its own sacra or religious rites  the whole gens occasionally went into mourning when one of its members was unfortunate  it would be interesting if it could be shown that the sacra were usually examples of ancestorworship but the faint indications on the subject scarcely permit us to assert this  on the whole sir henry maine strongly clings to the belief that the gens commonly had a real core of agnatic consanguinity from the very first but he justly recognises the principle of imitation which induces men to copy any fashionable institution  whatever the real origin of the gens many gentes were probably copies based on the fiction of common ancestry  on sir henry maines system then the gens rather proves the constant existence of recognised male descents among the peoples where it exists  the opposite theory of the gens is that to which mr mlennan inclined the composition and organisation of greek and roman tribes and commonwealths cannot well be explained except on the hypothesis that they resulted from the joint operation in early times of exogamy and the system of kinship through females only 268  the gens he adds was composed of all the persons in the tribe bearing the same name and accounted of the same stock  were the gentes really of different stocks as their names would imply and as the people believed  if so how came clans of different stocks to be united in the same tribe     how came a variety of such groups of different stocks to coalesce in a local tribe  these questions mr mlennan thought could not be answered on the patriarchal hypothesis  his own theory or rather his theory as understood by the present writer may be stated thus  in the earliest times there were homogeneous groups which became totem kin  let us say that in a certain district there were groups called woodpeckers wolves bears suns swine each with its own little territory  these groups were exogamous and derived the name through the mother  thus in course of time when sun men married a wolf girl and her children were wolves there would be wolves in the territory of the suns and thus each stock would be scattered through all the localities just as we see in australia and america  let us suppose that as certainly is occurring in australia and america paternal descent comes to be recognised in custom this change will not surprise sir henry maine who admits that a system of male may alter under stress of circumstances to a system of female descents  in course of time and as knowledge and common sense advance the old superstition of descent from a woodpecker a bear a wolf the sun or what not becomes untenable  a human name is assumed by the group which had called itself the woodpeckers or the wolves or perhaps by a local tribe in which several of these stocks are included  then a fictitious human ancestor is adopted and perhaps even adored  thus the wolves might call themselves claudii from their chiefs name and giving up belief in descent from a wolf might look back to a fancied ancestor named claudius  the result of these changes will be that an exogamous totem kin with female descent has become a gens with male kinship and only the faintest trace of exogamy  an example of somewhat similar processes must have occurred in the highland clans after the introduction of christianity when the chiefs christian name became the patronymic of the people who claimed kinship with him and owned his sway  are there any traces at all of totemism in what we know of the roman gentes  certainly the traces are very slight perhaps they are only visible to the eye of the intrepid anthropologist  i give them for what they are worth merely observing that they do tally as far as they go with the totemistic theory  the reader interested in the subject may consult the learned streinniuss de gentibus romanis p 104 aldus venice 1591  among wellknown savage totems none is more familiar than the sun  men claim descent from the sun call themselves by his name and wear his effigy as a badge 270  were there suns in rome  the aurelian gens is thus described on the authority of festus pompeiusthe aurelii were of sabine descent  the aurelii were so named from the sun aurum urere the burning thing because a place was set apart for them in which to pay adoration to the sun  here at least is an odd coincidence  among other gentile names the fabii cornelii papirii pinarii cassii are possibly connected with plants while wild etymology may associate porcii aquilii and valerii with swine and eagles  pliny h n xviii 3 gives a fantastic explanation of the vegetable names of roman gentes  we must remember that vegetable names are very common in american indian african and australian totem kin  of sun names the natchez and the incas of peru are familiar examples  turning from rome to greece we find the greek less regarded and more decadent than the gens  yet according to grote iii 54 the greek hadl sacra in honour of the same god supposed to be the primitive ancestor  2 a common burialplace  3 certain rights of succession to property  4 obligations of mutual help and defence  5 mutual rights and obligations to intermarry in certain cases  6 occasionally possession of common property  traces of the totem among the greek greek are naturally few  almost all the known greek bore patronymics derived from personal names  but it is not without significance that the attic demes often adopted the names of obsolescent greek and that those names were as mr grote says often derived from the plants and shrubs which grew in their neighbourhood  we have already seen that at least one attic greek the ioxidae revered the plant from which they derived their lineage  one thing is certain the totem names and a common explanation of the totem names in australia correspond with the names and mr grotes explanation of the names of the attic demes  one origin of family names says sir george grey ii 228 frequently ascribed by the natives is that they were derived from some vegetable or animal being common in the district which the family inhabited  some writers attempt to show that the attic greek was once exogamous and counted kin on the mothers side by quoting the custom which permitted a man to marry his halfsister the child of his father but not of his mother  they infer that this permission is a survival from the time when a mans fathers children were not reckoned as his kindred and when kinship was counted through mothers  sir henry maine p 105 prefers m fustel de coulanges theory that the marriage of halfbrothers and sisters on the fathers side was intended to save the portion of the girl to the family estate proof of this may be adduced from examination of all the recorded cases of such marriages in athens  but the reason thus suggested would have equally justified marriage between brothers and sisters on both sides and this was reckoned incest  a wellknown line in aristophanes shows how intense was athenian feeling about the impiety of relations with a sister uterine  on the whole the evidence which we have adduced tends to establish some links between the ancient greek and gens and the totem kindreds of savages  the indications are not strong but they all point in one direction  considering the high civilisation of rome and greece at the very dawn of historyconsidering the strong natural bent of these peoples toward refinementit is almost remarkable that even the slight testimonies we have been considering should have survived  5  on the evidence from myth and legend we propose to lay little stress  but as legends were not invented by anthropologists to prove a point it is odd that the traditions of athens as preserved by varro speak of a time when names were derived from the mother and when promiscuity prevailed  marriage itself was instituted by cecrops the serpent just as the lizard in australia is credited with this useful invention 273a  similar legends among nonaryan races chinese and egyptian are very common  6  there remains the evidence of actual fact and custom among aryan peoples  the lycians according to herodotus have this peculiar custom wherein they resemble no other men they derive their names from their mothers and not from their fathers and through mothers reckon their kin  status also was derived through the mothers 273b the old writers opinion that the custom so common in australia america and africa was unique is itself a proof of his good faith bachofen p 390 remarks that several lycian inscriptions give the names of mothers only  polybius attributes assigning a fantastic reason the same custom of counting kin through mothers to the locrians 273c  the british and irish custom of deriving descents through women is well known 273d and a story is told to account for the practice  the pedigrees of the british kings show that most did not succeed to their fathers and the various records of early celtic morals go to prove that no other system of kinship than the maternal would have possessed any value so uncertain was fatherhood  these are but hints of the prevalence of institutions which survived among teutonic races in the importance attached to the relationship of a mans sisters son  though no longer his legal heir the sisters son was almost closer than any other kinsman  we have now summarised and indicated the nature of the evidence which on the whole inclines us to the belief of mr mlennan rather than of sir henry maine  the point to which all the testimony adduced converges the explanation which most readily solves all the difficulties is the explanation of mr mlennan  the aryan races have very generally passed through the stage of scarcity of women polyandry absence of recognised male kinship and recognition of kinship through women  what sir henry maine admits as the exception we are inclined to regard as having in a very remote past been the rule  no one kind of evidenceneither traces of marriage by capture of exogamy of totemism of tradition of noted fact among lycians and picts and irishwould alone suffice to guide our opinion in this direction  but the cumulative force of the testimony strikes us as not inconsiderable and it must be remembered that the testimony has not yet been assiduously collected  let us end by showing how this discussion illustrates the method of folklore  we have found anomalies among aryans  we have seen the gens an odd decaying institution  we have seen greek families claim descent from various animals said to be zeus in disguise  we have found them tracing kinship and deriving names from the mother  we have found stocks with animal and vegetable names  we have found halfbrothers and sisters marrying  we have noted prohibition to marry anyone of the same family name  all these institutions are odd anomalous decaying things among aryans and the more civilised the aryans the more they decay  all of them are living active things among savages and far from being anomalous are in precise harmony with savage notions of the world surely then where they seem decaying and anomalous as among aryans these customs and laws are mouldering relics of ideas and practices natural and inevitable among savages     the art of savages 276   avoid coleridge he is useless says mr ruskin  why should the poetry of coleridge be useful  the question may interest the critic but we are only concerned with mr ruskin here for one reason  his disparagement of coleridge as useless is a survival of the belief that art should be useful  this is the savages view of art  he imitates nature in dance song or in plastic art for a definite practical purpose  his dances are magical dances his images are made for a magical purpose his songs are incantations  thus the theory that art is a disinterested expression of the imitative faculty is scarcely warranted by the little we know of arts beginnings  we shall adopt provisionally the hypothesis that the earliest art with which we are acquainted is that of savages contemporary or extinct  some philosophers may tell us that all known savages are only degraded descendants of early civilised men who have unluckily and inexplicably left no relics of their civilisation  but we shall argue on the opposite theory that the art of australians for example is really earlier in kind more backward nearer the rude beginnings of things than the art of people who have attained to some skill in pottery like the new caledonians these again are much more backward in a state really much earlier than the old races of mexico and peru while they in turn show but a few traces of advance towards the art of egypt and the art of egypt at least after the times of the ancient empire is scarcely advancing in the direction of the flawless art of greece  we shall be able to show how savage art as of the australians develops into barbarous art as of the new zealanders while the arts of strange civilisations like those of peru and mexico advance one step further and how again in the early art of greece in the greek art of ages prior to pericles there are remains of barbaric forms which are gradually softened into beauty  but there are necessarily breaks and solutions of continuity in the path of progress  one of the oldest problems has already risen before us in connection with the question statedis art the gratification of the imitative faculty now among the lowest the most untutored the worst equipped savages of contemporary races art is rather decorative on the whole than imitative the patterns on australian shields and clubs the scars which they raise on their own flesh by way of tattooing are very rarely imitations of any objects in nature  the australians like the red indians like many african and some aboriginal indian races peruvians and others distinguish their families by the names of various plants and animals from which each family boasts its descent  thus you have a family called kangaroos descended as they fancy from the kangaroo another from the cockatoo another from the black snake and so forth  now in many quarters of the globe this custom and this superstition combined with the imitative faculty in man has produced a form of art representing the objects from which the families claim descent  this art is a sort of rude heraldryprobably the origin of heraldry  thus if a red indian say a delaware is of the family of the turtle he blazons a turtle on his shield or coat probably tattoos or paints his breast with a figure of a turtle and always has a turtle reversed designed on the pillar above his grave when he dies just as in our mediaeval chronicles the leopards of an english king are reversed on his scutcheon opposite the record of his death  but the australians to the best of my knowledge though they are much governed by belief in descent from animals do not usually blazon their crest on their flesh nor on the trees near the place where the dead are buried  they have not arrived at this pitch of imitative art though they have invented or inherited a kind of runes which they notch on sticks and in which they convey to each other secret messages  the natives of the upper darling however do carve their family crests on their shields  in place of using imitative art the murri are said i am not quite sure with what truth to indicate the distinction of families by arrangements of patterns lines and dots tattooed on the breast and arms and carved on the bark of trees near places of burial  in any case the absence of the rude imitative art of heraldry among a race which possesses all the social conditions that produce this art is a fact worth noticing and itself proves that the native art of one of the most backward races we know is not essentially imitative  fig 1  an australian shield 278jpg  anyone who will look through a collection of australian weapons and utensils will be brought to this conclusion  the shields and the clubs are elaborately worked but almost always without any representation of plants animals or the human figure  as a rule the decorations take the simple shape of the herringbone pattern or such other patterns as can be produced without the aid of spirals or curves or circles  there is a natural and necessary cause of this choice of decoration  the australians working on hard wood with tools made of flint or broken glass or sharp shell cannot easily produce any curved lines  everyone who when a boy carved his name on the bark of a tree remembers the difficulty he had with s and g while he got on easily with letters like m and a which consist of straight or inclined lines  the savage artist has the same difficulty with his rude tools in producing anything like satisfactory curves or spirals  we engrave above fig 1 a shield on which an australian has succeeded with obvious difficulty in producing concentric ovals of irregular shape  it may be that the artist would have produced perfect circles if he could  his failure is exactly like that of a youthful carver of inscriptions coming to grief over his gs and ss  here however fig 2 we have three shields which like the ancient celtic pipkin the tallest of the three figures in fig 3 show the earliest known form of savage decorative artthe forms which survive under the names of chevron and herringbone  these can be scratched on clay with the nails or a sharp stick and this primeval way of decorating pottery made without the wheel survives with other relics of savage art in the western isles of scotland  the australian had not even learned to make rude clay pipkins but he decorated his shields as the old celts and modern old scotch women decorated their clay pots with the herringbone arrangement of incised lines  in the matter of colour the australians prefer white clay and red ochre which they rub into the chinks in the woodwork of their shields  when they are determined on an ambush they paint themselves all over with white justly conceiving that their sudden apparition in this guise will strike terror into the boldest hearts  but arrangements in black and white of this sort scarcely deserve the name of even rudimentary art  fig 2  shields 280jpg  fig 3  savage ornamentation 282jpg  the australians sometimes introduce crude decorative attempts at designing the human figure as in the pointed shield opposite fig 2 a which with the other australian designs are from mr brough smyths aborigines of victoria  but these ambitious efforts usually end in failure  though the australians chiefly confine themselves to decorative art there are numbers of wallpaintings so to speak in the caves of the country which prove that they like the bushmen could design the human figure in action when they pleased  their usual preference for the employment of patterns appears to me to be the result of the nature of their materials  in modern art our mechanical advantages and facilities are so great that we are always carrying the method and manner of one art over the frontier of another  our poetry aims at producing the effects of music our prose at producing the effects of poetry  our sculpture tries to vie with painting in the representation of action or with lace making in the production of reticulated surfaces and so forth  but the savage in his art has sense enough to confine himself to the sort of work for which his materials are fitted  set him in the bush with no implements and materials but a bit of broken shell and a lump of hard wood and he confines himself to decorative scratches  place the black in the large cave which pundjel the australian zeus inhabited when on earth as zeus inhabited the cave in crete and give the black plenty of red and white ochre and charcoal and he will paint the human figure in action on the rocky walls  later we will return to the cavepaintings of the australians and the bushmen in south africa  at present we must trace purely decorative art a little further  but we must remember that there was once a race apparently in much the same social condition as the australians but far more advanced and ingenious in art  the earliest men of the european continent about whom we know much the men whose bones and whose weapons are found beneath the graveldrift the men who were contemporary with the rhinoceros mammoth and cavebear were not further advanced in material civilisation than the australians  they used weapons of bone of unpolished stone and probably of hard wood  but the remnants of their art the scraps of mammoth or reindeer bone in our museums prove that they had a most spirited style of sketching from the life  in a collection of drawings on bone probably designed with a flint or a shell drawings by palaeolithic man in the british museum i have only observed one purely decorative attempt  even in this the decoration resembles an effort to use the outlines of foliage for ornamental purposes  in almost all the other cases the palaeolithic artist has not decorated his bits of bone in the usual savage manner but has treated his bone as an artist treats his sketchbook and has scratched outlines of beasts and fishes with his sharp shell as an artist uses his point  these ancient bones in short are the sketchbooks of european savages whose untaught skill was far greater than that of the australians or even of the eskimo  when brought into contact with europeans the australian and eskimo very quickly even without regular teaching learn to draw with some spirit and skill  in the australian stele or gravepillar which we have engraved fig 4 the shapeless figures below the men and animals are the dead and the boilyas or ghosts  observe the patterns in the interstices  the artist had lived with europeans  in their original conditions however the australians have not attained to such free artistlike and unhampered use of their rude materials as the mysterious european artists who drew the mammoth that walked abroad amongst them  fig 4  an australian stele 283jpg  we have engraved one solitary australian attempt at drawing curved lines the new zealanders a race far more highly endowed and when europeans arrived amongst them already far more civilised than the australians had like the australians no metal implements  but their stone weapons were harder and keener and with these they engraved the various spirals and coils on hard wood of which we give examples here  it is sometimes said that new zealand culture and art have filtered from some asiatic source and that in the coils and spirals designed as in our engravings on the face of the maori chief or on his wooden furniture there may be found debased asiatic influences 286  this is one of the questions which we can hardly deal with here  perhaps its solution requires more of knowledge anthropological and linguistic than is at present within the reach of any student  assuredly the races of the earth have wandered far and have been wonderfully intermixed and have left the traces of their passage here and there on sculptured stones and in the keeping of the ghosts that haunt ancient gravesteads  but when two pieces of artistic work one civilised one savage resemble each other it is always dangerous to suppose that the resemblance bears witness to relationship or contact between the races or to influences imported by one from the other  new zealand work may be asiatic in origin and debased by the effect of centuries of lower civilisation and ruder implements  or asiatic ornament may be a form of art improved out of ruder forms like those to which the new zealanders have already attained  one is sometimes almost tempted to regard the favourite maori spiral as an imitation of the form not unlike that of a bishops crozier at the top taken by the great native ferns  examples of resemblance to be accounted for by the development of a crude early idea may be traced most easily in the early pottery of greece  no one says that the greeks borrowed from the civilised people of america  only a few enthusiasts say that the civilised peoples of america especially the peruvians are aryan by race  yet the remains of peruvian palaces are often by no means dissimilar in style from the pelasgic and cyclopean buildings of gigantic stones which remain on such ancient hellenic sites as argos and mycenae  the probability is that men living in similar social conditions and using similar implements have unconsciously and unintentionally arrived at like results  fig 5  a a maori design b tattoo on a maoris face 285jpg  few people who are interested in the question can afford to visit peru and mycenae and study the architecture for themselves  but anyone who is interested in the strange identity of the human mind everywhere and in the necessary forms of early art can go to the british museum and examine the american and early greek pottery  compare the greek key pattern and the wave pattern on greek and mexican vases and compare the birdfaces or human faces very like those of birds with the similar faces on the clay pots which dr schliemann dug up at troy  the latter are engraved in his book on troy  compare the socalled cuttlefish from a peruvian jar with the same figure on the early greek vases most of which are to be found in the last of the classical vaserooms upstairs  once more compare the little clay whorls of the mexican and peruvian room with those which dr schliemann found so numerous at hissarlik  the conviction becomes irresistible that all these objects in shape in purpose in character of decoration are the same because the mind and the materials of men in their early stages of civilisation especially are the same everywhere  you might introduce old greek bits of claywork figures or vases into a peruvian collection or might foist mexican objects among the clay treasures of hissarlik and the wisest archaeologist would be deceived  the greek fret pattern especially seems to be one of the earliest that men learnt to draw  the svastika as it is called the cross with lines at right angles to each limb is found everywherein india greece scotland peruas a natural bit of ornament  the allegorising fancy of the indians gave it a mystic meaning and the learned have built i know not what worlds of religious theories on this prechristian cross which is probably a piece of hasty decorative work with no original mystic meaning at all 289 ornaments of this sort were transferred from wood or bone to clay almost as soon as people learned that early art the potters to which the australians have not attained though it was familiar to the not distant people of new caledonia  the style of spirals and curves again once acquired as it was by the new zealanders became the favourite of some races especially of the celtic  any one who will study either the ornaments of mycenae or those of any old scotch or irish collection will readily recognise in that art the development of a system of ornament like that of the maoris  classical greece on the other hand followed more in the track of the ancient system of straight and slanted lines and we do not find in the later greek art that love of interlacing coils and spirals which is so remarkable among the celts and which is very manifest in the ornaments of the mycaenean hoardsthat is perhaps of the ancient greek heroic age  the causes of these differences in the development of ornament the causes that made celtic genius follow one track and pursue to its aesthetic limits one early motif while classical art went on a severer line it is perhaps impossible at present to ascertain  but it is plain enough that later art has done little more than develop ideas of ornament already familiar to untutored races  fig 6  from a maoris face 287jpg  it has been shown that the art which aims at decoration is better adapted to both the purposes and materials of savages than the art which aims at representation  as a rule the materials of the lower savages are their own bodies which they naturally desire to make beautiful for ever by tattooing and the hard substances of which they fashion their tools and weapons  these hard substances when worked on with cutting instruments of stone or shell are most easily adorned with straight cut lines and spirals are therefore found to be on the whole a comparatively late form of ornament  fig 7  bushman dog 290jpg  we have now to discuss the efforts of the savage to represent  here again we have to consider the purpose which animates him and the materials which are at his service  his pictures have a practical purpose and do not spring from what we are apt perhaps too hastily to consider the innate love of imitation for its own sake  in modern art in modern times no doubt the desire to imitate nature by painting or sculpture has become almost an innate impulse an inborn instinct  but there must be some reason why for this and it does not seem at all unlikely that we inherit the love the disinterested love of imitative art from very remote ancestors whose habits of imitation had a direct interested and practical purpose  the member of parliament who mimics the crowing of a cock during debate or the street boy who beguiles his leisure by barking like a dog has a disinterested pleasure in the exercise of his skill but advanced thinkers seem pretty well agreed that the first men who imitated the voices of dogs and cocks and other animals did not do so merely for fun but with the practical purpose of indicating to their companions the approach of these creatures  such were the rude beginnings of human language and whether that theory be correct or not there are certainly practical reasons which impel the savage to attempt imitative art  i doubt if there are many savage races which do not use representative art for the purposes of writingthat is to communicate information to persons whom they cannot reach by the voice and to assist the memory which in a savage is perhaps not very strong  to take examples  a savage man meets a savage maid  she does not speak his language nor he hers  how are they to know whether according to the marriage laws of their race they are lawful mates for each other  this important question is settled by an inspection of their tattooed marks  if a thlinkeet man of the swan stock meets an iroquois maid of the swan stock they cannot speak to each other and the gesture language is cumbrous  but if both are tattooed with the swan then the man knows that this daughter of the swan is not for him  he could no more marry her than helen of troy could have married castor the tamer of horses  both are children of the swan as were helen and castor and must regard each other as brother and sister  the case of the thlinkeet man and the iroquois maid is extremely unlikely to occur but i give it as an example of the practical use among savages of representative art  fig 8  red indian picturewriting  the legend of manabozho 293jpg  among the uses of art for conveying intelligence we notice that even the australians have what the greeks would have called the greek a staff on which inscriptions legible to the aborigines are engraven  i believe however that the australian greek is not usually marked with picturewriting but with notcheseven more difficult to decipher  as an example of red indian picturewriting we publish a scroll from kohls book on the natives of north america  this rude work of art though the reader may think little of it is really a document as important in its way as the chaldaean clay tablets inscribed with the record of the deluge  the coarselydrawn figures recall to the artists mind much of the myth of manabozho the prometheus and the deucalion the cain and the noah of the dwellers by the great lake  manabozho was a great chief who had two wives that quarrelled  the two stumpy halffigures 4 represent the wives the mound between them is the displeasure of manabozho further on 5 you see him caught up between two treesan unpleasant fix from which the wolves and squirrels refused to extricate him  the kind of pyramid with a figure at top 8 is a mountain on which when the flood came manabozho placed his grandmother to be out of the waters way  the somewhat similar object is manabozho himself on the top of his mountain  the animals you next behold 10 were sent out by manabozho to ascertain how the deluge was faring and to carry messages to his grandmother  this scroll was drawn probably on birch bark by a red man of literary attainments who gave it to kohl in its lower righthand corner 11 he has pictured the event that he might never forget the story of the manabozhian deluge  the red indians have always as far as european knowledge goes been in the habit of using this picturewriting for the purpose of retaining their legends poems and incantations  it is unnecessary to say that the picturewriting of mexico and the hieroglyphics of ancient egypt are derived from the same savage processes  i must observe that the hasty indications of the figure used in picturewriting are by no means to be regarded as measures of the red mens skill in art  they can draw much better than the artist who recorded the manabozhian legend when they please  in addition to picturewriting religion has fostered savage representative art  if a man worships a lizard or a bear he finds it convenient to have an amulet or idol representing a bear or a lizard  if one adores a lizard or a bear one is likely to think that prayer and acts of worship addressed to an image of the animal will please the animal himself and make him propitious  thus the art of making little portable figures of various worshipful beings is fostered and the craft of working in wood or ivory is born  as a rule the savage is satisfied with excessively rude representations of his gods  objects of this kindrude hewn blocks of stone and woodwere the most sacred effigies of the gods in greece and were kept in the dimmest recesses of the temple  no demeter wrought by the craft of phidias would have appeared so holy to the phigalians as the strange old figure of the goddess with the head of a mare  the earliest greek sacred sculptures that remain are scarcely if at all more advanced in art than the idols of the naked admiralty islanders  but this is anticipating in the meantime it may be said that among the sources of savage representative art are the need of something like writing and ideas suggested by nascent religion  fig 9  bushman wallpainting 295jpg  the singular wallpicture fig 9 from a cave in south africa which we copy from the cape monthly magazine probably represents a magical ceremony  bushmen are tempting a great water animala rhinoceros or something of that sortto run across the land for the purpose of producing rain  the connection of ideas is scarcely apparent to civilised minds but it is not more indistinct than the connection between carrying a bit of the rope with which a man has been hanged and success at cardsa common french superstition  the bushman cavepictures like those of australia are painted in black red and white  savages like the assyrians and the early greeks and like children draw animals much better than the human figure  the bushman dog in our little engraving fig 7 is all alivealmost as full of life as the dog which accompanies the centaur chiron in that beautiful vase in the british museum which represents the fostering of achilles  the bushman wallpaintings like those of australia seem to prove that savage art is capable of considerable freedom when supplied with fitting materials  men seem to draw better when they have pigments and a flat surface of rock to work upon than when they are scratching on hard wood with a sharp edge of a broken shell  though the thing has little to do with art it may be worth mentioning as a matter of curiosity that the labyrinthine australian caves are decorated here and there with the mark of a red hand  the same mysterious or at least unexplained red hand is impressed on the walls of the ruined palaces and temples of yucatanthe work of a vanished people  fig 10  palaelithic art 297jpg  there is one singular fact in the history of savage art which reminds us that savages like civilised men have various degrees of culture and various artistic capacities  the oldest inhabitants of europe who have left any traces of their lives and handiwork must have been savages their tools and weapons were not even formed of polished stone but of roughhewn flint  the people who used tools of this sort must necessarily have enjoyed but a scanty mechanical equipment and the life they lived in caves from which they had to drive the cavebear and among snows where they stalked the reindeer and the mammoth must have been very rough  these earliest known europeans palaeolithic men as they called from their use of the ancient unpolished stone weapons appear to have inhabited the countries now known as france and england before the great age of ice  this makes their date one of incalculable antiquity they are removed from us by a dark backward and abysm of time  the whole age of ice the dateless period of the polishers of stone weapons the arrival of men using weapons of bronze the time which sufficed to change the climate and fauna and flora of western europe lie between us and palaeolithic man  yet in him we must recognise a skill more akin to the spirit of modern art than is found in any other savage race palaeolithic man like other savages decorated his weapons but as i have already said he did not usually decorate them in the common savage manner with ornamental patterns  he scratched on bits of bone spirited representations of all the animals whose remains are found mixed with his own  he designed the largeheaded horse of that period and science inclines to believe that he drew the breed correctly  his sketches of the mammoth the reindeer the bear and of many fishes may be seen in the british museum or engraved in such works as professor boyd dawkinss early man in britain  the object from which our next illustration fig 12 was engraved represents a deer and was a knifehandle  eyes at all trained in art can readily observe the wonderful spirit and freedom of these ancient sketches  they are the rapid characteristic work of true artists who know instinctively what to select and what to sacrifice  fig 12  palaeolithic art  a knifehandle 299jpg  some learned men mr boyd dawkins among them believe that the eskimo that stunted hunting and fishing race of the western arctic circle are descendants of the palaeolithic sketchers and retain their artistic qualities  other inquirers with mr geikie and dr wilson do not believe in this pedigree of the eskimo  i speak not with authority but the submission of ignorance and as one who has no right to an opinion about these deep matters of geology and ethnology  but to me mr geikies arguments appear distinctly the more convincing and i cannot think it demonstrated that the eskimo are descended from our old palaeolithic artists  but if mr boyd dawkins is right if the eskimo derive their lineage from the artists of the dordogne then the eskimo are sadly degenerated  in mr dawkinss early man is an eskimo drawing of a reindeer hunt and a palaeolithic sketch of a reindeer these by permission of the author and messrs macmillan we reproduce  look at the vigour and life of the ancient drawingthe feathering hair on the deers breast his head his horns the very grasses at his feet are touched with the graver of a true artist fig 14  the design is like a hasty memorandum of leechs  then compare the stiff formality of the modern eskimo drawing fig 13  it is rather like a record a piece of picturewriting than a free sketch a rapid representation of what is most characteristic in nature  clearly if the eskimo come from palaeolithic man they are a degenerate race as far as art is concerned yet as may be seen in dr rinks books the eskimo show considerable skill when they have become acquainted with european methods and models and they have at any rate a greater natural gift for design than the red indians of whose sacred art the thunderbird brooding over page 298 is a fair example  the red men believe in big birds which produce thunder quahteaht the adam of vancouvers island married one and this fig 11 is she  fig 11  red indian art  the thunderbird 298jpg  fig 13  eskimo drawing  a reindeer hunt 300jpg  fig 14  palaeolithic sketch  a reindeer 301jpg  we have tried to show how savage decorative art supplied the first ideas of patterns which were developed in various ways by the decorative art of advancing civilisation  the same progress might be detected in representative art  books like the guidebook to ancient greece which pausanias wrote before the glory had quite departed prove that the greek temples were museums in which the development of art might be clearly traced  furthest back in the series of images of gods came things like that large stone which was given to cronus when he wished to swallow his infant child zeus and which he afterwards vomited up with his living progeny  this fetichstone was preserved at delphi  next came wild bulks of beastheaded gods like the horseheaded demeter of phigalia and it seems possible enough that there was an artemis with the head of a shebear  gradually the bestial characteristics dropped and there appeared such rude anthropomorphic images of apollomore like south sea idols than the archer princeas are now preserved in athens  next we have the stage of semisavage realism which is represented by the metopes of selinus in sicily now in the british museum and by not a few gems and pieces of gold work  greek temples have fallen and the statues of the gods exist only in scattered fragments  but in the representative collection of casts belonging to the cambridge archaeological museum one may trace the career of greek art backwards from phidias to the rude idol  savage realism is the result of a desire to represent an object as it is known to be and not as it appears  thus catlin among the red indians found that the people refused to be drawn in profile  they knew they had two eyes and in profile they seemed only to have one  look at the selinus marbles and you will observe that figures of which the body is seen in profile have the full face turned to the spectator  again the savage knows that an animal has two sides both he thinks should be represented but he cannot foreshorten and he finds the profile view easiest to draw  to satisfy his need of realism he draws a beasts head fullface and gives to the one head two bodies drawn in profile examples of this are frequent in very archaic greek gems and gold work and mr a s murray suggests as i understand him that the attitude of the two famous lions which guarded vainly agamemnons gate at mycenae is derived from the archaic doublebodied and singleheaded beast of savage realism  very good examples of these oddities may be found in the journal of the hellenic society 1881 pl xv  here are doublebodied and single headed birds monsters and sphinxes  we engrave fig 15 three greek gems from the islands as examples of savagery in early greek art  in the oblong gem the archers are rather below the red indian standard of design  the hunter figured in the first gem is almost up to the bushman mark  in his dress ethnologists will recognise an arrangement now common among the natives of new caledonia  in the third gem the woman between two swans may be leda or she may represent leto in delos  observe the amazing rudeness of the design and note the modern waist and crinoline  the artists who engraved these gems on hard stone had of necessity much better tools than any savages possess but their art was truly savage  to discover how greek art climbed in a couple of centuries from this coarse and childish work to the grace of the aegina marbles and thence to the absolute freedom and perfect unapproachable beauty of the work of phidias is one of the most singular problems in the history of art  greece learned something no doubt from her early knowledge of the arts the priests of assyria and egypt had elaborated in the valleys of the euphrates and the nile  that might account for a swift progress from savage to formal and hieratic art but whence sprang the inspiration which led her so swiftly on to art that is perfectly free natural and godlike  it is a mystery of race and of a divine gift  the heavenly gods have given it to mortals  fig 15  archaic greek gems 303jpg     footnotes

several references to greek fetichstones in theophrastuss account of the superstitious man  a number of greek sacred stones named by pausanias may be worth noticing  in boeotia ix 16 the people believed that alcmene mother of heracles was changed into a stone  the thespians worshipped under the name of eros an unwrought stone greek their most ancient sacred object ix 27  the people of orchomenos paid extreme regard to certain stones said to have fallen from heaven or to certain figures made of stone that descended from the sky ix 38  near chaeronea rhea was said to have deceived cronus by offering him in place of zeus a stone wrapped in swaddling bands  this stone which cronus vomited forth after having swallowed it was seen by pausanias at delphi ix 41  by the roadside near the city of the panopeans lay the stones out of which prometheus made men x 4  the stone swallowed in place of zeus by his father lay at the exit from the delphian temple and was anointed compare the action of jacob gen xxviii 18 with oil every day  the phocians worshipped thirty squared stones each named after a god vii xxii  among all the greeks rude stones were worshipped before the images of the gods  among the troezenians a sacred stone lay in front of the temple whereon the troezenian elders sat and purified orestes from the murder of his mother  in attica there was a conical stone worshipped as apollo i xliv  near argos was a stone called zeus cappotas on which orestes was said to have sat down and so recovered peace of mind  such are examples of the sacred stones the oldest worshipful objects of greece  226  see essays on apollo and the mouse and the early history of the family  230  here i may mention a case illustrating the motives of the fetich worshipper  my friend mr j j atkinson who has for many years studied the manners of the people of new caledonia asked a native why he treasured a certain fetichstone  the man replied that in one of the vigils which are practised beside the corpses of deceased friends he saw a lizard  the lizard is a totem a worshipful animal in new caledonia the native put out his hand to touch it when it disappeared and left a stone in its place  this stone he therefore held sacred in the highest degree  here then a fetichstone was indicated as such by a spirit in form of a lizard  233a  much the same theory is propounded

own ideas may lead some inquirers to suppose  sir henry maine writes that both mr morgan and mr mlennan seem to me to think that human society went everywhere through the same series of changes and mr mlennan at any rate expresses himself as if all those stages could be clearly discriminated from one another and the close of one and the commencement of another announced with the distinctness of the clockbell telling the end of the hour  on the other hand i remember mr mlennans saying that in his opinion all manner of arrangements probably went on simultaneously in different places  in studies in ancient history p 127 he expressly guards against the tendency to assume that the progress of the various races of men from savagery has been a uniform progress that all the stages which any of them has gone through have been passed in their order by all  still more to the point is his remark on polyandry among the very early greeks and other aryans it is quite consistent with my view that in all
