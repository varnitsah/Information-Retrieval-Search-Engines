82008511	sally dows   by bret harte     contents   sally dows  the conspiracy of mrs bunker  the transformation of buckeye camp  their uncle from california     sally dows   prologue  the last gun at snake river   what had been in the cool gray of that summer morning a dewy country lane marked only by a few wagon tracks that never encroached upon its grassy border and indented only by the faint footprints of a crossing fox or coon was now before high noon already crushed beaten down and trampled out of all semblance of its former graciousness the heavy springless jolt of guncarriage and caisson had cut deeply through the middle track the hoofs of crowding cavalry had struck down and shredded the wayside vines and bushes to bury them under a cloud of following dust and the short plunging doublequick of infantry had trodden out this hideous ruin into one dusty level chaos along that rudely widened highway useless muskets torn accoutrements knapsacks caps and articles of clothing were scattered with here and there the larger wrecks of brokendown wagons roughly thrown aside into the ditch to make way for the living current for two hours the greater part of an army corps had passed and repassed that way but coming or going always with faces turned eagerly towards an open slope on the right which ran parallel to the lane and yet nothing was to be seen there for two hours a gray and bluish cloud rent and shaken with explosion after explosion but always closing and thickening after each discharge was all that had met their eyes nevertheless into this ominous cloud solid moving masses of men in gray or blue had that morning melted away or emerged from it only as scattered fragments that crept crawled ran or clung together in groups to be followed and overtaken in the rolling vapor  but for the last half hour the desolated track had stretched empty and deserted while there was no cessation of the rattling crackling and detonations on the fateful slope beyond it had still been silent once or twice it had been crossed by timid hurrying wings and frightened and hesitating little feet or later by skulkers and stragglers from the main column who were tempted to enter it from the hedges and bushes where they had been creeping and hiding suddenly a prolonged yell from the hidden slope beyondthe nearest sound that had yet been heard from that ominous distancesent them to cover again it was followed by the furious galloping of horses in the lane and a handsome redcapped officer accompanied by an orderly dashed down the track wheeled leaped the hedge rode out on the slope and halted in another instant a cloud of dust came whirling down the lane after him out of it strained the heavy shoulders and tightened chaintraces of six frantic horses dragging the swaying gun that in this tempest of motion alone seemed passive and helpless with an awful foreknowledge of its power as in obedience to a signal from the officer they crashed through the hedge after him a sudden jolt threw an artilleryman from the limber before the wheel a driver glanced back on the tense chain and hesitated go on yelled the prostrate man and the wheel went over him another and another gun followed out of the dust cloud until the whole battery had deployed on the slope before the drifting dust had fairly settled the falling back of the panting horses with their drivers gave a momentary glimpse of the nearest gun already in position and of the four erect figures beside it the yell that seemed to have evoked this sudden apparition again sounded nearer a blinding flash broke from the gun which was instantly hidden by the closing group around it and a deafening crash with the high ringing of metal ran down the lane a column of white woolly smoke arose as another flash broke beside it this was quickly followed by another and another with a response from the gun first fired until the whole slope shook and thundered and the smoke no longer white and woolly but darkening and thickening as with unburnt grains of gunpowder mingled into the one ominous vapor and driving along the lane hid even the slope from view  the yelling had ceased but the grinding and rattling heard through the detonation of cannon came nearer still and suddenly there was a shower of leaves and twigs from the lower branches of a chestnuttree near the broken hedge as the smoke thinned again a rising and falling medley of flapping hats tossing horses heads and shining steel appeared for an instant advancing tumultuously up the slope but the apparition was as instantly cloven by flame from the two nearest guns and went down in a gush of smoke and roar of sound so level was the delivery and so close the impact that a space seemed suddenly cleared between in which the whirling of the shattered remnants of the charging cavalry was distinctly seen and the shouts and oaths of the inextricably struggling mass became plain and articulate then a gunner serving the nearest piece suddenly dropped his swab and seized a carbine for out of the whirling confusion before them a single rider was seen galloping furiously towards the gun  the redcapped young officer rode forward and knocked up the gunners weapon with his sword for in that rapid glance he had seen that the riders reins were hanging loosely on the neck of his horse who was still dashing forwards with the frantic impetus of the charge and that the youthful figure of the rider wearing the stripes of a lieutenantalthough still erect exercised no control over the animal the face was boyish blond and ghastly the eyes were set and glassy it seemed as if death itself were charging the gun  within a few feet of it the horse swerved before a brandished rammer and striking the cheeks of the guncarriage pitched his inanimate rider across the gun the hot blood of the dead man smoked on the hotter brass with the reek of the shambles and bespattered the hand of the gunner who still mechanically served the vent as they lifted the dead body down the order came to cease firing for the yells from below had ceased too the rattling and grinding were receding with the smoke farther to the left the ominous central cloud parted for a brief moment and showed the unexpected sun glittering down the slope upon a near and peaceful river  the young artillery officer had dismounted and was now gently examining the dead man his breast had been crushed by a fragment of shell he must have died instantly the same missile had cut the chain of a locket which slipped from his opened coat the officer picked it up with a strange feelingperhaps because he was conscious himself of wearing a similar one perhaps because it might give him some clue to the mans identity it contained only the photograph of a pretty girl a tendril of fair hair and the word sally in the breastpocket was a sealed letter with the inscription for miss sally dows to be delivered if i fall by the mudsills hand a faint smile came over the officers face he was about to hand the articles to a sergeant but changed his mind and put them in his pocket  meantime the lane and woods beyond and even the slope itself were crowding with supports and waiting troops his own battery was still unlimbered waiting orders there was a slight commotion in the lane  very well done captain smartly taken and gallantly held  it was the voice of a general officer passing with his staff there was a note of pleasant relief in its tone and the middleaged caredrawn face of its owner was relaxed in a paternal smile the young captain flushed with pleasure  and you seem to have had close work too added the general pointing to the dead man  the young officer hurriedly explained the general nodded saluted and passed on but a youthful aide airily lingered  the old mans feeling good courtland he said weve rolled em up all along the line its all over now in point of fact i reckon youve fired the last round in this particular fratricidal engagement  the last round courtland remained silent looking abstractedly at the man it had crushed and broken at his feet  and i shouldnt wonder if you got your goldleaf for todays work but whos your sunny southern friend here he added following his companions eyes  courtland repeated his story a little more seriously which however failed to subdue the young aides levity so he concluded to stop over he interrupted cheerfully but looking at the letter and photograph i saylook here sally dows why there was another man picked up yesterday with a letter to the same girl doc murphy has it and by jove the same picture tooeh i say sally must have gathered in the boys and raked down the whole pile look here courty you might get doc murphys letter and hunt her up when this cruel war is over say youre fulfilling a sacred trust see good idea old man tata and he trotted quickly after his superior  courtland remained with the letter and photograph in his hand gazing abstractedly after him the smoke had rolled quite away from the fields on the left but still hung heavily down the south on the heels of the flying cavalry a long bugle call swelled up musically from below the freed sun caught the white flags of two field hospitals in the woods and glanced tranquilly on the broad cypressfringed lazyflowing and cruel but beautiful southern river which had all unseen crept so smilingly that morning through the very heart of the battle   chapter i   the two oclock express from redlands to forestville georgia had been proceeding with the languid placidity of the river whose banks it skirted for more than two hours but unlike the river it had stopped frequently sometimes at recognized stations and villages sometimes at the apparition of strawhatted and linencoated natives in the solitude of pine woods where after a decent interval of cheery conversation with the conductor and engineer it either took the stranger on board or relieved him of his parcel letter basket or even the verbal message with which he was charged much of the way lay through pinebarren and swampy woods which had never been cleared or cultivated much through decayed settlements and ruined villages that had remained unchanged since the war of the rebellion now three years past there were vestiges of the severity of a former military occupation the blackened timbers of railway bridges still unrepaired and along the line of a certain memorable march sections of iron rails taken from the tornup track roasted in bonfires and bent while redhot around the trunks of trees were still to be seen these mementos of defeat seemed to excite neither revenge nor the energy to remove them the dull apathy which had succeeded the days of hysterical passion and convulsion still lingered even the slow improvement that could be detected was marked by the languor of convalescence the helplessness of a race hitherto dependent upon certain barbaric conditions or political place and power unskilled in invention and suddenly confronted with the necessity of personal labor was visible everywhere eyes that but three short years before had turned vindictively to the north now gazed wistfully to that quarter for help and direction they scanned eagerly the faces of their energetic and prosperous neighborsand quondam foesupon the verandas of southern hotels and the decks of southern steamboats and were even now watching from a group in the woods the windows of the halted train where the faces appeared of two men of manifestly different types but still alien to the country in dress features and accent  two negroes were slowly loading the engine tender from a woodpile the rich brown smoke of the turpentine knots was filling the train with its stinging fragrance the elder of the two northern passengers with sharp new england angles in his face impatiently glanced at his watch  of all created shiftlessness this beats everything why couldnt we have taken in enough wood to last the ten miles farther to the terminus when we last stopped and why in thunder with all this firing up cant we go faster  the younger passenger whose quiet wellbred face seemed to indicate more discipline of character smiled  if you really wish to know and as weve only ten miles farther to goill show you why come with me  he led the way through the car to the platform and leaped down then he pointed significantly to the rails below them his companion started the metal was scaling off in thin strips from the rails and in some places its thickness had been reduced a quarter of an inch while in others the projecting edges were torn off or hanging in iron shreds so that the wheels actually ran on the narrow central strip it seemed marvelous that the train could keep the track  now you know why we dont go more than five miles an hour andare thankful that we dont said the young traveler quietly  but this is disgracefulcriminal ejaculated the other nervously  not at their rate of speed returned the younger man the crime would be in going faster and now you can understand why a good deal of the other progress in this state is obliged to go as slowly over their equally decaying and rotten foundations you cant rush things here as we do in the north  the other passenger shrugged his shoulders as they remounted the platform and the train moved on it was not the first time that the two fellowtravelers had differed although their mission was a common one the elder mr cyrus drummond was the vicepresident of a large northern land and mill company which had bought extensive tracts of land in georgia and the younger colonel courtland was the consulting surveyor and engineer for the company drummonds opinions were a good deal affected by sectional prejudice and a selfsatisfied and righteous ignorance of the actual conditions and limitations of the people with whom he was to deal while the younger man who had served through the war with distinction retained a soldiers respect and esteem for his late antagonists with a conscientious and thoughtful observation of their character although he had resigned from the army the fact that he had previously graduated at west point with high honors had given him preferment in this technical appointment and his knowledge of the country and its people made him a valuable counselor and it was a fact that the country people had preferred this soldier with whom they had once personally grappled to the capitalist they had never known during the struggle  the train rolled slowly through the woods so slowly that the fragrant pine smoke from the engine still hung round the windows of the cars gradually the clearings became larger they saw the distant white wooden colonnades of some planters house looking still opulent and pretentious although the fence of its inclosure had broken gaps and the gate sagged on its single hinge  mr drummond sniffed at this damning record of neglect and indifference even if they were ruined they might still have spent a few cents for nails and slats to enable them to look decent before folks and not parade their poverty before their neighbors he said  but thats just where you misunderstand them drummond said courtland smiling they have no reason to keep up an attitude towards their neighbors who still know them as squire soandso colonel this and that and the judgeowners of their vast but crippled estates they are not ashamed of being poor which is an accident  but they are of working which is deliberation interrupted drummond they are ashamed to mend their fences themselves now that they have no slaves to do it for them  i doubt very much if some of them know how to drive a nail for the matter of that said courtland still goodhumoredly but thats the fault of a system older than themselves which the founders of the republic retained we cannot give them experience in their new condition in one day and in fact drummond i am very much afraid that for our purposesand i honestly believe for their goodwe must help to keep them for the present as they are  perhaps said drummond sarcastically you would like to reinstate slavery  no but i should like to reinstate the master and not for his sake alone but for freedoms sake and ours to be plain since i have taken up this matter for the company i have satisfied myself from personal observation that the negroeven more than his mastercannot handle his new condition he is accustomed to his old traditional taskmaster and i doubt if he will work fairly for any otherparticularly for those who dont understand him dont mistake me i dont propose to go back to the whip to that brutal institution the irresponsible overseer to the buying and selling and separation of the family nor any of the old wrongs but i propose to make the old master our overseer and responsible to us he is not a fool and has already learned that it is more profitable to pay wages to his old slaves and have the power of dismissal like any other employer than be obliged under the old system of enforced labor and life servitude to undergo the cost of maintaining incompetence and idleness the old sentiment of slaveowning has disappeared before natural commonsense and selfishness i am satisfied that by some such process as this utilizing of the old master and the new freedom we will be better able to cultivate our lands than by buying up their estates and setting the old owners adrift with a little money in their pockets as an idle discontented class to revive old political dogmas and foment new issues or perhaps set up a dangerous opposition to us  you dont mean to say that those infernal niggers would give the preference to their old oppressors  dollar for dollar in wagesyes and why shouldnt they their old masters understand them betterand treat them generally better they know our interest in them is only an abstract sentiment not a real liking we show it at every turn but we are nearing redlands and major reed will i have no doubt corroborate my impressions he insists upon our staying at his house although the poor old fellow i imagine can ill afford to entertain company but he will be offended if we refuse  he is a friend of yours then asked drummond  i fought against his division at stony creek said courtland grimly he never tires of talking of it to meso i suppose i am  a few moments later the train glided beside the redlands platform as the two travelers descended a hand was laid on courtlands shoulder and a stout figure in the blackest and shiniest of alpaca jackets and the whitest and broadest of panama hats welcomed him glad to see yo cunnel i reckoned id waltz over and bring along the boy pointing to a grizzled negro servant of sixty who was bowing before them to tote yor things over instead of using a hack i havent run much on horseflesh since the wahha ha what i didnt use up for remounts i reckon yor commissary gobbled up with the other live stock eh he laughed heartily as if the recollections were purely humorous and again clapped courtland on the back  let me introduce my friend mr drummond major reed said courtland smiling  yo were in the wah sir  noireturned drummond hesitating he knew not why and angry at his own embarrassment  mr drummond the vicepresident of the company interposed courtland cheerfully was engaged in furnishing to us the sinews of war  major reed bowed a little more formally most of us heah sir were in the wah some time or other and if you gentlemen will honah me by joining in a social glass at the hotel across the way ill introduce you to captain prendergast who left a leg at fair oaks drummond would have declined but a significant pressure on his arm from courtland changed his determination he followed them to the hotel and into the presence of the onelegged warrior who turned out to be the landlord and barkeeper to whom courtland was hilariously introduced by major reed as the man sir who had pounded my division for three hours at stony creek  major reeds house was but a few minutes walk down the dusty lane and was presently heralded by the baying of three or four foxhounds and foreshadowed by a dilapidated condition of picketfence and stuccoed gate front beyond it stretched the wooden doric columns of the usual southern mansion dimly seen through the broad leaves of the horsechestnuttrees that shaded it there were the usual listless black shadows haunting the veranda and outer officesformer slaves and still attached houseservants arrested like lizards in breathless attitudes at the approach of strange footsteps and still holding the brush broom duster or home implement they had been lazily using in their fixed hands from the doorway of the detached kitchen connected by a gallery to the wing of the mansion aunt martha the cook gazed also with a saucepan clasped to her bosom and her revolving hand with the scrubbing cloth in it apparently stopped on a dead centre  drummond whose gorge had risen at these evidences of hopeless incapacity and utter shiftlessness was not relieved by the presence of mrs reeda soured disappointed woman of forty who still carried in her small dark eyes and thin handsome lips something of the bitterness and antagonism of the typical southern rights woman nor of her two daughters octavia and augusta whose languid atrabiliousness seemed a part of the mourning they still wore the optimistic gallantry and good fellowship of the major appeared the more remarkable by contrast with his cypressshadowed family and their venomous possibilities perhaps there might have been a light vein of southern insincerity in his good humor paw said miss octavia with gloomy confidence to courtland but with a pretty curl of the hereditary lip is about the only reconstructed one of the entire family we dont make em much about yer but id advise yo friend mr drummond if hes coming here carpetbagging not to trust too much to paws reconstruction it wont wash but when courtland hastened to assure her that drummond was not a carpetbagger was not only free from any of the political intrigue implied under that baleful title but was a wealthy northern capitalist simply seeking investment the young lady was scarcely more hopeful i suppose he reckons to pay paw for those niggers yo stole she suggested with gloomy sarcasm  no said courtland smiling but what if he reckoned to pay those niggers for working for your father and him  if paw is going into trading business with him if major reeda sothn gentlemanis going to keep shop he aint such a fool as to believe niggers will work when they aint obliged to thats been tried over at mirandy dowss not five miles from here and the niggers are half the time hangin round here takin holiday she put up new quarters for em and tried to make em eat together at a long table like those lowdown folks up north and did away with their cabins and their melon patches and allowed it would get em out of lying round too much and wanted em to work overtime and get mo pay and the result was that she and her niece and a lot of poor whites irish and scotch that she had to pick up long the river do all the work and her niece sally was mo than half union woman during the wah and up to all nothn tricks and dodges and swearin by them and yet for all thatthe thing wont work  but isnt that partly the reason isnt her failure a great deal due to this lack of sympathy from her neighbors discontent is easily sown and the negro is still weighted down by superstition the fifteenth amendment did not quite knock off all his chains  yes but that is nothing to her for if there ever was a person in this world who reckoned she was just born to manage everything and everybody it is sally dows  sally dows repeated courtland with a slight start  yes sally dows of pineville  you say she was half union but did she have any relations ororfriendsin the waron your side anywhowere killed in battle  they were all killed i reckon returned miss reed darkly there was her cousin jule jeffcourt shot in the cemetery with her beau who they say was sallys too there were chet brooks and joyce masterton who were both gone on her and both killed too and there was old captain dows himself who never lifted his head again after richmond was taken and drank himself to death it wasnt considered healthy to be miss sallys relations in those times or to be even wantin to be one  colonel courtland did not reply the face of the dead young officer coming towards him out of the blue smoke rose as vividly as on that memorable day the picture and letter he had taken from the dead mans breast which he had retained ever since the romantic and fruitless quest he had made for the fair original in after days and the strange and fateful interest in her which had grown up in his heart since then he now knew had only been lulled to sleep in the busy preoccupation of the last six months for it all came back to him with redoubled force his present mission and its practical object his honest zeal in its pursuit and the cautious skill and experience he had brought to it all seemed to be suddenly displaced by this romantic and unreal fantasy oddly enough it appeared now to be the only reality in his life the rest was an incoherent purposeless dream  isismiss sally married he asked collecting himself with an effort  married yes to that farm of her aunts i reckon thats the only thing she cares for  courtland looked up recovering his usual cheerful calm well i think that after luncheon ill pay my respects to her family from what you have just told me the farm is certainly an experiment worth seeing i suppose your father will have no objection to give me a letter to miss dows   chapter ii   nevertheless as colonel courtland rode deliberately towards dows folly as the new experiment was locally called although he had not abated his romantic enthusiasm in the least he was not sorry that he was able to visit it under a practical pretext it was rather late now to seek out miss sally dows with the avowed intent of bringing her a letter from an admirer who had been dead three years and whose memory she had probably buried neither was it tactful to recall a sentiment which might have been a weakness of which she was ashamed yet clearheaded and logical as courtland was in his ordinary affairs he was nevertheless not entirely free from that peculiar superstition which surrounds every mans romance he believed there was something more than a mere coincidence in his unexpectedly finding himself in such favorable conditions for making her acquaintance for the restif there was any resthe would simply trust to fate and so believing himself a cool sagacious reasoner but being actually as far as miss dows was concerned as blind fatuous and unreasoning as any of her previous admirers he rode complacently forward until he reached the lane that led to the dows plantation  here a better kept roadway and fence whose careful repair would have delighted drummond seemed to augur well for the new enterprise presently even the oldfashioned local form of the fence a slanting zigzag gave way to the more direct line of post and rail in the northern fashion beyond it presently appeared a long low frontage of modern buildings which to courtlands surprise were entirely new in structure and design there was no reminiscence of the usual southern porticoed gable or columned veranda yet it was not northern either the factorylike outline of facade was partly hidden in cherokee rose and jessamine  a long roofed gallery connected the buildings and became a veranda to one a broad wellrolled gravel drive led from the open gate to the newest building which seemed to be the office a smaller path diverged from it to the corner house which despite its severe simplicity had a more residential appearance unlike reeds house there were no lounging servants or field hands to be seen they were evidently attending to their respective duties dismounting courtland tied his horse to a post at the office door and took the smaller path to the corner house  the door was open to the fragrant afternoon breeze wafted through the rose and jessamine so also was a side door opening from the hall into a long parlor or sittingroom that ran the whole width of the house courtland entered it it was prettily furnished but everything had the air of freshness and of being uncharacteristically new it was empty but a faint hammering was audible on the rear wall of the house through the two open french windows at the back curtained with trailing vines which gave upon a sunlit courtyard courtland walked to the window just before it on the ground stood a small light ladder which he gently put aside to gain a better view of the courtyard as he put on his hat and stepped out of the open window  in this attitude he suddenly felt his hat tipped from his head followed almost instantaneously by a falling slipper and the distinct impression of a very small foot on the crown of his head an indescribable sensation passed over him he hurriedly stepped back into the room just as a small stripedstockinged foot was as hastily drawn up above the top of the window with the feminine exclamation good gracious me  lingering for an instant only to assure himself that the fair speaker had secured her foothold and was in no danger of falling courtland snatched up his hat which had providentially fallen inside the room and retreated ingloriously to the other end of the parlor the voice came again from the window and struck him as being very sweet and clear  sophy is that you  courtland discreetly retired to the hall to his great relief a voice from the outside answered whar miss sally  what did yo move the ladder for yo might have killed me  fo god miss sally i didnt move no ladder  dont tell me but go down and get my slipper and bring up some more nails  courtland waited silently in the hall in a few moments he heard a heavy footstep outside the rear window this was his opportunity reentering the parlor somewhat ostentatiously he confronted a tall negro girl who was passing through the room carrying a tiny slipper in her hand excuse me he said politely but i could not find any one to announce me is miss dows at home  the girl instantly whipped the slipper behind her is yo wanting miss mirandy dows she asked with great dignity oah miss sally dowsher niece miss mirandys bin gone to atlanta for a week  i have a letter for miss miranda but i shall be very glad if miss sally dows will receive me returned courtland handing the letter and his card to the girl  she received it with a still greater access of dignity and marked deliberation its clean gone outer my mind sah ef miss sally is in de resumption of visitahs at dis houah in fac sah she continued with intensified gravity and an exaggeration of thoughtfulness as the sounds of miss sallys hammering came shamelessly from the wall i doahn know exacly ef shes engaged playin de harp practicin de languages or paintin in oil and watah colors o givin audiences to offishals from de court house it might be de houah for de one or de odder but ill communicate wid her sah in de budwoh on de uppah flo she backed dexterously so as to keep the slipper behind her but with no diminution of dignity out of a side door in another moment the hammering ceased followed by the sound of rapid whispering without a few tiny twigs and leaves slowly rustled to the ground and then there was complete silence he ventured to walk to the fateful window again  presently he heard a faint rustle at the other end of the room and he turned a sudden tremulousness swept along his pulses and then they seemed to pause he drew a deep breath that was almost a sigh and remained motionless  he had no preconceived idea of falling in love with miss sally at first sight nor had he dreamed such a thing possible even the girlish face that he had seen in the locket although it had stirred him with a singular emotion had not suggested that and the ideal he had evolved from it was never a potent presence but the exquisitely pretty face and figure before him although it might have been painted from his own fancy of her was still something more and something unexpected all that had gone before had never prepared him for the beautiful girl who now stood there it was a poor explanation to say that miss sally was four or five years older than her picture and that later experiences enlarged capacity a different life and new ambition had impressed her youthful face with a refined mobility it was a weird fancy to imagine that the blood of those who had died for her had in some vague mysterious way imparted an actual fascination to her and he dismissed it but even the most familiar spectator like sophy could see that miss sally had the softest pink complexion the silkiest hair that looked as the floss of the indian corn might look if curled or golden spider threads if materialized and eyes that were in bright gray harmony with both that the frock of india muslin albeit homemade fitted her figure perfectly from the azure bows on her shoulders to the ribbon around her waist and that the hem of its billowy skirt showed a foot which had the reputation of being the smallest foot south of mason and dixons line but it was something more intangible than this which kept courtland breathless and silent  im not miss miranda dows said the vision with a frankness that was half childlike and half practical as she extended a little hand but i can talk fahm with yo about as well as aunty and i reckon from what major reed says heah holding up the letter between her fingers as long as yo get the persimmons yo dont mind what kind o pole yo knock em down with  the voice that carried this speech was so fresh clear and sweet that i am afraid courtland thought little of its bluntness or its conventional transgressions but it brought him his own tongue quite unemotionally and quietly i dont know what was in that note miss dows but i can hardly believe that major reed ever put my present felicity quite in that way  miss sally laughed then with a charming exaggeration she waved her little hand towards the sofa  there yo naturally wanted a little room for that connle but now that yo ve got it offand mighty pooty it was tooyo can sit down and with that she sank down at one end of the sofa prettily drew aside a white billow of skirt so as to leave ample room for courtland at the other and clasping her fingers over her knees looked demurely expectant  but let me hope that i am not disturbing you unseasonably said courtland catching sight of the fateful little slipper beneath her skirt and remembering the window i was so preoccupied in thinking of your aunt as the business manager of these estates that i quite forget that she might have a ladys hours for receiving  we havent got any company hours said miss sally and we havent just now any servants for company manners for were shorthanded in the fields and barns when yo came i was nailing up the laths for the vines outside because we couldnt spare carpenters from the factory but she added with a faint accession of mischief in her voice yo came to talk about the fahm  yes said courtland rising but not to interrupt the work on it will you let me help you nail up the laths on the wall i have some experience that way and we can talk as we work do oblige me  the young girl looked at him brightly  well now theres nothing mean about that yo mean it for sure  perfectly i shall feel so much less as if i was enjoying your company under false pretenses  yo just wait here then  she jumped from the sofa ran out of the room and returned presently tying the string of a long striped cotton blouseevidently an extra one of sophysbehind her back as she returned it was gathered under her oval chin by a tape also tied behind her while her fair hair was tucked under the usual red bandana handkerchief of the negro housemaid it is scarcely necessary to add that the effect was bewitching  but said miss sally eying her guests smartly fitting frockcoat yo ll spoil yor pooty clothes sure take off yor coatdont mind meand work in yor shirtsleeves  courtland obediently flung aside his coat and followed his active hostess through the french window to the platform outside above them a wooden ledge or cornice projecting several inches ran the whole length of the building it was on this that miss sally had evidently found a foothold while she was nailing up a trelliswork of laths between it and the windows of the second floor courtland found the ladder mounted to the ledge followed by the young girl who smilingly waived his proffered hand to help her up and the two gravely set to work but in the intervals of hammering and tying up the vines miss sallys tongue was not idle her talk was as fresh as quaint as original as herself and yet so practical and to the purpose of courtlands visit as to excuse his delight in it and her own fascinating propinquity whether she stopped to take a nail from between her pretty lips when she spoke to him or whether holding on perilously with one hand to the trellis while she gesticulated with the hammer pointing out the divisions of the plantation from her coign of vantage he thought she was as clear and convincing to his intellect as she was distracting to his senses  she told him how the war had broken up their old home in pineville sending her father to serve in the confederate councils of richmond and leaving her aunt and herself to manage the property alone how the estate had been devastated the house destroyed and how they had barely time to remove a few valuables how although she had always been opposed to secession and the war she had not gone north preferring to stay with her people and take with them the punishment of the folly she had foreseen how after the war and her fathers death she and her aunt had determined to reconstruct themselves after their own fashion on this bit of property which had survived their fortunes because it had always been considered valueless and unprofitable for negro labor how at first they had undergone serious difficulty through the incompetence and ignorance of the freed laborer and the equal apathy and prejudice of their neighbors how they had gradually succeeded with the adoption of new methods and ideas that she herself had conceived which she now briefly and clearly stated courtland listened with a new breathless and almost superstitious interest they were his own theoriesperfected and demonstrated  but you must have had capital for this  ah yes that was where they were fortunate there were some french cousins with whom she had once stayed in paris who advanced enough to stock the estate there were some english friends of her fathers old blockade runners who had taken shares provided them with more capital and imported some skilled laborers and a kind of steward or agent to represent them but they were getting on and perhaps it was better for their reputation with their neighbors that they had not been beholden to the noth seeing a cloud pass over courtlands face the young lady added with an affected sigh and the first touch of feminine coquetry which had invaded their wholesome camaraderie  yo ought to have found us out before connle  for an impulsive moment courtland felt like telling her then and there the story of his romantic quest but the reflection that they were standing on a narrow ledge with no room for the emotions and that miss sally had just put a nail in her mouth and a start might be dangerous checked him to this may be added a new jealousy of her previous experiences which he had not felt before nevertheless he managed to say with some effusion  but i hope we are not too late now i think my principals are quite ready and able to buy up any english or french investor now or to come  yo might try yo hand on that one said miss sally pointing to a young fellow who had just emerged from the office and was crossing the courtyard hes the english agent  he was squareshouldered and roundheaded fresh and clean looking in his white flannels but with an air of being utterly distinct and alien to everything around him and mentally and morally irreconcilable to it as he passed the house he glanced shyly at it his eye brightened and his manner became selfconscious as he caught sight of the young girl but changed again when he saw her companion courtland likewise was conscious of a certain uneasiness it was one thing to be helping miss sally alone but certainly another thing to be doing so under the eye of a stranger and i am afraid that he met the stony observation of the englishman with an equally cold stare miss sally alone retained her languid ease and selfpossession she called out wait a moment mr champney slipped lightly down the ladder and leaning against it with one foot on its lowest rung awaited his approach  i reckoned yo might be passing by she said as he came forward connle courtland with an explanatory wave of the hammer towards her companion who remained erect and slightly stiffened on the cornice is no relation to those figures along the frieze of the redlands court house but a nothn officer a friend of major reeds whos come down here to look after sothn property for some nothn capitalists mr champney she continued turning and lifting her eyes to courtland as she indicated champney with her hammer when he isnt talking english seeing english thinking english dressing english and wondering why god didnt make everything english is trying to do the same for his folks mr champney connle courtland connle courtland mr champney the two men bowed formally and now connle if yoll come down mr champney will show yo round the fahm when yo ve got through yoll find me here at work  courtland would have preferred and half looked for her company and commentary on this round of inspection but he concealed his disappointment and descended it did not exactly please him that champney seemed relieved and appeared to accept him as a bona fide stranger who could not possibly interfere with any confidential relations that he might have with miss sally nevertheless he met the englishmans offer to accompany him with polite gratitude and they left the house together  in less than an hour they returned it had not even taken that time for courtland to discover that the real improvements and the new methods had originated with miss sally that she was virtually the controlling influence there and that she was probably retarded rather than assisted by the oldfashioned and traditional conservatism of the company of which champney was steward it was equally plain however that the young fellow was dimly conscious of this and was frankly communicative about it  you see over there they work things in a different way and by jove they cant understand that there is any other dont you know theyre always wigging me as if i could help it although ive tried to explain the nigger business and all that dont you know they want miss dows to refer her plans to me and expect me to report on them and then theyll submit them to the board and wait for its decision fancy miss dows doing that but by jove they cant conceive of her at all over there dont you know  which miss dows do you mean asked courtland dryly  miss sally of course said the young fellow briskly she manages everythingher aunt included she can make those niggers work when no one else can a word or smile from her is enough she can make terms with dealers and contractorsher own terms toowhen they wont look at my figures by jove she even gets points out of those traveling agents and inventors dont you know who come along the road with patents and samples she got one of those lightningrod and wirefence men to show her how to put up an arbor for her trailing roses why when i first saw you up on the cornice i thought you were some other chap that shed askeddont you knowthat is at first of courseyou know what i meanha by jovebefore we were introduced dont you know  i think i offered to help miss dows said courtland with a quickness that he at once regretted  so did he dont you know miss sally does not ask anybody dont you see a fellow dont like to stand by and see a young lady like her doing such work vaguely aware of some infelicity in his speech he awkwardly turned the subject i dont think i shall stay here long myself  you expect to return to england asked courtland  oh no but i shall go out of the companys service and try my own hand theres a good bit of land about three miles from here thats in the market and i think i could make something out of it a fellow ought to settle down and be his own master he answered tentatively eh  but how will miss dows be able to spare you asked courtland uneasily conscious that he was assuming an indifference  oh im not much use to her dont you knowat least not here but i might if i had my own land and if we were neighbors i told you she runs the place no matter whos here or whose money is invested  i presume you are speaking now of young miss dows said courtland dryly  miss sallyof coursealways said champney simply she runs the shop  were there not some french investorsrelations of miss dows does anybody represent them asked courtland pointedly  yet he was not quite prepared for the naive change in his companions face no there was a sort of french cousin who used to be a good deal to the fore dont you know but i rather fancy he didnt come here to look after the property returned champney with a quick laugh i think the aunt must have written to his friends for they called him off and i dont think miss sally broke her heart about him shes not that sort of girleh she could have her pick of the state if she went in for that sort of thingeh  although this was exactly what courtland was thinking it pleased him to answer in a distrait sort of fashion certainly i should think so and to relapse into an apparently business abstraction  i think i wont go in continued champney as they neared the house again i suppose youll have something more to say to miss dows if theres anything else you want of me come to the office but shell know andererif youreerstaying long in this part of the country ride over and look me up dont you know and have a smoke and a julep i have a boy who knows how to mix them and ive some old brandy sent me from the other side goodby  more awkward in his kindliness than in his simple business confidences but apparently equally honest in both he shook courtlands hand and walked away courtland turned towards the house he had seen the farm and its improvements he had found some of his own ideas practically discounted clearly there was nothing left for him to do but to thank his hostess and take his leave but he felt far more uneasy than when he had arrived and there was a singular sense of incompleteness in his visit that he could not entirely account for his conversation with champney had complicatedhe knew not whyhis previous theories of miss dows and although he was half conscious that this had nothing to do with the business that brought him there he tried to think that it had if miss sally was reallyaadistracting element to contiguous man it was certainly something to be considered in a matter of business of which she would take a managerial part it was true that champney had said she was not that sort of girl but this was the testimony of one who was clearly under her influence he entered the house through the open french window the parlor was deserted he walked through the front hall and porch no one was there he lingered a few moments a slight chagrin beginning to mingle with his uneasiness she might have been on the lookout for him she or sophy must have seen him returning he would ring for sophy and leave his thanks and regrets for her mistress he looked for a bell touched it but on being confronted with sophy changed his mind and asked to see miss dows in the interval between her departure and the appearance of miss sally he resolved to do the very thing which he had dismissed from his thoughts but an hour before as illtimed and doubtful he had the photograph and letter in his pocket he would make them his excuse for personally taking leave of her  she entered with her fair eyebrows lifted in a pretty surprise  i declare to goodness i thought yo d ridden over to the red barn and gone home from there i got through my work on the vines earlier than i thought one of judge garrets nephews dropped in in time to help me with the last row yo neednt have troubled yoself to send up for me for mere company manners but sophy says yo looked sort of anxious and particular when yo asked for meso i suppose yo want to see me for something  mentally objurgating sophy and with an unpleasant impression in his mind of the unknown neighbor who had been helping miss sally in his place he nevertheless tried to collect himself gallantly  i dont know what my expression conveyed to sophy he said with a smile but i trust that what i have to tell you may be interesting enough to make you forget my second intrusion he paused and still smiling continued for more than three years miss dows you have more or less occupied my thoughts and although we have actually met today only for the first time i have during that time carried your image with me constantly even this meeting which was only the result of an accident i had been seeking for three years i find you here under your own peaceful vine and figtree and yet three years ago you came to me out of the thundercloud of battle  my good gracious said miss sally  she had been clasping her knee with her linked fingers but separated them and leaned backward on the sofa with affected consternation but an expression of growing amusement in her bright eyes courtland saw the mistake of his tone but it was too late to change it now he handed her the locket and the letter and briefly and perhaps a little more seriously recounted the incident that had put him in possession of them but he entirely suppressed the more dramatic and ghastly details and his own superstition and strange prepossession towards her  miss sally took the articles without a tremor or the least deepening or paling of the delicate faint suffusion of her cheek when she had glanced over the letter which appeared to be brief she said with smiling halfpitying tranquillity  yesit was that poor chet brooks sure i heard that he was killed at snake river it was just like him to rush in and get killed the first pop and all for nothing toopure foolishness  shocked yet relieved but uneasy under both sensations courtland went on blindly  but he was not the only one miss dows there was another man picked up who also had your picture  yesjoyce masterton they sent it to me but you didnt kill him too  i dont know that i personally killed either he said a little coldly he paused and continued with a gravity which he could not help feeling very inconsistent and even ludicrous they were brave men miss dows  to have worn my picture said miss sally brightly  to have thought they had so much to live for and yet to have willingly laid down their lives for what they believed was right  yo didnt go huntin me for three years to tell me a sothn girl that sothn men know how to fight did yo connle returned the young lady with the slightest lifting of her head and drooping of her blueveined lids in a divine hauteur they were always ready enough for that even among themselves it was much easier for these pooah boys to fight a thing out than think it out or work it out yo folks in the noth learned to do all three thats where you got the grip on us yo look surprised connle  i didnt expect you would look at itquite ininthat way said courtland awkwardly  i am sorry i disappointed yo after yo d taken such a heap o trouble returned the young lady with a puzzling assumption of humility as she rose and smoothed out her skirts but i couldnt know exactly what yo might be expecting after three years if i had i might have put on moning she stopped and adjusted a straying tendril of her hair with the sharp corner of the dead mans letter but i thank yo all the same connle it was real good in yo to think of toting these things over here and she held out her hand frankly  courtland took it with the sickening consciousness that for the last five minutes he had been an unconscionable ass he could not prolong the interview after she had so significantly risen if he had only taken his leave and kept the letter and locket for a later visit perhaps when they were older friends it was too late now he bent over her hand for a moment again thanked her for her courtesy and withdrew a moment later she heard the receding beat of his horses hoofs on the road  she opened the drawer of a brasshandled cabinet and after a moments critical survey of her picture in the dead mans locket tossed it and the letter into the recesses of the drawer then she stopped removed her little slipper from her foot looked at that too thoughtfully and called sophy  miss sally said the girl reappearing at the door  are you sure you did not move that ladder  i clare to goodness miss sally i never teched it  miss sally directed a critical glance at her handmaidens redcoifed head no she said to herself softly it felt nicer than wool anyway   chapter iii   in spite of the awkward termination of his visitor perhaps because of itcourtland called again at the plantation within the week but this time he was accompanied by drummond and was received by miss miranda dows a tall aquilinenosed spinster of fifty whose oldtime politeness had become slightly affected and whose old beliefs had given way to a halfcynical acceptance of new facts mr drummond delighted with the farm and its management was no less fascinated by miss sally while courtland was now discreet enough to divide his attentions between her and her aunt with the result that he was far from participating in champneys conviction of miss mirandas unimportance to the freedmen she still represented the old implacable taskmistress and it was evident that they superstitiously believed that she still retained a vague power of overriding the fourteenth amendment at her pleasure and was only to be restrained by the mediation of the goodhumored and sensible miss sally courtland was quick to see the value of this influence in the transition state of the freedmen and pointed it out to his principal drummonds previous doubts and skepticism already weakened by miss sallys fascinations vanished entirely at this prospect of beneficially utilizing these lingering evils of slavery he was convinced he was even enthusiastic the foreign investors were men to be bought out the estate improved and enlarged by the company and the fair owners retained in the management and control like most prejudiced men drummonds conversion was sudden and extreme and being a practical man was at once acted upon at a second and third interview the preliminaries were arranged and in three weeks from courtlands first visit the dows plantation and part of major reeds were merged in the drummond syndicate and placed beyond financial uncertainty courtland remained to represent the company as superintendent at redlands and with the transfer of the english investments champney retired as he had suggested to a smaller venture of his own on a plantation a few miles distant which the company had been unable to secure  during this interval courtland had frequent interviews with miss sally and easy and unrestrained access to her presence he had never again erred on the side of romance or emotion he had never again referred to the infelix letter and photograph and without being obliged to confine himself strictly to business affairs he had maintained an even quiet neighborly intercourse with her much of this was the result of his own selfcontrol and soldierly training and gave little indication of the deeper feeling that he was conscious lay beneath it at times he caught the young girls eyes fixed upon him with a mischievous curiosity a strange thrill went through him there are few situations so subtle and dangerous as the accidental confidences and understandings of two young people of opposite sex even though the question of any sentimental inclination be still in abeyance courtland knew that miss sally remembered the too serious attitude he had taken towards her past she might laugh at it and even resent it but she knew it remembered it knew that he did and this precious knowledge was confined to themselves it was in their minds when there was a pause in their more practical and conventional conversation and was even revealed in the excessive care which miss sally later took to avert at the right moment her mischievously smiling eyes once she went farther courtland had just finished explaining to her a plan for substituting small farm buildings for the usual halfcultivated gardenpatches dear to the negro fieldhand and had laid down the drawings on the table in the office when the young lady leaning against it with her hands behind her fixed her bright gray eyes on his serious face  i vow and protest connle she said dropping into one of the quaint survivals of an oldtime phraseology peculiar to her people i never allowed yo could just give yoself up to business soul and body as yo do when i first met yo that day  why what did you think me he asked quickly  miss sally who had a southern aptitude for gesture took one little hand from behind her twirled it above her head with a pretty air of disposing of some airy nothing in a presumably masculine fashion and said oh that  i am afraid i did not impress you then as a very practical man he said with a faint color  i thought you roosted rather high connle to pick up many worms in the moning but she added with a dazzling smile i reckon from what yo said about the photograph yo thought i wasnt exactly what yo believed i ought to be either  he would have liked to tell her then and there that he would have been content if those bright beautiful eyes had never kindled with anything but love or womanly aspiration that that soft lazy caressing voice had never been lifted beyond the fireside or domestic circle that the sunny tendriled hair and pink ears had never inclined to anything but whispered admiration and that the graceful lithe erect figure so independent and selfcontained had been satisfied to lean only upon his arm for support he was conscious that this had been in his mind when he first saw her he was equally conscious that she was more bewilderingly fascinating to him in her present inaccessible intelligence and practicality  i confess he said looking into her eyes with a vague smile i did not expect you would be so forgetful of some one who had evidently cared for you  meaning mr chet brooks or mr joyce masterton or both thats like most yo men connle yo reckon because a girl pleases yo she ought to be grateful all her lifeand yors too yo think different now but yo neednt act up to it quite so much she made a little deprecating gesture with her disengaged hand as if to ward off any retaliating gallantry i aint speaking for myself connle yo and me are good enough friends but the girls round here think yo re a trifle too much taken up with rice and niggers and looking at it even in yor light connle it aint business yo want to keep straight with major reed so it would be just as well to square the majors woman folks tavy and gussie reed aint exactly poisonous connle and yo might see one or the other home from church next sunday the sunday after that just to show yo aint particular and that yo go in for being a regular beau yo might walk home with me dont be frightenedive got a better gown than this its a new one just come home from louisville and ill wear it for the occasion  he did not dare to say that the quaint frock she was then wearinga plain checked household gingham used for childrens pinafores with its ribbons of the same pattern gathered in bows at the smart apron pocketshad become a part of her beauty for he was already hopelessly conscious that she was lovely in anything and he might be impelled to say so he thanked her gravely and earnestly but without gallantry or effusion and had the satisfaction of seeing the mischief in her eyes increase in proportion to his seriousness and heard her say with affected concern bear up connle dont let it worry yo till the time comes and took his leave  on the following sunday he was present at the redlands episcopal church and after the service stood with outward composure but some inward chafing among the gallant youth who after the local fashion had ranged themselves outside the doors of the building he was somewhat surprised to find mr champney evidently as much out of place as himself but less selfcontained waiting in the crowd of expectant cavaliers although convinced that the young englishman had come only to see miss sally he was glad to share his awkward isolation with another stranger and greeted him pleasantly the dows pew being nearer to the entrance than the reeds gave up its occupants first colonel courtland lifted his hat to miss miranda and her niece at the same moment that champney moved forward and ranged himself beside them miss sally catching courtlands eye showed the whites of her own in a backward glance of mischievous significance to indicate the following reeds when they approached courtland joined them and finding himself beside miss octavia entered into conversation apparently the suppressed passion and sardonic melancholy of that darkeyed young lady spurred him to a lighter gayer humor even in proportion as miss sallys goodnatured levity and sunny practicality always made him serious they presently fell to the rear with other couples and were soon quite alone  a little haughty but tall and erect in her wellpreserved black grenadine dress which gave her the appearance of a youthful but implacable widow miss reed declared she had not seen the connle for a coons age and certainly had not expected to have the honor of his company as long as there were niggers to be elevated or painted to look like white men she hoped that he and paw and sally dows were happy they hadnt yet got so far as to put up a nigger preacher in the place of mr symes their rector but she understood that there was some talk of running hannibal johnsonmiss dows coachmanfor county judge next year no she had not heard that the connle himself had thought of running for the office he might laugh at her as much as he likedhe seemed to be in better spirits than when she first saw himonly she would like to know if it was nothn style to laugh coming home from church of course if it was she would have to adopt it with the fourteenth amendment but just now she noticed the folks were staring at them and miss sally dows had turned round to look nevertheless miss octavias sallow cheek nearest the colonelthe sunny sidehad taken a faint brunettes flush and the corners of her proud mouth were slightly lifted  but candidly miss reed dont you think that you would prefer to have old hannibal whom you know as county judge than a stranger and a northern man like me  miss reeds dark eyes glanced sideways at the handsome face and elegant figure beside her something like a saucy smile struggled to her thin lips  there mightnt be much to choose connle  i admit it we should both acknowledge our mistress and be like wax in her hands  yo ought to make that pooty speech to sally dows shes generally mistress around here but she added suddenly fixing her eyes on him how does it happen that yo aint walking with her instead of that englishman yo know that its as plain as day that he took that land over there just to be near her when he was no longer agent  but courtland was always master of himself and quite at ease regarding miss sally when not in that ladys presence you forget he said smilingly that im still a stranger and knew little of the local gossip and if i did know it i am afraid we didnt bargain to buy up with the land mr champneys personal interest in the landlady  yo d have had your hands full for i reckon shes pooty heavily mortgaged in that fashion already returned miss reed with mere badinage than spitefulness in the suggestion and mr champney was run pooty close by a french cousin of hers when he was here yo havent got any french books to lend me connlehave yo paw says you read a heap of french and i find it mighty hard to keep up my practice since i left the convent at st louis for paw dont knew what sort of books to order and i reckon he makes awful mistakes sometimes  the conversation here turning upon polite literature it appeared that miss octavias french reading through a shy proud innocence and an imperfect knowledge of the wicked subtleties of the language was somewhat broad and unconventional for a young lady courtland promised to send her some books and even ventured to suggest some american and english novels not intensely nothn nor metaphysicalaccording to the accepted southern beliefs a new respect and pitying interest in this sullen solitary girl cramped by tradition and bruised rather than enlightened by sad experiences came over him he found himself talking quite confidentially to the lifted head arched eyebrows and aquiline nose beside him and even thinking what a handsome highbred brother she might have been to some one when they had reached the house in compliance with the familiar custom he sat down on one of the lower steps of the veranda while she shaking out her skirt took a seat a step or two above him this enabled him after the languid local fashion to lean on his elbow and gaze up into the eyes of the young lady while she with equal languor looked down upon him but in the present instance miss reed leaned forward suddenly and darting a sharp quick glance into his very consciousness said  and yo mean to say connle theres nothing between yo and sally dows  courtland neither flushed trembled grew confused nor prevaricated  we are good friends i think he replied quietly without evasion or hesitation  miss reed looked at him thoughtfully i reckon that is soand no more and thats why yo ve been so lucky in everything she said slowly  i dont think i quite understand returned courtland smiling is this a paradoxor a consolation  its the truth said miss reed gravely those who try to be anything more to sally dows lose their luck  that isare rejected by her is she really so relentless continued courtland gayly  i mean that they lose their luck in everything something is sure to happen and she cant help it either  is this a sibylline warning miss reed  no its nigger superstition it came from mammy judy sallys old nurse its part of their regular hoodoo she bewitched miss sally when she was a baby so that everybody is bound to her as long as they care for her and she isnt bound to them in any way all their luck goes to her as soon as the spell is on them she added darkly  i think i know the rest returned courtland with still greater solemnity you gather the buds of the witchhazel in april when the moon is full you then pluck three hairs from the young ladys right eyebrow when she isnt looking  yo can laugh connle for yo re luckybecause yo re free  im not so sure of that he said gallantly for i ought to be riding at this moment over to the infirmary to visit my sunday sick if being made to pleasantly forget ones time and duty is a sign of witchcraft i am afraid mammy judys enchantments were not confined to only one southern young lady  the sound of quick footsteps on the gravel path caused them both to look up a surly looking young fellow ostentatiously booted and spurred and carrying a heavy rawhide ridingwhip in his swinging hand was approaching them deliberately yet with uneasy selfconsciousness ignoring the presence of courtland he nodded abruptly to miss reed ascended the steps brushed past them both without pausing and entered the house  is that yor manners mr tom called the young lady after him a slight flush rising to her sallow cheek the young man muttered something from the hall which courtland did not catch its cousin tom higbee she explained half disdainfully hes had some ugliness with his horse i reckon but paw ought to teach him how to behave andi dont think he likes nothn men she added gravely  courtland who had kept his temper with his full understanding of the intruders meaning smiled as he took miss reeds hand in parting thats quite enough explanation and i dont know why it shouldnt be even an apology  yet the incident left little impression on him as he strolled back to redlands it was not the first time he had tasted the dregs of former sectional hatred in incivility and discourtesy but as it seldom came from his old personal antagoniststhe soldiersand was confined to the callow youth previous noncombatants and politicians he could afford to overlook it he did not see miss sally during the following week   chapter iv   on the next sunday he was early at church but he had perhaps accented the occasion by driving there in a light buggy behind a fast thoroughbred possibly selected more to the taste of a smart cavalry officer than an agricultural superintendent he was already in a side pew his eyes dreamily fixed on the prayerbook ledge before him when there was a rustle at the church door and a thrill of curiosity and admiration passed over the expectant congregation it was the entrance of the dows party miss sally well to the fore she was in her new clothes the latest fashion in louisville the latest but two in paris and new york  it was over twenty years ago i shall not imperil the effect of that lovely vision by recalling to the eye of today a fashion of yesterday enough that it enabled her to set her sweet face and vapory golden hair in a horseshoe frame of delicate flowers and to lift her oval chin out of a bewildering mist of tulle nor did a certain light polonaise conceal the outlines of her charming figure even those who were constrained to whisper to each other that miss sally must be now going on twentyfive did so because she still carried the slender graces of seventeen the organ swelled as if to welcome her as she took her seat a ray of sunlight that would have been cruel and searching to any other complexion drifted across the faint pink of her cheeks and nestling in her nebulous hair became itself transfigured a few stainedglass virtues on the windows did not come out of this effulgence as triumphantly and it was small wonder that the devotional eyes of the worshipers wandered from them to the face of sally dows  when the service was over as the congregation filed slowly into the aisle courtland slipped mutely behind her as she reached the porch he said in an undertone  i brought my horse and buggy i thought you might possibly allow me to drivebut he was stopped by a distressful knitting of her golden brows no she said quickly but firmly you must notit wont do as courtland hesitated in momentary perplexity she smiled sweetly well walk round by the cemetery if you like it will take about as long as a drive courtland vanished gave hurried instructions and a dollar to a lounging negro and rejoined miss sally as the delighted and proud freedman drove out of the gate miss sally heaved a slight sigh as the gallant equipage passed it was a mighty pooty turnout connle and id have just admired to go but it would have been rather hard on the other folks theres the reeds and maxwells and robertsons that are too pooah to keep blood horses and too proud to ride behind anything else it wouldnt be the right thing for us to go whirling by scattering our dust over them there was something so subtly pleasant in this implied partnership of responsibility that courtland forgot the abrupt refusal and thought only of the tact that prompted it nevertheless here a spell seemed to fall upon his usually ready speech now that they were together for the first time in a distinctly social fashion he found himself vacantly meaninglessly silent content to walk beside this charming summery presence brushed by its delicate draperies and inhaling its freshness presently it spoke  it would take more than a thousand feet of lumber to patch up the cowsheds beyond the moseley pasture and an entirely new building with an improved dairy would require only about two thousand more all the old material would come in good for fencing and could be used with the new post and rails dont yo think it would be better to have an outandout new building  yes certainly returned courtland a little confusedly he had not calculated upon this practical conversation and was the more disconcerted as they were passing some of the other couples who had purposely lingered to overhear them  and continued the young girl brightly the freight question is getting to be a pretty serious one aunt miranda holds some shares in the briggsville branch line and thinks something could be done with the directors for a new tariff of charges if she put a pressure on them tyler says that there was some talk of their reducing it one sixteenth per cent before we move this years crop  courtland glanced quickly at his companions face it was grave but there was the faintest wrinkling of the corner of the eyelid nearest him had we not better leave these serious questions until tomorrow he said smiling  miss sally opened her eyes demurely why yo seemed so quiet i reckoned yo must be full of business this morning but if yo prefer company talk well change the subject they say that yo and miss reed didnt have much trouble to find one last sunday she dont usually talk much but she keeps up a power of thinking i should reckon she added suddenly eying him critically that yo and she might have a heap o things to say to each other shes a good deal in yo fashion connle she dont forget butmore slowlyi dont know that thats altogether the best thing for yo  courtland lifted his eyes with affected consternation if this is in the light of another mysterious warning miss dows i warn you that my intellect is already tottering with them last sunday miss reed thrilled me for an hour with superstition and cassandralike prophecy dont things ever happen accidentally here and without warning  i mean returned the young lady with her usual practical directness that tave reed remembers a good many horrid things about the wah that she ought to forget but dont but she continued looking at him curiously she allows she was mighty cut up by her cousins manner to yo  i am afraid that miss reed was more annoyed than i was said courtland i should be very sorry if she attached any importance to it he added earnestly  and yo dont continued miss sally  no why should i she noticed however that he had slightly drawn himself up a little more erect and she smiled as he continued i dare say i should feel as he does if i were in his place  but yo wouldnt do anything underhanded she said quietly as he glanced at her quickly she added dryly dont trust too much to people always acting in yo fashion connle and dont think too much nor too little of what yo hear here yo re just the kind of man to make a good many silly enemies and as many foolish friends and i dont know which will give yo the most trouble only dont yo underrate either or hold yo head so high yo dont see whats crawlin around yo thats why in a copperhead swamp a horse is bitten oftener than a hog  she smiled yet with knitted brows and such a pretty affectation of concern for her companion that he suddenly took heart  i wish i had one friend i could call my own he said boldly looking straight into her eyes id care little for other friends and fear no enemies  yo re right connle she said ostentatiously slanting her parasol in a marvelous simulation of hiding a purely imaginative blush on a cheek that was perfectly infantine in its unchanged pink company talk is much pootier than what weve been saying andmeaning mefor i reckon yo wouldnt say that of any other girl but the one yo re walking withwhats the matter with me  he could not help smiling though he hesitated nothing but others have been disappointed  and that bothers yo  i mean i have as yet had no right to put your feelings to any test while  poor chet had yo were going to say well here we are at the cemetery i reckoned yo were bound to get back to the dead again before wed gone far and thats why i thought we might take the cemetery on our way it may put me in a more proper frame of mind to please yo  as he raised his eyes he could not repress a slight start he had not noticed before that they had passed through a small gateway on diverging from the road and was quite unprepared to find himself on the edge of a gentle slope leading to a beautiful valley and before him a long vista of tombs white headstones and low crosses edged by drooping cypress and trailing feathery vines some vines had fallen and been caught in long loops from bough to bough like funeral garlands and here and there the tops of isolated palmettos lifted a cluster of hearselike plumes yet in spite of this dominance of sombre but graceful shadow the drooping delicacy of darktasseled foliage and leafy fringes and the waving mourning veils of gray translucent moss a glorious vivifying southern sun smiled and glittered everywhere as through tears the balm of bay southernwood pine and syringa breathed through the long alleys the stimulating scent of roses moved with every zephyr and the closer odors of jessamine honeysuckle and orange flowers hung heavily in the hollows it seemed to courtland like the mourning of beautiful and youthful widowhood seductive even in its dissembling trappings provocative in the contrast of its own still strong virility everywhere the grass grew thick and luxuriant the quick earth was teeming with the germination of the dead below  they moved slowly along side by side speaking only of the beauty of the spot and the glory of that summer day which seemed to have completed its perfection here perhaps from the heat the overpowering perfume or some unsuspected sentiment the young lady became presently as silent and preoccupied as her companion she began to linger and loiter behind hovering like a butterfly over some flowering shrub or clustered sheaf of lilies until encountered suddenly in her floating draperies she might have been taken for a somewhat early and far too becoming ghost it seemed to him also that her bright eyes were slightly shadowed by a gentle thoughtfulness he moved close to her side with an irresistible impulse of tenderness but she turned suddenly and saying come moved at a quicker pace down a narrow side path courtland followed he had not gone far before he noticed that the graves seemed to fall into regular lines the emblems became cheaper and more common wooden head and foot stones of one monotonous pattern took the place of carved freestone or marble and he knew that they had reached that part of the cemetery reserved for those who had fallen in the war the long lines drawn with military precision stretched through the little valley and again up the opposite hill in an odd semblance of hollow squares ranks and columns a vague recollection of the fateful slope of snake river came over him it was intensified as miss sally who was still preceding him suddenly stopped before an isolated mound bearing a broken marble shaft and a pedestal with the inscription chester brooks a few withered garlands and immortelles were lying at its base but encircling the broken shaft was a perfectly fresh unfaded wreath  you never told me he was buried here said courtland quickly half shocked at the unexpected revelation was he from this state  no but his regiment was said miss sally eying the wreath critically  and this wreath is it from you continued courtland gently  yes i thought yo d like to see something fresh and pooty instead of those stale ones  and were they also from you he asked even more gently  dear no they were left over from last anniversary day by some of the veterans thats the only one i put therethat isi got mr champney to leave it here on his way to his house he lives just yonder yo know  it was impossible to resist this invincible naivete courtland bit his lip as the vision arose before him of this still more naif english admirer bringing hither at miss sallys bidding the tribute which she wished to place on the grave of an old lover to please a third man meantime she had put her two little hands behind her back in the simulated attitude of a good girl and was saying half smilingly and he even thought half wistfully  are yo satisfied  perfectly  then lets go away its mighty hot here  they turned away and descending the slope again reentered the thicker shade of the main avenue here they seemed to have left the sterner aspect of death they walked slowly the air was heavy with the hot incense of flowers the road sinking a little left a grassy bank on one side here miss sally halted and listlessly seated herself motioning courtland to do the same he obeyed eagerly the incident of the wreath had troubled him albeit with contending sensations she had given it to please him why should he question the manner or torment himself with any retrospective thought he would have given worlds to have been able to accept it lightly or gallantlywith any other girl he could but he knew he was trembling on the verge of a passionate declaration the magnitude of the stake was too great to be imperiled by a levity of which she was more a mistress than himself and he knew that his sentiment had failed to impress her his pride kept him from appealing to her strangely practical nature although he had recognized and accepted it and had even begun to believe it an essential part of the strong fascination she had over him but being neither a coward nor a weak hesitating idealist when he deliberately took his seat beside her he as deliberately made up his mind to accept his fate whatever it might be then and there  perhaps there was something of this in his face i thought yo were looking a little white connle she said quietly and i reckoned we might sit down a spell and then take it slowly home yo aint accustomed to the sothn sun and the air in the hollow was swampy as he made a slight gesture of denial she went on with a pretty sisterly superiority thats the way of yo nothn men yo think yo can do everything just as if yo were reared to it and yo never make allowance for different climates different blood and different customs thats where yo slip up  but he was already leaning towards her with his dark earnest eyes fixed upon her in a way she could no longer mistake at the risk of slipping up again miss dows he said gently dropping into her dialect with utterly unconscious flattery i am going to ask you to teach me everything you wish to be all that you demandwhich would be far better you have said we were good friends i want you to let me hope to be more i want you to overlook my deficiencies and the differences of my race and let me meet you on the only level where i can claim to be the equal of your own peoplethat of loving you give me only the same chance you gave the other poor fellow who sleeps yonderthe same chance you gave the luckier man who carried the wreath for you to put upon his grave  she had listened with delicately knitted brows the faintest touch of color and a halflaughing halfsuperior disapprobation when he had finished she uttered a plaintive little sigh yo oughtnt to have said that connle but yo and me are too good friends to let even that stand between us and to prove it to yo im going to forget it right awayand so are yo  but i cannot he said quickly if i could i should be unworthy of even your friendship if you must reject it do not make me feel the shame of thinking you believe me capable of wanton trifling i know that this avowal is abrupt to you but it is not to me you have known me only for three months but these three months have been to me the realization of three years dreaming as she remained looking at him with bright curious eyes but still shaking her fair head distressedly he moved nearer and caught her hand in the little pale lilac thread glove that was nevertheless too wide for her small fingers and said appealingly but why should you forget it why must it be a forbidden topic what is the barrier are you no longer free speak miss dowsgive me some hope miss dowssally  she had drawn herself away distressed protesting her fair head turned aside until with a slight twist and narrowing of her hand she succeeded in slipping it from the glove which she left a prisoner in his eager clasp there yo can keep the glove connle she said breathing quickly sit down this is not the place nor the weather for husking frolics wellyo want to know why yo mustnt speak to me in that way be still and ill tell yo  she smoothed down the folds of her frock sitting sideways on the bank one little foot touching the road yo mustnt speak that way to me she went on slowly because its as much as yo companys woth as much as our propertys woth as much maybe as yo lifes woth dont lift yo comb connle if you dont care for that others may sit still i tell yo well yo come here from the noth to run this property for moneythats square and fair business that any fool here can understandits nothn style it dont interfere with these fools family affairs it dont bring into their blood any nothn taint it dont divide their clannishness it dont separate father and son sister and brother and even if yo got a foothold here and settled down they know they can always outvote yo five to one but let these same fools know that yo re courtin a sothn girl known to be union during the wah that girl who has laughed at their foolishness let them even think that he wants that girl to mix up the family and the race and the property for him and there aint a young or old fool that believes in sothn isolation as the price of sothn salvation that wouldnt rise against yo there isnt one that wouldnt make shipwreck of yor syndicate and yor capital and the prosperity of redlands for the next four years to come and think they were doing right they began to suspect yo from the first they suspected yo when yo never went anywhere but stuck close to the fahm and me thats why i wanted yo to show yourself among the girls they wouldnt have minded yo flirting with them with the chance of yo breaking yo heart over tave reed or lympy morris theyre fools enough to believe that a snub or a jilt from a sothn girl would pay them back for a lost battle or a ruined plantation  for the first time miss sally saw courtlands calm blood fly to his cheek and kindle in his eye you surely do not expect me to tolerate this blind and insolent interference he said rising to his feet  she lifted her ungloved hand in deprecation sit still connle yo ve been a soldier and yo know what duty is well whats yo duty to yo company  it neither includes my private affairs nor regulates the beating of my heart i will resign  and leave me and aunt miranda and the plantation  no the company will find another superintendent to look after your aunts affairs and carry out our plans and you sallyyou will let me find you a home and fortune north there is work for me there there is room for you among my people  she shook her head slowly with a sweet but superior smile no connle i didnt believe in the wah but the least i could do was to stand by my folks and share the punishment that i knew was coming from it i despise this foolishness as much as yo but i cant run away from it come connle i wont ask yo to forget this mo ill even believe yo meant it but yo ll promise me yo wont speak of it again as long as yo are with the company and aunt miranda and me there mustnt be morethere mustnt even seem to be morebetween us  but then i may hope he said eagerly grasping her hand  i promise nothing for yo must not even have that excuse for speaking of this again either from anything i do or may seem to do she stopped released her hand as her eyes were suddenly fixed on the distance then she said with a slight smile but without the least embarrassment or impatience theres mr champney coming here now i reckon hes looking to see if that wreath is safe  courtland looked up quickly he could see the straw hat of the young englishman just above the myrtle bushes in a path intersecting the avenue a faint shadow crossed his face let me know one thing more he said hurriedly i know i have no right to ask the question but hashashas mr champney anything to do with your decision  she smiled brightly yo asked just now if yo could have the same chance he and chet brooks had well poor chet is dead and mr champneywellwait and see she lifted her voice and called mr champney the young fellow came briskly towards them his face betrayed a slight surprise but no discomfiture as he recognized her companion  oh mr champney said miss sally plaintively ive lost my glove somewhere near pooah brookss tomb in the hollow wont you go and fetch it and come back here to take me home the connle has got to go and see his sick niggers in the hospital champney lifted his hat nodded genially to courtland and disappeared below the cypresses on the slope yo mustnt be mad she said turning in explanation to her companion but we have been here too long already and its better that i should be seen coming home with him than yo  then this sectional interference does not touch him said courtland bitterly  no hes an englishman his father was a known friend of the confederacy and bought their cotton bonds  she stopped gazing into courtlands face with a pretty vague impatience and a slight pouting of her lip  connle  miss sally  yo say yo had known me for three years before yo saw me well we met once before we ever spoke to each other  courtland looked in her laughing eyes with admiring wonder when he asked  the first day yo came yo moved the ladder when i was on the cornice and i walked all ever yo head and like a gentleman yo never said a word about it i reckon i stood on yo head for five minutes  not as long as that said courtland laughing if i remember rightly  yes said miss sally with dancing eyes i a sothn girl actually set my foot on the head of a nothn scum of a connle my  let that satisfy your friends then  no i want to apologize sit down connle  but miss sally  sit down quick  he did so seating himself sideways on the bank miss sally stood beside him  take off yo hat sir  he obeyed smilingly miss sally suddenly slipped behind him he felt the soft touch of her small hands on his shoulders warm breath stirred the roots of his hair and thenthe light pressure on his scalp of what seemed the lips of a child  he leaped to his feet yet before he could turn completely rounda difficulty the young lady had evidently calculated uponhe was too late the floating draperies of the artful and shameless miss sally were already disappearing among the tombs in the direction of the hollow   chapter v   the house occupied by the manager of the drummond syndicate in redlandsthe former residence of a local lawyer and justice of the peacewas not large but had an imposing portico of wooden doric columns which extended to the roof and fronted the main street the allpervading creeper closely covered it the sidewalk before it was shaded by a row of broadleaved ailantus the front room with french windows opening on the portico was used by colonel courtland as a general office beyond this a sittingroom and diningroom overlooked the oldfashioned garden with its detached kitchen and inevitable negro cabin it was a close evening there were dark clouds coming up in the direction of the turnpike road but the leaves of the ailantus hung heavy and motionless in the hush of an impending storm the sparks of lazily floating fireflies softly expanded and went out in the gloom of the black foliage or in the dark recesses of the office whose windows were widely open and whose lights courtland had extinguished when he brought his armchair to the portico for coolness one of these sparks beyond the fence although alternately glowing and paling was still so persistent and stationary that courtland leaned forward to watch it more closely at which it disappeared and a voice from the street said  is that you courtland  yes come in wont you  the voice was champneys and the light was from his cigar as he opened the gate and came slowly up the steps of the portico the usual hesitation of his manner seemed to have increased a long sigh trilled the limp leaves of the ailantus and as quickly subsided a few heavy perpendicular raindrops crashed and spattered through the foliage like molten lead  youve just escaped the shower said courtland pleasantly he had not seen champney since they parted in the cemetery six weeks before  yesii thought id like to have a little talk with you courtland said champney he hesitated a moment before the proffered chair and then added with a cautious glance towards the street hadnt we better go inside  as you like but youll find it wofully hot were quite alone here theres nobody in the house and this shower will drive any loungers from the street he was quite frank although their relations to each other in regard to miss sally were still so undefined as to scarcely invite his confidence  howbeit champney took the proffered chair and the glass of julep which courtland brought him  you remember my speaking to you of dumont he said hesitatingly miss dows french cousin you know wellhes coming here hes got property herethose three houses opposite the court house from what i hear hes come over with a lot of newfangled french ideas on the nigger questionrot about equality and fraternity dont you knowand the highest education and highest offices for them you know what the feeling is here already you know what happened at the last election at coolidgevillehow the whites wouldnt let the niggers go to the polls and the jolly row that was kicked up over it well it looks as if that sort of thing might happen here dont you know if miss dows takes up these ideas  but ive reason to supposei mean said courtland correcting himself with some deliberation that any one who knows miss dows opinions knows that these are not her views why should she take them up  because she takes him up returned champney hurriedly and even if she didnt believe in them herself shed have to share the responsibility with him in the eyes of every unreconstructed rowdy like tom higbee and the rest of them theyd make short work of her niggers all the same  but i dont see why she should be made responsible for the opinions of her cousin nor do i exactly knew what taking him up means returned courtland quietly  champney moistened his dry lips with the julep and uttered a nervous laugh suppose we say her husbandfor thats what his coming back here means everybody knows that you would too if you ever talked with her about anything but business  a bright flash of lightning that lit up the faces of the two men would have revealed champneys flushed features and courtlands lack of color had they been looking at each other but they were not and the long reverberating crash of thunder which followed prevented any audible reply from courtland and covered his agitation  for without fully accepting champneys conclusions he was cruelly shocked at the young mans utterance of them he had scrupulously respected the wishes of miss sally and had faithfullyalthough never hopelesslyheld back any expression of his own love since their conversation in the cemetery but while his native truthfulness and sense of honor had overlooked the seeming insincerity of her attitude towards champney he had never justified his own tacit participation in it and the concealment of his own pretensions before his possible rival it was true that she had forbidden him to openly enter the lists with her admirers but champneys innocent assumption of his indifference to her and his consequent half confidences added poignancy to his story there seemed to be only one way to extricate himself and that was by a quarrel whether he did or did not believe champneys story whether it was only the jealous exaggeration of a rival or miss sally was actually deceiving them both his position had become intolerable  i must remind you champney he said with freezing deliberation that miss miranda dows and her niece now represent the drummond company equally with myself and that you cannot expect me to listen to any reflections upon the way they choose to administer their part in its affairs either now or to come still less do i care to discuss the idle gossip which can affect only the private interests of these ladies with which neither you nor i have any right to interfere  but the naivete of the young englishman was as invincible as miss sallys own and as fatal to courtlands attitude of course i havent any right you know he said calmly ignoring the severe preamble of his companions speech but i say hang it all even if a fellow has no chance himself he dont like to see a girl throw herself and her property away on a man like that  one moment champney said courtland under the infection of his guests simplicity abandoning his former superior attitude you say you have no chance do you want me to understand that you are regularly a suitor of miss dows  yees said the young fellow but with the hesitation of conscientiousness rather than evasion that isyou know i was but dont you see it couldnt be it wouldnt do you know if those clannish neighbors of hersthat southern setsuspected that miss sally was courted by an englishman dont you knowa poacher on their preservesit would be all up with her position on the property and her influence over them i dont mind telling you thats one reason why i left the company and took that other plantation but even that didnt work they had their suspicions excited already  did miss dows give that as a reason for declining your suit asked courtland slowly  yes you know what a straightforward girl she is she didnt come no rot about not expecting anything of the kind or about being a sister to me and all that for by jove shes always more like a fellows sister dont you know than his girl of course it was hard lines for me but i suppose she was about right he stopped and then added with a kind of gentle persistency you think she was about right dont you  with what was passing in courtlands mind the question seemed so bitterly ironical that at first he leaned half angrily forward in an unconscious attempt to catch the speakers expression in the darkness i should hardly venture to give an opinion he said after a pause miss dows relations with her neighbors are so very peculiar and from what you tell me of her cousin it would seem that her desire to placate them is not always to be depended upon  im not finding fault with her you know said champney hastily im not such a beastly cad as that i wouldnt have spoken of my affairs at all but you asked you know i only thought if she was going to get herself into trouble on account of that frenchman you might talk to hershed listen to you because shed know you only did it out of business reasons and theyre really business reasons you know i suppose you dont think much of my business capacity colonel and you wouldnt go much on my judgmentespecially now but ive been here longer than you andhe lowered his voice slightly and dragged his chair nearer courtlandi dont like the looks of things here theres some devilment plotting among those rascals theyre only awaiting an opportunity a single flash would be enough to set them in a blaze even if the fire wasnt lit and smouldering already like a spark in a bale of cotton id cut the whole thing and clear out if i didnt think it would make it harder for miss dows who would be left alone  youre a good fellow champney said courtland laying his hand on the young mans shoulder with a sudden impulse and i forgive you for overlooking any concern that i might have indeed he added with an odd seriousness and a half sigh its not strange that you should but i must remind you that the dowses are strictly the agents and tenants of the company i represent and that their rights and property under that tenancy shall not be interfered with by others as long as i am here i have no right however he added gravely to keep miss dows from imperiling them by her social relations  champney rose and shook hands with him awkwardly the shower seems to be holding up he said and ill toddle along before it starts afresh goodnight i sayyou didnt mind my coming to you this way did you by jove i thought you were a little standoffish at first but you know what i meant  perfectly and i thank you they shook hands again champney stepped from the portico and reaching the gate seemed to vanish as he had come out of the darkness  the storm was not yet over the air had again become close and suffocating courtland remained brooding in his chair whether he could accept champneys news as true or not he felt that he must end this suspense at once a halfguilty consciousness that he was thinking more of it in reference to his own passion than his duty to the company did not render his meditations less unpleasant yet while he could not reconcile miss sallys confidences in the cemetery concerning the indifference of her people to champneys attentions with what champney had just told him of the reasons she had given him for declining them i am afraid he was not shocked by her peculiar ethics a lover seldom finds fault with his mistress for deceiving his rival and is as little apt to consider the logical deduction that she could deceive him also as othello was to accept brabantios warning the masculine sense of honor which might have resented the friendship of a man capable of such treachery did not hesitate to accept the love of a woman under the same conditions perhaps there was an implied compliment in thus allowing her to take the sole ethical responsibility which few women would resist  in the midst of this gloomy abstraction courtland suddenly raised his head and listened  cato  yes sah  there was a sound of heavy footsteps in the hall coming from the rear of the house and presently a darker bulk appeared in the shadowed doorway it was his principal overseera strong and superior negro selected by his fellowfreedmen from among their number in accordance with courtlands new regime  did you come here from the plantation or the town  the town sah  i think you had better keep out of the town in the evenings for the present said courtland in a tone of quiet but positive authority  are dey goin to bring back de ole patter rollers sah asked the man with a slight sneer        the patrol or local police who formerly had the      surveillance of slaves  i dont know returned courtland calmly ignoring his overseers manner but if they did you must comply with the local regulations unless they conflict with the federal laws when you must appeal to the federal authorities i prefer you should avoid any trouble until you are sure  i reckon they wont try any games on me said the negro with a short laugh  courtland looked at him intently  i thought as much youre carrying arms cato hand them over  the overseer hesitated for a moment and then unstrapped a revolver from his belt and handed it to courtland  now how many of you are in the habit of going round the town armed like this  only de men whove been insulted sah  and how have you been insulted  marse tom highee down in de market reckoned it was high time fancy niggers was drov into de swamp and i allowed that loafers and beggars had better roost high when workin folks was around and marse tom said hed cut my haht out  and do you think your carrying a revolver will prevent him and his friends performing that operation if you provoked them  you said we was to pertect oursefs sah returned the negro gloomily what foh den did you drill us to use dem rifles in de armory  to defend yourselves together under orders if attacked not to singly threaten with them in a street row together you would stand some chance against those men separately they could eat you up cato  i wouldnt trust too much to some of dem niggers standing together sah said gate darkly deyd run before de old mastersif they didnt run to em shuah  a fear of this kind had crossed courtlands mind before but he made no present comment i found two of the armory rifles in the mens cabins yesterday he resumed quietly see that it does not occur again they must not be taken from the armory except to defend it  yes sah  there was a moment of silence then it was broken by a sudden gust that swept through the columns of the portico stirring the vines the broad leaves of the ailantus began to rustle an ominous pattering followed the rain had recommenced and as courtland rose and walked towards the open window its blank panes and the interior of the office were suddenly illuminated by a gleam of returning lightning  he entered the office bidding cato follow and lit the lamp above his desk the negro remained standing gloomily but respectfully by the window  cato do you know anything of mr dumontmiss dows cousin  the negros white teeth suddenly flashed in the lamplight ya ha i reckon sah  then hes a great friend of your people  i dont know about dat sah but hes a powful enemy of de reeds and de higbees  on account of his views of course  deed no said cato with an astounded air jess on account of de vendetta  the vendetta  yes sah de old blood quoll of de families its been goin on over fifty years sah de granfader fader and brudder of de higbees was killed by de granfader fader and brudder of de doomonts de reeds chipped in when all de higbees was played out fo dey was relations but dey was chawed up by some of de dowses first cousins to de doomonts  what are the dows in this vendetta  no sah no mo deys bin no man in de family since miss sallys fader dieddats let de dows out fo ever de las shootin was done by marse jack doomont who crippled marse tom higbees brudder jo and den skipped to europe dey say hes come back and is lying low over at atlanty darll be lively times of he comes here to see miss sally  but he may have changed his ideas while living abroad where this sort of thing is simple murder  the negro shook his head grimly den he wouldnt come sah no sah he knows dat tom higbees bound to go fo him or leave de place and marse jack wouldnt mind settlin him too as well as his brudder for de scores is agin de doomonts yet and marse jack aint no slouch wid a scatter gun  at any other time the imminence of this survival of a lawless barbarism of which he had heard so much would have impressed courtland now he was only interested in it on account of the inconceivable position in which it left miss sally had she anything to do with this baleful cousins return or was she only to be a helpless victim of it  a white dazzling and bewildering flash of lightning suddenly lit up the room the porch the dripping ailantus and the flooded street beyond it was followed presently by a crash of thunder with what seemed to be a second fainter flash of lightning or rather as if the first flash had suddenly ignited some inflammable substance with the long reverberation of the thunder still shaking the house courtland slipped quickly out of the window and passed down to the gate  did it strike anything sah said the startled negro as courtland returned  not that i can see said his employer shortly go inside and call zoe and her daughter from the cabin and bring them in the hall stay till i come goill shut the windows myself  it must have struck somewhere sah shuah dehs a powful smell of sulphur right here said the negro as he left the room  courtland thought so too but it was a kind of sulphur that he had smelled beforeon the battlefield for when the door was closed behind his overseer he took the lamp to the opposite wall and examined it carefully there was the distinct hole made by a bullet which had missed catos head at the open window by an inch   chapter vi   in an instant courtland had regained complete possession of himself his distracting passionhow distracting he had never before realizedwas gone his clear sightno longer distorted by sentimenthad come back he saw everything in its just proportionhis duty the plantation the helpless freedman threatened by lawless fury the two womenno longer his one tantalizing vision but now only a passing detail of the work before him he saw them through no aberrating mist of tenderness or expediencybut with the single directness of the man of action  the shot had clearly been intended for cato even if it were an act of mere personal revenge it showed a confidence and security in the wouldbe assassin that betokened cooperation and an organized plan he had availed himself of the thunderstorm the flash and long reverberating roll of soundan artifice not unknown to border ambushto confuse discovery at the instant yet the attack might be only an isolated one or it might be the beginning of a general raid upon the syndicates freedmen if the former he could protect cato from its repetition by guarding him in the office until he could be conveyed to a place of safety if the latter he must at once collect the negroes at their quarters and take cato with him he resolved upon the latter course the quarters were half a mile from the dows dwellingwhich was two miles away  he sat down and wrote a few lines to miss dows stating that in view of some threatened disturbances in the town he thought it advisable to keep the negroes in their quarters whither he was himself going he sent her his housekeeper and the child as they had both better remain in a place of security until he returned to town he gave the note to zoe bidding her hasten by the back garden across the fields then he turned to cato  i am going with you to the quarters tonight he said quietly and you can carry your pistol back to the armory yourself he handed him the weapon the negro received it gratefully but suddenly cast a searching glance at his employer courtlands face however betrayed no change when zoe had gone he continued tranquilly we will go by the back way through the woods as the negro started slightly courtland continued in the same even tone the sulphur you smelled just now cato was the smoke of a gun fired at you from the street i dont propose that the shot shall be repeated under the same advantages  the negro became violently agitated it was dat sneakin hound tom higbee he said huskily  courtland looked at him sharply then there was something more than words passed between him and you cato what happened come speak out  he lashed me with his whip and i gib him one right under the yeah and drupped him said cato recovering his courage with his anger at the recollection i had a right to defend mysef sah  yes and i hope youll be able to do it now said courtland calmly his face giving no sign of his conviction that catos fate was doomed by that single retaliating blow but youll be safer at the quarters he passed into his bedroom took a revolver from his bedhead and a derringer from the drawer both of which he quickly slipped beneath his buttoned coat and returned  when we are in the fields clear of the house keep close by my side and even try to keep step with me what you have to say say now there must be no talking to betray our positionwe must go silently and youll have enough to do to exercise your eyes and ears i shall stand between you and any attack but i expect you to obey orders without hesitation he opened the back door motioned to cato to pass out followed him locked the door behind them and taking the negros arm walked beside the low palings to the end of the garden where they climbed the fence and stood upon the open field beyond  unfortunately it had grown lighter with the breaking of the heavy clouds and gusty gleams of moonlight chased each other over the field or struck a glitter from standing rainpools between the little hillocks to cross the open field and gain the fringe of woods on the other side was the nearest way to the quarters but for the moment was the most exposed course to follow the hedge to the bottom of the field and the boundary fence and then cross at right angles in its shadow would be safer but they would lose valuable time believing that catos vengeful assailant was still hovering near with his comrades courtland cast a quick glance down the shadowy line of osage hedge beside them suddenly cato grasped his arm and pointed in the same direction where the boundary fence he had noticeda barrier of rough palingscrossed the field with the moon low on the other side of it it was a mere black silhouette broken only by bright silver openings and gaps along its surface that indicated the moonlit field beyond at first courtland saw nothing else then he was struck by the fact that these openings became successively and regularly eclipsed as with the passing of some opaque object behind them it was a file of men on the other side of the fence keeping in its shelter as they crossed the field towards his house roughly calculating from the passing obscurations there must have been twelve or fifteen in all  he could no longer doubt their combined intentions nor hesitate how to meet them he must at once make for the quarters with cato even if he had to cross that open field before them he knew that they would avoid injuring him personally in the fear of possible federal and political complications and he resolved to use that fear to insure catos safety placing his hands on the negros shoulders he shoved him forwards falling into a lock step so close behind him that it became impossible for the most expert marksman to fire at one without imperiling the others life when half way across the field he noticed that the shadows seen through the openings of the fence had paused the ambushed men had evidently seen the double apparition understood it and as he expected dared not fire he reached the other side with cato in safety but not before he saw the fateful shadows again moving and this time in their own direction they were evidently intending to pursue them but once within the woods courtland knew that his chances were equal he breathed more freely cato now less agitated had even regained something of his former emotional combativeness which courtland had checked although far from confident of his henchmans prowess in an emergency the prospect of getting him safe into the quarters seemed brighter  it was necessary also to trust to his superior woodcraft and knowledge of the locality and courtland still walking between him and his pursuers and covering his retreat allowed him to lead the way it lay over ground that was beginning to slope gently the underbrush was presently exchanged for springy moss the character of the trees changed the black trunks of cypresses made the gloom thicker trailing vines and parasites brushed their faces a current of damp air seemed to flow just above the soil in which their lower limbs moved sluggishly as through stagnant water as yet there was no indication of pursuit but courtland felt that it was not abandoned indeed he had barely time to check an exclamation from the negro before the dull gallop of horsehoofs in the open ahead of them was plain to them both it was a second party of their pursuers mounted who had evidently been sent to prevent their final egress from the woods while those they had just evaded were no doubt slowly and silently following them on foot they were to be caught between two fires  what is there to the left of us whispered courtland quickly  de swamp  courtland set his teeth together his dullwitted companion had evidently walked them both into the trap nevertheless his resolve was quickly made he could already see through the thinning fringe of timber the figures of the mounted men in the moonlight  this should be the boundary line of the plantation this field beside us is ours he said interrogatively  yes returned the negro but de quarters is a mile furder  good stay here until i come back or call you im going to talk to these fellows but if you value your life dont you speak nor stir  he strode quickly through the intervening trees and stepped out into the moonlight a suppressed shout greeted him and half a dozen mounted men masked and carrying rifles rode down towards him but he remained quietly waiting there and as the nearest approached him he made a step forward and cried halt  the men pulled up sharply and mechanically at that ring of military imperiousness  what are you doing here said courtland  we reckon thats our business connle  its mine when youre on property that i control  the man hesitated and looked interrogatively towards his fellows i allow youve got us there connle he said at last with the lazy insolence of conscious power but i dont mind telling you were wanting a nigger about the size of your cato we haint got anything agin you connle we dont want to interfere with your property and your ways but we dont calculate to have strangers interfere with our ways and our customs trot out your niggeryou nothn folks dont call him property you knowand well clear off your land  and may i ask what you want of cato said courtland quietly  to show him that all the federal law in hll wont protect him when he strikes a white man burst out one of the masked figures riding forward  then you compel me to show you said courtland immovably what any federal citizen may do in the defense of federal law for ill kill the first man that attempts to lay hands upon him on my property some of you who have already tried to assassinate him in cold blood i have met before in less dishonorable warfare than this and they know i am able to keep my word  there was a moments silence the barrel of the revolver he was holding at his side glistened for an instant in the moonlight but he did not move the two men rode up to the first speaker and exchanged words a light laugh followed and the first speaker turned again to courtland with a mocking politeness  very well connle if thats your opinion and you allow we cant follow our game over your property why we reckon well have to give way to those who can sorry to have troubled you goodnight  he lifted his hat ironically waved it to his followers and the next moment the whole party were galloping furiously towards the high road  for the first time that evening a nervous sense of apprehension passed over courtland the impending of some unknown danger is always more terrible to a brave man than the most overwhelming odds that he can see and realize he felt instinctively that they had uttered no vague bravado to cover up their defeat there was still some advantage on which they confidently reckonedbut what was it only a reference to the other party tracking them through the woods on which their enemies now solely relied he regained cato quickly the white teeth of the foolishly confident negro were already flashing his imagined triumph to his employer courtlands heart grew sick as he saw it  were not out of the woods yet cato he said dryly nor are they keep your eyes and ears open and attend to me how long can we keep in the cover of these woods and still push on in the direction of the quarters  theres a way roun de edge o de swamp sah but wed have to go back a spell to find it  go on  and dars moccasins and copperheads lying round here in de trail dey dont go for us ginerallybut he hesitated white men dont stand much show  good then it is as bad for those who are chasing us as for me that will do lead on  they retraced their steps cautiously until the negro turned into a lighter byway a strange mephitic odor seemed to come from sodden leaves and mosses that began to ooze under their feet they had picked their way in silence for some minutes the stunted willows and cypress standing farther and farther apart and the openings with clumps of sedge were frequent courtland was beginning to fear this exposure of his follower and had moved up beside him when suddenly the negro caught his arm and trembled violently his lips were parted over his teeth the whites of his eyes glistened he seemed gasping and speechless with fear  whats the matter cato said courtland glancing instinctively at the ground beneath speak manhave you been bitten  the word seemed to wring an agonized cry from the miserable man  bitten no but dont you hear em coming sah god almighty dont you hear dat  what  de dogs de hounsde bloodhouns deyve set em loose on me  it was true a faint baying in the distance was now distinctly audible to courtland he knew now plainly the full cruel purport of the leaders speechthose who could go anywhere were tracking their game  every trace of manhood had vanished from the negros cowering frame courtland laid his hand assuringly appealingly and then savagely on his shoulder  come enough of this i am here and will stand by you whatever comes these dogs are no more to be feared than the others rouse yourself man and at least help me make a fight of it  no no screamed the terrified man lemme go lemme go back to de massas tell em ill come tell em to call de houns off me and ill go quiet lemme go he struggled violently in his companions grasp  in all courtlands selfcontrol habits of coolness and discipline it is to be feared there was still something of the old berserker temper his face was white his eyes blazed in the darkness only his voice kept that level distinctness which made it for a moment more terrible than even the baying of the tracking hounds to the negros ear cato he said attempt to run now and by god ill save the dogs the trouble of grappling your living carcass come here up that tree with you pointing to a swamp magnolia dont move as long as i can stand here and when im downbut not till thensave yourselfthe best you can  he half helped half dragged the now passive african to the solitary tree as the bay of a single hound came nearer the negro convulsively scrambled from courtlands knee and shoulder to the fork of branches a dozen feet from the ground courtland drew his revolver and stepping back a few yards into the open awaited the attack  it came unexpectedly from behind a sudden yelp of panting cruelty and frenzied anticipation at courtlands back caused him to change front quickly and the dripping fangs and snaky boalike neck of a gray weird shadow passed him with an awful supernaturalness of instinct it kept on in an unerring line to the fateful tree but that dread directness of scent was courtlands opportunity his revolver flashed out in an aim as unerring the brute pierced through neck and brain dashed on against the tree in his impetus and then rolled over against it in a quivering bulk again another bay coming from the same direction told courtland that his pursuers had outflanked him and the whole pack were crossing the swamp but he was prepared again the same weird shadow as spectral and monstrous as a dream dashed out into the brief light of the open but this time it was stopped and rolled over convulsively before it had crossed flushed with the fire of fight in his veins courtland turned almost furiously from the fallen brutes at his feet to meet the onset of the more cowardly hunters whom he knew were at his heels at that moment it would have fared ill with the foremost no longer the calculating steward and diplomatic manager no longer the coolheaded arbiter of conflicting interests he was ready to meet them not only with the intrepid instincts of a soldier but with an aroused partisan fury equal to their own to his surprise no one followed the baying of a third hound seemed to be silenced and checked the silence was broken only by the sound of distant disputing voices and the uneasy trampling of hoofs this was followed by two or three rifle shots in the distance but not either in the direction of the quarters nor the dows dwellinghouse there evidently was some interruption in the pursuita diversion of some kind had taken placebut what he knew not he could think of no one who might have interfered on his behalf and the shouting and wrangling seemed to be carried on in the accents of the one sectional party he called cautiously to cato the negro did not reply he crossed to the tree and shook it impatiently its boughs were empty cato was gone the miserable negro must have taken advantage of the first diversion in his favor to escape but where and how there was nothing left to indicate  as courtland had taken little note of the trail he had no idea of his own whereabouts he knew he must return to the fringe of cypress to be able to cross the open field and gain the negro quarters where it was still possible that cato had fled taking a general direction from the few stars visible above the opening he began to retrace his steps but he had no longer the negros woodcraft to guide him at times his feet were caught in trailing vines which seemed to coil around his ankles with ominous suggestiveness at times the yielding soil beneath his tread showed his perilous proximity to the swamp as well as the fact that he was beginning to incline towards that dread circle which is the hopeless instinct of all lost and straying humanity luckily the edge of the swamp was more open and he would be enabled to correct his changed course again by the position of the stars but he was becoming chilled and exhausted by these fruitless efforts and at length after a more devious and prolonged detour which brought him back to the swamp again he resolved to skirt its edge in search of some other mode of issuance beyond him the light seemed stronger as of a more extended opening or clearing and there was even a superficial gleam from the end of the swamp itself as if from some ignis fatuus or the glancing of a pool of unbroken water a few rods farther brought him to it and a full view of the unencumbered expanse beyond him far across the swamp he could see a hillside bathed in the moonlight with symmetrical lines of small white squares dotting its slopes and stretching down into a valley of gleaming shafts pyramids and tombs it was the cemetery the white squares on the hillside were the soldiers graves and among them even at that distance uplifting solemnly like a reproachful phantom was the broken shaft above the dust of chester brooks  with the view of that fateful spot which he had not seen since his last meeting there with sally dows a flood of recollection rushed upon him in the white mist that hung low along the farther edge of the swamp he fancied he could see again the battery smoke through which the ghostly figure of the dead rider had charged his gun three years before in the vapory white plumes of a funereal plant in the long avenue he was reminded of the light figure of miss sally as she appeared at their last meeting in another moment in his already dazed condition he might have succumbed to some sensuous memory of her former fascinations but he threw it off savagely now with a quick and bitter recalling of her deceit and his own weakness turning his back upon the scene with a halfsuperstitious tremor he plunged once more into the trackless covert but he was conscious that his eyesight was gradually growing dim and his strength falling he was obliged from time to time to stop and rally his sluggish senses that seemed to grow heavier under some deadly exhalation that flowed around him he even seemed to hear familiar voicesbut that must be delusion at last he stumbled throwing out an arm to protect himself he came heavily down upon the ooze striking a dull halfelastic root that seemedit must have been another delusionto move beneath him and evenso confused were his senses nowto strike back angrily upon his prostrate arm a sharp pain ran from his elbow to shoulder and for a moment stung him to full consciousness again there were voices surelythe voices of their former pursuers if they were seeking to revenge themselves upon him for catos escape he was ready for them he cocked his revolver and stood erect a torch flashed through the wood but even at that moment a film came over his eyes he staggered and fell  an interval of helpless semiconsciousness ensued he felt himself lifted by strong arms and carried forward his arm hanging uselessly at his side the dank odor of the wood was presently exchanged for the free air of the open field the flaming pineknot torches were extinguished in the bright moonlight people pressed around him but so indistinctly he could not recognize them all his consciousness seemed centred in the burning throbbing pain of his arm he felt himself laid upon the gravel the sleeve cut from his shoulder the cool sensation of the hot and bursting skin bared to the night air and then a soft cool and indescribable pressure upon a wound he had not felt before a voice followedhigh lazily petulant and familiar to him and yet one he strove in vain to recall  de lawdygawd save us miss sally wot yo doin dah chile chile yo ll kill yosef shuah  the pressure continued strange and potent even through his pain and was then withdrawn and a voice that thrilled him said  its the only thing to save him hush ye chattering black crow say anything about this to a living soul and ill have yo flogged now trot out the whiskey bottle and pour it down him   chapter vii   when courtlands eyes opened again he was in bed in his own room at redlands with the vivid morning sun occasionally lighting up the wall whenever the closely drawn curtains were lightly blown aside by the freshening breeze the whole events of the night might have been a dream but for the insupportable languor which numbed his senses and the torpor of his arm that swollen and discolored lay outside the coverlet on a pillow before him cloths that had been wrung out in iced water were replaced upon it from time to time by sophy miss dows housekeeper who seated near his bedhead was lazily fanning him their eyes met  broken he said interrogatively with a faint return of his old deliberate manner glancing at his helpless arm  deedy no cunnle snake bite responded the negress  snake bite repeated courtland with languid interest what snake  moccasin o copperheadif you doun know yosef which she replied but its all right now honey de pizens drawd out and clean gone wot yer feels now is de whiskey de whiskey stays sah it gets into de lubrications of de skin sah and has to be absobed  some faint chord of memory was touched by the girls peculiar vocabulary  ah said courtland quickly youre miss dows sophy then you can tell me  nuffin sah absomlutely nuffin interrupted the girl shaking her head with impressive official dignity its done gone fobid by de doctor yo re to lie dar and shut yor eye honey she added for the moment reverting unconsciously to the native maternal tenderness of her race and yo re not to bodder yosef ef school keeps o not de medical man say distinctly sah she concluded sternly recalling her duty again no conversation wid de patient  but courtland had winning ways with all dependents but you will answer me one question sophy and ill not ask another hashe hesitated in his still uncertainty as to the actuality of his experience and its probable extenthascatoescaped  if yo mean dat sassy bullnigger oberseer of yose cunnle hes safe yo bet returned sophy sharply safe in his own quotahs night afo las after braggin about the bloodhaowns he killed and safe ober the county line yesday

trash drap off to sleep comforble fo you doan get annuder word out o sophy shuah  as if in obedience courtland closed his eyes but even in his weak state he was conscious of the blood coming into his cheek at sophys relentless criticism of the man for whom he had just periled his life and position much of it he felt was true but how far had he been a dupe in his quixotic defense of a quarrelsome blusterer and cowardly bully yet there was the unmistakable shot and coldblooded attempt at catos assassination and there were the bloodhounds sent to track the unfortunate man that was no dreambut a brutal inexcusable fact  the medical practitioner of redlands he remembered was conservative oldfashioned and diplomatic but his sympathies had been broadened by some army experiences and courtland trusted to some soldierly and frank exposition of the matter from him nevertheless dr maynard was first healer and like sophy professionally cautious the colonel had better not talk about it now it was already two days old the colonel had been nearly fortyeight hours in bed it was a regrettable affair but the natural climax of longcontinued political and racial irritationand not without great provocation assassination was a strong word could colonel courtland swear that cato was actually aimed at or was it not merely a demonstration to frighten a bullying negro it might have been necessary to teach him a lessonwhich the colonel by this time ought to know could only be taught to these inferior races by fear the bloodhounds ah yeswell the bloodhounds were in fact only a part of that wholesome discipline surely colonel courtland was not so foolish as to believe that even in the old slaveholding days planters sent dogs after runaways to mangle and destroy their own property they might as well at once let them escape no sir they were used only to frighten and drive the niggers out of swamps brakes and hidingplacesas no nigger had ever dared to face em cato might lie as much as he liked but everybody knew who it was that killed major reeds hounds nobody blamed the colonel for itnot even major reedbut if the colonel had lived a little longer in the south hed have known it wasnt necessary to do that in selfpreservation as the hounds would never have gone for a white man but that was not a matter for the colonel to bother about now he was doing well he had slept nearly thirty hours there was no fever he must continue to doze off the exhaustion of his powerful stimulant and he the doctor would return later in the afternoon  perhaps it was his very inability to grasp in that exhausted state the full comprehension of the doctors meaning perhaps because the physical benumbing of his brain was stronger than any mental excitement but he slept again until the doctor reappeared youre doing well enough now colonel said the physician after a brief examination of his patient and i think we can afford to wake you up a bit and even let you move your arm youre luckier than poor tom higbee who wont be able to set his leg to the floor for three weeks to come i havent got all the buckshot out of it yet that jack dumont put there the other night  courtland started slightly jack dumont that was the name of sally dows cousin of whom champney had spoken he had resolutely put aside from his returning memory the hazy recollection of the young girls voicethe last thing he had heard that nightand the mystery that seemed to surround it but there was no delusion in this cousinhis rival and that of the equally deceived champney he controlled himself and repeated coldly  jack dumont  yes but of course you knew nothing of all that while you were off in the swamp there yet by jingo it was dumonts shooting higbee that helped you to get off your nigger a darned sight more than your killing the dogs  i dont understand returned courtland coldly  well you see dumont who had taken up nothn principles i reckon more to goad the higbees and please sally dows than from any conviction came over here that night whether he suspected anything was up or wanted to dare higbee for bedevilment or was only dancing attendance on miss sally no one knows but he rode slap into highees party called out if youre out hunting tom heres a chance for your score meaning their old vendetta feud and brings his shotgun up to his shoulder higbee wasnt quick enough dumont lets fly drops higbee and then gallops off chased by the reeds to avenge higbee and followed by the whole crowd to see the fun which was a little better than niggerdriving and that let you and cato out colonel  and dumont  got clean away to foxboro station leaving another score on his side for the reeds and higbees to wipe out as best they can you nothn men dont believe in these sort of things colonel but taken as a straight dash and hit o raiding that stroke of sally dows cousin was mighty fine  courtland controlled himself with difficulty the doctor had spoken truly the hero of this miserable affair was her cousinhis rival and to himperhaps influenced by some pitying appeal of miss sally for the man she had deceivedcourtland owed his life he instinctively drew a quick sharp breath  are you in pain  not at all when can i get up  perhaps tomorrow  and this arm  better not use it for a week or two he stopped and glancing paternally at the younger man added gravely but kindly if youll take my unprofessional advice colonel courtland youll let this matter simmer down it wont hurt you and your affairs here that folks have had a taste of your quality and the nigger a lesson that his fellows wont forget  i thank you returned courtland coldly but i think i already understand my duty to the company i represent and the government i have served  possibly colonel said the doctor quietly but youll let an older man remind you and the government that you cant change the habits or relations of two distinct races in a few years your friend miss sally dowsalthough not quite in my way of thinkinghas never attempted that  i am fully aware that miss dows possesses diplomatic accomplishments and graces that i cannot lay claim to returned courtland bitterly  the doctor lifted his eyebrows slightly and changed the subject  when he had gone courtland called for writing materials he had already made up his mind and one course alone seemed proper to him he wrote to the president of the company detailing the circumstances that had just occurred admitting the alleged provocation given by his overseer but pointing out the terrorism of a moblaw which rendered his own discipline impossible he asked that the matter be reported to washington and some measures taken for the protection of the freedmen in the mean time he begged to tender his own resignation but he would stay until his successor was appointed or the safety of his employees secured until then he should act upon his own responsibility and according to his judgment he made no personal charges mentioned no names asked for no exemplary prosecution or trial of the offenders but only demanded a safeguard against a repetition of the offense his next letter although less formal and official was more difficult it was addressed to the commandant of the nearest federal barracks who was an old friend and former companioninarms he alluded to some conversation they had previously exchanged in regard to the presence of a small detachment of troops at redlands during the elections which courtland at the time however had diplomatically opposed he suggested it now as a matter of public expediency and prevention when he had sealed the letters not caring to expose them to the espionage of the local postmaster or his ordinary servants he intrusted them to one of miss sallys own henchmen to be posted at the next office at bitter creek station ten miles distant  unfortunately this duty accomplished the reaction consequent on his still weak physical condition threw him back upon himself and his memory he had resolutely refused to think of miss sally he had been able to withstand the suggestions of her in the presence of her handmaidsupposed to be potent in nursing and herblorewhom she had detached to wait upon him and he had returned politely formal acknowledgments to her inquiries he had determined to continue this personal avoidance as far as possible until he was relieved on the ground of that business expediency which these events had made necessary she would see that he was only accepting the arguments with which she had met his previous advances briefly he had recourse to that hopeless logic by which a man proves to himself that he has no reason for loving a certain woman and is as incontestably convinced by the same process that he has and in the midst of it he weakly fell asleep and dreamed that he and miss sally were walking in the cemetery that a hideous snake concealed among some lilies over which the young girl was bending had uplifted its triangular head to strike that he seized it by the neck struggled with it until he was nearly exhausted when it suddenly collapsed and shrunk leaving in his palm the limp crushed and delicately perfumed little thread glove which he remembered to have once slipped from her hand  when he awoke that perfume seemed to be still in the air distinct from the fresh but homelier scents of the garden which stole through the window a sense of delicious coolness came with the afternoon breeze that faintly trilled the slanting slats of the blind with a slumberous humming as of bees the golden glory of a sinking southern sun was penciling the cheap paper on the wall with leafy tracery and glowing arabesques but more than that the calm of some potent influenceor some unseen presencewas upon him which he feared a movement might dispel the chair at the foot of his bed was empty sophy had gone out he did not turn his head to look further his languid eyes falling aimlessly upon the carpet at his bedside suddenly dilated for they fell also on the smallest foot in the state  he started to his elbow but a soft hand was laid gently yet firmly upon his shoulder and with a faint rustle of muslin skirts miss sally rose from an unseen chair at the head of his bed and stood beside him  dont stir connle i didnt sit where i could look in yor face for fear of waking yo but ill change seats now she moved to the chair which sophy had vacated drew it slightly nearer the bed and sat down  it was very kind of youto come said courtland hesitatingly as with a strong effort he drew his eyes away from the fascinating vision and regained a certain cold composure but i am afraid my illness has been greatly magnified i really am quite well enough to be up and about my business if the doctor would permit it but i shall certainly manage to attend to my duty tomorrow and i hope to be at your service  meaning that yo dont care to see me now connle she said lightly with a faint twinkle in her wise sweet eyes i thought of that but as my business wouldnt wait i brought it to yo she took from the folds of her gown a letter to his utter amazement it was the one he had given his overseer to post to the commandant that morning to his greater indignation the seal was broken  who has dared he demanded half rising  her little hand was thrust out half deprecatingly no one yo can fight connle only me i dont generally open other folks letters and i wouldnt have done it for myself i did for yo  for me  for yo i reckoned what yo might do and i told sam to bring me the letters first i didnt mind what yo wrote to the companyfor theyll take care of yo and their own eggs are all in the same basket i didnt open that one but i did this when i saw the address it was as i expected and yo d given yoself away for if yo had those soldiers down here yo d have a row sure dont move connle yo may not care for that its in yor line but folks will say that the soldiers werent sent to prevent rioting but that connle courtland was using his old comrades to keep order on his property at govment expense hol on hol on connle said the little figure rising and waving its pretty arms with a mischievous simulation of terrified deprecation dont shoot of course yo didnt mean that but thats about the way that sothn men will put it to yor govment for she continued more gently yet with the shrewdest twinkle in her gray eyes if yo really thought the niggers might need federal protection yo d have let me write to the commandant to send an escortnot to yo but to catothat he might be able to come back in safety yo d have had yor soldiers id have had back my nigger whichdemurelyyo dont seem to worry yoself much about connle and there isnt a sothn man would have objected but still more demurely and affectedly smoothing out her crisp skirt with her little hands yo havent been troubling me much with yor counsel lately  a swift and utterly new comprehension swept over courtland for the first time in his knowledge of her he suddenly grasped what was perhaps the true conception of her character looking at her clearly now he understood the meaning of those pliant graces so unaffected and yet always controlled by the reasoning of an unbiased intellect her frank speech and plausible intonations before him stood the trueborn daughter of a long race of politicians all that he had heard of their dexterity tact and expediency rose here incarnate with the added grace of womanhood a strange sense of reliefperhaps a dawning of hopestole over him  but how will this insure catos safety hereafter or give protection to the others he said fixing his eyes upon her  the future wont concern yo much connle if as yo say here yor resignation is sent in and yor successor appointed she replied with more gravity than she had previously shown  but you do not think i will leave you in this uncertainty he said passionately he stopped suddenly his brow darkened i forgot he added coldly you will be well protected yourcousinwill give you the counsel of raceandcloser ties  to his infinite astonishment miss sally leaned forward in her chair and buried her laughing face in both of her hands when her dimples had become again visible she said with an effort dont yo think connle that as a peacemaker my cousin was even a bigger failure than yoself  i dont understand stammered courtland  dont yo think she continued wiping her eyes demurely that if a young woman about my size who had got perfectly tired and sick of all this fuss made about yo because yo were a nothn man managing niggersif that young woman wanted to show her people what sort of a radical and abolitionist a sothn man of their own sort might become shed have sent for jack dumont as a sample eh only i declare to goodness i never reckoned that he and higbee would revive the tomfooling of the vendetta and take to shootin each other at once  and your sending for your cousin was only a feint to protect me said courtland faintly  perhaps he didnt have to be sent for connle she said with a slight touch of coquetry suppose we say i let him come hed be hanging round for he has property here and wanted to get me to take it up with mine in the company i knew what his new views and ideas were and i thought id better consult champneywho being a foreigner and an older resident than yo was quite neutral he didnt happen to tell yo anything about itdid he connle she added with a grave mouth but an indescribable twinkle in her eyes  courtlands face darkened he didand he further told me miss dows that he himself was your suitor and that you had refused him because of the objections of your people  she raised her eyes to his swiftly and dropped them  and yo think i ought to have accepted him she said slowly  no butyou knowyou told mehe began hurriedly but she had already risen and was shaking out the folds of her dress  were not talking business connleand business was my only excuse for coming here and taking sophys place ill send her in to yo now  but miss dowsmiss sally  she stoppedhesitateda singular weakness for so selfcontained a natureand then slowly produced from her pocket a second letterthe one that courtland had directed to the company i didnt read this letter as i just told yo connle for i reckon i know whats in it but i thought id bring it with me too in case yo changed yor mind  he raised himself on his pillow as she turned quickly away but in that single vanishing glimpse of her bright face he saw what neither he nor any one else had ever seen upon the face of sally dowsa burning blush  miss sally he almost leaped from the bed but she was gone there was another rustle at the doorthe entrance of sophy  call her back sophy quick he said  the negress shook her turbaned head not much honey when miss sally say she goesshe done gone shuah  but sophy perhaps something in the significant face of the girl tempted him perhaps it was only an impulse of his forgotten youth sophy appealinglytell meis miss sally engaged to her cousin  wat dat said sophy in indignant scorn miss sally engaged to dat dumont what fo yo re crazy no  nor champney tell me sophy has she a lover  for a moment the whites of sophys eyes were uplifted in speechless scorn yo ask dat yo lyin dar wid dat snakebit arm yo lyin dar and miss sallywho has only to whistle to call de fust quality in de state raoun

out of it nowbofe of yonebber fo yo re hers and shes yorsfo ebber for she sucked yo blood  what gasped courtland aghast at what he believed to be the sudden insanity of the negress  yes whars yor eyes

man im sick of yo stop dar lie down dar hol on connle for massys sake well darill call her back  and she did   look heredont you knowit rather took me by surprise said champney a few days later with a hearty grip of the colonels uninjured hand but i dont bear malice old fellow and by jove it was such a sensible allround businesslike choice for the girl to make that no wonder we never thought of it before hang it all you see a fellow was always so certain it would be something out of the way and detrimental dont you know that would take the fancy of a girl like thatsomebody like that cousin of hers or higbee or even me by jove that we never thought of looking beyond our nosesnever thought of the business and you all the time so cold and silent and matteroffact about it but i congratulate you youve got the business down on a safe basis now and whats more youve got the one woman who can run it  they say he was a true prophet at least the syndicate affairs prospered and in course of time even the reeds and the higbees participated in the benefits there were no more racial disturbances only the districts polled a peaceful and smaller democratic majority at the next election there were not wanting those who alleged that colonel courtland had simply become mrs courtlands superintendent that she had absorbed him as she had every one who had come under her influence and that she would not rest until she had made him a senator to represent mrs courtland in the councils of the nation but when i last dined with them in washington ten years ago i found them both very happy and comfortable and i remember that mrs courtlands remarks upon federal and state interests the proper education of young girls and the management of the family were eminently wise and practical     the conspiracy of mrs bunker   part i   on the northerly shore of san francisco bay a line of bluffs terminates in a promontory at whose base formed by the crumbling debris of the cliff above there is a narrow stretch of beach salt meadow and scrub oak the abrupt wall of rock behind it seems to isolate it as completely from the mainland as the sea before it separates it from the opposite shore in spite of its contiguity to san franciscoopposite also but hidden by the sharp reentering curve of coastthe locality was wild uncultivated and unfrequented a solitary fishermans cabin half hidden in the rocks was the only trace of habitation white drifts of seagulls and pelican across the face of the cliff gray clouds of sandpipers rising from the beach the dripping flight of ducks over the salt meadows and the occasional splash of a seal from the rocks were the only signs of life that could be seen from the decks of passing ships and yet the fishermans cabin was occupied by zephas bunker and his young wife and he had succeeded in wresting from the hard soil pasturage for a cow and goats while his lateensailed fishingboat occasionally rode quietly in the sheltered cove below  three years ago zephas bunker an exwhaler had found himself stranded on a san francisco wharf and had hired out to a small petaluma farmer at the end of a year he had acquired little taste for the farmers business but considerable for the farmers youthful daughter who equally weary of small agriculture had consented to elope with him in order to escape it they were married at oakland he put his scant earnings into a fishingboat discovered the site for his cabin and brought his bride thither the novelty of the change pleased her although perhaps it was but little advance on her previous humble position yet she preferred her present freedom to the bare restricted home life of her past the perpetual presence of the restless sea was a relief to the old monotony of the wheat field and its isolated drudgery for marys youthful fancy thinly sustained in childhood by the lightest literary food had neither been stimulated nor disillusioned by her marriage that practical experience which is usually the end of girlish romance had left her still a child in sentiment the long absences of her husband in his fishingboat kept her from wearying of or even knowing his older and unequal companionship it gave her a freedom her girlhood had never known yet added a protection that suited her still childish dependency while it tickled her pride with its equality when not engaged in her easy household duties in her threeroomed cottage or the care of her rocky garden patch she found time enough to indulge her fancy over the mysterious haze that wrapped the invisible city so near and yet unknown to her in the sails that slipped in and out of the golden gate but of whose destination she knew nothing and in the long smoke trail of the mail steamer which had yet brought her no message like all dwellers by the sea her face and her thoughts were more frequently turned towards it and as with them it also seemed to her that whatever change was coming into her life would come across that vast unknown expanse but it was here that mrs bunker was mistaken  it had been a sparkling summer morning the waves were running before the dry northwest trade winds with crystalline but colorless brilliancy sheltered by the high northerly bluff the house and its garden were exposed to the untempered heat of the cloudless sun refracted from the rocky wall behind it some tarpaulin and ropes lying among the rocks were sticky and odorous the scrub oaks and manzanita bushes gave out the aroma of baking wood occasionally a faint potpourri fragrance from the hot wild roses and beach grass was blown along the shore even the lingering odors of bunkers vocation and of mrs bunkers cooking were idealized and refined by the saline breath of the sea at the doors and windows mrs bunker in the dazzling sun bending over her peas and lettuces with a small hoe felt the comfort of her brown holland sunbonnet secure in her isolation she unbuttoned the neck of her gown for air and did not put up the strand of black hair that had escaped over her shoulder it was very hot in the lee of the bluff and very quiet in that still air so quiet that she heard two distinct reports following each other quickly but very faint and far she glanced mechanically towards the sea two merchantmen in midstream were shaking out their wings for a long flight a pilot boat and coasting schooner were rounding the point but there was no smoke from their decks she bent over her work again and in another moment had forgotten it but the heat with the dazzling reflection from the cliff forced her to suspend her gardening and stroll along the beach to the extreme limit of her domain here she looked after the cow that had also strayed away through the tangled bush for coolness the goats impervious to temperature were basking in inaccessible fastnesses on the cliff itself that made her eyes ache to climb over an hour passed she was returning and had neared her house when she was suddenly startled to see the figure of a man between her and the cliff he was engaged in brushing his dusty clothes with a handkerchief and although he saw her coming and even moved slowly towards her continued his occupation with a halfimpatient halfabstracted air her feminine perception was struck with the circumstance that he was in deep black with scarcely a gleam of white showing even at his throat and that he wore a tall black hat without knowing anything of social customs it seemed to her that his dress was inconsistent with his appearance there  goodmorning he said lifting his hat with a preoccupied air do you live here  yes she said wonderingly  anybody else  my husband  i mean any other people are there any other houses he said with a slight impatience  no  he looked at her and then towards the sea i expect some friends who are coming for me in a boat i suppose they can land easily here  didnt you yourself land here just now she said quickly  he half hesitated and then as if scorning an equivocation made a hasty gesture over her shoulder and said bluntly no i came over the cliff  down the cliff she repeated incredulously  yes he said glancing at his clothes it was a rough scramble but the goats showed me the way  and you were up on the bluff all the time she went on curiously  yes you seeihe stopped suddenly at what seemed to be the beginning of a prearranged and plausible explanation as if impatient of its weakness or hypocrisy and said briefly yes i was there  like most women more observant of his face and figure she did not miss this lack of explanation he was a very goodlooking man of middle age with a thin proud highbred face which in a country of bearded men had the further distinction of being smoothly shaven she had never seen any one like him before she thought he looked like an illustration of some novel she had read but also somewhat melancholy worn and tired  wont you come in and rest yourself she said motioning to the cabin  thank you he said still half absently perhaps id better it may be some time yet before they come  she led the way to the cabin entered the living rooma plainly furnished little apartment between the bedroom and the kitchenpointed to a large bamboo armchair and placed a bottle of whiskey and some water on the table before him he thanked her again very gently poured out some spirits in his glass and mixed it with water but when she glanced towards him again he had apparently risen without tasting it and going to the door was standing there with his hand in the breast of his buttoned frock coat gazing silently towards the sea there was something vaguely historical in his attitudeor what she thought might be historicalas of somebody of great importance who had halted on the eve of some great event at the door of her humble cabin  his apparent unconsciousness of her and of his surroundings his preoccupation with something far beyond her ken far from piquing her only excited her interest the more and then there was such an odd sadness in his eyes  are you anxious for your folks coming she said at last following his outlook  ioh no he returned quickly recalling himself theyll be sure to comesooner or later no fear of that he added half smilingly half wearily  mrs bunker passed into the kitchen where while apparently attending to her household duties she could still observe her singular guest left alone he seated himself mechanically in the chair and gazed fixedly at the fireplace he remained a long time so quiet and unmoved in spite of the marked ostentatious clatter mrs bunker found it necessary to make with her dishes that an odd fancy that he was scarcely a human visitant began to take possession of her yet she was not frightened she remembered distinctly afterwards that far from having any concern for herself she was only moved by a strange and vague admiration of him  but her prolonged scrutiny was not without effect suddenly he raised his dark eyes and she felt them pierce the obscurity of her kitchen with a quick suspicious impatient penetration which as they met hers gave way however to a look that she thought was gently reproachful then he rose stretched himself to his full height and approaching the kitchen door leaned listlessly against the doorpost  i dont suppose you are ever lonely here  no sir  of course not you have yourself and husband nobody interferes with you you are contented and happy together  mrs bunker did not say what was the fact that she had never before connected the sole companionship of her husband with her happiness perhaps it had never occurred to her until that moment how little it had to do with it she only smiled gratefully at the change in her guests abstraction  do you often go to san francisco he continued  i have never been there at all some day i expect we will go there to live  i wouldnt advise you to he said looking at her gravely i dont think it will pay you youll never be happy there as here youll never have the independence and freedom you have here youll never be your own mistress again but how does it happen you never were in san francisco he said suddenly  if he would not talk of himself here at least was a chance for mrs bunker to say something she related how her family had emigrated from kansas across the plains and had taken up a location at contra costa how she didnt care for it and how she came to marry the seafaring man who brought her hereall with great simplicity and frankness and as unreservedly as to a superior beingalbeit his attention wandered at times and a rare but melancholy smile that he had apparently evoked to meet her conversational advances became fixed occasionally even his dark eyes which had obliged mrs bunker to put up her hair and button her collar rested upon her without seeing her  then your husbands name is bunker he said when she paused at last thats one of those nantucket quaker namessailors and whalers for generationsand yours you say was macewan well mrs bunker your family came from kentucky to kansas only lately though i suppose your father calls himself a freestates man you ought to know something of farming and cattle for your ancestors were old scotch covenanters who emigrated a hundred years ago and were great stock raisers  all this seemed only the natural omniscience of a superior being and mrs bunker perhaps was not pained to learn that her husbands family was of a lower degree than her own but the strangers knowledge did not end there he talked of her husbands businesshe explained the vast fishing resources of the bay and coast he showed her how the large colony of italian fishermen were inimical to the interests of california and to her husbandparticularly as a native american trader he told her of the volcanic changes of the bay and coast line of the formation of the rocky ledge on which she lived he pointed out to her its value to the government for defensive purposes and how it naturally commanded the entrance of the golden gate far better than fort point and that it ought to be in its hands if the federal government did not buy it of her husband certainly the state of california should and here he fell into an abstraction as deep and as gloomy as before he walked to the window paced the floor with his hand in his breast went to the door and finally stepped out of the cabin moving along the ledge of rocks to the shore where he stood motionless  mrs bunker had listened to him with parted lips and eyes of eloquent admiration she had never before heard anyone talk like thatshe had not believed it possible that any one could have such knowledge perhaps she could not understand all he said but she would try to remember it after he had gone she could only think now how kind it was of him that in all this mystery of his coming and in the singular sadness that was oppressing him he should try to interest her and thus looking at him and wondering an idea came to her  she went into her bedroom and took down her husbands heavy pilot overcoat and souwester and handed them to her guest  youd better put them on if youre going to stand there she said  but i am not cold he said wonderingly  but you might be seen she said simply it was the first suggestion that had passed between them that his presence there was a secret he looked at her intently then he smiled and said i think youre right for many reasons put the pilot coat over his frock coat removed his hat with the gesture of a bow handed it to her and placed the souwester in its stead then for an instant he hesitated as if about to speak but mrs bunker with a delicacy that she could not herself comprehend at the moment hurried back to the cabin without giving him an opportunity  nor did she again intrude upon his meditations hidden in his disguise which to her eyes did not however seem to conceal his characteristic figure he wandered for nearly an hour under the bluff and along the shore returning at last almost mechanically to the cabin where oblivious of his surroundings he reseated himself in silence by the table with his cheek resting on his hand presently her quick experienced ear detected the sound of oars in their rowlocks she could plainly see from her kitchen window a small boat with two strangers seated at the stern being pulled to the shore with the same strange instinct of delicacy she determined not to go out lest her presence might embarrass her guests reception of his friends but as she turned towards the living room she found he had already risen and was removing his hat and pilot coat she was struck however by the circumstance that not only did he exhibit no feeling of relief at his deliverance but that a halfcynical halfsavage expression had taken the place of his former melancholy as he went to the door the two gentlemen hastily clambered up the rocks to greet him  jim reckoned it was you hangin round the rocks but i couldnt tell at that distance seemed you borrowed a hat and coat wellits all fixed and weve no time to lose theres a coasting steamer just dropping down below the heads and it will take you aboard but i can tell you youve kicked up a hll of a row over there he stopped evidently at some sign from her guest the rest of the mans speech followed in a hurried whisper which was stopped again by the voice she knew no certainly not the next moment his tall figure was darkening the door of the kitchen his hand was outstretched goodby mrs bunker and many thanks for your hospitality my friends here he turned grimly to the men behind him think i ought to ask you to keep this a secret even from your husband i dont they also think that i ought to offer you money for your kindness i dont but if you will honor me by keeping this ring in remembrance of ithe took a heavy seal ring from his fingerits the only bit of jewelry i have about meill be very glad goodby she felt for a moment the firm soft pressure of his long thin fingers around her own and thenhe was gone the sound of retreating oars grew fainter and fainter and was lost the same reserve of delicacy which now appeared to her as a duty kept her from going to the window to watch the destination of the boat no he should go as he came without her supervision or knowledge  nor did she feel lonely afterwards on the contrary the silence and solitude of the isolated domain had a new charm they kept the memory of her experience intact and enabled her to refill it with his presence she could see his tall figure again pausing before her cabin without the incongruous association of another personality she could hear his voice again unmingled with one more familiar for the first time the regular absence of her husband seemed an essential good fortune instead of an accident of their life for the experience belonged to her and not to him and her together he could not understand it he would have acted differently and spoiled it she should not tell him anything of it in spite of the strangers suggestion which of course he had only made because he didnt know zephas as well as she did for mrs bunker was getting on rapidly it was her first admission of the conjugal knowledge that ones husband is inferior to the outside estimate of him the next stepthe belief that he was deceiving her as he was themwould be comparatively easy  nor should she show him the ring the stranger had certainly never said anything about that it was a heavy ring with a helmeted head carved on its red carnelian stone and what looked like strange letters around it it fitted her third finger perfectly but his fingers were small and he had taken it from his little finger she should keep it herself of course if it had been money she would have given it to zephas but the stranger knew that she wouldnt take money how firmly he had said that i dont she felt the warm blood fly to her fresh young face at the thought of it he had understood her she might be living in a poor cabin doing all the housework herself and her husband only a fisherman but he had treated her like a lady  and so the afternoon passed the outlying fog began to roll in at the golden gate obliterating the headland and stretching a fleecy bar across the channel as if shutting out from vulgar eyes the way that he had gone night fell but zephas had not yet come this was unusual for he was generally as regular as the afternoon trades which blew him there there was nothing to detain him in this weather and at this season she began to be vaguely uneasy then a little angry at this new development of his incompatibility then it occurred to her for the first time in her wifehood to think what she would do if he were lost yet in spite of some pain terror and perplexity at the possibility her dominant thought was that she would be a free woman to order her life as she liked  it was after ten before his lateen sail flapped in the little cove she was waiting to receive him on the shore his goodhumored hirsute face was slightly apologetic in expression but flushed and disturbed with some new excitement to which an extra glass or two of spirits had apparently added intensity the contrast between his evident indulgence and the previous abstemiousness of her late guest struck her unpleasantly welli declare she said indignantly so thats what kept you  no he said quickly theres been awful times over in frisco everybody just wild and the vigilance committee in session jo hendersons killed shot by wynyard marion in a duel hell be lynched sure as a gun if they ketch him  but i thought men who fought duels always went free  yes but this aint no common duel they say the whole thing was planned beforehand by them southern fireeaters to get rid o henderson because hes a northern man and antislavery and that they picked out colonel marion to do it because he was a dead shot they got him to insult henderson so he was bound to challenge marion and that giv marion the chyce of weppings it was a reglar put up job to kill him  and whats all this to do with you she asked with irritation  hold on wont you and ill tell you i was pickin up nets off saucelito about noon when i was hailed by one of them vigilance tugs and they set me to stand off and on the shore and watch that marion didnt get away while they were scoutin inland ye see the duel took place just over the bluff therebehind yeand they allowed that marion had struck away north for mendocino to take ship there for after overhaulin his seconds boat they found out that they had come away from saucelito alone but they sent a tug around by sea to mendocino to head him off there while theyre closin in around him inland theyre bound to catch him sooner or later but you aint listenin mollie  she wasin every fibrebut with her head turned towards the window and the invisible golden gate through which the fugitive had escaped for she saw it all nowthat glorious visionher highbred handsome guest and wynyard marion were one and the same person and this rough commonplace man before herher own husbandhad been basely set to capture him   part ii   during that evening and the next mrs bunker without betraying her secret or exciting the least suspicion on the part of her husband managed to extract from him not only a rough description of marion which tallied with her own impressions but a short history of his career he was a famous politician who had held high office in the south he was an accomplished lawyer he had served in the army he was a fiery speaker he had a singular command of men he was unmarried but there were queer stories of his relations with some of the wives of prominent officials and there was no doubt that he used them in some of his political intrigues he zephas would bet something that it was a woman who had helped him off did she speak  yes she had spoken it made her sick to sit there and hear such stories because a man did not agree with some people in politics it was perfectly awful to think how they would abuse him and take away his character men were so awfully jealous too if another man happened to be superior and finelooking there wasnt anything bad enough for them to say about him no she wasnt a slavery sympathizer either and hadnt anything to do with man politics although she was a southern woman and the macewans had come from kentucky and owned slaves of course he zephas whose ancestors were cape cod quakers and had always been sailors couldnt understand she did not know what he meant by saying what a long tail our cats got but if he meant to call her a cat and was going to use such language to her he had better have stayed in san francisco with his vigilance friends and perhaps it would have been better if he had stayed there before he took her away from her parents at martinez then she wouldnt have been left on a desert rock without any chance of seeing the world or ever making any friends or acquaintances  it was their first quarrel discreetly made up by mrs bunker in some alarm at betraying herself honestly forgiven by zephas in a rude remorseful consciousness of her limited life one or two nights later when he returned it was with a mingled air of mystery and satisfaction well mollie he said cheerfully it looks as if your pets were not as bad as i thought them  my pets repeated mrs bunker with a faint rising of color  well i call these southern chivs your pets mollie because you stuck up for them so the other night but never mind that now what do you suppose has happened jim rider you know the southern banker and speculator whos a regular big injin among the chivs he sent cap simmons down to the wharf while i was unloadin to come up and see him well i went and what do yu think he told me he was gettin up an american fishin company and wanted me to take charge of a firstclass schooner on shares said he heard of me afore and knew i was an american and a white man and just the chap ez could knock them eytalians outer the market  yes interrupted mrs bunker quickly but emphatically the fishing interest ought to be american and protected by the state with regular charters and treaties  i say mollie said her astonished but admiring husband youve been readin the papers or listenin to stump speakin sure  go on returned mrs bunker impatiently and say what happened next  well returned zephas i first thought you see that it had suthin to do with that marion business particklerly ez folks allowed he was hidin somewhere yet and they wanted me to run him off so i thought rider might as well know that i wasnt to be bribed so i ups and tells him how id been lyin off saucelito the other day workin for the other side agin him with that he laughs says he didnt want any better friends than me but that i must be livin in the backwoods not to know that wynyard marion had escaped and was then at sea on his way to mexico or central america then we agreed to terms and the long and short of it is mollie that im to have the schooner with a hundred and fifty dollars a month and ten per cent shares after a year looks like biz eh mollie old girl but you dont seem pleased  she had put aside the arm with which he was drawing her to him and had turned her white face away to the window so he had gonethis strangerthis one friend of her lifeshe would never see him again and all that would ever come of it was this pecuniary benefit to her husband who had done nothing he would not even offer her money but he had managed to pay his debt to her in this way that their vulgar poverty would appreciate and this was the end of her dream  you dont seem to take it in mollie continued the surprised zephas it means a house in frisco and a little cabin for you on the schooner when you like  i dont want it i wont have it i shall stay here she burst out with a halfpassionate halfchildish cry and ran into her bedroom leaving the astonished zephas helpless in his awkward consternation  by gum i must take her to frisco right off or shell be havin the high strikes here alone i oughter knowed it would come to this but although he consulted cap simmons the next day who informed him it was all womans ways when struck and advised him to pay out all the line he could at such delicate moments she had no recurrence of the outbreak on the contrary for days and weeks following she seemed calmer older and more growed up although she resisted changing her seashore dwelling for san francisco she accompanied him on one or two of his deep sea trips down the coast and seemed happier on their southern limits she had taken to reading the political papers and speeches and some cheap american histories captain bunkers crew profoundly convinced that their skippers wife was a womans rights fanatic with the baleful qualities of sea lawyer superadded marveled at his bringing her  it was on returning home from one of these trips that they touched briefly at san francisco where the secretary of the fishing company came on board mrs bunker was startled to recognize in him one of the two gentlemen who had taken mr marion off in the boat but as he did not appear to recognize her even after an awkward introduction by her husband she would have recovered her equanimity but for a singular incident as her husband turned momentarily away the secretary with a significant gesture slipped a letter into her hand she felt the blood rush to her face as with a smile he moved away to follow her husband she came down to the little cabin and impatiently tore open the envelope which bore no address a small folded note contained the following lines   i never intended to burden you with my confidence but the discretion tact and courage you displayed on our first meeting and what i know of your loyalty since have prompted me to trust myself again to your kindness even though you are now aware whom you have helped and the risks you ran my friends wish to communicate with me and to forward to me from time to time certain papers of importance which owing to the tyrannical espionage of the government would be discovered and stopped in passing through the express or postoffice these papers will be left at your house but here i must trust entirely to your wit and judgment as to the way in which they should be delivered to my agent at the nearest mexican port to facilitate your action your husband will receive directions to pursue his course as far south as todos santos where a boat will be ready to take charge of them when he is sighted i know i am asking a great favor but i have such confidence in you that i do not even ask you to commit yourself to a reply to this if it can be done i know that you will do it if it cannot i will understand and appreciate the reason why i will only ask you that when you are ready to receive the papers you will fly a small red pennant from the little flagstaff among the rocks believe me your friend and grateful debtor  w m   mrs bunker cast a hasty glance around her and pressed the letter to her lips it was a sudden consummation of her vaguest halfformed wishes the realization of her wildest dreams to be the confidante of the gallant but melancholy hero in his lonely exile and persecution was to satisfy all the unformulated romantic fancies of her girlish reading to be later perhaps the flora macdonald of a middleaged prince charlie did not however evoke any ludicrous associations in her mind her feminine fancy exalted the escaped duelist and alleged assassin into a social martyr his actual small political intrigues and ignoble aims of office seemed to her little different from those aspirations of royalty which she had read aboutas perhaps they were indeed it is to be feared that in foolish little mrs bunker wynyard marion had found the old feminine adoration of pretension and privilege which every rascal has taken advantage of since the flood  howbeit the next morning after she had returned and zephas had sailed away she flew a red bandana handkerchief on the little flagstaff before the house a few hours later a boat appeared mysteriously from around the point its only occupanta common sailorasked her name and handed her a sealed package mrs bunkers invention had already been at work she had created an aunt in mexico for whom she had with some ostentation made some small purchases while in san francisco when her husband spoke of going as far south as todos santos she begged him to deliver the parcel to her aunts messenger and even addressed it boldly to her inside the outer wrapper she wrote a note to marion which with a new and amazing diffidence she composed and altered a dozen times at last addressing the following in a large schoolgirl hand sir i obey your commands to the last whatever your oppressors or enemies may do you can always rely and trust upon she who in deepest sympathy signs herself ever mollie rosalie macewan the substitution of her maiden name in full seemed in her simplicity to be a delicate exclusion of her husband from the affair and a certain disguise of herself to alien eyes the superscription to mrs marion macewan from mollie bunker to be called for by hand at todos santos also struck her as a marvel of ingenuity the package was safely and punctually delivered by zephas who brought back a small packet directed to her which on private examination proved to contain a letter addressed to j e kirby to be called for with the hurried line a thousand thanks w m mrs bunker drew a long quick breath he might have written more he might havebut the wish remained still unformulated the next day she ran up a signal the same boat and solitary rower appeared around the point and took the package a week later when her husband was ready for sea she again hoisted her signal it brought a return package for mexico which she inclosed and readdressed and gave to her husband the recurrence of this incident apparently struck a bright idea from the simple zephas  look here mollie why dont you come yourself and see your aunt i cant go into port without a license and them port charges cost a heap o red tape for theyve got a filibuster scare on down there just now but you can go ashore in the boat and ill get permission from the secretary to stand off and wait for you there for twentyfour hours mrs bunker flushed and paled at the thought she could see him the letter would be sufficient excuse the distrust suggested by her husband would give color to her delivering it in person there was perhaps a brief twinge of conscience in taking this advantage of zephas kindness but the next moment with that peculiar logic known only to the sex she made the unfortunate mans suggestion a condonation of her deceit she hadnt asked to go he had offered to take her he had only himself to thank  meantime the political excitement in which she had become a partisan without understanding or even conviction presently culminated with the presidential campaign and the election of abraham lincoln the intrigues of southern statesmen were revealed in open expression and echoed in california by those citizens of southern birth and extraction who had long held place power and opinion there there were rumors of secession of california joining the south or of her founding an independent pacific empire a note from j e kirby informed mrs bunker that she was to carefully retain any correspondence that might be in her hands until further orders almost at the same time that zephas as regretfully told her that his projected southern trip had been suspended mrs bunker was disappointed and yet in some singular conditions of her feelings felt relieved that her meeting with marion was postponed it is to be feared that some dim conviction unworthy a partisan that in the magnitude of political events her own petty personality might be overlooked by her hero tended somewhat to her resignation  meanwhile the seasons had changed the winter rains had set in the trade winds had shifted to the southeast and the cottage although strengthened enlarged and made more comfortable through the good fortunes of the bunkers was no longer sheltered by the cliff but was exposed to the full strength of the pacific gales there were long nights when she could hear the rain fall monotonously on the shingles or startle her with a short sharp reveille en the windows there were brief days of flying clouds and drifting sunshine and intervals of dull gray shadow when the heaving white breakers beyond the gate slowly lifted themselves and sank before her like wraiths of warning at such times in her accepted solitude mrs bunker gave herself up to strange moods and singular visions the more audacious and more striking it seemed to her from their very remoteness and the difficulty she was beginning to have in materializing them the actual personality of wynyard marion as she knew it in her one interview had become very shadowy and faint in the months that passed yet when the days were heavy she sometimes saw herself standing by his side in some vague tropical surroundings and hailed by the multitude as the faithful wife and consort of the great leader president emperorshe knew not what exactly how this was to be managed and the manner of zephas effacement from the scene never troubled her childish fancy and it is but fair to say her womans conscience in the logic before alluded to it seemed to her that all ethical responsibility for her actions rested with the husband who had unduly married her nor were those visions always roseate in the wild declamation of that exciting epoch which filled the newspapers there was talk of short shrift with traitors so there were days when the sudden onset of a squall of hail against her window caused her to start as if she had heard the sharp fusillade of that file of muskets of which she had sometimes read in history  one day she had a singular fright she had heard the sound of oars falling with a precision and regularity unknown to her she was startled to see the approach of a large eightoared barge rowed by men in uniform with two officers wrapped in cloaks in the stern sheets and before them the glitter of musket barrels the two officers appeared to be conversing earnestly and occasionally pointing to the shore and the bluff above for an instant she trembled and then an instinct of revolt and resistance followed she hurriedly removed the ring which she usually wore when alone from her finger slipped it with the packet under the mattress of her bed and prepared with blazing eyes to face the intruders but when the boat was beached the two officers with scarcely a glance towards the cottage proceeded leisurely along the shore relieved yet it must be confessed a little piqued at their indifference she snatched up her hat and sallied forth to confront them  i suppose you dont know that this is private property she said sharply  the group halted and turned towards her the orderly who was following turned his face aside and smiled the younger officer demurely lifted his cap the elder gray handsome in a generals uniform after a moments halfastounded halfamused scrutiny of the little figure gravely raised his gauntleted fingers in a military salute  i beg your pardon madam but i am afraid we never even thought of that we are making a preliminary survey for the government with a possible view of fortifying the bluff it is very doubtful if you will be disturbed in any rights you may have but if you are the government will not fail to make it good to you he turned carelessly to the aide beside him i suppose the bluff is quite inaccessible from here  i dont know about that general they say that marion after he killed henderson escaped down this way said the young man  indeed what good was that how did he get away from here  they say that mrs fairfax was hanging round in a boat waiting for him the story of the escape is all out now  they moved away with a slight perfunctory bow to mrs bunker only the younger officer noting that the pert pretty little western woman wasnt as sharp and snappy to his superior as she had at first promised to be  she turned back to the cottage astounded angry and vaguely alarmed who was this mrs fairfax who had usurped her fame and solitary devotion there was no woman in the boat that took him off it was equally well known that he went in the ship alone if they had heard that some woman was with him herewhy should they have supposed it was mrs fairfax zephas might know somethingbut he was away the thought haunted her that day and the next on the third came a more startling incident  she had been wandering along the edge of her domain in a state of restlessness which had driven her from the monotony of the house when she heard the barking of the big newfoundland dog which zephas had lately bought for protection and company she looked up and saw the boat and its solitary rower at the landing she ran quickly to the house to bring the packet as she entered she started back in amazement for the sittingroom was already in possession of a woman who was seated calmly by the table  the stranger turned on mrs bunker that frankly insolent glance and deliberate examination which only one woman can give another in that glance mrs bunker felt herself in the presence of a superior even if her own eyes had not told her that in beauty attire and bearing the intruder was of a type and condition far beyond her own or even that of any she had known it was the more crushing that there also seemed to be in this haughty woman the same incongruousness and sharp contrast to the plain and homely surroundings of the cottage that she remembered in him  yo aw mrs bunker i believe she said in languid southern accents how de doh  i am mrs bunker said mrs bunker shortly  and so this is where cunnle marion stopped when he waited fo the boat to take him off said the stranger glancing lazily around and delaying with smiling insolence the explanation she knew mrs bunker was expecting the cunnle said it was a pooh enough place but i dont see it i reckon however he was too worried to judge and glad enough to get off yo ought to have made him talkhe generally dont want much prompting to talk to women if theyre pooty  he didnt seem in a hurry to go said mrs bunker indignantly the next moment she saw her error even before the cruel handsome smile of her unbidden guest revealed it  i thought so she said lazily this is the place and heres where the cunnle stayed only yo oughtnt have given him and yoself away to the first stranger quite so easy the cunnle might have taught yo that the two or three hours he was with yo  what do you want with me demanded mrs bunker angrily  i want a letter yo have for me from cunnle marion  i have nothing for you said mrs bunker i dont know who you are  you ought to considering youve been acting as messenger between the cunnle and me said the lady coolly  thats not true said mrs bunker hotly to combat an inward sinking  the lady rose with a lazy languid grace walked to the door and called still lazily o pedro  the solitary rower clambered up the rocks and appeared on the cottage threshold  is this the lady who gave you the letters for me and to whom you took mine  si senora  they were addressed to a mr kirby said mrs bunker sullenly how was i to know they were for mrs kirby  mr kirby mrs kirby and myself are all the same you dont suppose the cunnle would give my real name and address did you address yor packet to his real name or to some one else did you let your husband know who they were for  oddly a sickening sense of the meanness of all these deceits and subterfuges suddenly came over mrs bunker without replying she went to her bedroom and returned with colonel marions last letter which she tossed into her visitors lap  thank yo mrs bunker ill be sure to tell the cunnle how careful yo were not to give up his correspondence to everybody itll please him mo than to hear yo are wearing his ringwhich everybody knowsbefore people  he gave it to mehehe knew i wouldnt take money said mrs bunker indignantly  he didnt have any to give said the lady slowly as she removed the envelope from her letter and looked up with a dazzling but cruel smile a sothn gentleman dont fill up his pockets when he goes out to fight he dont tuck his maws bible in his breastpocket clap his dear aunties locket big as a cheese plate over his heart nor let his sole leather cigyar case that his gyrl gave him lie round him in spots when he goes out to take another gentlemans fire he leaves that to yanks  did you come here to insult my husband said mrs bunker in the rage of desperation  to insult yo husband welli came here to get a letter that his wife received from his political and natural enemy andperhaps i did with a side glance at mrs bunkers crimson cheek she added carelessly i have nothing against captain bunker hes a straightforward man and must go with his kind he helped those hounds of vigilantes because he believes in them we couldnt bribe him if we wanted to and we dont  if she only knew something of this womans relations to marionwhich she only instinctively suspectedand could retaliate upon her mrs bunker felt she would have given up her life at that moment  colonel marion seems to find plenty that he can bribe she said roughly and ive yet to know who you are to sit in judgment on them youve got your letter take it and go when he wants to send you another through me somebody else must come for it not you thats all  she drew back as if to let the intruder pass but the lady without moving a muscle finished the reading of her letter then stood up quietly and began carefully to draw her handsome cloak over her shoulders yo want to know who i am mrs bunker she said arranging the velvet collar under her white oval chin well im a sothn woman from figinya and im figinyan first last and all the time she shook out her sleeves and the folds of her cloak i believe in state rights and slaveryif you know what that means i hate the north i hate the east i hate the west i hate this nigger government id kill that man lincoln quicker than lightning she began to draw down the fingers of her gloves holding her shapely hands upright before her im hard and fast to the cause i gave up house and niggers for it she began to button her gloves at the wrist with some difficulty tightly setting together her beautiful lips as she did so i gave up my husband for it and i went to the man who loved it better and had risked more for it than ever he had cunnle marions my friend im mrs fairfax josephine hardee that was his disciple and follower well maybe those puritanical nothn folks might give it another name  she moved slowly towards the door but on the threshold paused as colonel marion had and came back to mrs bunker with an outstretched hand i dont see that yo and me need quoll i didnt come here for that i came here to see yor husband and seeing yo i thought it was only right to talk squarely to yo as yo understand i wouldnt talk to yor husband mrs bunker i want yor husband to take me awayi want him to take me to the cunnle if i tried to go in any other way id be watched spied upon and followed and only lead those hounds on his track i dont expect yo to ask yo husband for me but only not to interfere when i do  there was a touch of unexpected weakness in her voice and a look of pain in her eyes which was not unlike what mrs bunker had seen and pitied in marion but they were the eyes of a woman who had humbled her and mrs bunker would have been unworthy her sex if she had not felt a cruel enjoyment in it yet the dominance of the stranger was still so strong that she did not dare to refuse the proffered hand she however slipped the ring from her finger and laid it in mrs fairfaxs palm  you can take that with you she said with a desperate attempt to imitate the others previous indifference i shouldnt like to deprive you and your friend of the opportunity of making use of it again as for my husband i shall say nothing of you to him as long as you say nothing to him of mewhich i suppose is what you mean  the insolent look came back to mrs fairfaxs face i reckon yo re right she said quietly putting the ring in her pocket as she fixed her dark eyes on mrs bunker and the ring may be of use again goodby mrs bunker  she waved her hand carelessly and turning away passed out of the house a moment later the boat and its two occupants pushed from the shore and disappeared round the point  then mrs bunker looked round the room and down upon her empty finger and knew that it was the end of her dream it was all over nowindeed with the picture of that proud insolent woman before her she wondered if it had ever begun this was the woman she had allowed herself to think she might be this was the woman he was thinking of when he sat there this was the mrs fairfax the officers had spoken of and who had made hermrs bunkerthe gobetween for their lovemaking all the work that she had done for him the deceit she had practiced on her husband was to bring him and this woman together and they both knew it and had no doubt laughed at her and her pretensions  it was with a burning cheek that she thought how she had intended to go to marion and imagined herself arriving perhaps to find that shameless woman already there in her vague unformulated longings she had never before realized the degradation into which her foolish romance might lead her she saw it now that humiliating moral lesson we are all apt to experience in the accidental display of our own particular vices in the person we hate she had just felt in mrs fairfaxs presence with it came the paralyzing fear of her husbands discovery of her secret secure as she had been in her dull belief that he had in some way wronged her by marrying her she for the first time began to doubt if this condoned the deceit she had practiced on him the tribute mrs fairfax had paid himthis appreciation of his integrity and honesty by an enemy and a woman like herselftroubled her frightened her and filled her with her first jealousy what if this woman should tell him all what if she should make use of him as marion had of her zephas was a strong northern partisan but was he proof against the guileful charms of such a devil she had never thought before of questioning his fidelity to her she suddenly remembered now some rough pleasantries of captain simmons in regard to the inconstancy of his calling no there was but one thing for her to do she would make a clean breast to him she would tell him everything she had done except the fatal fancy that compelled her to it she began to look for his coming now with alternate hope and fearwith unabated impatience the night that he should have arrived passed slowly morning came but not zephas when the mist had lifted she ran impatiently to the rocks and gazed anxiously towards the lower bay there were a few gray sails scarce distinguishable above the grayer waterbut they were not his she glanced half mechanically seaward and her eyes became suddenly fixed there was no mistake she knew the rigshe could see the familiar white lapstreak as the vessel careened on the starboard tackit was her husbands schooner slowly creeping out of the golden gate   part iii   her first wild impulse was to run to the cove for the little dingey always moored there and to desperately attempt to overtake him but the swift consciousness of its impossibility was followed by a dull bewildering torpor that kept her motionless helplessly following the vessel with straining eyes as if they could evoke some response from its decks she was so lost in this occupation that she did not see that a pilotboat nearly abreast of the cove had put out a twooared gig which was pulling quickly for the rocks when she saw it she trembled with the instinct that it brought her intelligence she was right it was a brief note from her husband informing her that he had been hurriedly dispatched on a short sea cruise that in order to catch the tide he had not time to go ashore at the bluff but he would explain everything on his return her relief was only partial she was already experienced enough in his vocation to know that the excuse was a feeble one he could easily have fetched the bluff in tacking out of the gate and have signaled to her to board him in her own boat the next day she locked up her house rowed round the point to the embarcadero where the bay steamboats occasionally touched and took up passengers to san francisco captain simmons had not seen her husband this last trip indeed did not know that he had gone out of the bay mrs bunker was seized with a desperate idea she called upon the secretary of the fishing trust that gentle man was businesslike but neither expansive nor communicative her husband had not been ordered out to sea by them she ought to know that captain bunker was now his own master choosing his own fishing grounds and his own times and seasons he was not aware of any secret service for the company in which captain bunker was engaged he hoped mrs bunker would distinctly remember that the little matter of the duel to which she referred was an old bygone affair and never anything but a personal matter in which the fishery had no concern whatever and in which he certainly should not again engage he would advise mrs bunker if she valued her own good and especially her husbands to speedily forget all about it these were ugly times as it was if mrs bunkers services had not been properly rewarded or considered it was certainly a great shame but really he could not be expected to make it good certain parties had cost him trouble enough already besides really she must see that his position between her husband whom he respected and a certain other party was a delicate one but mrs bunker heard no more she turned and ran down the staircase carrying with her a burning cheek and blazing eye that somewhat startled the complacent official  she did not remember how she got home again she had a vague recollection of passing through the crowded streets wondering if the people knew that she was an outcast deserted by her husband deceived by her ideal hero repudiated by her friends men had gathered in knots before the newspaper offices excited and gesticulating over the bulletin boards that had such strange legends as the crisis details of an alleged conspiracy to overthrow the government the assassin of henderson to the fore again rumored arrests on the mexican frontier sometimes she thought she understood the drift of them even fancied they were the outcome of her visitas if her very presence carried treachery and suspicion with itbut generally they only struck her benumbed sense as a dull meaningless echo of something that had happened long ago when she reached her house late that night the familiar solitude of shore and sea gave her a momentary relief but with it came the terrible conviction that she had forfeited her right to it that when her husband came back it would be hers no longer and that with their meeting she would know it no more for through all her childish vacillation and imaginings she managed to cling to one steadfast resolution she would tell him everything and know the worst perhaps he would never come perhaps she should not be alive to meet him  and so the days and nights slowly passed the solitude which her previous empty deceit had enabled her to fill with such charming visions now in her awakened remorse seemed only to protract her misery had she been a more experienced though even a more guilty woman she would have suffered less without sympathy or counsel without even the faintest knowledge of the world or its standards of morality to guide her she accepted her isolation and friendlessness as a necessary part of her wrongdoing her only criterion was her enemymrs fairfaxand she could seek her relief by joining her lover but mrs bunker knew now that she herself had never had oneand was alone mrs fairfax had broken openly with her husband but she had deceived hers and the experience and reckoning were still to come in her miserable confession it was not strange that this half child half woman sometimes looked towards that gray sea eternally waiting for herthat sea which had taken everything from her and given her nothing in returnfor an obliterating and perhaps exonerating death  the third day of her waiting isolation was broken upon by another intrusion the morning had been threatening with an opaque motionless livid arch above which had taken the place of the usual flying scud and shaded cloud masses of the rainy season the whole outlying ocean too beyond the bar appeared nearer and even seemed to be lifted higher than the bay itself and was lit every now and then with wonderful clearness by long flashes of breaking foam like summer lightning she knew that this meant a southwester and began with a certain mechanical deliberation to set her little domain in order against the coming gale she drove the cows to the rude shed among the scrub oaks she collected the goats and young kids in the corral and replenished the stock of fuel from the woodpile she was quite hidden in the shrubbery when she saw a boat making slow headway against the wind towards the little cove where but a moment before she had drawn up the dingey beyond the reach of breaking seas it was a whaleboat from saucelito containing a few men as they neared the landing she recognized in the man who seemed to be directing the boat the second friend of colonel marionthe man who had come with the secretary to take him off but whom she had never seen again in her present horror of that memory she remained hidden determined at all hazards to avoid a meeting when they had landed one of the men halted accidentally before the shrubbery where she was concealed as he caught his first view of the cottage which had been invisible from the point they had rounded  look here bragg he said turning to marions friend in a voice which was distinctly audible to mrs bunker what are we to say to these people  theres only one returned the other the mans at sea his wifes here shes all right  you said she was one of us  after a fashion shes the woman who helped marion when he was here i reckon he made it square with her from the beginning for she forwarded letters from him since but you can tell her as much or as little as you find necessary when you see her  yes but we must settle that now said bragg sharply and i propose to tell her nothing im against having any more petticoats mixed up with our affairs i propose to make an examination of the place without bothering our heads about her  but we must give some reason for coming here and we must ask her to keep dark or well have her blabbing to the first person she meets urged the other  shes not likely to see anybody before night when the brig will be in and the men and guns landed move on and let jim take soundings off the cove while i look along the shore its just as well that theres a house here and a little cover like thispointing to the shrubberyto keep the men from making too much of a show until after the earthworks are up there are sharp eyes over at the fort  there dont seem to be any one in the house now returned the other after a moments scrutiny of the cottage or the woman would surely come out at the barking of the dog even if she hadnt seen us likely shes gone to saucelito  so much the better just as well that she should know nothing until it happens afterwards well settle with the husband for the price of possession he has only a squatters rights come along well have bad weather before we get back round the point again but so much the better for it will keep off any inquisitive longshore cruisers  they moved away but mrs bunker stung through her benumbed and brooding consciousness and made desperate by this repeated revelation of her former weakness had heard enough to make her feverish to hear more she knew the intricacies of the shrubbery thoroughly she knew every foot of shade and cover of the clearing and creeping like a cat from bush to bush she managed without being discovered to keep the party in sight and hearing all the time it required no great discernment even for an inexperienced woman like herself at the end of an hour to gather their real purpose it was to prepare for the secret landing of an armed force disguised as laborers who under the outward show of quarrying in the bluff were to throw up breastworks and fortify the craggy shelf the landing was fixed for that night and was to be effected by a vessel now cruising outside the heads  she understood it all now she remembered marions speech about the importance of the bluff for military purposes she remembered the visit of the officers from the fort opposite the strangers were stealing a march upon the government and by night would be in possession it was perhaps an evidence of her newly awakened and larger comprehension that she took no thought of her loss of home and propertyperhaps there was little to draw her to it nowbut was conscious only of a more terrible catastrophea catastrophe to which she was partly accessory of which any other woman would have warned her husbandor at least those officers of the fort whose business it was toah yes the officers of the fortonly just opposite to her she trembled and yet flushed with an inspiration it was not too late yetwhy not warn them now  but how a message sent by saucelito and the steamboat to san franciscothe usual waywould not reach them tonight to go herself rowing directly across in the dingey would be the only security of success if she could do it it was a long pullthe sea was getting upbut she would try  she waited until the last man had stepped into the boat in nervous dread of some one remaining then when the boat had vanished round the point again she ran back to the cottage arrayed herself in her husbands pilot coat hat and boots and launched the dingey it was a heavy slow but luckily a stanch and seaworthy boat it was not until she was well off shore that she began to feel the full fury of the wind and waves and knew the difficulty and danger of her undertaking she had decided that her shortest and most direct course was within a few points of the wind but the quartering of the waves on the broad bluff bows of the boat tended to throw it to leeward a movement that while it retarded her forward progress no doubt saved the little craft from swamping again the feebleness and shortness of her stroke which never impelled her through a rising wave but rather lifted her half way up its face prevented the boat from taking much water while her steadfast gaze fixed only on the slowly retreating shore kept her steering free from any fatal nervous vacillation which the sight of the threatening seas on her bow might have produced preserved through her very weakness ignorance and simplicity of purpose the dingey had all the security of a drifting boat yet retained a certain gentle but persistent guidance in this feminine fashion she made enough headway to carry her abreast of the point where she met the reflux current sweeping round it that carried her well along into the channel now sluggish with the turn of the tide after half an hours pulling she was delighted to find herself again in a reverse current abreast of her cottage but steadily increasing her distance from it she was in fact on the extreme outer edge of a vast whirlpool formed by the force of the gale on a curving lee shore and was being carried to her destination in a semicircle around that bay which she never could have crossed she was moving now in a line with the shore and the fort whose flagstaff above its green square and white quarters she could see distinctly and whose lower water battery and landing seemed to stretch out from the rocks scarcely a mile ahead protected by the shore from the fury of the wind and even of the sea her progress was also steadily accelerated by the velocity of the current mingling with the ebbing tide a sudden fear seized her she turned the boats head towards the shore but it was swept quickly round again she redoubled her exertions tugging frantically at her helpless oars she only succeeded in getting the boat into the trough of the sea where after a lurch that threatened to capsize it it providentially swung around on its short keel and began to drift stern on she was almost abreast of the battery now she could hear the fitful notes of a bugle that seemed blown and scattered above her head she even thought she could see some men in blue uniforms moving along the little pier she was passing it another fruitless effort to regain her ground but she was swept along steadily towards the gate the whitening bar and the open sea  she knew now what it all meant this was what she had come for this was the end beyond only a little beyond just a few moments longer to wait and then out there among the breakers was the rest that she had longed for but had not dared to seek it was not her fault they could not blame her he would come back and never know what had happenednor even know how she had tried to atone for her deceit and he would find his house in possession ofofthose devils no no she must not die yet at least not until she had warned the fort she seized the oars again with frenzied strength the boat had stopped under the unwonted strain staggered tried to rise in an uplifted sea took part of it over her bow struck down mrs bunker under half a ton of blue water that wrested the oars from her paralyzed hands like playthings swept them over the gunwale and left her lying senseless in the bottom of the boat    hold harrdor youll run her down  now then rileylook aliveis it slapin ye are  hold yer jaw flanigan and stand ready with the boathook now then hold harrd  the sudden jarring and tilting of the waterlogged boat a sound of rasping timbers the swarming of men in shirtsleeves and blue trousers around her seemed to rouse her momentarily but she again fainted away  when she struggled back to consciousness once more she was wrapped in a soldiers jacket her head pillowed on the shirtsleeve of an artillery corporal in the stern sheets of that eightoared government barge she had remembered but the only officer was a bareheaded boyish lieutenant and the rowers were an athletic but unseamanlike crew of mingled artillerymen and infantry  and where did ye drift from darlint  mrs bunker bridled feebly at the epithet  i didnt drift i was going to the fort  the fort is it  yes i want to see the general  wadnt the liftenant do ye or shure theres the adjutant hes a foine man  silence flanigan said the young officer sharply then turning to mrs bunker he said dont mind him but let his wife take you to the canteen when we get in and get you some dry clothes  but mrs bunker spurred to convalescence at the indignity protested stiffly and demanded on her arrival to be led at once to the generals quarters a few officers who had been attracted to the pier by the rescue acceded to her demand  she recognized the grayhaired handsome man who had come ashore at her house with a touch of indignation at her treatment she briefly told her story but the general listened coldly and gravely with his eyes fixed upon her face  you say you recognized in the leader of the party a man you had seen before under what circumstances  mrs bunker hesitated with burning cheeks he came to take colonel marion from our place  when you were hiding himyes weve heard the story now mrs bunker may i ask you what you as a southern sympathizer expect to gain by telling me this story  but here mrs bunker burst out i am not a southern sympathizer never never never im a union womanwife of a northern man i helped that man before i knew who he was any christian northerner or southerner would have done the same  her sincerity and passion were equally unmistakable the general rose opened the door of the adjoining room said a few words to an orderly on duty and returned what you are asking of me mrs bunker is almost as extravagant and unprecedented as your story you must understand as well as your husband that if i land a force on your property it will be to take possession of it in the name of the government for government purposes  yes yes said mrs bunker eagerly i know that i am willing zephas will be willing  and continued the general fixing his eyes on her face you will also understand that i may be compelled to detain you here as a hostage for the safety of my men  oh no no please said mrs bunker springing up with an imploring feminine gesture i am expecting my husband he may be coming back at any moment i must be there to see him first please let me go back sir with your men put me anywhere ashore between them and those men that are coming lock me up keep me a prisoner in my own home do anything else if you think i am deceiving you but dont keep me here to miss him when he comes  but you can see him later said the general  but i must see him first said mrs bunker desperately i must see him first forforhe knows nothing of this he knows nothing of my helping colonel marion he knows nothing ofhow foolish i have been andhe must not know it from others there it was out at last she was sobbing now but her pride was gone she felt relieved and did not even notice the presence of two or three other officers who had entered the room exchanged a few hurried words with their superior and were gazing at her in astonishment  the generals brow relaxed and he smiled very well mrs bunker it shall be as you like then you shall go and meet your husband with captain jennings hereindicating one of the officerswho will take charge of you and the party  and said mrs bunker looking imploringly through her wet but pretty lashes at the officer he wont say anything to zephas either  not a syllable said captain jennings gravely but while the tug is getting ready general hadnt mrs bunker better go to mrs flanigan  i think not said the general with a significant look at the officer as he gallantly offered his arm to the astonished mrs bunker if she will allow me the pleasure of taking her to my wife  there was an equally marked respect in the manner of the men and officers as mrs bunker finally stepped on board the steam tug that was to convey the party across the turbulent bay but she heeded it not neither did she take any concern of the still furious gale the difficult landing the preternatural activity of the band of sappers who seemed to work magic with their picks and shovels the shelter tents that arose swiftly around her the sheds and bush inclosures that were evoked from the very ground beneath her feet the wonderful skill order and discipline that in a few hours converted her straggling dominion into a formal camp even to the sentinel who was already calmly pacing the rocks by the landing as if he had being doing it for years only one thing thrilled herthe sudden outburst fluttering and snapping of the national flag from her little flagstaff he would see itand perhaps be pleased  and indeed it seemed as if the men had caught the infection of her anxiety for when her strained eyes could no longer pierce the murky twilight settling over the gate one came running to her to say that the lookout had just discovered through his glass a closereefed schooner running in before the wind it was her husband and scarcely an hour after night had shut in the schooner had rounded to off the point dropped her boat and sped away to anchorage and then mrs bunker running bareheaded down the rocks breaking in upon the hurried explanation of the officer of the guard threw herself upon her husbands breast and sobbed and laughed as if her heart would break  nor did she scarcely hear his hurried comment to the officer and unconscious corroboration of her story how a brig had raced them from the gate was heading for the bar but suddenly sheered off and put away to sea again as if from some signal from the headland yesthe bluff interrupted captain jennings bitterly i thought of that but the old man said it was more diplomatic just now to prevent an attempt than even to successfully resist it  but when they were alone again in their little cottage and zephas honest eyeswith no trace of evil knowledge or suspicion in their homely neutral lightnesswere looking into hers with his usual simple trustfulness mrs bunker trembled whimpered andi grieve to saybasely funked her boasted confession but here the deity which protects feminine weakness intervened with the usual miracle as he gazed at his wifes troubled face an apologetic cloud came over his rugged but open brow and a smile of awkward deprecating embarrassment suffused his eyes i declare to goodness mollie but i must tell you suthin although i guess i didnt kalkilate to say a word about it but darn it all i cant keep it in no lookin inter that innercent face o yournpressing her flushing cheeks between his cool brown handsand gazing inter them two truthful eyesthey blinked at this moment with a divine modestyand thinkin of what youve just did for your kentrylike them revolutionary women o 76i feel like a darned swab of a traitor myself well what i want ter tell you is this ye know or yeve heard me tell o that mrs fairfax as left her husband for that fireeatin marion and stuck to him through thick and thin and stood watch and watch with him in this howlin southern rumpus theyre kickin up all along the coast as if she was a man herself well jes as i hauled up at the wharf at frisco she comes aboard  youre cap bunker she says  thats me maam i says  youre a northern man and you go with your kind sez she but youre a white man and thars no cur blood in you but you aint listenin mollie youre dead tired lasswith a commiserating look at her now whitening faceand ill haul in line and wait well to cut it short she wanted me to take her down the coast a bit to where she could join marion she said shed been shook by his friends followed by spiesand blame my skin mollie ef that proud woman didnt break down and cry like a baby now mollie what got me in all this was that them chivalry folksez was always jawin about their southern dames and their ladye fairs and always runnin that kind of bilge water outer their scuppers whenever they careened over on a fair windwas jes the kind to throw off on a woman when they didnt want her and i kinder thought id like her to see the difference betwixt the latitude o charleston and cape cod so i told her i didnt want the jewelry and dimons she offered me but if she would come down to the wharf after dark id smuggle her aboard and id allow to the men that she was your auntie ez i was givin a free passage to lord dear think o me takin the name o mollie bunkers aunt in vain for that sort o woman think o me continued captain bunker with a tentative chuckle sort o pretendin to hand yor auntie to kernel marion forfor his lady love i dont wonder yes half frighted and half laffin he added as his wife uttered a hysterical cry it was awful but it worked and i got her off and wots more i got her shipped to mazatlan where shell join marion and the two are goin back to virginy where i guess they wont trouble californy again ye know now deary he went on speaking with difficulty through mrs bunkers clinging arms and fast dripping tears why i didnt heave to to say goodby but its all over nowive made a clean breast of it mollieand dont you cry  but it was not all over for a moment later captain bunker began to fumble in his waistcoat pocket with the one hand that was not clasping his wifes waist one thing more mollie when i left her and refused to take any of her dimons she put a queer sort o ring into my hand and told me with a kind o mischievious bedevilin smile that i must keep it to remember her by here it iswhy mollie lass are you crazy  she had snatched it from his fingers and was running swiftly from the cottage out into the tempestuous night he followed closely until she reached the edge of the rocks and only then in the struggling fastflying moonlight she raised a passionate hand and threw it far into the sea  as he led her back to the cottage she said she was jealous and honest captain bunker with his arm around her felt himself the happiest man in the world    from that day the flag flew regularly over the rocky shelf and in time bugles and morning drumbeats were wafted from it to the decks of passing ships for the federal government had adjudged the land for its own use paid captain bunker a handsome sum for its possession and had discreetly hidden the little cottage of mrs bunker and its history forever behind bastion and casemate     the transformation of buckeye camp   part i   the tiny lights that had been far scattered and intermittent as fireflies all along the dark stream at last dropped out one by one leaving only the three windows of parks emporium to pierce the profoundly wooded banks of the south fork so allpervading was the darkness that the mere opening of the emporium front door shot out an illuminating shaft which revealed the whole length of the little main street of buckeye while the simple passing of a single figure before one of the windows momentarily eclipsed a third of the settlement this undue preeminence given to the only three citizens of buckeye who were still up at ten o clock seemed to be hardly justified by their outward appearance which was that of ordinary longbearded and longbooted river bar miners two sat upon the counter with their hands upon their knees the third leaned beside the open window  it was very quiet the faint far barking of a dog or an occasional subdued murmur from the river shallows audible only when the wind rose slightly helped to intensify their solitude so supreme had it become that when the man at the window at last continued his conversation meditatively with his face towards it he seemed to be taking all nature into his confidence  the worst thing about it is that the only way we can keep her out of the settlement is by the same illegal methods which we deplore in other camps we have always boasted that buckeye could get along without vigilance committees or regulators  yes and that was because we started it on the principle of original selection which we are only proposing to continue replied one of the men on the counter so theres nothing wrong about our sending a deputation to wait upon her to protest against her settling here and give her our reasons  yes only it has all the impudence without the pluck of the regulators you demand what you are afraid to enforce come parks you know she has all the rights on her side look at it squarely she proposes to open a store and sell liquor and cigars which she serves herself in the brokendown tienda which was regularly given to her people by the spanish grantee of the land were squatting on its not her fault but ours if weve adopted a line of rules which dont agree with hers to govern the settlers on her land nor should she be compelled to follow them nor because we justify our squatting here on the ground that the spanish grant isnt confirmed yet can we forbid her squatting under the same right  but look at the moral question brace consider the example the influence of such a shop kept by such a woman on the community we have the right to protect ourselvesthe majority  thats the way the lynchers talk returned brace and im not so sure about there being any moral question yet you are assuming too much there is no reason why she shouldnt run the tienda as decentlybarring the liquor sale which however is legal and for which she can get a licenseas a man could and without interfering with our morals  then what is the use of our rules  they were made for those who consented to adopt them as we all did they still bind us and if we dont choose to buy her liquor or cigars that will dispose of her and her tienda much more effectually than your protest its a pity shes a lone unprotected woman now if she only had a husband  she carries a dagger in her garter  this apparently irrelevant remark came from the man who had not yet spoken but who had been listening with the languid unconcern of one who relinquishing the labor of argument to others had consented to abide by their decision it was met with a scornful smile from each of the disputants perhaps even by an added shrug of the shoulders from the womans previous defender he was evidently not to be taken in by extraneous sentiment nevertheless both listened as the speaker slowly feeling his knees as if they were his way to a difficult subject continued with the same suggestion of stating general fact but waiving any argument himself clarkson of angels allows shes got a free gaudy pictercovered style with the boys but that she can be giltedged when she wants to rowley meadehim ez hed his skelp pulled over his eyes at one stroke foolin with a she bear over on black mountainallows it would be rather monotonous in him attemptin any familiarities with her bulstrodes brother ez was in marysville said there was a womanlike to her but not herez made it lively for the boys with a game called little monte and he dropped a hundred dollars there afore he came away they do say that about seven men got shot in marysville on account o this one or from some oneasiness that happened at her shop but then he went on slowly and deferentially as the faces of the two others were lowered and became fixed she says she tired o drunken rowdiestheres a sameness about em and it dont sell her pipes and cigars and thats why shes coming here thompson over at dry creek sez that thats where our reputation is playin us weve got her as a reward o virtoo and be dd to us but cautiously thompson aint drawed a sober breath since christmas  the three men looked in each others faces in silence the same thought occurred to each the profane thompson was right and the womans advent was the logical sequence of their own ethics two years previously the buckeye company had found gold on the south fork and had taken up claims composed mainly of careful provident and thoughtful mensome of cultivation and refinementthey had adopted a certain orderly discipline for their own guidance solely which however commended itself to later settlers already weary of the lawlessness and reckless freedom which usually attended the inception of mining settlements consequently the birth of buckeye was accompanied with no dangerous travail its infancy was free from the diseases of adolescent communities the settlers without any express prohibition had tacitly dispensed with gambling and drinking saloons following the unwritten law of example had laid aside their revolvers and mingled together peacefully when their labors were ended without a single peremptory regulation against drinking and playing or carrying lethal weapons nor had there been any test of fitness or qualification for citizenship through previous virtue there were one or two gamblers a skillful duelist and men who still drank whiskey who had voluntarily sought the camp of some such antecedents was the last speaker probably with two wives elsewhere and a possible homicidal record he had modestly held aloof from obtrusive argument  well we must have a meeting and put the question squarely to the boys tomorrow said parks gazing thoughtfully from the window the remark was followed by another long silence beyond in the darkness buckeye unconscious of the momentous question awaiting its decision slept on peacefully  i brought the keg of whiskey and brandy from red gulch today that doctor duchesne spoke of he resumed presently you know he said we ought to have some in common stock that he could always rely upon in emergencies and for use after the tule fever i didnt agree with him and told him how i had brought sam denver through an attack with quinine and arrowroot but he laughed and wanted to know if wed resolved that everybody should hereafter have the denver constitution thats the trouble with those old army surgeonsthey never can get over the heroics of their past why he told parson jennings that hed rather treat a man for jimjams than one that was dying for want of stimulants however the liquor is here and one of the things we must settle tomorrow is the question if it ought not to be issued only on duchesnes prescription when i made that point to him squarely he grinned again and wanted to know if i calculated to put the same restriction on the sale of patent medicines and drugs generally  n powder n shot contributed the indifferent man  perhaps youd better take a look at the liquor saunders said parks dismissing the ethical question you know more about it than we do it ought to be the best  saunders went behind the counter drew out two demijohns and possibly from the force of habit selected three mugs from the crockery and poured some whiskey into each before he could check himself  perhaps we had better compare tastes said brace blandly they all sipped their liquor slowly and in silence the decision was favorable better try some with water to see how it mixes said saunders lazily filling the glasses with a practiced hand this required more deliberation and they drew their chairs to the table and sat down a slight relaxation stole over the thoughtful faces of brace and parks a gentle perspiration came over the latters brow but the features and expression of saunders never changed the conversation took a broader range politics and philosophy entered into it literature and poetry were discussed by parks and brace saunders still retaining the air of a dispassionate observer ready to be convinced but abstaining from argumentand occasionally replenishing the glasses there was felt to be no inconsistency between their present attitude and their previous conversation rather it proved to them that gentlemen could occasionally indulge in a social glass together without frequenting a liquor saloon this was stated with some degree of effusion by parks and assented to with singular enthusiasm by brace saunders nodding it was also observed with great penetration by brace that in having really good specially selected liquor like that the great danger of the intoshikatn fxhe corrected himself with great deliberation the intoxicating effectsof adulterated liquors sold in drinking saloons was obviated mr brace thought also that the vitiated quality of the close air of a crowded saloon had a great deal to do with itthe excess of carbonhiche begged their pardoncarbonic acid gas undoubtedly rendered people slupid and steepy but here from the open window he walked dreamily to it and leaned out admiringly towards the dark landscape that softly slumbered without one could drink in only health and poetry  wots that said saunders looking up  i said health and poetry returned brace with some dignity i repeat  no i mean wots that noise listen  they listened so breathlessly that the soft murmur of the river seemed to flow in upon them but above it quite distinctly came the regular muffled beat of horsehoofs in the thick dust and the occasional rattle of wheels over rocky irregularities but still very far and faint and fading like the noises in a dream brace drew a long breath parks smiled and softly closed his eyes but saunders remained listening  that was over our road near the turnpike he said musingly thats queer thar aint any of the boys away tonight and thats a wagon its some one comin here hark to that there it is again  it was the same sound but more distinct and nearer and then was lost again  theyre dragging through the river sand thats just abreast o mallorys stopped there i reckon no pushin on again hear em grinding along the gravel over hamiltons trailins stopped aginthats before somervilles shanty whats gone o them now maybe theyve lost the trail and got onto grays slide through the woods its no use lookin ye couldnt see anything in this nigger dark hol on if theyre comin through the woods yell hear em again jest off here yes by thunder here they are  this time the clatter and horsehoofs were before them at the very door a mans voice cried whoa and there was a sudden bound on the veranda the door opened for an instant the entrance appeared to be filled with a mass of dazzling white flounces and a figure which from waist to crown was impenetrably wrapped and swathed in black lace somewhere beneath its folds a soft spanish yet somewhat childish voice cried tente hol on turned and vanished this was succeeded by the apparition of a silent swarthy mexican who dropped a small trunk at their feet and vanished also then the whiteflounced and blacklaced figure reappeared as the departing wagon rattled away glided to the centre of the room placed on the trunk a small foot whose lowquartered black satin slipper seemed to be held only by the toe threw back with both hands the black lace mantilla which was pinned by a rose over her little right ear and with her hands slightly extended and waving softly said mira caballeros ere we are again boys viva aow ees your mother aow ees that for high behold me just from pike  parks and brace who had partly risen fell back hopelessly in their chairs again and gazed at the figure with a feeble smile of vacuous pain and politeness at which it advanced lowered its black eyes mischievously over the table and the men who sat there poured out a glass of the liquor and said i look towards you boys dont errise you are just a leetle weary eh a leetle oh yes a leetle tired of crookin your elboweh dont care if the school keepeh dont want any pie want to go ome eh  but here mr parks rose with slight difficulty but unflinching dignity and leaned impressively over the table may i ashkmay i be permitted to arsk madam to what we may owe the pleasure of thishof thisvisit  her face and attitude instantly changed her arms dropped and caught up the mantilla with a quick but not ungraceful sweep and in apparently a single movement she was draped wrapped and muffled from waist to crown as before with a slight inclination of her head she said in quite another voice si senor i have arrive here because in your whole great town of booki there is not so much as oneshe held up a small brown fingeras much as one leetle light or fire like thees because in this grand pueblo there is not one peoples who have not already sleep in his bed but thees bueno i have arrive all the same like a leetle bird like the small fly arrive to the light not to youonly to the light i go not to my casa for she is dark and tonight she have nothing to make the fire or bed i go not to the otelthere is not

we have mooch sorrow we have to make the caballeros mooch trrouble to make disposition of his house but what will you  there was another awkward silence and then saunders who had been examining the intruder with languid criticism removed his pipe from his mouth and said quietly  thats the woman youre looking forjovita mendez   part ii   the rest of that interview has not been recorded suffice it that a few minutes later parks brace and saunders left the emporium and passed the night in the latters cabin leaving the emporium in possession of miss mendez and her peon servant that at the earliest dawn the two women and their baggage were transferred to the old adobe house where however a mexican workman had already arrived and with a basketful of red tiles was making it habitable buckeye which was popularly supposed to sleep with one eye on the river and always first repaired there in the morning to wash and work was only awake to the knowledge of the invasion at noon the meeting so confidently spoken of the night before had not been called messrs parks and brace were suffering from headachesundoubtedly a touch of tule chill saunders at work with his partner in eagle bar was as usual generous with apparently irrelevant facts on all subjectsbut that of the strangers it would seem as if the selfconstituted committee of safety had done nothing  and nothing whatever seemed to happen thompson of angels smoking a meditative pipe at noon on the trail noticed the repairing of the old adobe house casually spoke of it on his return to his work without apparent concern or exciting any comment the two billinger brothers saw jovita mendez at the door of her house an hour later were themselves seen conversing with her by jim barker but on returning to their claim neither they nor barker exhibited any insurrectionary excitement later on shuttleworth was found in possession of two bundles of freshly rolled cornhusk cigarettes and promised to get his partner some the next day but that gentleman anticipated him by nightfall nearly all buckeye had passed in procession before the little house without exhibiting any indignation or protest that night however it seemed as if the events for which the committee was waiting were really impending the adult female population of buckeye consisted of seven womenwives of miners that they would submit tamely to the introduction of a young pretty and presumably dangerous member of their own sex was not to be supposed but whatever protest they made did not pass beyond their conjugal seclusion and was apparently not supported by their husbands two or three of them under the pretext of sympathy of sex secured interviews with the fair intruder the result of which was not however generally known but a few days later mrs bob carpentera somewhat brickdusty blondewas observed wearing some black netting and a heavily flounced skirt and mrs shuttleworth in her next visit to fiddletown wore her paisley shawl affixed to her chestnut hair by a bunch of dogroses and wrapped like a plaid around her waist the seven ladies of buckeye who had never before met except on domestic errands to each others houses or on sunday attendance at the first methodist church at fiddletown now took to walking together or in their husbands company along the upper bank of the riverthe one boulevard of buckeye the third day after miss mendez arrival they felt the necessity of immediate shopping expeditions to fiddletown this operation had hitherto been confined to certain periods and restricted to the laying in of stores of rough household stuffs but it now apparently included a wider range and more ostentatious quality parks emporium no longer satisfied them and this unexpected phase of the situation was practically brought home to the proprietor in the necessity of extending the more inoffensive and peaceful part of his stock and when towards the end of the week a cartload of pretty fixtures mirrors and furniture arrived at the tienda there was a renewed demand at the emporium for articles not in stock and the consequent diverting of custom to fiddletown buckeye found itself face to face with a hitherto undreamt of and preposterous proposition it seemed that the advent of the strange woman without having yet produced any appreciable effect upon the men had already insidiously inveigled the adult female population into ostentatious extravagance  at the end of a week the little adobe house was not only rendered habitable but was even made picturesque by clean white curtains at its barred windows and some bright halfmoorish coloring of beams and rafters nearly the whole ground floor was given up to the saloon of the tienda which consisted of a small counter at one side containing bottles and glasses and another flanking it with glass cases containing cigars pipes and tobacco while the centre of the room was given up to four or five small restaurant tables the staff of jovita was no longer limited to sanchicha but had been augmented by a little old man of indefinite antiquity who resembled an aztec idol and an equally old mexican who looked not unlike a browntinted and veined tobacco leaf himself and might have stood for a sign but the genius of the place its omnipresent and allpervading goddess was jovita smiling joyous indefatigable in suavity and attention allembracing in her courtesies frank of speech and eye quick at repartee and deftly handling the slang of the day and the locality with a childlike appreciation and an infantine accent that seemed to redeem it from vulgarity or unfeminine boldness few could resist the volatile infection of her presence a smile was the only tribute she exacted and goodhumor the rule laid down for her guests if it occasionally required some mental agility to respond to her banter a californian gathering was however seldom lacking in humor yet she was always the principal performer to an admiring audience perhaps there was security in this multitude of admirers perhaps there was a saving grace in this humorous trifling the passions are apt to be serious and solitary and jovita evaded them with a jestwhich if not always delicate or witty was effective in securing the laughter of the majority and the jealousy of none  at the end of the week another peculiarity was noticed there was a perceptible increase of the mexican population who had always hitherto avoided buckeye on sunday an irish priest from el pasto said mass in a patchedup corner of the old mission ruin opposite rollinsons ford a few lounging excelsior boys were equally astonished to see jovitas red rose crest and black mantilla glide by and followed her unvarying smile and jesting salutation up to the shadow of the crumbling portal at vespers nearly all buckeye hitherto virtuously skeptical and goodhumoredly secure in works without faith made a point of attending it was alleged by some to see if jovitas glossy indianinky eyes would suffer aberration in her devotions but the rosecrested head was never lifted from the wellworn prayerbook or the brown hands which held a certain poor little cheap rosary like a childs string of battered copper coins buckeye lounged by the wall through the service with respectful tolerance and uneasy shifting legs and came away but the apparently simple event did not end there it was unconsciously charged with a tremendous import to the settlement for it was discovered the next day by mrs bob carpenter and nan shuttleworth that the methodist church at fiddletown was too far away and buckeye ought to have a preacher of its own seats were fitted up in the loft of carpenters storehouse where the reverend henry mccorkle held divine service and instituted a bible class at the end of two weeks it appeared that jovitas invasionwhich was to bring dissipation and ruin to buckeyehad indirectly brought two churches a chilling doubt like a cold mist settled along the river as the two rival processions passed on the third sunday jo bateman who had been in the habit of reclining on that day in his shirtsleeves under a tree with a novel in his hand looked gloomily after them then knocking the ashes from his pipe he rose shook hands with his partners said apologetically that he had lately got into the habit of respecting the sabbath and was too old to change again and so shook the red dust of buckeye from his feet and departed  as yet there had not been the slightest evidence of disorderly conduct on the part of the fair proprietress of the tienda nor her customers nor any drunkenness or riotous disturbance that could be at all attributed to her presence there was it is true considerable hilarity smoking and some gambling there until a late hour but this could not be said to interfere with the rest and comfort of other people a clue to the mystery of so extraordinary a propriety was given by jovita herself one day she walked into parks emporium and demanded an interview with the proprietor  you have made the rules for thees booki  yesthat isi and my friends have  and when one shall not have mind the rulewhen one have say no damn the rule what shall you make to him shall you aprison him  mr parks hastened to say with a superior yet engaging smile that it never had been necessary as the rules were obligatory upon the honor and consent of alland were never broken except he added still more engagingly she would remember in her casewith their consent  and your caballeros break not the rules  no  then they shall not break the rules of meat my tienda look i have made the rule that i shall not have a caballero drunk at my house i have made the rule that i shall not sell him the aguardiente when he have too mooch i have made the rule that when he gamble too mooch when he put up too mooch money i say no i will not that he shall i make one more rule that he shall not quarrel nor fight in my house when he quarrel and fight i say go vamos get out  and very good rules they are too miss mendez  jovita fixed her shining black eyes on the smiling parks and when he say no nevarre damn the rules when he come drunk remain drunk play high and fight you will not poonish him you will not take him out  well you see the fact is i have not the power  are you not the alcalde  no there is a justice of the peace at fiddletown but even he could do nothing to enforce your rules but if anything should happen you can make a complaint to him  bueno you have not the power i have i make not the complaint to fiddletown i make the complaint to jose perez to manuel to antonio to sanchichashe is a strong one i say chook him out they chook him out they remove him he does not rrremain enough bueno gracias senor goodaby  she was gone for the next four days parks was in a state of some anxietybut it appeared unnecessarily so whether the interview had become known along the river did not transpire but there seemed to be no reason for miss mendez to enforce her rules it was said that once when thompson of angels was a little too noisy he had been quietly conducted by his friends from the tienda without the intervention of jose the frequenters of the saloon became its police  yet the eventlong protractedcame at last it was a dry feverish breezeless afternoon when the short echoless explosion of a revolver puffed out on the river followed by another delivered so rapidly that they seemed rolled into one there was no mistaking that significant repetition one shot might have been an accident two meant intention the men dropped their picks and shovels and ranran as they never before ran in buckeyeran mechanically blindly groping at their belts and pockets for the weapons that hung there no longer ran aimlessly as to purpose but following instinctively with hurried breath and quivering nostrils the cruel scent of powder and blood ran until reaching the tienda the foremost stumbled over the body of shuttleworth came upon the halfsitting halfleaning figure of saunders against its adobe wall the doors were barred and closed and even as the crowd charged furiously forward a window was sharply shut above in their very face  stand back gentlemen lift him up whats the row what is it saunders who did it speak man  but saunders who was still supporting himself against the wall only looked at them with a singular and halfapologetic smile and then leaned forward as if to catch the eye of shuttleworth who was recovering consciousness in the uplifted arms of his companions but neither spoke  its some dd greaser inside said thompson with sudden ferocity some of her cursed crew break down the doors boys  stop  it was the voice of shuttleworth speaking with an effort he was hard hit somewhere in the groin pain and blood were coming with consciousness and movement and his face was ghastly yet there was the same singular smile of embarrassment which saunders had worn and a touch of invincible disgust in his voice as he stammered quickly dont be dd fools its no one in there its only me and him hell tell you that wont you saunders  yes said saunders leaning anxiously forward with a brightening face dn it allcant you see its onlyonly us  you and me thats all repeated shuttleworth with a feverish laugh only our dd foolishness think of it boys he gave me the lie and i drew  both of us full you knowreglar beasts said saunders sinking back against the wall kick me somebody and finish me off  i dont see any weapons here said brace gravely examining the ground  theyre inside said shuttleworth with tremulous haste we began it in therejust like hogs you know didnt we saunders bitterly  you bet said saunders faintly reglar swine  parks looked graver still and as he passed a handkerchief around the wounded mans thigh said but i dont see where you got your pistols and how you got out here  clinched you know sorter rolled over out hereandandoh dn itdont talk  he means said shuttleworth still feebly that wewegrabbed another mans sixshooter andandhe that isand theyhehe and me grabbed each other anddont you see but here becoming more involved and much weaker he discreetly fainted away  and that was all buckeye ever knew of the affair for they refused to speak of it again and dr duchesne gravely forbade any further interrogation both mens revolvers were found undischarged in their holsters hanging in their respective cabins the balls which were afterwards extracted from the two men singularly disappeared dr duchesne asserting with a grim smile that they had swallowed them        it was a frontier superstition that the ball extracted      from a gunshot wound if swallowed by the wounded man      prevented inflammation or any supervening complications  nothing could be ascertained of the facts at the tienda which at that hour of the day appeared to have been empty of customers and was occupied only by miss mendez and her retainers all surmises as to the real cause of the quarrel and the reason for the reticence of the two belligerents were suddenly and unexpectedly stopped by their departure from buckeye as soon as their condition permitted on the alleged opinion of dr duchesne that the air of the river was dangerous to their convalescence the momentary indignation against the tienda which the two combatants had checked eventually subsided altogether after all the fight had taken place outside it was not even proven that the provocation had been given at the tienda its popularity was undiminished   part iii   it was the end of the rainy season and a wet night brace and parks were looking from the window over the swollen river with faces quite as troubled as the stream below nor was the prospect any longer the same in the past two years buckeye had grown into a city they could now count a half dozen church spires from the window of the threestoried brick building which had taken the place of the old wooden emporium but they could also count the brilliantly lit windows of an equal number of saloons and gamblinghouses which glittered through the rain or to use the words of a local critic shone seven nights in the week to the gospel shops one a difficulty had arisen which the two men had never dreamed of and a struggle had taken place between the two rival powers which was developing a degree of virulence and intolerance on both sides that boded no good to buckeye the disease which its infancy had escaped had attacked its adult growth with greater violence the new american saloons which competed with jovita mendez spanish venture had substituted a brutal masculine sincerity for her veiled feminine methods there was higher play deeper drinking darker passion yet the opposition after the fashion of most reformers were casting back to the origin of the trouble in jovita and were confounding principles and growth if it had not been for her the rule would never have been broken if there was to be a cleaning out of the gambling houses she must go first  the sounds of a harp and a violin played in the nearest saloon struggled up to them with the opening and shutting of its swinging baize inner doors there was boisterous chanting from certain belated revelers in the next street which had no such remission the brawling of the stream below seemed to be echoed in the uneasy streets the quiet of the old days had departed with the sedate encompassing woods that no longer fringed the river bank the restful calm of nature had receded before the dusty outskirts of the town  its mighty unfortunate too said brace moodily that shuttleworth and saunders who havent been in the place since their row have come over from fiddletown today and are banging around town they havent said anything that i know of but their presence is quite enough to revive the old feeling against her shop the committee he added bitterly will be sure to say that not only the first gambling but the first shooting in buckeye took place there if they get up that story againno matter how quiet she has become sinceno matter what you may say as mayorit will go hard with her whats that now  they listened breathlessly above the brawling of the river the twanging of the harpplayer and the receding shouts of the revelers they could hear the hollow wooden sidewalks resounding with the dull monotonous trampling of closely following feet parks rose with a white face  brace  yes  will you stand by meand her  stand by you and her eh what good god parksyou dont mean to say youits gone as far as that  will you or wont you  the sound of the trampling had changed to a shuffling on the pavement below and then footsteps began to ascend the stairs  brace held out his hand quickly and grasped that of parks as the door opened to half a dozen men they were evidently the ringleaders of the crowd below there was no hesitation or doubt in their manner the unswerving directness which always characterized those illegal demonstrations lent it something of dignity nevertheless carpenter the spokesman flushed slightly before parks white determined face  come parks you know what were after he said bluntly we didnt come here to parley we knew your sentiments and what you think is your duty we know what we consider oursand so do you but were here to give you a chance either as mayor or if you prefer it as the oldest citizen here to take a hand in our business tonight were not ashamed of what were going to do and were willing to abide by it so theres no reason why we shouldnt speak aboveboard of it to you we even invite you to take part in our last call tonight at the hall  go whispered brace quickly youll gain time  parks face changed and he turned to carpenter enough he said gravely i reserve what i have to say of these proceedings till i join you there he stopped whispered a few words to brace and then disappeared as the men descended the stairs and joining the crowd on the pavement proceeded silently towards the town hall there was nothing in the appearance of that decorous procession to indicate its unlawful character or the recklessness with which it was charged  there were thirty or forty men already seated in the hall the meeting was brief and to the point the gambling saloons were to be cleaned out that night the tables and appliances thrown into the street and burnt the doors closed and the gamblers were to be conducted to the outskirts of the town and forbidden to enter it again on pain of death  does this yer refer to jovita mendez saloon asked a voice  to their surprise the voice was not parks but shuttleworths it was also a matter to be noted that he stood a little forward of the crowd and that there was a corresponding movement of a dozen or more men from fiddletown who apparently were part of the meeting  the chairman no 10 said there was to be no exception and certainly not for the originator of disorder in buckeye he was surprised that the question should be asked by no 72 who was an old resident of buckeye and who with no 73 had suffered from the character of that womans saloon  thats jest it said shuttleworth and ez i reckon that saunders and me did all the disorder there was and had to turn ourselves out o town on account of it i dont see jest where she could come into this affair only he turned and looked around him in one way and that way gentlemen would be for her to come here and boot one half o this kempany out o town and shoot the other half you hear methats so he stopped tugged a moment at his cravat and loosened his shirtcollar as if it impeded his utterance and went on ive got to say suthin to you gentlemen about me and saunders and this woman ive got to say suthin thats hard for a white man to say and him a married man tooive got to say that me and saunders never had no quoll never had no fight at her shop ive got to say that me and saunders got shot by jovita mendez for insultin herfor tryin to treat her as if she was the common dirt of the turnpikeand served us right ive got to say that saunders and me made a bet that for all her airs she wasnt no better than she might be and we went there drunk to try herand that we got left with two shots into us like hounds as we were thats sowasnt it saunders  with two shots inter us like hounds ez we were repeated saunders with deliberate precision  and ive got to say suthin more genlemen continued shuttleworth now entirely removing his coat and vest and apparently shaking himself free from any extraneous trammels ive got to say thisive got to say that thar aint a man in buckeye from dirty dick over yon to the mayor of this town ez hasnt tried the same thing on and got leftgot left without shootin maybe mores the pity but got left all the same and ive got to say lifting his voice that ef thats what you call disorderliness in herif thats what yor turnin this woman out o town forwhy  he stopped absolutely breathless and gasping for there was a momentary shock of surprise and shame and then he was overborne by peal after peal of inextinguishable laughter but it was the laughter that precipitated doubt enlightened justice cleared confusion andsaved them  in vain a few struggled to remind them that the question of the other saloons was still unaffected it was lost in the motion enthusiastically put and carried that the committee should instantly accompany saunders and shuttleworth to jovitas saloon to make an apology in their presence five minutes later they halted hilariously before its door but it was closed dark and silent  their sudden onset and alarm brought sanchicha to the halfopened door ah yes the senorita bueno she had just left for fiddletown with the senor parks the honorable mayor they had been married only a few moments before by the reverend mr mccorkle     their uncle from california   part i   it was bitterly cold when night fell over lakeville wisconsin the sunset which had flickered rather than glowed in the western sky took upon itself a still more boreal tremulousness until at last it seemed to fade away in cold blue shivers to the zenith nothing else stirred in the crisp still air the evening smoke of chimneys rose threadlike and vanished the stars were early pale and pitiless when the later moonlight fell it appeared only to whiten the stiffened earth like snow except where it made a dull pewterlike film over the three frozen lakes which encompassed the town  the site of the town itself was rarely beautiful and its pioneers and founders had carried out the suggestions they had found there with loving taste and intelligence  themselves old voyageurs trappers and traders they still loved nature too well to exclude her from the restful homes they had achieved after years of toiling face to face with her so a strip of primeval forest on the one side and rolling level prairie on the other still came up to the base of the hill whereon they had built certain solid houses which a second generation had beautified and improved with modern taste but which still retained their old honesty of foundation and wholesome rustic space these yet stood among the old trees military squares and broad sloping avenues of the town seen from the railway by day the regularity of streets and blocks was hidden by environing trees there remained only a picturesque lifting of rustic gardens brown roofs gables spires and cupolas above the mirroring lake seen from the railway this bitter night the invisible terraces and streets were now pricked out by symmetrical lines and curves of sparkling lights which glittered through the leafless boughs and seemed to encircle the hill like a diadem  central in the chiefest square and yet preserving its old lordly isolation in a wooded garden the homestead of enoch lane stood with all its modern additions and improvements already these included not only the latest phases of decoration but various treasures brought by the second generation from europe which they were wont to visit but from which they always contentedly returned to their little provincial town whether there was some instinctive yearning like the stirred sap of great forests in their wholesome pioneer blood or whether there was some occult fascination in the pretty towncrested hill itself it was still certain that the richest inhabitants always preferred to live in lakeville even the young who left it to seek their fortune elsewhere came back to enjoy their success under the sylvan vaults of this vast ancestral roof and that was why this 22d of december 1870 the whole household of gabriel lane was awaiting the arrival from california of his brother sylvester lane at the old homestead which he had left twenty years ago  and you dont know how he looks said kitty lane to her father  i do perfectly rather chubby with blue eyes curly hair fair skin and blushes when you speak to him  papa  ehoh well he used to you see that was twentyfive years ago when he left here for boardingschool he ran away from there as i told you went to sea and finally brought up at san francisco  and you havent had any picture or photograph of him since  nothat isi sayyou havent any of you got a picture of sylvester have you he turned in a vague parenthetical appeal to the company of relatives and friends collected in the drawingroom after dinner  cousin jane has she knows all about him  but it appeared that cousin jane had only heard susan marckland say that edward bingham had told her that he was in california when uncle sylvester had been nearly hanged by a vigilance committee for protecting a horse thief or a gambler or some such person this was felt to be ineffective as a personal description  hes sure to wear a big beard they all do when they first come back said amos gunn with metropolitan oraculousness  he has a big curling mustache long silken hair and broad shoulders said marie du page  there was such piquant conviction in the manner of the speaker who was also a very pretty girl that they all turned towards her and kitty quickly said  but youve never seen him  nobut she stopped and lifting one shoulder threw her spirited head sideways in a pretty deprecatory way with elevated eyebrows and an expression intended to show the otherwise untranslatable character of her impression but it showed quite as pleasantly the other fact that she was the daughter of a foreigner an old french military explorer and that she had retained even in anglosaxon lakeville some of the gallic animation  well how many of you girls are going with me to meet him at the station said gabriel dismissing with masculine promptness the lesser question its time to be off  id like to go said kitty and so would cousin jane but really papa you see if you dont know him and we dont either and youve got to satisfy yourself that its the right man and then introduce yourself and then usand all this on the platform before everybodyit makes it rather embarrassing for us and then as hes your younger brother and were supposed to be his affectionate nieces you know it would make him feel so ridiculous  and if he were to kiss you said marie tragically and then turn out not to be him  so continued kitty youd better take cousin john who was more in uncle sylvesters time to represent the past of the family and perhaps mr gunn  to represent the future i suppose interrupted gabriel in a wicked whisper  to represent a name that most men of the world in new york and san francisco know went on kitty without a blush it would make recognition and introduction easier and take an extra fur with you dearnot for him but for yourself i suppose hes lived so much in the open air as to laugh at our coddling  i dont know about that said her father thoughtfully the last telegram i have from him en route says hes half frozen and wants a close carriage sent to the station  of course said marie impatiently you forget the poor creature comes from burning canyons and hot golden sands and perpetual sunshine  very well but come along marie and see how ive prepared his room and as her father left the drawingroom kitty carried off her old schoolfellow upstairs  the room selected for the coming sylvester had been one of the elaborate guestchambers but was now stripped of its more luxurious furniture and arranged with picturesque yet rural extravagance a few rare buffalo bear and panther skins were disposed over the bare floor and even displayed gracefully over some elaborately rustic chairs the handsome french bedstead had been displaced for a small wroughtiron asceticlooking couch covered with a gorgeously striped mexican blanket the fireplace had been dismantled of its steel grate and the hearth extended so as to allow a pile of symmetrically heaped mosscovered hickory logs to take its place the walls were covered with trophies of the chase buckhorns and deerheads and a number of indian arrows stood in a sheaf in the corners beside a few modern guns and rifles  perfectly lovely said marie butwith a slight shiver of her expressive shouldersa little cold and outdoorish eh  nonsense returned kitty dictatorially and if he is cold he can easily light those logs they always build their open fires under a tree why even mr gunn used to do that when he was camping out in the adirondacks last summer i call it perfectly comfortable and so natural nevertheless they had both tucked their chilly hands under the fleecy shawls they had snatched from the hall for this hyperborean expedition  you have taken much pains for him kaitee said marie with her faintest foreign intonation you will like this strange uncleyou  he is a wonderful man marie hes been everywhere seen everything and done everything out there hes fought duels been captured by indians and tied to a stake to be tortured hes been leader of a vigilance committee and they say that he has often shot and killed men himself im afraid hes been rather wicked you know hes lived alone in the woods like a hermit without seeing a soul and then again hes been a chief among the indians with heaven knows how many indian wives they called him the palefaced thunderbolt my dear and the young man who swallows the lightning or something like that  and what can he want here asked marie  to see us my dear said kitty loftily and then too he has to settle something about his share of the property for you know grandpa left a share of it to him not that hes ever bothered himself about it for hes richa kind of monte cristo you knowwith a gold mine and an island off the coast to say nothing of a whole county that he owns that is called after him and millions of wild cattle that he rides among and lassos its dreadfully hard to do you know you take a long rope with a slipknot and you throw it around your head so and  hark said marie with a dramatic start and her finger on her small mouth he comes  there was the clear roll of wheels along the smooth frozen carriage sweep towards the house the sharp crisp click of hoofs on stone the opening of heavy doors the sudden sparkling invasion of frigid air the uplifting of voices in greetingbut all familiar there were gabriel lanes cheery hopeful tones the soprano of cousin jane and cousin emma the baritone of mr gunn and the grave measured oratorical utterance of parson dexter who had joined the party at the station but certainly the accents of no stranger had he come yes for his name was just then called and the quick ear of marie had detected a light lounging alien footstep cross the cold strip of marble vestibule the two girls exchanged a rapid glance each looked into the mirror and then interrogatively at the other nodded their heads affirmatively and descended to the drawingroom a group had already drawn round the fire and a small central figure who with its back turned towards them was still enwrapped in an enormous overcoat of rich fur was engaged in presenting an alternate small varnished leather boot to the warmth of the grate as they entered the room the heavy fur was yielded up with apparent reluctance and revealed to the astonished girls a man of ordinary stature with a slight and elegant figure set off by a traveling suit of irreproachable cut his light reddishyellow hair mustache and sunburned cheek which seemed all of one color and outline made it impossible to detect the gray of the one or the hollowness of the other and gave no indication of his age yet there was clearly no mistake here was gabriel lane seizing their nervously cold fingers and presenting them to their uncle sylvester  far from attempting to kiss kitty the stranger for an instant seemed oblivious of the little hand she offered him in the halfpreoccupied bow he gave her but marie was not so easily passed over and with her audacious face challenging his he abstractedly imparted to the shake of her hand something of the fervor that he should have shown his relative and then still warming his feet on the fender he seemed to have forgotten them both  accustomed as you have been sir said the reverend mr dexter seizing upon an awkward silence and accenting it laboriously perhaps i should say inured as you have been to the exciting and stirring incidents of a lawless and adventurous community you doubtless find in a pastoral yet cultivated and refined seclusion like lakeville a degree of  oh several degrees said uncle sylvester blandly flicking bits of buffalo hair from his wellfitting trousers its colder you knowmuch colder  i was referring to a less material contrast continued mr dexter with a resigned smile yet as to the mere question of cold i am told sir that in california there are certain severe regions of altitudealthough the mean temperature  i suppose out in california you fellows would say our temperature was a darned sight meaner eh broke in amos gunn with a confidential glance at the others as if offering a humorous diversion suited to the californian taste uncle sylvester did not however smile gazing critically at gunn he said thoughtfully i think not ive even known men killed for saying less than that and turned to the clergyman you are quite right some of the higher passes are very cold i was lost in one of them in 56 with a small party we were seventy miles from any settlement we had had nothing to eat for thirtysix hours our campfire melting the snow sank twelve feet below the surface the circle closed eagerly around him marie kitty and cousin jane pressing forward with excited faces even the clergyman assumed an expression of profound interest a man by the name of thompson i think continued uncle sylvester thoughtfully gazing at the fire was frozen a few yards away towards morning having been fiftyeight hours without food our last drop of whiskey exhausted and the fire extinguished we found  yes yes said half a dozen voices  we found continued uncle sylvester rubbing his hands cheerfully we found itexceedingly cold yesexceedingly cold  there was a dead silence  but you escaped said kitty breathlessly  i think so i think we all escapedthat is except thompson if his name was thompson it might have been parker continued uncle sylvester gazing with a certain languid astonishment on the eager faces around him  but how did you escape  oh somehow i dont remember exactly i dont think he went on reflectively that we had to eat thompsonif it was himat least not then nowith a faint effort of recollectionthat would have been another affair yes assuringly to the eager frightened eyes of cousin jane you are quite right that was something altogether different dear me one quite mixes up these things eh  a servant had entered and after a hurried colloquy with gabriel the latter turned to uncle sylvester  excuse me but i think there must be some mistake we brought up your luggage with youtwo trunksin the station wagon a man has just arrived with three more which he says are yours  there should be five in all i think said uncle sylvester thoughtfully  maybe there are sir i didnt count exactly said the servant  all right said uncle sylvester cheerfully turning to his brother you can put them in my room or on the landing except two marked l in a triangle they contain some things i picked up for you and the girls well look them over in the morning and if you dont mind ill excuse myself now and go to bed  but its only half past ten said gabriel remonstratingly you dont surely go to bed at half past ten  i do when i travel travel is so exhausting goodnight dont let anybody disturb themselves to come with me  he bowed languidly to the company and disappeared with a yawn gracefully disguised into a parting smile  well said cousin jane drawing a long breath  i dont believe its your uncle sylvester at all said marie vivaciously its some trick that gabriel is playing upon us and hes not even a good actorhe forgets his part  and then five trunks for one single man heavens what can he have in them said cousin emma  perhaps his confederates to spring out upon us at night after everybodys asleep  are you sure you remembered him papa said kitty sotto voce  certainly and my dear child he knows all the family history as well as you do andcontinued her father with a slight laugh that did not however conceal a certain seriousness that was new to himi only wish i understood as much about the property as he does by the way amos he broke off suddenly turning to the young man he seemed to know your people  most men in the financial world do said gunn a little superciliously  yes but he asked me if you hadnt a relative of some kind in southern california or mexico  a slight flushso slight that only the keen vivaciously observant eyes of marie noticed itpassed over the young mans face  i believe it is a known fact that our branch of the family never emigrated from their native town he said emphatically the gunns were rather peculiar and particular in that respect  then there were no offshoots from the old stock said gabriel  nevertheless this pet joke of gabriels did not dissipate the constraint and disappointment left upon the company by uncle sylvesters unsatisfying performance and early withdrawal and they separated soon after kitty and marie being glad to escape upstairs together on the landing they met two of the irish housemaids in a state of agitated exhaustion it appeared that the sthrange gintleman had requested that his bed be remade from bedclothes and bedding always carried with him in his trunks from their apologetic tone it was evident that he had liberally rewarded them shure miss protested norah in deprecation of kittys flashing eye theres thim thats lived among shnakes and poysin riptiles and faverous disayses thats particklar av the beds and sheets they lie on hisht howly mother its something else hes wanting now  the door of uncle sylvesters room had slowly opened and a blue pyjamad sleeve appeared carefully depositing the sheaf of bows and arrows outside the door i say norah or bridget there some of you take those infernal things away and look out will you for the arrowheads are deadly poison the fool who got em didnt know they were african and not indian at all and hold on the hand vanished and presently reappeared holding two rifles and take these away too theyre loaded capped and not on the halfcock a jar a fall the slightest shock is enough to send them off  im dreadfully sorry that you should find it so uncomfortable in our house uncle sylvester said kitty with a flushed cheek and vibrating voice  oh its youis it said uncle sylvesters voice cheerfully i thought it was bridget out there no i dont intend to find it uncomfortable thats why im putting these things outside but for heavens sake dont you touch them leave that to the ineffable ass who put them there goodnight  the door closed the whispering voices of the girls faded from the corridor the lights were lowered in the central hall only the red cyclopean eye of an enormous columnar stove like a lighthouse gleamed through the darkness outside the silent night sparkled glistened and finally paled towards morning having invested the sturdy wooden outer walls of the house and filmed with delicate tracery every available inch of window pane it seemed stealthily to invade the house itself stilling and chilling it as it drew closer around its central heart of warmth and life only once the frigid stillness was broken by the opening of a door and steps along the corridor this was preceded by an acrid smell of burning bark  it was subtle enough to permeate the upper floor and the bedroom of marie du page who was that night a light and nervous sleeper peering from her door she could see on the lower corridor the extraordinary spectacle of uncle sylvester robed in a gorgeous japanese dressinggown of quilted satin trimmed with the fur of the blue fox candle in hand leisurely examining the wall of the passage presently drawing out a footrule from his pocket he actually began to measure it miss du page saw no more hurriedly closing her door she locked and bolted it firmly convinced that gabriel lane was harboring in the guise of uncle sylvester a somnambulist a maniac or an impostor   part ii   it doesnt seem as if uncle sylvester was any the more comfortable for having his own private bedding with him said kitty lane entering maries room early the next morning bridget found him curled up in his furs like a cat asleep on the drawingroom sofa this morning  marie started she remembered her last nights vision but some instinctshe knew not whatkept her from revealing it at this moment she only said a little ironically  perhaps he missed the wild freedom of his barbaric life in a small bedroom  no bridget says he said something about being smoked out of his room by a ridiculous wood fire the idea as if a man brought up in the woods couldnt stand a little smoke nothats his excuse mariedo you know what i firmly believe  no said marie quickly  i firmly believe that poor man is ashamed of his past rough life and does everything he can to forget it thats why he affects those ultracivilized and effeminate ways and goes to the other extreme as people always do  then you think hes really reformed and isnt likely to take an impulse to rob and murder anybody again  why marie what nonsense  nevertheless uncle sylvester appeared quite fresh and cheerful at breakfast it seemed that he had lit the fire before undressing but the green logs were piled so far into the room that the smoke nearly suffocated him fearful of alarming the house by letting the smoke escape through the door he opened the window and when it had partly dispersed sought refuge himself from the arctic air of his bedroom in the drawingroom so far the act did not seem inconsistent with his sanity or even intelligence and consideration for others but marie fixed upon him a pair of black audacious eyes  did you ever walk in your sleep mr lane  no butthoughtfully breaking an eggi have ridden i think  in your sleep oh do tell us all about it said cousins jane and emma in chorus  uncle sylvester cast a resigned glance out of the window oh yescertainly it isnt much you see at one time i was in the habit of making long monotonous journeys and they were often exhausting and he added becoming wearied as if at the recollection always dreadfully tiresome as the trail was sometimes very uncertain and dangerous i rode a very surefooted mule that could go anywhere where there was space big enough to set her small hoofs upon one night i was coming down the slope of a mountain towards a narrow valley and river that were crossed by an old abandoned flume of which nothing was now left but the upright trestlework and long horizontal stringpiece as the trail was very difficult and the mules pace was slow i found myself dozing at times and at last i must have fallen asleep i think i must have been awakened by a singular regularity in the movement of the muleor else it was the monotony of step that had put me to sleep and the cessation of it awakened me you see at first i was not certain that i wasnt really dreaming for the trail seemed to have disappeared the wall of rock on one side had vanished also and there appeared to be nothing ahead of me but the opposite hillside  uncle sylvester stopped to look out of the window at a passing carriage then he went on the moon came out and i saw what had happened the mule either of her own free will or obeying some movement i had given the reins in my sleep had swerved from the trail got on top of the flume and was actually walking across the valley on the narrow stringpiece a foot wide half a mile long and sixty feet from the ground i knew he continued examining his napkin thoughtfully that she was perfectly surefooted and that if i kept quiet she could make the passage but i suddenly remembered that midway there was a break and gap of twenty feet in the continuous line and that the stringpiece was too narrow to allow her to turn round and retrace her steps  good heavens said cousin jane  i beg your pardon said uncle sylvester politely  i only said good heavens well she added impatiently  well repeated uncle sylvester vaguely oh thats all i only wanted to explain what i meant by saying i had ridden in my sleep  but said cousin jane leaning across the table with grim deliberation and emphasizing each word with the handle of her knife howdidyouandthatmule get down  oh with slings and ropes you knowso demonstrating by placing his napkinring in a sling made of his napkin  and i suppose you carried the slings and ropes with you in your five trunks gasped cousin jane  no fellows on the river brought em in the morning mighty spry chaps those river miners  very said cousin jane  breakfast over they were not surprised that their sybaritic guest excused himself from an inspection of the town in the frigid morning air and declined joining a skating party to the lake on the ground that he could keep warmer indoors with half the exertion an hour later found him standing before the fire in gabriel lanes study looking languidly down on his elder brother  then as far as i can see he said quietly you have made ducks and drakes of your share of the property and that virtually you are in the hands of this man gunn and his father  youre putting it too strongly said gabriel deprecatingly in the first place my investments with gunns firm are by no means failures and they only hold as security a mortgage on the forest land below the hill its scarcely worth the money i would have sold it long ago but it had been a fancy of fathers to keep it wild land for the sake of old times and the healthiness of the town  there used to be a log cabin there where the old man had a habit of camping out whenever he felt cramped by civilization up here wasnt there said uncle sylvester meditatively  yes said gabriel impatiently its still therebut to return to mr gunn he has taken a fancy to kitty and even if i could not lift the mortgage theres some possibility that the land would still remain in the family  i think ill drive over this afternoon and take a look at the old shanty if this infernal weather lets up  yes but just now my dear sylvester let us attend to business i want to show you those investments  oh certainly trot em out said his brother plucking up a simulation of interest as he took a seat at the table  from a drawer of his desk gabriel brought out a bundle of prospectuses and laid them before uncle sylvester  a languid smile of recognition lit up the latters face ah yes he said glancing at them the old lot carmelita santa maria and preciosa just as i imaginedand yet whod have thought of seeing them here a good deal rouged and powdered miss carmelita since i first knew you considerably bolstered up by miraculous testimony to your powers my dear santa maria since the day i found you out to my cost and you too preciosaa precious lot of money i dropped on you in the old days  you are joking said gabriel with an uneasy smile you dont mean to imply that this stock is old and worthless  there isnt a capital in america or europe where for the last five years it hasnt been floated with a new character each time my dear gabriel that stock isnt worth the paper it is printed on  but it is impossible that an experienced financier like gunn could be deceived  im sorry to hear that  come sylvester confess youve taken a prejudice against gunn from your sudden dislike of his son and what have you against him  i couldnt say exactly said uncle sylvester reflectively it may be his eyes or only his cravat but rising cheerfully and placing his hand lightly on his brothers shoulder dont you worry yourself about that stock old man ill see that somebody else has the worry and you the cash and as to the land andkittywell you hold on to them both until you find out which the young man is really after  and then said gabriel with a smile  dont give him either but i say havent we had enough business this morning lets talk of something else whos the french girl  marie shes the daughter of jules du pagedont you rememberfathers friend when jules died it was always thought that father who had half adopted her as a child would leave her some legacy but you know that father died without making a will and thatrich as he washis actual assets were far less than we had reason to expect kitty who felt the disappointment as keenly as her friend i believe would have divided her own share with her its odd by the way that father could have been so deceived in the amount of his capital or how he got rid of his money in a way that we knew nothing of do you know sylvester ive sometimes suspected  what said uncle sylvester suddenly  the bored languor of his face had abruptly vanished every muscle was alert his gray eyes glittered  that he advanced money to du page who lost it or that they speculated together returned gabriel who following uncle sylvesters voice only had not noticed the change of expression  that would seem to be a weakness of the lane family said uncle sylvester grimly with a return of his former carelessness but that is not your own opinionthats a suggestion of some one else  well said gabriel with a laugh and a slight addition of color it was gunns theory as a man of the world and a practical financier you know  and youve talked with him about it  yes it was a matter of general wonder years ago  very likelybut just now dont you think weve had enough financial talk said uncle sylvester with a bored contraction of his eyebrows come looking around the room youve changed the interior of the old house  yes unfortunately just after fathers death it was put in the hands of a local architect or builder one of fathers old friends but not a very skillful workman who made changes while the family were away thats why your present bedroom which was fathers old study had a slice taken off it to make the corridor larger and why the big chimney and hearthstone are still there although the fireplace is modernized that was flints stupidity  whose stupidity asked uncle sylvester trimming his nails  flintsthe old architect  why didnt you make him change it back again  he left lakeville shortly after and i brought an architect from st louis after i returned from europe but nothing could be done to your room without taking down the chimney so it remained as flint left it  that reminds me gabriel im afraid i spoke rather cavalierly to kitty last night about the arrangements of the room the fact is ive taken a fancy to it and should like to fit it up myself have i your permission  certainly my dear sylvester  ive some knickknacks in my trunks and ill do it at once  as you like  and youll see that i am not disturbed and youll explain it to kitty with my apologies  yes  then im off  gabriel glanced at his brother with a perplexed smile here was the bored traveler explorer goldseeker soldier of fortune actually as pleased as a girl over the prospect of arranging his room he called after him sylvester  yes  i say if you could you know just try to interest these people tonight with some of your adventuressomething told seriously you know as if you really were in earnestid be awfully obliged to you the fact isyoull excuse mebut they think you dont come up to your reputation  they want a story  yesone of your experiences  ill give them one tata  for the rest of the day uncle sylvester was invisible although his active presence in his room was betrayed by the sound of hammering and moving of furniture as the remainder of the party were skating on the lake this eccentricity was not remarked except by onemarie du pagewho on pretense of a slight cold had stayed at home but with her suspicions of the former night she had determined to watch the singular relative of her friend added to a natural loyalty to the lanes she was moved by a certain curiosity and fascination towards this incomprehensible man  the house was very quiet when she stole out of her room and passed softly along the corridor she examined the wall carefully to discover anything that might have excited the visitors attention there were a few large engravings hanging there could he have designed to replace them by some others suddenly she was struck with the distinct conviction that the wall of the corridor did not coincide with the wall of his room as represented by the line of the door there was certainly a space between the two walls unaccounted for this was undoubtedly what had attracted his attention but what business was it of his  she reflected that she had seen in the wall of the conservatory an old closed staircase now used as shelves for dried herbs and seeds which she had been told was the oldtime communication between the garden and grandfather lanes studythe room now occupied by the stranger perhaps it led still farther and thus accounted for the space determined to satisfy herself she noiselessly descended to the conservatory there surely was the staircasea narrow flight of wooden steps encumbered with packages of herbslosing itself in upper darkness by the aid of a candle she managed to grope and pick her way up step by step then she paused the staircase had abruptly ended on the level of the study now cut off from it by the new partition she was in a stifling inclosure formed by the walls scarcely eighteen inches wide it was made narrower by a singular excrescence on the old wall which seemed to have been a bricked closet now half destroyed and in ruins she turned to descend when a strange sound from uncle sylvesters room struck her ear it was the sound of tapping on the floor close to the partition within a foot of where she was standing at the same moment there was a decided movement of the plank of the flooring beneath the partition it began to slide slowly and then was gradually withdrawn into the room with prompt presence of mind she instantly extinguished her candle and drew herself breathlessly against the partition  when the plank was entirely withdrawn a ray of light slipped through the opening revealing the bare rafters of the floor and a hand and arm inserted under the partition groping as if towards the bricked closet as the fingers of the exploring hand were widely extended marie had no difficulty in recognizing on one of them a peculiar signet ring which uncle sylvester wore a swift impulse seized her to the audacious marie impulse and action were the same thing bending stealthily over the aperture she suddenly snatched the ring from the extended finger the hand was quickly withdrawn with a start and uncontrolled exclamation and she availed herself of that instant to glide rapidly down the stairs  she regained her room stealthily having the satisfaction a moment later of hearing uncle sylvesters door open and the sound of his footsteps in the corridor but he was evidently unable to discover any outer ingress to the inclosure or believed the loss of his ring an accident for he presently returned meantime what was she to do  tell kitty of her discovery and show the ring nonot yet oddly enough now that she had the ring taken from his wicked finger in the very act she found it as difficult as ever to believe in his burglarious design she must wait the mischiefif there had been mischiefwas done the breaking in of the bricked closet was from the appearance of the ruins a bygone act could it have been some youthful escapade of uncle sylvesters the scene of which he was revisiting as criminals are compelled to do and had there been anything taken from the closetor was its destruction a part of the changes in the old house how could she find out without asking kitty there was one way she remembered that mr gunn had once shown a great deal of interest to kitty about the old homestead and even of old mr lanes woodland cabin she would ask him it was a friendly act for kitty had not of late been very kind to him  the opportunity presented itself at dusk as mr gunn somewhat abstracted stood apart at the drawingroom window marie hoped he had enjoyed himself while skating her stupid cold had kept her indoors she had amused herself rambling about the old homestead it was such a queer place so full of old nooks and corners and unaccountable spaces just the place she would think where old treasures might have been stored eh  mr gunn had not spokenhe had only coughed but in the darkness his eyes were fixed angrily on her face without observing it she went on she knew he was interested in the old house she had heard him talk to kitty about it had kitty ever said anything about some old secret hoarding place  no certainly not and she was mistaken he never was interested in the house he could not understand what had put that idea in her head unless it was this ridiculous shady stranger in the guise of an uncle whom they had got there it was like his affectation  oh dear no said marie with unmistakable truthfulness he did not say anything but with sudden inconsistent aggression is that the way you speak to kitty of her uncle  really he didnt knowhe was joking only and he was afraid he must just now ask her to excuse him he had received letters that made it possible that he might be called suddenly to new york at any moment marie stared it was evident that he had proposed to kitty and been rejected but she was no nearer her discovery  nor was there the least revelation in the calm halfbored yet goodhumored presence of the wicked uncle at dinner so indifferent did he seem not only to his own villainy but even to the loss it had entailed that she had a wild impulse to take the ring from her pocket and display it on her own finger before him then and there but the conviction that he would in some way be equal to the occasion prevented her the dinner passed off with some constraint no doubt emanating from the conscious kitty and gunn nevertheless when they had returned to the drawingroom gabriel rubbed his hands expectantly  i prevailed on sylvester this morning to promise to tell us some of his experiencessomething complete and satisfactory this time eh  uncle sylvester warming his cold blood before the fire looked momentarily forgetful anddisappointing cousins jane and emma shrugged their shoulders  eh said uncle sylvester absently ereroh yes well more cheerfully about what eh  let it be said marie pointedly fixing her black magnetic eyes on the wicked stranger let it be something about the discovery of gold or a buried treasure hoard or a robbery  to her intense disgust uncle sylvester far from being discomfited or confused actually looked pleased and his gray eyes thawed slightly  certainly he said well then down on the san joaquin river there was an old chapone of the earliest settlersin fact hed come on from oregon before the gold discovery his name dear mecontinued uncle sylvester with an effort of memory and apparently beginning already to lose his interest in the storywaserflint  as uncle sylvester paused here cousin jane broke in impatiently well thats not an uncommon name there was an old carpenter here in your fathers time who was called flint  yes said uncle sylvester languidly but there is or was something uncommon about itand thats the point of the story for in the old time flint and gunn were of the same stock  is this a californian joke said gunn with a forced smile on his flushed face if so spare me for its an old one  its much older history mr gunn said uncle sylvester blandly which i remember from a boy when the first flint traded near sault sainte marie the canadian voyageurs literally translated his name into pierre a fusil and he went by that name always but when the english superseded the french in numbers and language the name was literally translated back again into peter gunn which his descendants bear  a labored form of the old joke said gunn turning contemptuously away  but the story said cousins jane and emma the story of the gold discoverynever mind the names  excuse me said uncle sylvester placing his hand in the breast of his coat with a delightful exaggeration of offended dignity but doubts having been cast upon my preliminary statement i fear i must decline proceeding further nevertheless he smiled unblushingly at miss du page as he followed gunn from the room  the next morning those who had noticed the strained relations of miss kitty and mr gunn were not surprised that the latter was recalled on pressing business to new york by the first train but it was a matter of some astonishment to gabriel lane and marie du page that uncle sylvester should have been up early and actually accompanied that gentleman as far as the station indeed the languid explorer and goldseeker exhibited remarkable activity and clad in a rough tourist suit announced over the breakfasttable his intention of taking a long tramp through the woods which he had not revisited since a boy to this end he had even provided himself with a small knapsack and for once realized kittys ideal of his character  dont go too far said gabriel for although the cold has moderated the barometer is falling fast and there is every appearance of snow take care you are not caught in one of our blizzards  but you are all going on the lake to skate protested uncle sylvester  yes for the very reason that it may be our last chance but should it snow we shall be nearer home than you may be  nevertheless when it came on to snow as gabriel had predicted the skating party was by no means so near home as he had imagined a shrewd keenness and some stimulating electric condition of the atmosphere had tempted the young people far out on the lake and they had ignored the first fall of fine grayish granulations that swept along the icy surface like little puffs of dust or smoke then the fall grew thicker the gray sky contracted the hurrying flakes dashed against them by a fierce northwester were larger heavier and seemed an almost palpable force that held them back their skates already clogged with drift were beginning to be useless the bare windswept spaces were becoming rarer they could only stumble on blindly towards the nearest shore nor when they reached it were they yet safe they could scarcely stand against the still increasing storm that was fast obliterating the banks and stretch of meadow beyond their only hope of shelter was the range of woods that joined the hill holding hands in single file the little party consisting of kitty marie and cousins jane and emmastouthearted gabriel leading and cousin john bringing up the rearat last succeeded in reaching it and were rejoiced to find themselves near old lanes halfruined cabin to their added joy and astonishment whiffs of whirling smoke were issuing from the crumbling chimney they ran to the crazy door pushed aside its weak fastening and founduncle sylvester calmly enjoying a pipe before a blazing fire a small pickaxe and crowbar were lying upon a mound of freshly turned earth beside the chimney where the rotten flooring had been torn up  the tumultuous entrance of the skating party required no explanation but when congratulations had been exchanged the wet snow shaken off and they had drawn round the fire curious eyes were cast upon the solitary occupant and the pile of earth and debris before him  i believe said gabriel laughingly that you have been so bored here that you have actually played at goldhunting for amusement  uncle sylvester took the pipe from his mouth and nodded  its a common diversion of yours said marie audaciously  uncle sylvester smiled sweetly  and have you been successful this time asked marie  i got the color  eh  uncle sylvester rose and placed himself with his back to the fire gently surveying the assembled group  i was interrupted in a story of golddigging last evening he said blandly how far had i got  you were down on the san joaquin river in the spring of 50 with a chap named flint chorused cousins jane and emma promptly  ah yes said uncle sylvester well in those days there was a scarcity of money in the diggings gold dust there was in plenty but no coin you can fancy it was a bother to weigh out a pinch of dust every time you wanted a drink of whiskey or a pound of flour but there was no other legal tender pretty soon however a lot of gold and silver pieces found their way into circulation in our camp and the camps around us they were foreignold french and english coins heres one of them that i kept he took from his pocket a gold coin and handed it to gabriel  lane rose to his feet with an exclamation  why this is like the louisdor that grandfather saved through the war and gave to father  uncle sylvester took the coin back placed it in his left eye like a monocle and winked gravely at the company  it is the same he went on quietly i was interested for i had a good memory and i remembered that as a boy grandfather had shown me one of those coins and told me he was keeping them for old jules du page who didnt believe in banks and banknotes well i traced them to a trader called flint who was shipping gold dust from stockton to peter gunn  sons in new york  to whom asked gabriel quickly  old gunnthe father of your friend said uncle sylvester blandly we talked the matter over on our way to the station this morning well to return flint only said that he had got them from a man called thompson who had got them from somebody else in exchange for goods a year or two afterwards this same thompson happened to be frozen up with me in starvation camp when he thought he was dying he confessed that he had been bribed by flint to say what he had said but that he believed the coins were stolen meantime flint had disappeared other things claimed my attention i had quite forgotten him until one night five years afterwards i blundered into a deserted miningcamp by falling asleep on my mule who carried me across a broken flume buti think i told you that story already  you never finished it said cousin jane sharply  let me do so now then i was really saved by some indians who took me for a spirit up aloft there in the moonlight and spread the alarm the first white man they brought me was a wretched drunkard known to the boys as old fusil or fusel oil who went into delirium tremens at the sight of me well who do you suppose he turned out to be flint flint played out and ruined cast off and discarded by his relations in new yorkthe foundation of whose fortunes he had laid by the villainy they had accepted and condoned for flint as the carpenter of the old homestead had discovered the existence of a bricked closet in the wall of fathers study partitioned it off so that he could break into it without detection and rifle it at his leisure and who had thus carried off that part of grandfathers hoard which father had concealed there he knew it could never be missed by the descendants but through haste or ignorance he did not touch the papers and documents also hidden there and they told of the existence of grandfathers second cache or hidingplace beneath this hearth and were left for me to discover  he coolly relit his pipe fixed his eyes on marie without apparently paying attention to the breathless scrutiny of the others and went on flint alias pierre a fusil alias gunn died a maniac i resolved to test the truth of his story i came here i knew the old homestead as a boy who had wandered over every part of it far better than you gabriel or any one the elder gunn had only heard of it through the criminal disclosure of his relative and only wished to absorb it through his son in time and thus obliterate all trace of flints outrage i recognized the room perfectlythanks to our dear kitty who had taken up the carpet which thus disclosed the loose plank before the closet that was hidden by the partition under pretext of rearranging the roomfor which kitty will forgive mei spent the day behind a locked door making my way through the partition there i found the rifled closet but the papers intact they contained a full description of the sum taken by flint and also of a larger sum buried in a cask beside this chimney i had just finished unearthing it a few moments before you came i had at first hoped to offer it to the family as a christmas gift tomorrow buthe stopped and sucked slowly at his pipe  we anticipated you said gabriel laughing  no said uncle sylvester coolly but because it dont happen to belong to you at all according to the paper i have in my pocket which is about as legal a document as i ever saw it is fathers free gift to miss marie du page  kitty threw her arms around her white and breathless friend with a joyful cry and honest gabriels face shone with unselfish gratification  for yourself my dear gabriel you must be satisfied with the fact that messrs peter gunn  sons will take back your wildcat stock at the price you paid for it it is the price they pay for their share in this little transaction as i had the honor of pointing out to mr gunn on our way to the station this morning  then you think that young mr gunn knew that flint was his relation and that he had stolen fathers money said kitty and that mr
