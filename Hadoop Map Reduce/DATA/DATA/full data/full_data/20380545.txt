 nathaniel hawthorne    hearken to our neighbor with the iron tongue  while i sit musing over my sheet of foolscap he emphatically tells the hour in tones loud enough for all the town to hear though doubtless intended only as a gentle hint to myself that i may begin his biography before the evening shall be further wasted  unquestionably a personage in such an elevated position and making so great a noise in the world has a fair claim to the services of a biographer  he is the representative and most illustrious member of that innumerable class whose characteristic feature is the tongue and whose sole business to clamor for the public good  if any of his noisy brethren in our tonguegoverned democracy be envious of the superiority which i have assigned him they have my free consent to hang themselves as high as he  and for his history let not the reader apprehend an empty repetition of dingdongbell he has been the passive hero of wonderful vicissitudes with which i have chanced to become acquainted possibly from his own mouth while the careless multitude supposed him to be talking merely of the time of day or calling them to dinner or to church or bidding drowsy people go bedward or the dead to their graves  many a revolution has it been his fate to go through and invariably with a prodigious uproar  and whether or no he have told me his reminiscences this at least is true that the more i study his deeptoned language the more sense and sentiment and soul do i discover in it  this bellfor we may as well drop our quaint personificationis of antique french manufacture and the symbol of the cross betokens that it was meant to be suspended in the belfry of a romish place of worship the old people hereabout have a tradition that a considerable part of the metal was supplied by a brass cannon captured in one of the victories of louis the fourteenth over the spaniards and that a bourbon princess threw her golden crucifix into the molten mass  it is said likewise that a bishop baptized and blessed the bell and prayed that a heavenly influence might mingle with its tones  when all due ceremonies had been performed the grand monarque bestowed the giftthan which none could resound his beneficence more loudlyon the jesuits who were then converting the american indians to the spiritual dominion of the pope so the bellour selfsame bell whose familiar voice we may hear at all hours in the streetsthis very bell sent forth its firstborn accents from the tower of a logbuilt chapel westward of lake champlain and near the mighty stream of the st lawrence  it was called our ladys chapel of the forest  the peal went forth as if to redeem and consecrate the heathen wilderness  the wolf growled at the sound as he prowled stealthily through the underbrush the grim bear turned his back and stalked sullenly away the startled doe leaped up and led her fawn into a deeper solitude  the red men wondered what awful voice was speaking amid the wind that roared through the treetops and following reverentially its summons the darkrobed fathers blessed them as they drew near the crosscrowned chapel  in a little time there was a crucifix on every dusky bosom  the indians knelt beneath the lowly roof worshipping in the same forms that were observed under the vast dome of st peters when the pope performed high mass in the presence of kneeling princes  all the religious festivals that awoke the chiming bells of lofty cathedrals called forth a peal from our ladys chapel of the forest  loudly rang the bell of the wilderness while the streets of paris echoed with rejoicings for the birthday of the bourbon or whenever france had triumphed on some european battlefield  and the solemn woods were saddened with a melancholy knell as often as the thickstrewn leaves were swept away from the virgin soil for the burial of an indian chief  meantime the bells of a hostile people and a hostile faith were ringing on sabbaths and lecturedays at boston and other puritan towns  their echoes died away hundreds of miles southeastward of our ladys chapel but scouts had threaded the pathless desert that lay between and from behind the huge treetrunks perceived the indians assembling at the summons of the bell  some bore flaxenhaired scalps at their girdles as if to lay those bloody trophies on our ladys altar  it was reported and believed all through new england that the pope of rome and the king of france had established this little chapel in the forest for the purpose of stirring up the red men to a crusade against the english settlers  the latter took energetic measures to secure their religion and their lives  on the eve of an especial fast of the romish church while the bell tolled dismally and the priests were chanting a doleful stave a band of new england rangers rushed from the surrounding woods fierce shouts and the report of musketry pealed suddenly within the chapel  the ministering priests threw themselves before the altar and were slain even on its steps  if as antique traditions tell us no grass will grow where the blood of martyrs has been shed there should be a barren spot to this very day on the site of that desecrated altar  while the blood was still plashing from step to step the leader of the rangers seized a torch and applied it to the drapery of the shrine  the flame and smoke arose as from a burntsacrifice at once illuminating and obscuring the whole interior of the chapelnow hiding the dead priests in a sable shroud now revealing them and their slayers in one terrific glare  some already wished that the altarsmoke could cover the deed from the sight of heaven  but one of the rangersa man of sanctified aspect though his hands were bloodyapproached the captain  sir said he our village meetinghouse lacks a bell and hitherto we have been fain to summon the good people to worship by beat of drum give me i pray you the bell of this popish chapel for the sake of the godly mr rogers who doubtless hath remembered us in the prayers of the congregation ever since we began our march  who can tell what share of this nights good success we owe to that holy mans wrestling with the lord  nay then answered the captain if good mr rogers hath holpen our enterprise it is right that he should share the spoil  take the bell and welcome deacon lawson if you will be at the trouble of carrying it home  hitherto it hath spoken nothing but papistry and that too in the french or indian gibberish but i warrant me if mr rogers consecrate it anew it will talk like a good english and protestant bell  so deacon lawson and half a score of his townsmen took down the bell suspended it on a pole and bore it away on their sturdy shoulders meaning to carry it to the shore of lake champlain and thence homeward by water  far through the woods gleamed the flames of our ladys chapel flinging fantastic shadows from the clustered foliage and glancing on brooks that had never caught the sunlight  as the rangers traversed the midnight forest staggering under their heavy burden the tongue of the bell gave many a tremendous strokeclang clang clanga most doleful sound as if it were tolling for the slaughter of the priests and the ruin of the chapel  little dreamed deacon lawson and his townsmen that it was their own funeral knell  a warparty of indians had heard the report of musketry and seen the blaze of the chapel and now were on the track of the rangers summoned to vengeance by the bells dismal murmurs  in the midst of a deep swamp they made a sudden onset on the retreating foe  good deacon lawson battled stoutly but had his skull cloven by a tomahawk and sank into the depths of the morass with the ponderous bell above him  and for many a year thereafter our heros voice was heard no more on earth neither at the hour of worship nor at festivals nor funerals  and is he still buried in that unknown grave  scarcely so dear reader hark  how plainly we hear him at this moment the spokesman of time proclaiming that it is nine oclock at night  we may therefore safely conclude that some happy chance has restored him to upper air  but there lay the bell for many silent years and the wonder is that he did not lie silent there a century or perhaps a dozen centuries till the world should have forgotten not only his voice but the voices of the whole brotherhood of bells  how would the first accent of his iron tongue have startled his resurrectionists  but he was not fated to be a subject of discussion among the antiquaries of far posterity  near the close of the old french war a party of new england axemen who preceded the march of colonel bradstreet toward lake ontario were building a bridge of logs through a swamp  plunging down a stake one of these pioneers felt it graze against some hard smooth substance  he called his comrades and by their united efforts the top of the bell was raised to the surface a rope made fast to it and thence passed over the horizontal limb of a tree  heave ho up they hoisted their prize dripping with moisture and festooned with verdant watermoss  as the base of the bell emerged from the swamp the pioneers perceived that a skeleton was clinging with its bony fingers to the clapper but immediately relaxing its nerveless grasp sank back into the stagnant water  the bell then gave forth a sullen clang  no wonder that he was in haste to speak after holding his tongue for such a length of time the pioneers shoved the bell to and fro thus ringing a loud and heavy peal which echoed widely through the forest and reached the ears of colonel bradstreet and his three thousand men  the soldiers paused on their march a feeling of religion mingled with bornetenderness overpowered their rude hearts each seemed to hear the clangor of the old churchbell which had been familiar to hint from infancy and had tolled at the funerals of all his forefathers  by what magic had that holy sound strayed over the widemurmuring ocean and become audible amid the clash of arms the loud crashing of the artillery over the rough wildernesspath and the melancholy roar of the wind among the boughs  the newenglanders hid their prize in a shadowy nook betwixt a large gray stone and the earthy roots of an overthrown tree and when the campaign was ended they conveyed our friend to boston and put him up at auction on the sidewalk of king street  he was suspended for the nonce by a block and tackle and being swung backward and forward gave such loud and clear testimony to his own merits that the auctioneer had no need to say a word  the highest bidder was a rich old representative from our town who piously bestowed the bell on the meetinghouse where he had been a worshipper for half a century  the good man had his reward  by a strange coincidence the very first duty of the sexton after the bell had been hoisted into the belfry was to toll the funeral knell of the donor  soon however those doleful echoes were drowned by a triumphant peal for the surrender of quebec  ever since that period our hero has occupied the same elevated station and has put in his word on all matters of public importance civil military or religious  on the day when independence was first proclaimed in the street beneath he uttered a peal which many deemed ominous and fearful rather than triumphant  but he has told the same story these sixty years and none mistake his meaning now  when washington in the fulness of his glory rode through our flowerstrewn streets this was the tongue that bade the father of his country welcome again the same voice was heard when la fayette came to gather in his halfcenturys harvest of gratitude  meantime vast changes have been going on below  his voice which once floated over a little provincial seaport is now reverberated between brick edifices and strikes the ear amid the buzz and tumult of a city  on the sabbaths of olden time the summons of the bell was obeyed by a picturesque and varied throng stately gentlemen in purple velvet coats embroidered waistcoats white wigs and goldlaced hats stepping with grave courtesy beside ladies in flowered satin gowns and hooppetticoats of majestic circumference while behind followed a liveried slave or bondsman bearing the psalmbook and a stove for his mistresss feet  the commonalty clad in homely garb gave precedence to their betters at the door of the meetinghouse as if admitting that there were distinctions between them even in the sight of god  yet as their coffins were borne one after another through the street the bell has tolled a requiem for all alike what mattered it whether or no there were a silver scutcheon on the coffinlid  open thy bosom mother earth  thus spake the bell another of thy children is coming to his long rest  take him to thy bosom and let him slumber in peace thus spake the bell and mother earth received her child  with the selfsame tones will the present generation be ushered to the embraces of their mother and mother earth will still receive her children  is not thy tongue aweary mournful talker of two centuries  o funeral bell wilt thou never be shattered with thine own melancholy strokes  yea and a trumpetcall shall arouse the sleepers whom thy heavy clang could awake no more  againagain thy voice reminding me that i am wasting the midnight oil  in my lonely fantasy i can scarce believe that other mortals have caught the sound or that it vibrates elsewhere than in my secret soul but to many hast thou spoken  anxious men have heard thee on their sleepless pillows and bethought themselves anew of tomorrows care  in a brief interval of wakefulness the sons of toil have heard thee and say is so much of our quiet slumber spentis the morning so near at hand  crime has heard thee and mutters now is the very hour despair answers thee thus much of this weary life is gone the young mother on her bed of pain and ecstasy has counted thy echoing strokes and dates from them her firstborns share of life and immortality  the bridegroom and the bride have listened and feel that their night of rapture flits like a dream away  thine accents have fallen faintly on the ear of the dying man and warned him that ere thou speakest again his spirit shall have passed whither no voice of time can ever reach alas for the departing traveller if thy voicethe voice of fleeting timehave taught him no lessons for eternity
