  long ago in the days when our caged blackbirds never saw a kings soldier without whistling impudently come ower the water to charlie a minister of thrums was to be married but something happened and he remained a bachelor then when he was old he passed in our square the lady who was to have been his wife and her hair was white but she too was still unmarried the meeting had only one witness a weaver and he said solemnly afterwards they didna speak but they just gave one another a look and i saw the lovelight in their een no more is remembered of these two no being now living ever saw them but the poetry that was in the soul of a battered weaver makes them human to us for ever  it is of another minister i am to tell but only to those who know that light when they see it i am not bidding goodbye to many readers for though it is true that some men of whom lord rintoul was one live to an old age without knowing love few of us can have met them and of women so incomplete i never heard  gavin dishart was barely twentyone when he and his mother came to thrums lighthearted like the traveller who knows not what awaits him at the bend of the road it was the time of year when the ground is carpeted beneath the firs with brown needles when splitnuts patter all day from the beech and children lay yellow corn on the dominies desk to remind him that now they are needed in the fields the day was so silent that carts could be heard rumbling a mile away all thrums was out in its wynds and closes a few of the weavers still in kneebreechesto look at the new auld licht minister i was there too the dominie of glen quharity which is four miles from thrums and heavy was my heart as i stood afar off so that gavins mother might not have the pain of seeing me i was the only one in the crowd who looked at her more than at her son  eighteen years had passed since we parted already her hair had lost the brightness of its youth and she seemed to me smaller and more fragile and the face that i loved when i was a hobbledehoy and loved when i looked once more upon it in thrums and always shall love till i die was soft and worn margaret was an old woman and she was only fortythree and i am the man who made her old as gavin put his eager boyish face out at the carriage window many saw that he was holding her hand but none could be glad at the sight as the dominie was glad looking on at a happiness in which he dared not mingle margaret was crying because she was so proud of her boy women do that poor sons to be proud of good mothers but i would not have you dry those tears  when the little minister looked out at the carriage window many of the people drew back humbly but a little boy in a red frock with black spots pressed forward and offered him a sticky parly which gavin accepted though not without a tremor for children were more terrible to him then than bearded men the boys mother trying not to look elated bore him away but her face said that he was made for life with this little incident gavins career in thrums began i remembered it suddenly the other day when wading across the wynd where it took place many scenes in the little ministers life come back to me in this way the first time i ever thought of writing his love story as an old mans gift to a little maid since grown tall was one night while i sat alone in the schoolhouse on my knees a fiddle that has been my only living companion since i sold my hens my mind had drifted back to the first time i saw gavin and the egyptian together and what set it wandering to that midnight meeting was my garden gate shaking in the wind at a gate on the hill i had first encountered these two it rattled in his hand and i looked up and saw them and neither knew why i had such cause to start at the sight then the gate swung to it had just such a click as mine  these two figures on the hill are more real to me than things that happened yesterday but i do not know that i can make them live to others a ghostshow used to come yearly to thrums on the merry muckle friday in which the illusion was contrived by hanging a glass between the onlookers and the stage i cannot deny that the comings and goings of the ghost were highly diverting yet the farmer of tnowhead only laughed because he had paid his money at the hole in the door like the rest of us tnowhead sat at the end of a form where he saw round the glass and so saw no ghost i fear my public may be in the same predicament i see the little minister as he was at oneandtwenty and the little girl to whom this story is to belong sees him though the things i have to tell happened before she came into the world but there are reasons why she should see and i do not know that i can provide the glass for others if they see round it they will neither laugh nor cry with gavin and babbie  when gavin came to thrums he was as i am now for the pages lay before him on which he was to write his life yet he was not quite as i am the life of every man is a diary in which he means to write one story and writes another and his humblest hour is when he compares the volume as it is with what he vowed to make it but the biographer sees the last chapter while he is still at the first and i have only to write over with ink what gavin has written in pencil  how often is it a phanton woman who draws the man from the way he meant to go so was man created to hunger for the ideal that is above himself until one day there is magic in the air and the eyes of a girl rest upon him he does not know that it is he himself who crowned her and if the girl is as pure as he their love is the one form of idolatry that is not quite ignoble it is the joining of two souls on their way to god but if the woman be bad the test of the man is when he wakens from his dream the nobler his ideal the further will he have been hurried down the wrong way for those who only run after little things will not go far his love may now sink into passion perhaps only to stain its wings and rise again perhaps to drown  babbie what shall i say of you who make me write these things i am not your judge shall we not laugh at the student who chafes when between him and his book comes the song of the thrushes with whom on the mad night you danced into gavins life you had more in common than with auld licht ministers the gladness of living was in your step your voice was melody and he was wondering what love might be  you were the daughter of a summer night born where all the birds are free and the moon christened you with her soft light to dazzle the eyes of man not our little minister alone was stricken by you into his second childhood to look upon you was to rejoice that so fair a thing could be to think of you is still to be young even those who called you a little devil of whom i have been one admitted that in the end you had a soul though not that you had been born with one they said you stole it and so made a woman of yourself but again i say i am not your judge and when i picture you as gavin saw you first a barelegged witch dancing up windyghoul rowan berries in your black hair and on your finger a jewel the little minister could not have bought with five years of toil the shadows on my pages lift and i cannot wonder that gavin loved you  often i say to myself that this is to be gavins story not mine yet must it be mine too in a manner and of myself i shall sometimes have to speak not willingly for it is time my little tragedy had died of old age i have kept it to myself so long that now i would stand at its grave alone it is true that when i heard who was to be the new minister i hoped for a day that the life broken in harvie might be mended in thrums but two minutes talk with gavin showed me that margaret had kept from him the secret which was hers and mine and so knocked the bottom out of my vain hopes i did not blame her then nor do i blame her now nor shall anyone who blames her ever be called friend by me but it was bitter to look at the white manse among the trees and know that i must never enter it for margarets sake i had to keep aloof yet this new trial came upon me like our parting at harvie i thought that in those eighteen years my passions had burned like a ship till they sank but i suffered again as on that awful night when adam dishart came back nearly killing margaret and tearing up all my ambitions by the root in a single hour i waited in thrums until i had looked again on margaret who thought me dead and gavin who had never heard of me and then i trudged back to the schoolhouse something i heard of them from time to time during the winterfor in the gossip of thrums i was well postedbut much of what is to be told here i only learned afterwards from those who knew it best gavin heard of me at times as the dominie in the glen who had ceased to attend the auld licht kirk and margaret did not even hear of me it was all i could do for them     chapter ii  runs alongside the making of a minister   on the east coast of scotland hidden as if in a quarry at the foot of cliffs that may one day fall forward is a village called harvie so has it shrunk since the day when i skulked from it that i hear of a travellers asking lately at one of its doors how far he was from a village yet harvie throve once and was celebrated even in distant thrums for its fish most of our weavers would have thought it as unnatural not to buy harvies in the square on the muckle friday as to let saturday night pass without laying in a sufficient stock of halfpennies to go round the family twice  gavin was born in harvie but left it at such an early age that he could only recall thatched houses with nets drying on the roofs and a sandy shore in which coarse grass grew in the picture he could not pick out the house of his birth though he might have been able to go to it had he ever returned to the village soon he learned that his mother did not care to speak of harvie and perhaps he thought that she had forgotten it too all save one scene to which his memory still guided him when his mind wandered to harvie gavin saw the door of his home open and a fisherman enter who scratched his head and then said your mans drowned missis gavin seemed to see many women crying and his mother staring at them with a face suddenly painted white and next to hear a voice that was his own saying never mind mother ill be a man to you now and ill need breeks for the burial but adam required no funeral for his body lay deep in the sea  gavin thought that this was the tragedy of his mothers life and the most memorable event of his own childhood but it was neither when margaret even after she came to thrums thought of harvie it was not at adams death she shuddered but at the recollection of me  it would ill become me to take a late revenge on adam dishart now by saying what is not true of him though he died a fisherman he was a sailor for a great part of his life and doubtless his recklessness was washed into him on the high seas where in his time men made a crony of death and drank merrily over dodging it for another night to me his roars of laughter without cause were as repellent as a boys drum yet many faces that were long in my company brightened at his coming and women with whom despite my yearning i was in no wise a favorite ran to their doors to listen to him as readily as to the bellman children scurried from him if his mood was savage but to him at all other times while me they merely disregarded there was always a smell of the sea about him he had a rolling gait unless he was drunk when he walked very straight and before both sexes he boasted that any woman would take him for his beard alone of this beard he took prodigious care though otherwise thinking little of his appearance and i now see that he understood women better than i did who had nevertheless reflected much about them it cannot be said that he was vain for though he thought he attracted women strangely that i maintain is a weakness common to all men and so no more to be marvelled at than a stake in a fence foreign oaths were the nails with which he held his talk together yet i doubt not they were a curiosity gathered at sea like his chains of shells more for his own pleasure than for others pain his friends gave them no weight and when he wanted to talk emphatically he kept them back though they were then as troublesome to him as eggs to the birdnesting boy who has to speak with his spoil in his mouth  adam was drowned on gavins fourth birthday a year after i had to leave harvie he was blown off his smack in a storm and could not reach the rope his partner flung him its no go lad he shouted so long jim and sank  a month afterwards margaret sold her share in the smack which was all adam left her and the furniture of the house was rouped she took gavin to glasgow where her only brother needed a housekeeper and there mother and son remained until gavin got his call to thrums during those seventeen years i lost knowledge of them as completely as margaret had lost knowledge of me on hearing of adams death i went back to harvie to try to trace her but she had feared this and so told no one where she was going  according to margaret gavins genius showed itself while he was still a child he was born with a brow whose nobility impressed her from the first it was a ministers brow and though margaret herself was no scholar being as slow to read as she was quick at turning bannocks on the girdle she decided when his age was still counted by months that the ministry had need of him in those days the first question asked of a child was not tell me your name but what are you to be and one child in every family replied a minister he was set apart for the church as doggedly as the shilling a week for the rent and the rule held good though the family consisted of only one boy from his earliest days gavin thought he had been fashioned for the ministry as certainly as a spade for digging and margaret rejoiced and marvelled thereat though she had made her own puzzle an enthusiastic mother may bend her sons mind as she chooses if she begins it once nay she may do stranger things i know a mother in thrums who loves features and had a child born with no chin to speak of the neighbors expected this to bring her to the dust but it only showed what a mother can do in a few months that child had a chin with the best of them  margarets brother died but she remained in his single room and ever with a picture of her son in a pulpit to repay her contrived to keep gavin at school everything a womans fingers can do margarets did better than most and among the wealthy people who employed herwould that i could have the teaching of the sons of such as were good to her in those hard daysher gentle manner was spoken of for though margaret had no schooling she was a lady at heart moving and almost speaking as one even in harvie where they did not perhaps like her the better for it  at six gavin hit another boy hard for belonging to the established church and at seven he could not lose himself in the shorter catechism his mother expounded the scriptures to him till he was eight when he began to expound them to her by this time he was studying the practical work of the pulpit as enthusiastically as ever medical student cut off a leg from a front pew in the gallery gavin watched the ministers every movement noting that the first thing to do on ascending the pulpit is to cover your face with your hands as if the exalted position affected you like a strong light and the second to move the big bible slightly to show that the kirk officer not having had a university education could not be expected to know the very spot on which it ought to lie gavin saw that the minister joined in the singing more like one countenancing a seemly thing than because he needed it himself and that he only sang a mouthful now and again after the congregation was in full pursuit of the precentor it was noteworthy that the first prayer lasted longer than all the others and that to read the intimations about the bibleclass and the collection elsewhere than immediately before the last psalm would have been as sacrilegious as to insert the dedication to king james at the end of revelation sitting under a minister justly honoured in his day the boy was often some words in advance of him not vainglorious of his memory but fervent eager and regarding the preacher as hardly less sacred than the book gavin was encouraged by his frightened yet admiring mother to saw the air from their pew as the minister sawed it in the pulpit and two benedictions were pronounced twice a sabbath in that church in the same words the same manner and simultaneously  there was a black year when the things of this world especially its pastimes took such a grip of gavin that he said to margaret he would rather be good at the high jump than the author of the pilgrims progress that year passed and gavin came to his right mind one afternoon margaret was at home making a glengarry for him out of a piece of carpet and giving it a tartan edging when the boy bounded in from school crying come quick mother and youll see him margaret reached the door in time to see a street musician flying from gavin and his friends did you take stock of him mother the boy asked when he reappeared with the mark of a muddy stick on his back hes a papista sore sight mother a sore sight we stoned him for persecuting the noble martyrs  when gavin was twelve he went to the university and also got a place in a shop as errand boy he used to run through the streets between his work and his classes potatoes and salt fish which could then be got at two pence the pound if bought by the half hundred weight were his food there was not always a good meal for two yet when gavin reached home at night there was generally something ready for him and margaret had supped hours ago gavins hunger urged him to fall to but his love for his mother made him watchful  what did you have yourself mother he would demand suspiciously  oh i had a fine supper i assure you  what had you  i had potatoes for one thing  and dripping  you may be sure  mother youre cheating me the dripping hasnt been touched since yesterday  i dinnadontcare for drippingno much  then would gavin stride the room fiercely a queer little figure  do you think ill stand this mother will i let myself be pampered with dripping and every delicacy while you starve  gavin i really dinna care for dripping  then ill give up my classes and we can have butter  i assure you im no hungry its different wi a growing laddie  im not a growing laddie gavin would say bitterly but mother i warn you that not another bite passes my throat till i see you eating too  so margaret had to take her seat at the table and when she said i can eat no more gavin retorted sternly nor will i for fine i see through you  these two were as one far more than most married people and just as gavin in his childhood reflected his mother she now reflected him the people for whom she sewed thought it was contact with them that had rubbed the broad scotch from her tongue but she was only keeping pace with gavin when she was excited the harvie words came back to her as they come back to me i have taught the english language all my life and i try to write it but everything i say in this book i first think to myself in the doric this too i notice that in talking to myself i am broader than when gossiping with the farmers of the glen who send their children to me to learn english and then jeer at them if they say old lights instead of auld lichts  to margaret it was happiness to sit through the long evenings sewing and look over her work at gavin as he read or wrote or recited to himself the learning of the schools but she coughed every time the weather changed and then gavin would start  you must go to your bed mother he would say tearing himself from his books or he would sit beside her and talk of the dream that was common to botha dream of a manse where margaret was mistress and gavin was called the minister every night gavin was at his mothers bedside to wind her shawl round her feet and while he did it margaret smiled  mother this is the chaff pillow youve taken out of my bed and given me your feather one  gavin you needna change them i winna have the feather pillow  do you dare to think ill let you sleep on chaff put up your head now is that soft  its fine i dinna deny but what i sleep better on feathers do you mind gavin you bought this pillow for me the moment you got your bursary money  the reserve that is a wall between many of the scottish poor had been broken down by these two when he saw his mother sleeping happily gavin went back to his work to save the expense of a lamp he would put his book almost beneath the dying fire and taking the place of the fender read till he was shivering with cold  gavin it is near morning and you not in your bed yet what are you thinking about so hard  oh mother i was wondering if the time would ever come when i would be a minister and you would have an egg for your breakfast every morning  so the years passed and soon gavin would be a minister he had now sermons to prepare and every one of them was first preached to margaret how solemn was his voice how his eyes flashed how stern were his admonitions  gavin such a sermon i never heard the spirit of god is on you im ashamed you should have me for a mother  god grant mother gavin said little thinking what was soon to happen or he would have made this prayer on his knees that you may never be ashamed to have me for a son  ah mother he would say wistfully it is not a great sermon but do you think im preaching christ that is what i try but im carried away and forget to watch myself  the lord has you by the hand gavin and mind i dinna say that because youre my laddie  yes you do mother and well i know it and yet it does me good to hear you  that it did him good i who would fain have shared those days with them am very sure the praise that comes of love does not make us vain but humble rather knowing what we are the pride that shines in our mothers eyes as she looks at us is about the most pathetic thing a man has to face but he would be a devil altogether if it did not burn some of the sin out of him  not long before gavin preached for our kirk and got his call a great event took place in the little room at glasgow the student appeared for the first time before his mother in his ministerial clothes he wore the black silk hat that was destined to become a terror to evildoers in thrums and i dare say he was rather puffed up about himself that day you would probably have smiled at him  its a pity im so little mother he said with a sigh  youre no what i would call a particularly long man margaret said but youre just the height i like  then gavin went out in his grandeur and margaret cried for an hour she was thinking of me as well as of gavin and as it happens i know that i was thinking at the same time of her gavin kept a diary in those days which i have seen and by comparing it with mine i discovered that while he was showing himself to his mother in his black clothes i was on my way back from tilliedrum where i had gone to buy a sandglass for the school the one i bought was so like another margaret had used at harvie that it set me thinking of her again all the way home this is a matter hardly worth mentioning and yet it interests me  busy days followed the call to thrums and gavin had difficulty in forcing himself to his sermons when there was always something more to tell his mother about the weaving town they were going to or about the manse or the furniture that had been transferred to him by the retiring minister the little room which had become so familiar that it seemed one of a family party of three had to be stripped and many of its contents were sold among what were brought to thrums was a little exercise book in which margaret had tried unknown to gavin to teach herself writing and grammar that she might be less unfit for a manse he found it accidentally one day it was full of i am thou art he is and the like written many times in a shaking hand gavin put his arms round his mother when he saw what she had been doing the exercise book is in my desk now and will be my little maids when i die  gavin gavin margaret said many times in those last days at glasgow to think it has all come true  let the last word you say in the house be a prayer of thankfulness she whispered to him when they were taking a final glance at the old home  in the bare room they called the house the little minister and his mother went on their knees but as it chanced their last word there was not addressed to god  gavin margaret whispered as he took her arm do you think this bonnet sets me     chapter iii  the nightwatchers   what first struck margaret in thrums was the smell of the caddis the town smells of caddis no longer but whiffs of it may be got even now as one passes the houses of the old where the lay still swings at little windows like a great ghost pendulum to me it is a homely smell which i draw in with a great breath but it was as strange to margaret as the weavers themselves who in their colored nightcaps and corduroys streaked with threads gazed at her and gavin the little minister was trying to look severe and old but twentyone was in his eye  look mother at that white house with the green roof that is the manse  the manse stands high with a sharp eye on all the town every back window in the tenements has a glint of it and so the back of the tenements is always better behaved than the front it was in the front that jamie don a pitiful bachelor all his life because he thought the women proposed kept his ferrets and here too beattie hanged himself going straight to the clothesposts for another rope when the first one broke such was his determination in the front sanders gilruth openly boasted on dons potatopit that by having a seat in two churches he could lie in bed on sabbath and get the credit of being at one or other gavin made short work of him to the rightminded the auld licht manse was as a family bible ever lying open before them but beattie spoke for more than himself when he said dagone that manse i never gie a swear but there it is glowering at me  the manse looks down on the town from the northeast and is reached from the road that leaves thrums behind it in another moment by a wide straight path so rough that to carry a fraught of water to the manse without spilling was to be superlatively good at one thing packages in a cart it set leaping like trout in a fishingcreel opposite the opening of the garden wall in the manse where for many years there had been an intention of putting up a gate were two big stones a yard apart standing ready for the winter when the path was often a rush of yellow water and this the only bridge to the glebe dyke down which the minister walked to church  when margaret entered the manse on gavins arm it was a whitewashed house of five rooms with a garret in which the minister could sleep if he had guests as during the fast week it stood with its garden within high walls and the roof awing southward was carpeted with moss that shone in the sun in a dozen shades of green and yellow three firs guarded the house from west winds but blasts from the north often tore down the steep fields and skirled through the manse banging all its doors at once a beech growing on the east side leant over the roof as if to gossip with the well in the courtyard the garden was to the south and was over full of gooseberry and currant bushes it contained a summer seat where strange things were soon to happen  margaret would not even take off her bonnet until she had seen through the manse and opened all the presses the parlour and kitchen were downstairs and of the three rooms above the study was so small that gavins predecessor could touch each of its walls without shifting his position every room save margarets had longlidded beds which close as if with shutters but hers was cofffronted or comparatively open with carving on the wood like the ornamentation of coffins where there were children in a house they liked to slope the boards of the closedin bed against the dresser and play at sliding down mountains on them  but for many years there had been no children in the manse he in whose ways gavin was to attempt the heavy task of walking had been a widower three months after his marriage a man narrow when he came to thrums but so largehearted when he left it that i who know there is good in all the world because of the lovable souls i have met in this corner of it yet cannot hope that many are as near to god as he the most gladsome thing in the world is that few of us fall very low the saddest that with such capabilities we seldom rise high of those who stand perceptibly above their fellows i have known very few only mr carfrae and two or three women  gavin only saw a very frail old minister who shook as he walked as if his feet were striking against stones he was to depart on the morrow to the place of his birth but he came to the manse to wish his successor godspeed strangers were so formidable to margaret that she only saw him from her window  may you never lose sight of god mr dishart the old man said in the parlour then he added as if he had asked too much may you never turn from him as i often did when i was a lad like you  as this aged minister with the beautiful face that god gives to all who love him and follow his commandments spoke of his youth he looked wistfully around the faded parlour  it is like a dream he said the first time i entered this room the thought passed through me that i would cut down that cherry tree because it kept out the light but you see it outlives me i grew old while looking for the axe only yesterday i was the young minister mr dishart and tomorrow you will be the old one bidding goodbye to your successor  his eyes came back to gavins eager face  you are very young mr dishart  nearly twentyone  twentyone ah my dear sir you do not know how pathetic that sounds to me twentyone we are children for the second time at twentyone and again when we are grey and put all our burden on the lord the young talk generously of relieving the old of their burdens but the anxious heart is to the old when they see a load on the back of the young let me tell you mr dishart that i would condone many things in oneandtwenty now that i dealt hardly with at middle age god himself i think is very willing to give oneandtwenty a second chance  i am afraid gavin said anxiously that i look even younger  i think mr carfrae answered smiling that your heart is as fresh as your face and that is well the useless men are those who never change with the years many views that i held to in my youth and long afterwards are a pain to me now and i am carrying away from thrums memories of errors into which i fell at every stage of my ministry when you are older you will know that life is a long lesson in humility  he paused  i hope he said nervously that you dont sing the paraphrases  mr carfrae had not grown out of all his prejudices you see indeed if gavin had been less bigoted than he on this question they might have parted stiffly the old minister would rather have remained to die in his pulpit than surrender it to one who read his sermons others may blame him for this but i must say here plainly that i never hear a minister reading without wishing to send him back to college  i cannot deny mr carfrae said that i broke down more than once today this forenoon i was in tillyloss for the last time and it so happens that there is scarcely a house in it in which i have not had a marriage or prayed over a coffin ah sir these are the scenes that make the minister more than all his sermons you must join the family mr dishart or you are only a minister once a week and remember this if your call is from above it is a call to stay many such partings in a lifetime as i have had to day would be too heartrending  and yet gavin said hesitatingly they told me in glasgow that i had received a call from the mouth of hell  those were cruel words but they only mean that people who are seldom more than a days work in advance of want sometimes rise in arms for food our weavers are passionately religious and so independent that they dare any one to help them but if their wages were lessened they could not live and so at talk of reduction they catch fire change of any kind alarms them and though they call themselves whigs they rose a few years ago over the paving of the streets and stoned the workmen who were strangers out of the town  and though you may have thought the place quiet today mr dishart there was an ugly outbreak only two months ago when the weavers turned on the manufacturers for reducing the price of the web made a bonfire of some of their doors and terrified one of them into leaving thrums under the command of some chartists the people next paraded the streets to the music of fife and drum and six policemen who drove up from tilliedrum in a light cart were sent back tied to the seats  no one has been punished  not yet but nearly two years ago there was a similar riot and the sheriff took no action for months then one night the square suddenly filled with soldiers and the ringleaders were seized in their beds mr dishart the people are determined not to be caught in that way again and ever since the rising a watch has been kept by night on every road that leads to thrums the signal that the soldiers are coining is to be the blowing of a horn if you ever hear that horn i implore you to hasten to the square  the weavers would not fight  you do not know how the chartists have fired this part of the country one misty day a week ago i was on the hill i thought i had it to myself when suddenly i heard a voice cry sharply shoulder arms i could see no one and after a moment i put it down to a freak of the wind then all at once the mist before me blackened and a body of men seemed to grow out of it they were not shadows they were thrums weavers drilling with pikes in their hands  they broke up mr carfrae continued after a pause at my entreaty but they have met again since then  and there were auld lichts among them gavin asked i should have thought they would be frightened at our precentor lang tammas who seems to watch for backsliding in the congregation as if he had pleasure in discovering it  gavin spoke with feeling for the precentor had already put him through his catechism and it was a stiff ordeal  the precentor said mr carfrae why he was one of them  the old minister once so brave a figure tottered as he rose to go and reeled in a dizziness until he had walked a few paces gavin went with him to the foot of the manse road without his hat as all thrums knew before bedtime  i begin gavin said as they were parting where you leave off and my prayer is that i may walk in your ways  ah mr dishart the whitehaired minister said with a sigh the world does not progress so quickly as a man grows old you only begin where i began  he left gavin and then as if the little ministers last words had hurt him turned and solemnly pointed his staff upward such men are the strong nails that keep the world together  the twentyoneyearsold minister returned to the manse somewhat sadly but when he saw his mother at the window of her bedroom his heart leapt at the thought that she was with him and he had eighty pounds a year gaily he waved both his hands to her and she answered with a smile and then in his boyishness he jumped over a gooseberry bush immediately afterwards he reddened and tried to look venerable for while in the air he had caught sight of two women and a man watching him from the dyke he walked severely to the door and again forgetting himself was bounding upstairs to margaret when jean the servant stood scandalised in his way  i dont think she caught me was gavins reflection and the lord preserves was jeans  gavin found his mother wondering how one should set about getting a cup of tea in a house that had a servant in it he boldly rang the bell and the willing jean answered it so promptly in a rush and jump that margaret was as much startled as aladdin the first time he rubbed his lamp  manse servants of the most admired kind move softly as if constant contact with a minister were goloshes to them but jean was new and raw only having got her place because her father might be an elder any day she had already conceived a romantic affection for her master but to say sir to himas she thirsted to dowould have been as difficult to her as to swallow oysters so anxious was she to please that when gavin rang she fired herself at the bedroom but bells were novelties to her as well as to margaret and she cried excitedly what is it thinking the house must be on fire  theres a curran folk at the back door jean announced later and their respects to you and would you gie them some water out o the well it has been a drouth this aucht days and the pumps is locked na she said as gavin made a too liberal offer that would toom the well and theres jimply enough for oursels i should tell you too that three o them is no auld lichts  let that make no difference gavin said grandly but jean changed his message to a bowlful apiece to auld lichts all other denominations one cupful  ay ay said snecky hobart letting down the bucket and well include atheists among other denominations the conversation came to gavin and margaret through the kitchen doorway  dinna class jo cruickshanks wi me said saml langlands the u p  na na said cruickshanks the atheist im ower independent to be religious i dinna gang to the kirk to cry oh lord gie gie gie  take tent o yoursel my man said lang tammas sternly or youll soon be whaur you would neifer the warld for a cup o that cauld water  maybe youve ower keen an interest in the devil tammas retorted the atheist but ony way if its heaven for climate its hell for company  lads said snecky sitting down on the bucket well send mr dishart to jo hell make another rob dow o him  speak mair reverently o your minister said the precentor he has the gift  i hinna naturally your solemn rasping word tammas but in the heart i speak in all reverence lads the minister has a word i tell you he prays near like one giving orders  at first snecky continued i thocht yon lang candidate was the earnestest o them a and i dinna deny but when i saw him wi his head bowedlike in prayer during the singing i says to rnysel thou art the man ay but betsy wraxed up her head and he wasna praying he was combing his hair wi his fingers on the sly  you ken fine sneck said cruickshanks that you said thou art the man to ilka ane o them and just voted for mr dishart because he preached hinmost  i didna say it tomr urquhart the ane that preached second sneck said that was the lad that gaed through ither  ay said susy tibbits nicknamed by haggart the timidest woman because she once said she was too young to marry but i was fell sorry for him just being over anxious he began bonny flinging himself like ane inspired at the pulpit door but after hendry munn pointed at it and cried out be cautious the snecks loose he a gaed to bits what a coolness hendry has though i suppose it was his duty him being kirkofficer  we didna want a man lang tammas said that could be put out by sic a sma thing as that mr urquhart was in sic a ravel after it that when he gies out the first line o the hunder and nineteenth psalm for singing says he and so on to the end ay that finished his chance  the noblest o them to look at said tibbie birse was that ane frae aberdeen him that had sic a saft side to jacob  ay said snecky and i speired at dr mcqueen if i should vote for him looks like a genius does he says the doctor weel then says he dinna vote for him for my experience is that theres no folk sic idiots as them that looks like geniuses  sal susy said its a guid thing weve settled for i enjoyed sitting like a judge upon them so muckle that i sair doubt it was a kind o sport to me  it was no sport to them susy ise uphaud but it is a blessing weve settled and ondoubtedly weve got the pick o them the only thing mr dishart did that made me oneasy was his saying the word caesar as if it began wi a k  hell startle you mair afore youre done wi him the atheist said maliciously i ken the ways o thae ministers preaching for kirks oh theyre cunning you was a pleased that mr dishart spoke about looms and webs but lathies it was a trick ilka ane o thae young ministers has a sermon about looms for weaving congregations and a second about beating swords into ploughshares for country places and another on the great catch of fishes for fishing villages thats their stockintrade and just you wait and see if you dinna get the ploughshares and the fishes afore the months out a minister preaching for a kirk is one thing but a minister placed int may be a very different berry  joseph cruickshanks cried the precentor passionately none o your dd blasphemy  they all looked at whamond and he dug his teeth into his lips in shame  whas swearing now said the atheist  but whamond was quick  matthew twelve and thirtyone he said  dagont tammas exclaimed the baffled cruickshanks youre aye quoting scripture how do you no quote feargus oconnor  lads said snecky jo hasna heard mr disharts sermons ay we get it scalding when he comes to the sermon i canna thole a minister that preaches as if heaven was round the corner  if youre hitting at our minister snecky said james cochrane let me tell you hes a better man than yours  a better curler i dare say  a better prayer  ay he can pray for a black frost as if it was ane o the royal family i ken his prayers o lord let it haud for anither day and keep the snaw awa will you pretend jeames that mr duthie could make onything o rob dow  i admit that robs awakening was an extraordinary thing and sufficient to gie mr dishart a name but mr carfrae was baffled wi rob too  jeames if you had been in our kirk that day mr dishart preached fort you would be wearying the now for sabbath to be back int again as you ken that wicked man there jo cruickshanks got rob dow drucken cursing poachingrob dow to come to the kirk to annoy the minister ay he hadna been at that work for ten minutes when mr dishart stopped in his first prayer and gae rob a look i couldna see the look being in the precentors box but as sure as death i felt it boring through me rob is hard wood though and soon he was at his tricks again weel the minister stopped a second time in the sermon and so awful was the silence that a heap o the congregation couldna keep their seats i heard rob breathing quick and strong mr dishart had his arm pointed at him a this time and at last he says sternly come forward listen joseph cruickshanks and tremble rob gripped the board to keep himsel frae obeying and again mr dishart says come forward and syne rob rose shaking and tottered to the pulpit stair like a man suddenly shot into the day of judgment you hulking man of sin cries mr dishart not a tick fleid though robs as big as three o him sit down on the stair and attend to me or ill step doun frae the pulpit and run you out of the house of god  and since that day said hobart rob has worshipped mr dishart as a man that has stepped out o the bible when the carriage passed this day we was discussing the minister and saml dickie wasna sure but what mr dishart wore his hat rather far back on his head you should have seen rob my certie he roars theres the shine frae heaven on that little ministers face and them as says theres no has me to fecht  ay weel said the u p rising well see how rob wearsand how your minister wears too i wouldna like to sit in a kirk whaur they daurna sing a paraphrase  the psalms of david retorted whamond mount straight to heaven but your paraphrases sticks to the ceiling o the kirk  youre a bigoted set tammas whamond but i tell you this and its my last words to you the nicht the dayll come when youll hae mr duthie ay and even the u p minister preaching in the auld licht kirk  and let this be my last words to you replied the precentor furiously that rather than see a u p preaching in the auld licht kirk i would burn in hell fire for ever  this gossip increased gavins knowledge of the grim men with whom he had now to deal but as he sat beside margaret after she had gone to bed their talk was pleasant  you remember mother gavin said how i almost prayed for the manse that was to give you an egg every morning i have been telling jean never to forget the egg  ah gavin things have come about so much as we wanted that im a kind o troubled its hardly natural and i hope nothing terrible is to happen now  gavin arranged her pillows as she liked them and when he next stole into the room in his stocking soles to look at her he thought she was asleep but she was not i dare say she saw at that moment gavin in his first frock and gavin in knickerbockers and gavin as he used to walk into the glasgow room from college all still as real to her as the gavin who had a kirk  the little minister took away the lamp to his own room shaking his fist at himself for allowing his mothers door to creak he pulled up his blind the town lay as still as salt but a steady light showed in the south and on pressing his face against the window he saw another in the west mr carfraes words about the nightwatch came back to him perhaps it had been on such a silent night as this that the soldiers marched into thrums would they come again     chapter iv  first coming of the egyptian woman   a learned man says in a book otherwise beautiful with truth that villages are family groups to him thrums would only be a village though town is the word we have ever used and this is not true of it doubtless we have interests in common from which a place so near but the road is heavy as tilliedrum is shut out and we have an individuality of our own too as if like our red houses we came from a quarry that supplies no other place but we are not one family in the old days those of us who were of the tenements seldom wandered to the croft head and if we did go there we saw men to whom we could not always give a name to flit from the tanage brae to haggarts road was to change ones friends a kirk wynd weaver might kill his swine and tillyloss not know of it until boys ran westward hitting each other with the bladders only the voice of the dulsemen could be heard all over thrums at once thus even in a small place but a few outstanding persons are known to everybody  in eight days gavins figure was more familiar in thrums than many that had grown bent in it he had already been twice to the cemetery for a minister only reaches his new charge in time to attend a funeral though short of stature he cast a great shadow he was so full of his duties jean said that though he pulled to the door as he left the manse he had passed the currant bushes before it snecked he darted through courts and invented ways into awkward houses if you did not look up quickly he was round the corner his visiting exhausted him only less than his zeal in the pulpit from which according to report he staggered damp with perspiration to the vestry where hendry munn wrung him like a wet cloth a deaf lady celebrated for giving out her washing compelled him to hold her trumpet until she had peered into all his crannies with the shorter catechism for a lantern janet dundas told him in answer to his knock that she could not abide him but she changed her mind when he said her garden was quite a show the wives who expected a visit scrubbed their floors for him cleaned out their presses for him put diamond socks on their bairns for him rubbed their hearthstones blue for him and even tidied up the garret for him and triumphed over the neighbours whose houses he passed by for gavin blundered occasionally by inadvertence as when he gave dear old betty davie occasion to say bitterly  ou ay you can sail by my door and gang to easies but im thinking you would stop at mine too if i had a brass handle ont  so passed the first four weeks and then came the fateful night of the seventeenth of october and with it the strange woman family worship at the manse was over and gavin was talking to his mother who never crossed the threshold save to go to church though her activity at home was among the marvels jean sometimes slipped down to the tenements to announce when wearyworld the policeman came to the door with rob dows compliments and if youre no wi me by ten oclock im to break out again gavin knew what this meant and at once set off for robs  youll let me gang a bit wi you the policeman entreated for till rob sent me on this errand not a soul has spoken to me the day ay mony a ane hae i spoken to but not a man woman nor bairn would fling me a word  i often meant to ask you gavin said as they went along the tenements which smelled at that hour of roasted potatoes why you are so unpopular  its because im police im the first ane that has ever been in thrums and the very folk that appointed me at a crown a week looks upon me as a disgraced man for accepting its gospel that my ain wife is short wi me when ive on my uniform though weel she kens that i would rather hae stuck to the loom if i hadna haen sic a queer richt leg nobody feels the shame o my position as i do mysel but this is a town without pity  it should be a consolation to you that you are discharging useful duties  but im no im doing harm theres charles dickson says that the very sicht o my uniform rouses his dander so muckle that it makes him break windows though a peaceablydisposed man till i was appointed and whats the use o their haeing a policeman when they winna come to the lockup after i lay hands on them  do they say they wont come  say catch them saying onything they just gie me a wap into the gutters if they would speak i wouldna complain for im natrally the sociablest man in thrums  rob however had spoken to you  because he had need o me that was ay robs way converted or no converted when he was blind drunk he would order me to see him safe hame but would he crack wi me na na  wearyworld who was so called because of his forlorn way of muttering its a weary warld and nobody bides int as he went his melancholy rounds sighed like one about to cry and gavin changed the subject  is the watch for the soldiers still kept up he asked  it is but the watchers winna let me in aside them ill let you see that for yoursel at me head o the roods for they watch there in the auld windmill  most of the thrums lights were already out and that in the windmill disappeared as footsteps were heard  youre desperate characters the policeman cried but got no answer he changed his tactics  a fine nicht for the time o year he cried no answer  but i wouldna wonder he shouted though we had rain afore morning no answer  surely you could gie me a word frae ahint the door youre doing an onlawful thing but i dinna ken wha you are  youll swear to that some one asked gruffly  i swear to it peter  wearyworld tried another six remarks in vain  ay he said to the minister thats what it is to be an onpopular man and now ill hae to turn back for the very anes that winna let me join them would be the first to complain if i gaed out o bounds  gavin found dow at new zealand a hamlet of mud houses whose tenants could be seen on any sabbath morning washing themselves in the burn that trickled hard by robs son micah was asleep at the door but he brightened when he saw who was shaking him  my father put me out he explained because hes daft for the drink and was fleid he would curse me he hasna cursed me micah added proudly for an aught days come sabbath hearken to him at his loom he daurna take his feet off the treadles for fear o running straucht to the drink  gavin went in the loom and two stools the one fourfooted and the other a buffet were robs most conspicuous furniture a shavingstrap hung on the wall the fire was out but the trunk of a tree charred at one end showed how he heated his house he made a fire of peat and on it placed one end of a tree trunk that might be six feet long as the tree burned away it was pushed further into the fireplace and a roaring fire could always be got by kicking pieces of the smouldering wood and blowing them into flame with the bellows when rob saw the minister he groaned relief and left his loom he had been weaving his teeth clenched his eyes on fire for seven hours  i wasna fleid little micah said to the neighbours afterwards to gang in wi the minister hes a fine man that he didna ca my father names na he said youre a brave fellow rob and he took my fathers hand he did my father was shaking after his fecht wi the drink and says he mr dishart he says if youll let me break out nows and nans i could bide straucht atween times but i canna keep sober if i hinna a drink to look forrit to ay my father prigged sair to get one fou day in the month and he said syne if i die sudden theres thirty chances to one that i gang to heaven so its worth risking but mr dishart wouldna hear ot and he cries no by god he cries well wrestle wi the devil till we throttle him and down him and my father gaed on their knees  the minister prayed a lang time till my father said his hunger for the drink was gone but he says it swells up in me o a sudden aye and it may be back afore youre hame then come to me at once says mr dishart but my father says na for it would haul me into the publichouse as if it had me at the end o a rope but ill send the laddie  you saw my father crying the minister back it was to gie him twa pound and says my father god helping me he says ill droon mysel in the dam rather than let the drink master me but in case it should get haud o me and i should die drunk it would be a michty gratification to me to ken that you had the siller to bury me respectable without ony help frae the poors rates the minister wasna for taking it at first but he took it when he saw how earnest my father was ay hes a noble man after he gaed awa my father made me learn the names o the apostles frae luke sixth and he says to me miss out bartholomew he says for he did little and put gavin dishart in his place  feeling as old as he sometimes tried to look gavin turned homeward margaret was already listening for him you may be sure she knew his step i think our steps vary as much as the human face my bookshelves were made by a blind man who could identify by their steps nearly all who passed his window yet he has admitted to me that he could not tell wherein my steps differed from others and this i believe though rejecting his boast that he could distinguish a ministers step from a doctors and even tell to which denomination the minister belonged  i have sometimes asked myself what would have been gavins future had he gone straight home that night from dows he would doubtless have seen the egyptian before morning broke but she would not have come upon him like a witch there are i dare say many lovers who would never have been drawn to each other had they met for the first time as say they met the second time but such dreaming is to no purpose gavin met sanders webster the molecatcher and was persuaded by him to go home by caddam wood  gavin took the path to caddam because sanders told him the wild lindsays were there a gypsy family that threatened the farmers by day and danced devilishly it was said at night the little minister knew them by repute as a race of giants and that not many persons would have cared to face them alone at midnight but he was feeling as one wound up to heavy duties and meant to admonish them severely  sanders an old man who lived with his sister nanny on the edge of the wood went with him and for a time both were silent but sanders had something to say  was you ever at the spittal mr dishart he asked  lord rintouls house at the top of glen quharity no  hae you ever looked on a lord  no  or on an auld lords young leddyship i have  what is she  you surely ken that rintouls auld and is to be married on a young leddyship shes no a leddyship yet but theyre to be married soon so i may say ive seen a leddyship ay an impressive sicht it was yestreen  is there a great difference in their ages  as muckle as atween auld peter spens and his wife wha was saxteen when he was saxty and she was playing at dumps in the street when her man was waiting for her to make his porridge ay sic a differ doesna suit wi common folk but of course earls can please themsels rintouls so fond o the leddyship at is to be that when she was at the school in edinbury he wrote to her ilka day kaytherine crummie telled me that and she says aince youre used to it writing letters is as easy as skinning moles i dinna ken what they can write sic a heap about but i daur say he gies her his views on the chartist agitation and the potato disease and shell write back about the romantic sichts o edinbury and the sermons o the grand preachers she hears sal though thae grand folk has no religion to speak o for theyre a english kirk youre no speiring what her leddyship said to me  what did she say  weel you see there was a dancing ball on and kaytherine crummie took me to a window whaur i could stand on a flowerpot and watch the critturs whirling round in the ball like teetotums whats mair she pointed out the leddyship thats to be to me and i just glowered at her for thinks i take your fill sanders and whaur theres lords and leddyships dinna waste a minute on colonels and honourable misses and sic like dirt ay but what wi my een blinking at the blaze o candles i lost sicht o her till all at aince somebody says at my lug well my man and who is the prettiest lady in the room mr dishart it was her leddyship she looked like a star  and what did you do  the first thing i did was to fall aff the flowerpot but syne i came to and says i wi a polite smirk im thinking your leddyship says i as youre the bonniest yourself  i see you are a cute man sanders  ay but thats no a she lauched in a pleased way and tapped me wi her fan and says she why do you think me the prettiest i dinna deny but what that staggered me but i thocht a minute and took a look at the other dancers again and syne i says michty sly like the other leddies i says has sic sma feet  sanders stopped here and looked doubtingly at gavin  i canna make up my mind he said whether she liked that for she rapped my knuckles wi her fan fell sair and aff she gaed ay i consulted tammas haggart about it and he says the flirty crittur he says what would you say mr dishart  gavin managed to escape without giving an answer for here their roads separated he did not find the wild lindsays however children of whim of prodigious strength while in the open but destined to wither quickly in the hot air of towns they had gone from caddam leaving nothing of themselves behind but a black mark burned by their fires into the ground thus they branded the earth through many counties until some hour when the spirit of wandering again fell on them and they forsook their hearths with as little compunction as the bird leaves its nest  gavin had walked quickly and he now stood silently in the wood his hat in his hand in the moonlight the grass seemed tipped with hoar frost most of the beeches were already bare but the shoots clustering round them like children at their mothers skirts still retained their leaves red and brown among the pines these leaves were as incongruous as a weddingdress at a funeral gavin was standing on grass but there were patches of heather within sight and broom and the leaf of the blaeberry where the beeches had drawn up the earth with them as they grew their roots ran this way and that slippery to the feet and looking like disinterred bones a squirrel appeared suddenly on the charred ground looked doubtfully at gavin to see if he was growing there and then glided up a tree where it sat eyeing him and forgetting to conceal its shadow caddam was very still at long intervals came from far away the whack of an axe on wood gavin was in a world by himself and this might be someone breaking into it  the mystery of woods by moonlight thrilled the little minister his eyes rested on the shining roots and he remembered what had been told him of the legend of caddam how once on a time it was a mighty wood and a maiden most beautiful stood on its confines panting and afraid for a wicked man pursued her how he drew near and she ran a little way into the wood and he followed her and she still ran and still he followed until both were for ever lost and the bones of her pursuer lie beneath a beech but the lady may still be heard singing in the woods if the night be fine for then she is a glad spirit but weeping when there is wild wind for then she is but a mortal seeking a way out of the wood  the squirrel slid down the fir and was gone the axes blows ceased nothing that moved was in sight the wind that has its nest in trees was circling around with many voices that never rose above a whisper and were often but the echo of a sigh gavin was in the caddam of past days where the beautiful maiden wanders ever waiting for him who is so pure that he may find her he will wander over the treetops looking for her with the moon for his lamp and some night he will hear her singing the little minister drew a deep breath and his foot snapped a brittle twig then he remembered who and where he was and stooped to pick up his staff but he did not pick it up for as his fingers were closing on it the lady began to sing  for perhaps a minute gavin stood stock still like an intruder then he ran towards the singing which seemed to come from windy ghoul a straight road through caddam that farmers use in summer but leave in the back end of the year to leaves and pools in windyghoul there is either no wind or so much that it rushes down the sieve like an army entering with a shriek of terror and escaping with a derisive howl the moon was crossing the avenue but gavin only saw the singer  she was still fifty yards away sometimes singing gleefully and again letting her body sway lightly as she came dancing up windyghoul soon she was within a few feet of the little minister to whom singing except when out of tune was a suspicious thing and dancing a device of the devil his arm went out wrathfully and his intention was to pronounce sentence on this woman  but she passed unconscious of his presence and he had not moved nor spoken though really of the average height she was a little thing to the eyes of gavin who always felt tall and stout except when he looked down the grace of her swaying figure was a new     chapter v  a warlike chapter culminating in the flouting of the minister by the woman   mr dishart  jean had clutched at gavin in bank street her hair was streaming and her wrapper but half buttoned  oh mr dishart look at the mistress i couldna keep her in the manse  gavin saw his mother beside him bareheaded trembling  how could i sit still gavin and the town full o the skirls of women and bairns oh gavin what can i do for them they will suffer most this night  as gavin took her hand he knew that margaret felt for the people more than he  but you must go home mother he said and leave me to do my duty i will take you myself if you will not go with jean be careful of her jean  ay will i jean answered then burst into tears mr dishart she cried if they take my father theyd best take my mither too  the two women went back to the manse where jean relit the fire having nothing else to do and boiled the kettle while margaret wandered in anguish from room to room  men nearly naked ran past gavin seeking to escape from thrums by the fields he had descended when he shouted to them they only ran faster a tillyloss weaver whom he tried to stop struck him savagely and sped past to the square in bank street which was full move he had heard the horn thrice it sounded and thrice it struck him to the heart he looked again and saw a shadow stealing along the tenements then another then halfadozen he remembered mr carfraes words if you ever hear that horn i implore you to hasten to the square and in another minute he had reached the tenements  now again he saw the gypsy she ran past him halfascore of men armed with staves and pikes at her heels at first he thought they were chasing her but they were following her as a leader her eyes sparkled as she waved them to the square with her arms  the soldiers the soldiers was the universal cry  who is that woman demanded gavin catching hold of a frightened old man  curse the egyptian limmer the man answered shes egging my laddie on to fecht  bless her rather the son cried for warning us that the sojers is coming put your ear to the ground mr dishart and youll hear the dirl o their feet  the young man rushed away to the square flinging his father from him gavin followed as he turned into the school wynd the town drum began to beat windows were thrown open and sullen men ran out of closes where women were screaming and trying to hold them back at the foot of the wynd gavin passed sanders webster  mr dishart the molecatcher cried hae you seen that egyptian may i be struck dead if its no her little leddyship  but gavin did not hear him thing in the world to him only while she passed did he see her as a gleam of colour a gypsy elf poorly clad her bare feet flashing beneath a short green skirt a twig of rowan berries stuck carelessly into her black hair her face was pale she had an angels loveliness gavin shook  still she danced onwards but she was very human for when she came to muddy water she let her feet linger in it and flung up her arms dancing more wantonly than before a diamond on her finger shot a thread of fire over the pool undoubtedly she was the devil  gavin leaped into the avenue and she heard him and looked behind he tried to cry woman sternly but lost the word for now she saw him and laughed with her shoulders and beckoned to him so that he shook his fist at her she tripped on but often turning her head beckoned and mocked him and he forgot his dignity and his pulpit and all other things and ran after her up windyghoul did he pursue her and it was well that the precentor was not there to see she reached the mouth of the avenue and kissing her hand to gavin so that the ring gleamed again was gone  the ministers one thought was to find her but he searched in vain she might be crossing the hill on her way to thrums or perhaps she was still laughing at him from behind a tree after a longer time than he was aware of gavin realised that his boots were chirping and his trousers streaked with mud then he abandoned the search and hastened homewards in a rage  from the hill to the manse the nearest way is down two fields and the little minister descended them rapidly thrums which is red in daylight was grey and still as the cemetery he had glimpses of several of its deserted streets to the south the watchlight showed brightly but no other was visible so it seemed to gavin and thensuddenlyhe lost the power to of people at one moment and empty the next the minister stumbled over old charles yuill  take me and welcome yuill cried mistaking gavin for the enemy he had only one arm through the sleeve of his jacket and his feet were bare  i am mr dishart are the soldiers already in the square yuill  theyll be there in a minute  the man was so weak that gavin had to hold him  be a man charles you have nothing to fear it is not such as you the soldiers have come for if need be i can swear that you had not the strength even if you had the will to join in the weavers riot  for godsake mr dishart yuill cried his hands chattering on gavins coat dinna swear that my laddie was in the thick o the riot and if hes taen theres the poorshouse gaping for kitty and me for i couldna weave half a web a week if theres a warrant agin onybody o the name of yuill swear its me swear im a desperate character swear im michty strong for all i look palsied and if when they take me my courage breaks down swear the mair swear i confessed my guilt to you on the book  as yuill spoke the quick rubadub of a drum was heard  the soldiers gavin let go his hold of the old man who hastened away to give himself up  thats no the sojers said a woman its the folk gathering in the square thisll be a watery sabbath in thrums  rob dow shouted gavin as dow flung past with a scythe in his hand lay down that scythe  to hell wi religion rob retorted fiercely it spoils a thing  lay down that scythe i command you  rob stopped undecidedly then cast the scythe from him but its rattle on the stones was more than he could bear  i winna he cried and picking it up ran to the square  an upper window in bank street opened and dr mcqueen put out his head he was smoking as usual  mr dishart he said you will return home at once if you are a wise man or better still come in here you can do nothing with these people tonight  i can stop their fighting  you will only make black blood between them and you  dinna heed him mr dishart cried some women  you had better heed him cried a man  i will not desert my people gavin said  listen then to my prescription the doctor replied drive that gypsy lassie out of the town before the soldiers reach it she is firing the men to a redheat through sheer devilry  she brocht the news or we would have been nipped in our beds some people cried  does any one know who she is gavin demanded but all shook their heads the egyptian as they called her had never been seen in these parts before  has any other person seen the soldiers he asked perhaps this is a false alarm  several have seen them within the last few minutes the doctor answered they came from tilliedrum and were advancing on us from the south but when they heard that we had got the alarm they stopped at the top of the brae near tnowheads farm man you would take these things more coolly if you smoked  show me this woman gavin said sternly to those who had been listening then a stream of people carried him into the square  the square has altered little even in these days of enterprise when tillyloss has become newton bank and the craft head croft terrace with enamelled labels on them for the guidance of slow people who forget their address and have to run to the end of the street and look up every time they write a letter the stones on which the butterwives sat have disappeared and with them the clay walls and the outside stairs gone too is the stair of the townhouse from the top of which the drummer roared the gossip of the week on sabbaths to country folk to the scandal of all who knew that the proper thing on that day is to keep your blinds down but the townhouse itself round and red still makes exit to the south troublesome wherever streets meet the square there is a house in the centre of them and thus the heart of thrums is a box in which the stranger finds himself suddenly wondering at first how he is to get out and presently how he got in  to gavin who never before had seen a score of people in the square at once here was a sight strange and terrible andrew struthers an old soldier stood on the outside stair of the town house shouting words of command to some fifty weavers many of them scantily clad but all armed with pikes and poles most were known to the little minister but they wore faces that were new to him newcomers joined the body every moment if the drill was clumsy the men were fierce hundreds of people gathered around some screaming some shaking their fists at the old soldier many trying to pluck their relatives out of danger gavin could not see the egyptian women and old men fighting for the possession of his ear implored him to disperse the armed band he ran up the townhouse stair and in a moment it had become a pulpit  dinna dare to interfere mr dishart struthers said savagely  andrew struthers said gavin solemnly in the name of god i order you to leave me alone if you dont he added ferociously ill fling you over the stair  dinna heed him andrew some one shouted and another cried he canna understand our sufferings he has dinner ilka day  struthers faltered however and gavin cast his eye over the armed men  rob dow he said william carmichael thomas whamond william munn alexander hobart henders haggart step forward  these were auld lichts and when they found that the minister would not take his eyes off them they obeyed all save rob dow  never mind him rob said the atheist cruickshanks its better playing cards in hell than singing psalms in heaven  joseph cruickshanks responded gavin grimly you will find no cards down there  then rob also came to the foot of the stair there was some angry muttering from the crowd and young charles yuill exclaimed curse you would you lord it ower us on weekdays as weel as on sabbaths  lay down your weapons gavin said to the six men  they looked at each other hobart slipped his pike behind his back  i hae no weapon he said slily  let me hae my fling this nicht dow entreated and ill promise to bide sober for a twelvemonth  oh rob rob the minister said bitterly are you the man i prayed with a few hours ago  the scythe fell from robs hands  down wi your pikes he roared to his companions or ill brain you wi them  ay lay them down the precentor whispered but keep your feet on them  then the minister who was shaking with excitement though he did not know it stretched forth his arms for silence and it came so suddenly as to frighten the people in the neighboring streets  if he prays were done for cried young charles yuill but even in that hour many of the people were unbonneted  oh thou who art the lord of hosts gavin prayed we are in thy hands this night these are thy people and they have sinned but thou art a merciful god and they were sore tried and knew not what they did to thee our god we turn for deliverance for without thee we are lost  the little ministers prayer was heard all round the square and many weapons were dropped as an amen to it  if you fight cried gavin brightening as he heard the clatter of the iron on the stones your wives and children may be shot in the streets these soldiers have come for a dozen of you will you be benefited if they take away a hundred  oh hearken to him cried many women  i winna answered a man for im ane o the dozen whaurs the egyptian  here  gavin saw the crowd open and the woman of windy ghoul come out of it and while he should have denounced her he only blinked for once more her loveliness struck him full in the eyes she was beside him on the stair before he became a minister again  how dare you woman he cried but she flung a rowan berry at him  if i were a man she exclaimed addressing the people i wouldna let myself be catched like a mouse in a trap  we winna some answered  what kind o women are you cried the egyptian her face gleaming as she turned to her own sex that bid your men folk gang to gaol when a bold front would lead them to safety do you want to be husbandless and hameless  disperse i command you cried gavin this abandoned woman is inciting you to riot  dinna heed this little man the egyptian retorted  it is curious to know that even at that anxious moment gavin winced because she called him little  she has the face of a mischiefmaker he shouted and her words are evil  you men and women o thrums she responded ken that i wish you weel by the service i hae done you this nicht wha telled you the sojers was coming  it was you it was you  ay and mony a mile i ran to bring the news listen and ill tell you mair  she has a false tongue gavin cried listen not to the brazen woman  what i have to tell she said is as true as what ive telled already and how true that is you a ken youre wondering how the sojers has come to a stop at the tap o the brae instead o marching on the town heres the reason they agreed to march straucht to the square if the alarm wasna given but if it was they were to break into small bodies and surround the town so that you couldna get out thats what theyre doing now  at this the screams were redoubled and many men lifted the weapons they had dropped  believe her not cried gavin how could a wandering gypsy know all this  ay how can you ken some demanded  its enough that i do ken the egyptian answered and this mair i ken that the captain of the soldiers is confident hell nab every one o you thats wanted anless you do one thing  what is t  if you a run different ways youre lost but if you keep thegither youll be able to force a road into the country whaur you can scatter thats what hes fleid youll do  then its what we will do  it is what you will not do gavin said passionately the truth is not in this wicked woman  but scarcely had he spoken when he knew that startling news had reached the square a murmur arose on the skirts of the mob and swept with the roar of the sea towards the townhouse a detachment of the soldiers were marching down the roods from the north  theres some coming frae the easttown end was the next intelligence and theyve gripped sanders webster and auld charles yuill has given himsel up  you see you see the gypsy said flashing triumph at gavin  lay down your weapons gavin cried but his power over the people had gone  the egyptian spoke true they shouted dinna heed the minister  gavin tried to seize the gypsy by the shoulders but she slipped past him down the stair and crying follow me ran round the townhouse and down the brae  woman he shouted after her but she only waved her arms scornfully the people followed her many of the men still grasping their weapons but all in disorder within a minute after gavin saw the gleam of the ring on her finger as she waved her hands he and dow were alone in the square  shes an awfu woman that rob said i saw her lauching  gavin ground his teeth  rob dow he said slowly if i had not found christ i would have throttled that woman you saw how she flouted me     chapter vi  in which the soldiers meet the amazons of thrums   dow looked shamefacedly at the minister and then set off up the square  where are you going rob  to gie myself up i maun do something to let you see theres one man in thrums that has mair faith in you than in a fliskmahoy  and only one rob but i dont know that they want to arrest you  ay i had a hand in tying the polissman to the  i want to hear nothing about that gavin said quickly  will i hide then  i dare not advise you to do that it would be wrong  half a score of fugitives tore past the townhouse and were out of sight without a cry there was a tread of heavier feet and a dozen soldiers with several policemen and two prisoners appeared suddenly on the north side of the square  rob cried the minister in desperation run  when the soldiers reached the townhouse where they locked up their prisoners dow was skulking eastward and gavin running down the brae  theyre fechting he was told theyre fechting on the brae the sojers is firing a mans killed  but this was an exaggeration  the brae though short is very steep there is a hedge on one side of it from which the land falls away and on the other side a hillock gavin reached the scene to see the soldiers marching down the brae guarding a small body of policemen the armed weavers were retreating before them a hundred women or more were on the hillock shrieking and gesticulating gavin joined them calling on them not to fling the stones they had begun to gather  the armed men broke into a rabble flung down their weapons and fled back towards the townhouse here they almost ran against the soldiers in the square who again forced them into the brae finding themselves about to be wedged between the two forces some crawled through the hedge where they were instantly seized by policemen others sought to climb up the hillock and then escape into the country the policemen clambered after them the men were too frightened to fight but a woman seized a policeman by the waist and flung him head foremost among the soldiers one of these shouted fire but the captain cried no then came showers of missiles from the women they stood their ground and defended the retreat of the scared men  who flung the first stone is not known but it is believed to have been the egyptian the policemen were recalled and the whole body ordered to advance down the brae thus the weavers who had not escaped at once were driven before them and soon hemmed in between the two bodies of soldiers when they were easily captured but for two minutes there was a thick shower of stones and clods of earth  it was ever afterwards painful to gavin to recall this scene but less on account of the shower of stones than because of the flight of one divit in it he had been watching the handsome young captain halliwell riding with his men admiring him too for his coolness this coolness exasperated the gypsy who twice flung at halliwell and missed him he rode on smiling contemptuously  oh if i could only fling straight the egyptian moaned  then she saw the minister by her side and in the tick of a clock something happened that can never be explained for the moment gavin was so lost in misery over the probable effect of the nights rioting that he had forgotten where he was suddenly the egyptians beautiful face was close to his and she pressed a divit into his hand at the same time pointing at the officer and whispering hit him  gavin flung the clod of earth and hit halliwell on the head  i say i cannot explain this i tell what happened and add with thankfulness that only the egyptian witnessed the deed gavin i suppose had flung the divit before he could stay his hand then he shrank in horror  woman he cried again  you are a dear she said and vanished  by the time gavin was breathing freely again the lockup was crammed with prisoners and the riot act had been read from the townhouse stair it is still remembered that the baronbailie to whom this duty fell had got no further than victoria by the grace of god when the paper was struck out of his hands  when a stirring event occurs up here we smack our lips over it for months and so i could still write a history of that memorable night in thrums i could tell how the doctor a man whose shoulders often looked as if they had been caught in a shower of tobacco ash brought me the news to the schoolhouse and now when i crossed the fields to dumfounder waster lunny with it i found birse the post reeling off the story to him as fast as a fisher could let out line i know who was the first woman on the marywell brae to hear the horn and how she woke her husband and who heard it first at the denhead and the tenements with what they immediately said and did i had from dite deuchars own lips the curious story of his sleeping placidly throughout the whole disturbance and on wakening in the morning yoking to his loom as usual and also his statement that such illluck was enough to shake a mans faith in religion the police had knowledge that enabled them to go straight to the houses of the weavers wanted but they sometimes brought away the wrong man for such of the people as did not escape from the town had swopped houses for the nighta trick that served them better than all their drilling on the hill old yuills son escaped by burying himself in a peat rick and snecky hobart by pretending that he was a sack of potatoes less fortunate was sanders webster the molecatcher already mentioned sanders was really an innocent man he had not even been in thrums on the night of the rising against the manufacturers but thinking that the outbreak was to be left unpunished he wanted his share in the glory of it so he had boasted of being a ringleader until many believed him including the authorities his braggadocio undid him he was run to earth in a pigsty and got nine months with the other arrests i need not concern myself for they have no part in the story of the little minister  while gavin was with the families whose breadwinners were now in the lockup a cell that was usually crammed on fair nights and empty for the rest of the year the sheriff and halliwell were in the roundroom of the townhouse not in a good temper they spoke loudly and some of their words sank into the cell below  the whole thing has been a fiasco the sheriff was heard saying owing to our failing to take them by surprise why threefourths of those taken will have to be liberated and we have let the worst offenders slip through our hands  well answered halliwell who was wearing a heavy cloak i have brought your policemen into the place and that is all i undertook to do  you brought them but at the expense of alarming the country side i wish we had come without you  nonsense my men advanced like ghosts could your police have come down that brae alone tonight  yes because it would have been deserted your soldiers i tell you have done the mischief this woman who so many of our prisoners admit brought the news of our coming must either have got it from one of your men or have seen them on the march  the men did not know their destination true she might have seen us despite our precautions but you forget that she told them how we were to act in the event of our being seen that is what perplexes me  yes and me too for it was a close secret between you and me and lord rintoul and not halfadozen others  well find the woman and we shall get the explanation if she is still in the town she cannot escape for my men are everywhere  she was seen ten minutes ago  then she is ours i say riach if i were you i would set all my prisoners free and take away a cartload of their wives instead i have only seen the backs of the men of thrums but on my word i very nearly ran away from the women hallo i believe one of your police has caught our virago singlehanded  so halliwell exclaimed hearing some one shout this is the rascal but it was not the egyptian who was then thrust into the roundroom it was john dunwoodie looking very sly probably there was not even in thrums a cannier man than dunwoodie his religious views were those of cruickshanks but he went regularly to church on the offchance of there being a god after all so im safe whatever side may be wrong  this is the man explained a policeman who brought the alarm he admits himself having been in tilliedrum just before we started  your name my man the sheriff demanded  it micht be john dunwoodie the tinsmith answered cautiously  but is it  i dinna say its no  you were in tilliedrum this evening  i micht hae been  were you  ill swear to nothing  why not  because im a canny man  into the cell with him halliwell cried losing patience  leave him to me said the sheriff i understand the sort of man now dunwoodie what were you doing in tilliedrum  i was taking my laddie down to be prenticed to a writer there answered dunwoodie falling into the sheriffs net  what are you yourself  i micht be a tinsmith to trade  and you a mere tinsmith dare to tell me that a lawyer was willing to take your son into his office be cautious dunwoodie  weel then the laddies highly edicated and i hae siller and thats how the writer was to take him and make a gentleman o him  i learn from the neighbours the policeman explained that this is partly true but what makes us suspect him is this he left the laddie at tilliedrum and yet when he came home the first person he sees at the fireside is the laddie himself the laddie had run home and the reason plainly was that he had heard of our preparations and wanted to alarm the town  there seems something in this dunwoodie the sheriff said and if you cannot explain it i must keep you in custody  ill make a clean breast ot dunwoodie replied seeing that in this matter truth was best the laddie was terrible against being made a gentleman and when he saw the kind o life he would hae to lead clean hands clean dickies and no gutters on his breeks his heart took mair scunner at genteelity than ever and he ran hame ay i was mad when i saw him at the fireside but he says to me how would you like to be a gentleman yoursel father he says and that so affected me at im to gie him his ain way  another prisoner dave langlands was confronted with dunwoodie  john dunwoodies as innocent as i am mysel dave said and im most michty innocent it wasna john but the egyptian that gave the alarm i tell you what sheriff if itll make me innocenterlike ill picture the egyptian to you just as i saw her and syne youll be able to catch her easier  you are an honest fellow said the sheriff  i only wish i had the whipping of him growled halliwell who was of a generous nature  for what business had she continued dave righteously to meddle in other folks business shes no a thrums lassie and so i say let the law take its course on her  will you listen to such a cur riach asked halliwell  certainly speak out langlands  weel then i was in the windmill the nicht  you were a watcher  i happened to be in the windmill wi another man dave went on avoiding the officers question  what was his name demanded halliwell  it was the egyptian i was to tell you about dave said looking to the sheriff  ah yes you only tell tales about women said halliwell  strange women corrected dave weel we was there and it would maybe be twal oclock and we was speaking but about lawful things when we heard some ane running yont the road i keeked through a hole in the door and i saw it was an egyptian lassie at i had never clapped een on afore she saw the licht in the window and she cried hie you billies in the windmill the sojers is coming i fell in a fricht but the other man opened the door and again she cries the sojers is coming quick or youll be taen at that the other man up wi his bonnet and ran but i didna make off so smart  you had to pick yourself up first suggested the officer  sal it was the lassie picked me up ay and she picked up a horn at the same time  blaw on that she cried and alarm the town but sheriff i didna dot na i had ower muckle respect for the law  in other words said halliwell you also bolted and left the gypsy to blow the horn herself  i dinna deny but what i made my feet my friend but it wasna her that blew the horn i ken that for i looked back and saw her trying to dot but she couldna she didna ken the way  then who did blow it  the first man she met i suppose we a kent that the horn was to be the signal except wearywarld hes police so we kept it frae him  that is all you saw of the woman  ay for i ran straucht to my garret and there your men took me can i gae hame now sheriff  no you cannot describe the womans appearance  she had a heap o rowan berries stuck in her hair and i think she had on a green wrapper and a red shawl she had a most extraordinary face i canna exact describe it for she would be lauchin one second and syne solemn the next i tell you her face changed as quick as you could turn the pages o a book ay here comes wearywarld to speak up for me  wearyworld entered cheerfully  this is the local policeman a tilliedrum officer said we have been searching for him everywhere and only found him now  where have you been asked the sheriff wrathfully  whaur maist honest men is at this hour replied wearyworld in my bed  how dared yon ignore your duty at such a time  its a long story the policeman answered pleasantly in anticipation of a talk at last  answer me in a word  in a word cried the policeman quite crestfallen it canna be done youll need to crossexamine me too its my lawful richt  ill take you to the tilliedrum gaol for your share in this nights work if you do not speak to the purpose why did you not hasten to our assistance  as sure as death i never kent you was here i was up the roods on my rounds when i heard an awfu din down in the square and thinks i theres rough characters about and the place for honest folk is their bed so to my bed i gaed and i was int when your men gripped me we must see into this before we leave in the meantime you will act as a guide to my searchers stop do you know anything of this egyptian  what egyptian ist a lassie wi rowans in her hair  the same have you seen her  that i have theres nothing agin her is there whatever it is ill uphaud she didna dot for a simpler frankerspoken crittur couldna be  never mind what i want her for when did you see her  it would be about twal oclock began wearyworld unctuously when i was in the roods ay no lang afore i heard the disturbance in the square i was standing in the middle o the road wondering how the door o the windmill was swinging open when she came up to me  a fine nicht for the time o year i says to her for nobody but the minister had spoken to me a day  a very fine nicht says she very frank though she was breathing quick like as if she had been running youll be police says she  i am says i and wha be you  im just a puir gypsy lassie she says  and whats that in your hand says i  its a horn i found in the wood says she but its rusty and winna blaw  i laughed at her ignorance and says i i warrant i could blaw it  i dinna believe you says she  gie me haud ot says i and she gae it to me and i blew some bonny blasts ont ay you see she didna ken the way ot thank you kindly says she and she ran awa without even minding to take the horn back again  you incredible idiot cried the sheriff then it was you who gave the alarm  what hae i done to madden you honest wearyworld asked in perplexity  get out of my sight sir roared the sheriff  but the captain laughed  i like your doughty policeman riach he said hie obliging friend let us hear how this gypsy struck you how was she dressed  she was snod but no unca snod replied weary world stiffly  i dont understand you  i mean she was couthie but no sair in order  what on earth is that  weel a tasty stocky but gey orra put on  what language are you speaking you enigma  im saying she was naturally a bonny bit kimmer rather than happit up to the nines  oh go away cried halliwell whereupon wearyworld descended the stair haughtily declaring that the sheriff was an unreasonable man and that he was a queer captain who did not understand the english language  can i gae hame now sheriff asked langlands hopefully  take this fellow back to his cell riach directed shortly and whatever else you do see that you capture this woman halliwell i am going out to look for her myself confound it what are you laughing at  at the way this vixen has slipped through your fingers  not quite that sir not quite that she is in thrums still and i swear ill have her before day breaks see to it halliwell that if she is brought here in my absence she does not slip through your fingers  if she is brought here said halliwell mocking him you must return and protect me it would be cruelty to leave a poor soldier in the hands of a woman of thrums  she is not a thrums woman you have been told so a dozen times  then i am not afraid  in the roundroom which is oblong there is a throne on which the bailie sits when he dispenses justice it is swathed in red cloths that give it the appearance of a pulpit left to himself halliwell flung off his cloak and taking a chair near this dais rested his legs on the bare wooden table one on each side of the lamp he was still in this position when the door opened and two policemen thrust the egyptian into the room     chapter vii  has the folly of looking into a womans eyes by way of text   this is the woman captain one of the policemen said in triumph and begging your pardon will you keep a grip of her till the sheriff comes back  halliwell did not turn his head  you can leave her here he said carelessly three of us are not needed to guard a woman  but shes a slippery customer  you can go said halliwell and the policemen withdrew slowly eyeing their prisoner doubtfully until the door closed then the officer wheeled round languidly expecting to find the egyptian gaunt and muscular  now then he drawled whyby jove  the gallant soldier was as much taken aback as if he had turned to find a pistol at his ear he took his feet off the table yet he only saw the gypsys girlish figure in its red and green for she had covered her face with her hands she was looking at him intently between her fingers but he did not know this all he did want to know just then was what was behind the hands  before he spoke again she had perhaps made up her mind about him for she began to sob bitterly at the same time she slipped a finger over her ring  why dont you look at me asked halliwell selfishly  i daurna  am i so fearsome  youre a sojer and you would shoot me like a craw  halliwell laughed and taking her wrists in his hands uncovered her face  oh by jove he said again but this time to himself  as for the egyptian she slid the ring into her pocket and fell back before the officers magnificence  oh she cried is all sojers like you  there was such admiration in her eyes that it would have been selfcontempt to doubt her yet having smiled complacently halliwell became uneasy  who on earth are you he asked finding it wise not to look her in the face why do you not answer me more quickly  dinna be angry at that captain the egyptian implored i promised my mither aye to count twenty afore i spoke because she thocht i was ower glib captain how ist that youre so fleid to look at me  thus put on his mettle halliwell again faced her with the result that his question changed to where did you get those eyes then was he indignant with himself  what i want to know he explained severely is how you were able to acquaint the thrums people with our movements that you must tell me at once for the sheriff blames my soldiers come now no counting twenty  he was pacing the room now and she had her face to herself it said several things among them that the officer evidently did not like this charge against his men  does the shirra blame the sojers exclaimed this quickwitted egyptian weel that cows for he has nane to blame but himsel  what cried halliwell delighted it was the sheriff who told tales answer me you are counting a hundred this time  perhaps the gypsy had two reasons for withholding her answer if so one of them was that as the sheriff had told nothing she had a story to make up the other was that she wanted to strike a bargain with the officer  if i tell you she said eagerly will you set me free  i may ask the sheriff to do so  but he mauna see me the egyptian said in distress theres reasons captain  why surely you have not been before him on other occasions said halliwell surprised  no in the way you mean muttered the gypsy and for the moment her eyes twinkled but the light in them went out when she remembered that the sheriff was near and she looked desperately at the window as if ready to fling herself from it she had very good reasons for not wishing to be seen by riach though fear that he would put her in gaol was not one of them  halliwell thought it was the one cause of her woe and great was his desire to turn the tables on the sheriff  tell me the truth he said and i promise to befriend you  weel then the gypsy said hoping still to soften his heart and making up her story as she told it yestreen i met the shirra and he tolled me a i hae telled the thrums folk this nicht  you can scarcely expect me to believe that where did you meet him  in glen quharity he was riding on a horse  well i allow he was there yesterday and on horseback he was on his way back to tilliedrum from lord rintouls place but dont tell me that he took a gypsy girl into his confidence  ay he did without kenning he was gieing his horse a drink when i met him and he let me tell him his fortune he said he would gaol me for an impostor if i didna tell him true so i gaed about it cautiously and after a minute or twa i telled him he was coming to thrums the nicht to nab the rioters  you are trifling with me interposed the indignant soldier you promised to tell me not what you said to the sheriff but how he disclosed our movements to you  and thats just what i am telling you only you hinna the rumelgumption to see it how do you think fortunes is telled first we get out o the man without his seeing what were after a about himsel and syne we repeat it to him thats what i did wi the shirra  you drew the whole thing out of him without his knowing  deed i did and he rode awa saying i was a witch  the soldier heard with the delight of a schoolboy  now if the sheriff does not liberate you at my request he said i will never let him hear the end of this story he was right you are a witch you deceived the sheriff yes undoubtedly you are a witch  he looked at her with fun in his face but the fun disappeared and a wondering admiration took its place  by jove he said i dont wonder you bewitched the sheriff i must take care or you will bewitch the captain too  at this notion he smiled but he also ceased looking at her suddenly the egyptian again began to cry  youre angry wi me she sobbed i wish i had never set een on you  why do you wish that halliwell asked  fine you ken she answered and again covered her face with her hands  he looked at her undecidedly  i am not angry with you he said gently you are an extraordinary girl  had he really made a conquest of this beautiful creature her words said so but had he the captain could not make up his mind he gnawed his moustache in doubt  there was silence save for the egyptians sobs halliwells heart was touched and he drew nearer her  my poor girl  he stopped was she crying was she not laughing at him rather he became red  the gypsy peeped at him between her fingers and saw that he was of two minds she let her hands fall from her face and undoubtedly there were tears on her cheeks  if youre no angry wi me she said sadly how will you no look at me  i am looking at you now  he was very close to her and staring into her wonderful eyes i am older than the captain and those eyes have dazzled me  captain dear  she put her hand in his his chest rose he knew she was seeking to beguile him but he could not take his eyes off hers he was in a worse plight than a woman listening to the first whisper of love  now she was further from him but the spell held she reached the door without taking her eyes from his face for several seconds he had been as a man mesmerised  just in time he came to it was when she turned from him to find the handle of the door she was turning it when his hand fell on hers so suddenly that she screamed he twisted her round  sit down there he said hoarsely pointing to the chair upon which he had flung his cloak she dared not disobey then he leant against the door his back to her for just then he wanted no one to see his face the gypsy sat very still and a little frightened  halliwell opened the door presently and called to the soldier on duty below  davidson see if you can find the sheriff i want him and davidson  the captain paused  yes he muttered and the old soldier marvelled at his words it is better davidson lock this door on the outside  davidson did as he was ordered and again the egyptian was left alone with halliwell  afraid of a woman she said contemptuously though her heart sank when she heard the key turn in the lock  i admit it he answered calmly  he walked up and down the room and she sat silently watching him  that story of yours about the sheriff was not true he said at last  i suspect it wasna answered the egyptian coolly hae you been thinking about it a this time captains i could tell you what youre thinking now youre wishing it had been true so that the ane o you couldna lauch at the other  silence said the captain and not another word would he speak until he heard the sheriff coming up the stair the egyptian trembled at his step and rose in desperation  why is the door locked cried the sheriff shaking it  all right answered halliwell the key is on your side  at that moment the egyptian knocked the lamp off the table and the room was at once in darkness the officer sprang at her and catching her by the skirt held on  why are you in darkness asked the sheriff as he entered  shut the door cried halliwell put your back to it  dont tell me the woman has escaped  i have her i have her she capsized the lamp the little jade shut the door  still keeping firm hold of her as he thought the captain relit the lamp with his other hand it showed an extraordinary scene the door was shut and the sheriff was guarding it halliwell was clutching the cloth of the bailies seat there was no egyptian  a moment passed before either man found his tongue  open the door after her cried halliwell  but the door would not open the egyptian had fled and locked it behind her  what the two men said to each other it would not be fitting to tell when davidson who had been gossiping at the corner of the townhouse released his captain and the sheriff the gypsy had been gone for some minutes  but she shant escape us riach cried and hastened out to assist in the pursuit  halliwell was in such a furious temper that he called up davidson and admonished him for neglect of duty     chapter viii  3 ammonstrous audacity of the woman   not till the stroke of three did gavin turn homeward with the legs of a ploughman and eyes rebelling against overwork seeking to comfort his dejected people whose courage lay spilt on the brae he had been in as many houses as the policemen the soldiers marching through the wynds came frequently upon him and found it hard to believe that he was always the same one they told afterwards that thrums was remarkable for the ferocity of its women and the number of its little ministers the morning was nipping cold and the streets were deserted for the people had been ordered within doors as he crossed the roods gavin saw a gleam of redcoats in the back wynd he heard a bugle blown a stir in the bankers close spoke of another seizure at the top of the school wynd two policeman of whom one was wearyworld stopped the minister with the flash of a lantern  we dauredna let you pass sir the tilliedrum man said without a good look at you thats the orders  i hereby swear said wearyworld authoritatively that this is no the egyptian signed peter spens policeman called by the vulgar wearyworld mr dishart you can pass unless youll bide a wee and gie us your crack  you have not found the gypsy then gavin asked  no the other policeman said but we ken shes within cry o this very spot and escape she canna  what mortal man can do wearyworld said were doing ay and mair but shes auld wecht and may find bilbie in queer places mr dishart my official opinion is that this egyptian is fearsomely like my snuffspoon ive kent me drap that spoon on the fender and be beat to find it in an hour and yet a the time i was sure it was there this is a gey mysterious world and womens the uncanniest things int its hardly mous to think how uncanny they are  this one deserves to be punished gavin said firmly she incited the people to riot  she did agreed weary world who was supping ravenously on sociability ay she even tried her tricks on me so that them that kens no better thinks she fooled me but shes cracky to gie her her due shes cracky and as for her being a cuttie youve said yoursel mr dishart that were all desperately wicked but were sair tried has it ever struck you that the trouts bites best on the sabbath gods critturs tempting decent men  come alang cried the tilliedrum man impatiently  im coming but i maun give mr dishart permission to pass first hae you heard mr dishart wearyworld whispered that the egyptian diddled baith the captain and the shirra its my official opinion that shes no better than a roasted onion the which if you grip it firm jumps out o sicht leaving its coat in your fingers mr dishart you can pass  the policeman turned down the school wynd and gavin who had already heard exaggerated accounts of the strange womans escape from the townhouse proceeded along the tenements he walked in the black shadows of the houses though across the way there was the morning light  in talking of the gypsy the little minister had as it were put on the black cap but now even though he shook his head angrily with every thought of her the scene in windyghoul glimmered before his eyes sometimes when he meant to frown he only sighed and then having sighed he shook himself he was unpleasantly conscious of his right hand which had flung the divit ah she was shameless and it would be a bright day for thrums that saw the last of her he hoped the policemen would succeed in it was the gladsomeness of innocence that he had seen dancing in the moonlight a mere woman could not be like that how soft and she had derided him he the auld licht minister of thrums had been flouted before his people by a hussy she was without reverence she knew no difference between an auld licht minister whose duty it was to speak and hers to listen and herself this woman deserved to be and the look she cast behind her as she danced and sang it was sweet so wistful the presence of purity had silenced him purity who had made him fling that divit he would think no more of her let it suffice that he knew what she was he would put her from his thoughts was it a ring on her finger  fifty yards in front of him gavin saw the road end in a wall of soldiers they were between him and the manse and he was still in darkness no sound reached him save the echo of his own feet but was it an echo he stopped and turned round sharply now he heard nothing he saw nothing yet was not that a human figure standing motionless in the shadow behind  he walked on and again heard the sound again he looked behind but this time without stopping the figure was following him he stopped so did it he turned back but it did not move it was the egyptian  gavin knew her despite the lane of darkness despite the long cloak that now concealed even her feet despite the hood over her head she was looking quite respectable but he knew her  he neither advanced to her nor retreated could the unhappy girl not see that she was walking into the arms of the soldiers but doubtless she had been driven from all her hidingplaces for a moment gavin had it in his heart to warn her but it was only for a moment the nest a sudden horror shot through him she was stealing toward him so softly that he had not seen her start the woman had designs on him gavin turned from her he walked so quickly that judges would have said he ran  the soldiers i have said stood in the dim light gavin had almost reached them when a little hand touched his arm  stop cried the sergeant hearing some one approaching and then gavin stepped out of the darkness with the gypsy on his arm  it is you mr dishart said the sergeant and your lady  i said gavin  his lady pinched his arm  yes she answered in an elegant english voice that made gavin stare at her but indeed i am sorry i ventured into the streets tonight i thought i might be able to comfort some of these unhappy people captain but i could do little sadly little  it is no scene for a lady maam but your husband has did you speak mr dishart  yes i must inf  my dear said the egyptian i quite agree witfe you so we need not detain the captain  im only a sergeant maam  indeed said the egyptian raising her pretty eyebrows and how long are you to remain in thrums sergeant  only for a few hours mrs dishart if this gypsy lassie had not given us so much trouble we might have been gone by now  ah yes i hope you will catch her sergeant  sergeant said gavin firmly i must  you must indeed dear said the egyptian for you are sadly tired goodnight sergeant  your servant mrs dishart your servant sir  but cried gavin  come love said the egyptian and she walked the distracted minister through the soldiers and up the manse road  the soldiers left behind gavin flung her arm from him and standing still shook his fist in her face  youyouwoman he said  this i think was the last time he called her a woman  but she was clapping her hands merrily  it was beautiful she exclaimed  it was iniquitous he answered and i a minister  you cant help that said the egyptian who pitied all ministers heartily  no gavin said misunderstanding her i could not help it no blame attaches to me  i meant that you could not help being a minister you could have helped saving me and i thank you so much  do not dare to thank me i forbid you to say that i saved you i did my best to hand you over to the authorities  then why did you not hand me over  gavin groaned  all you had to say continued the merciless egyptian was this is the person you are in search of i did not have my hand over your mouth why did you not say it  forbear said gavin woefully  it must have been the gypsy said because you really wanted to help me  then it was against my better judgment said gavin  i am glad of that said the gypsy mr dishart i do believe you like me all the time  can a man like a woman against his will gavin blurted out  of course he can said the egyptian speaking as one who knew that is the very nicest way to be liked  seeing how agitated gavin was remorse filled her and she said in a wheedling voice  it is all over and no one will know  passion sat on the ministers brow but he said nothing for the gypsys face had changed with her voice and the audacious woman was become a child  i am very sorry she said as if he had caught her stealing jam the hood had fallen back and she looked pleadingly at him she had the appearance of one who was entirely in his hands  there was a torrent of words in gavin but only these trickled forth  i dont understand you  you are not angry any more pleaded the egyptian  angry he cried with the righteous rage of one who when his leg is being sawn off is asked gently if it hurts him  i know you are she sighed and the sigh meant that men are strange  have you no respect for law and order demanded gavin  not much she answered honestly  he looked down the road to where the redcoats were still visible and his face became hard she read his thoughts  no she said becoming a woman again it is not yet too late why dont you shout to them  she was holding herself like a queen but there was no stiffness in her they might have been a pair of lovers and she the wronged one again she looked timidly at him and became beautiful in a new way her eyes said that lie was very cruel and she was only keeping back her tears till he had gone more dangerous than her face was her manner which gave gavin the privilege of making her unhappy it permitted him to argue with her it never implied that though he raged at her he must stand afar off it called him a bully but did not end the conversation  now but perhaps i should not tell this unless she is his wife a man is shot with a thrill of exultation every time a pretty woman allows him to upbraid her  i do not understand you gavin repeated weakly and the gypsy bent her head under this terrible charge  only a few hours ago he continued you were a gypsy girl in a fantastic dress barefooted  the egyptians bare foot at once peeped out mischievously from beneath the cloak then again retired into hiding  you spoke as broadly complained the minister somewhat taken aback by this apparition as any woman in thrums and now you fling a cloak over your shoulders and immediately become a fine lady who are you  perhaps answered the egyptian it is the cloak that has bewitched me she slipped out of it ay ay ou losh she said as if surprised it was just the cloak that did it for now im a puir ignorant bit lassie again my certie but claithes does make a differ to a woman  this was sheer levity and gavin walked scornfully away from it  yet if you will not tell me who you are he said looking over his shoulder tell me where you got the cloak  na faags replied the gypsy out of the cloak really mr dishart you had better not ask she added replacing it over her  she followed him meaning to gain the open by the fields to the north of the manse  goodbye she said holding out her hand if you are not to give me up  i am not a policeman replied gavin but he would not take her hand  surely we part friends then said the egyptian sweetly  no gavin answered i hope never to see your face again  i cannot help the egyptian said with dignity your not liking my face then with less dignity she added there is a splotch of mud on your own little minister it came off the divit you flung at the captain  with this parting shot she tripped past him and gavin would not let his eyes follow her it was not the mud on his face that distressed him nor even the hand that had flung the divit it was the word little though even margaret was not aware of it gavins shortness had grieved him all his life there had been times when he tried to keep the secret from himself in his boyhood he had sought a remedy by getting his larger comrades to stretch him in the company of tall men he was always self conscious in the pulpit he looked darkly at his congregation when he asked them who by taking thought could add a cubit to his stature when standing on a hearthrug his heels were frequently on the fender in his bedroom he has stood on a footstool and surveyed himself in the mirror once he fastened high heels to his boots being ashamed to ask hendry munn to do it for him but this dishonesty shamed him and he tore them off so the egyptian had put a needle into his pride and he walked to the manse gloomily  margaret was at her window looking for him and he saw her though she did not see him he was stepping into the middle of the road to wave his hand to her when some sudden weakness made him look towards the fields instead the egyptian saw him and nodded thanks for his interest in her but he scowled and pretended to be studying the sky next moment he saw her running back to him  there are soldiers at the top of the field she cried i cannot escape that way  there is no other way gavin answered  will you not help me again she entreated  she should not have said again gavin shook his head but pulled her closer to the manse dyke for his mother was still in sight  why do you do that the girl asked quickly looking round to see if she were pursued oh i see she said as her eyes fell on the figure at the window  it is my mother gavin said though he need not have explained unless he wanted the gypsy to know that he was a bachelor  only your mother  only let me tell you she may suffer more than you for your behaviour tonight  how can she  if you are caught will it not be discovered that i helped you to escape  but you said you did not  yes i helped you gavin admitted my god what would my congregation say if they knew i had let you pass yourself off as as my wife  he struck his brow and the egyptian had the propriety to blush  it is not the punishment from men i am afraid of gavin said bitterly but from my conscience no that is not true i do fear exposure but for my mothers sake look at her she is happy because she thinks me good and true she has had such trials as you cannot know of and now when at last i seemed able to do something for her you destroy her happiness you have her life in your hands  the egyptian turned her back upon him and one of her feet tapped angrily on the dry ground then child of impulse as she always was she flashed an indignant glance at him and walked quickly down the road  where are you going he cried  to give myself up you need not be alarmed i will clear you  there was not a shake in her voice and she spoke without looking back  stop gavin called but she would not until his hand touched her shoulder  what do you want she asked  why whispered gavin giddily whywhy do you not hide in the manse gardenno one will look for you there  there were genuine tears in the gypsys eyes now  you are a good man she said i like you  dont say that gavin cried in horror there is a summerseat in the garden  then he hurried from her and without looking to see if she took his advice hastened to the manse once inside he snibbed the door     chapter ix  the woman considered in absenceadventures of a military cloak   about six oclock margaret sat up suddenly in bed with the conviction that she had slept in to her this was to ravel the day a dire thing the last time it happened gavin softened by her distress had condensed morning worship into a sentence that she might make up on the clock  her part on waking was merely to ring her bell and so rouse jean for margaret had given gavin a promise to breakfast in bed and remain there till her fire was lit accustomed all her life however to early rising her feet were usually on the floor before she remembered her vow and then it was but a step to the window to survey the morning to margaret who seldom went out the weather was not of great moment while it mattered much to gavin yet she always thought of it the first thing and he not at all until he had to decide whether his companion should be an umbrella or a staff  on this morning margaret only noticed that there had been rain since gavin came in forgetting that the water obscuring the outlook was on the other side of the panes she tried to brush it away with her fist it was of the soldiers she was thinking they might have been awaiting her appearance at the window as their signal to depart for hardly had she raised the blind when they began their march out of thrums from the manse she could not see them but she heard them and she saw some people at the tenements run to their houses at sound of the drum other persons less timid followed the enemy with execrations halfway to tilliedrum margaret the only person as it happened then awake in the manse stood listening for some time in the summerseat of the garden however there was another listener protected from her sight by thin spars  despite the lateness of the hour margaret was too softhearted to rouse jean who had lain down in her clothes trembling for her father she went instead into gavins room to look admiringly at him as he slept often gavin woke to find that his mother had slipped in to save him the enormous trouble of opening a drawer for a clean collar or of pouring the water into the basin with his own hand sometimes he caught her in the act of putting thick socks in the place of thin ones and it must be admitted that her passion for keeping his belongings in boxes and the boxes in secret places and the secret places at the back of drawers occasionally led to their being lost when wanted they are safe at any rate for i put them away some gait was then magarets comfort but less soothing to gavin yet if he upbraided her in his hurry it was to repent bitterly his temper the next instant and to feel its effects more than she temper being a weapon that we hold by the blade when he awoke and saw her in his room he would pretend unless he felt called upon to rage at her for self neglect to be still asleep and then be filled with tenderness for her a great writer has spoken sadly of the shock it would be to a mother to know her boy as he really is but i think she often knows him better than he is known to cynical friends we should be slower to think that the man at his worst is the real man and certain that the better we are ourselves the less likely is he to be at his worst in our company every time he talks away his own character before us he is signifying contempt for ours  on this morning margaret only opened gavins door to stand and look for she was fearful of awakening him after his heavy night even before she saw that he still slept she noticed with surprise that for the first time since he came to thrums he had put on his shutters she concluded that he had done this lest the light should rouse him he was not sleeping pleasantly for now he put his open hand before his face as if to guard himself and again he frowned and seemed to draw back from something he pointed his finger sternly to the north ordering the weavers his mother thought to return to their homes and then he muttered to himself so that she heard the words and if thy right hand offend thee cut it off and cast it from thee for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell then suddenly he bent forward his eyes open and fixed on the window thus he sat for the space of half a minute like one listening with painful intentness when he lay back margaret slipped away she knew he was living the night over again but not of the divit his right hand had cast nor of the woman in the garden  gavin was roused presently by the sound of voices from margarets room where jean who had now gathered much news was giving it to her mistress jeans cheerfulness would have told him that her father was safe had he not wakened to thoughts of the egyptian i suppose he was at the window in an instant unsnibbing the shutters and looking out as cautiously as a burglar might have looked in the egyptian was gone from the summerseat he drew a great breath  but his troubles were not over he had just lifted his ewer of water when these words from the kitchen capsized it  ay an egyptian thats what the auld folk call a gypsy weel mrs dishart she led police and sojers sic a dance through thrums as would baffle description though i kent the fits and fors ot as i dinna ay but they gripped her in the end and the queer thing is  gavin listened to no more he suddenly sat down the queer thing of course was that she had been caught in his garden yes and doubtless queerer things about this hussy and her husband were being bawled from door to door to the girls probable sufferings he gave no heed what kind of man had he been a few hours ago to yield to the machinations of a woman who was so obviously the devil now he saw his folly in the face  the tray in jeans hands clattered against the dresser and gavin sprang from his chair he thought it was his elders at the front door  in the parlour he found margaret sorrowing for those whose mates had been torn from them and jean with a face flushed by talk on ordinary occasions the majesty of the minister still cowed jean so that she could only gaze at him without shaking when in church and then because she wore a veil in the manse he was for taking a glance at sideways and then going away comforted as a respectable woman may once or twice in a day look at her brooch in the pasteboard box as a means of helping her with her work but with such a todo in thrums and she the possessor of exclusive information jeans reverence for gavin only took her today as far as the door where she lingered half in the parlour and half in the lobby her eyes turned politely from the minister but her ears his entirely  i thought i heard jean telling you about the capture of theof an egyptian woman gavin said to his mother nervously  did you cry to me jean asked turning round longingly but maybe the mistress will tell you about the egyptian hersel  has she been taken to tilliedrum gavin asked in a hollow voice  sup up your porridge gavin margaret said ill have no speaking about this terrible night till youve eaten something  i have no appetite the minister replied pushing his plate from him jean answer me  deed then said jean willingly they hinna taen her to tilliedrum  for what reason asked gavin his dread increasing  for the reason that they couldna catch her jean answered she spirited hersel awa the magerful crittur  what but i heard you say  ay they had her aince but they couldna keep her its like a witch story they had her safe in the townhouse and baith shirra and captain guarding her and syne in a clink she wasna there a nicht they looked for her but she hadna left so muckle as a foot print ahint her and in the tail of the day they had to up wi their tap in their lap and march awa without her  gavins appetite returned  has she been seen since the soldiers went away he asked laying down his spoon with a new fear where is she now  no human eye has seen her jean answered impressively whaur is she now whaur does the flies vanish to in winter we ken theyre some gait but whaur  but what are the people saying about her  daft things said jean old charles yuill gangs the length o hinting that shes dead and buried  she could not have buried herself jean margaret said mildly  i dinna ken charles says shes even capable o that  then jean retired reluctantly but leaving the door ajar and gavin fell to on his porridge he was now so cheerful that margaret wondered  if half the stories about this gypsy be true she said she must be more than a mere woman  less you mean mother gavin said with conviction she is a woman and a sinful one  did you see her gavin  i saw her mother she flouted me  the daring tawpie exclaimed margaret  she is all that said the minister  was she dressed just like an ordinary gypsy body but you dont notice clothes much gavin  i noticed hers gavin said slowly she was in a green and red i think and barefooted  ay shouted jean from the kitchen startling both of them but she had a lang greylike cloak too she was seen jouking up closes int  gavin rose considerably annoyed and shut the parlour door  was she as bonny as folks say asked margaret jean says they speak of her beauty as unearthly  beauty of her kind gavin explained learnedly is neither earthly nor heavenly he was seeing things as they are very clearly now what he said is mere physical beauty pooh  and yet said margaret the soul surely does speak through the face to some extent  do you really think so mother gavin asked a little uneasily  i have always noticed it margaret said and then her son sighed  but i would let no face influence me a jot he said recovering  ah gavin im thinking im the reason you pay so little regard to womens faces its no natural  youve spoilt me you see mother for ever caring for another woman i would compare her to you and then where would she be  sometime margaret said youll think differently  never answered gavin with a violence that ended the conversation  soon afterwards he set off for the town and in passing down the garden walk cast a guilty glance at the summerseat something black was lying in one corner of it he stopped irresolutely for his mother was nodding to him from her window then he disappeared into the little arbour what had caught his eye was a bible on the previous day as he now remembered he had been called away while studying in the garden and had left his bible on the summerseat a pencil between its pages not often probably had the egyptian passed a night in such company  but what was this gavin had not to ask himself the question the gypsys cloak was lying neatly folded at the other end of the seat why had the woman not taken it with her hardly had he put this question when another stood in front of it what was to be done with the cloak he dared not leave it there for jean to discover he could not take it into the manse in daylight beneath the seat was a toolchest without a lid and into this he crammed the cloak then having turned the box face downwards he went about his duties but many a time during the day he shivered to the marrow reflecting suddenly that at this very moment jean might be carrying the accursed thing at arms length like a dog in disgrace to his mother  now let those who think that gavin has not yet paid toll for taking the road with the egyptian follow the adventures of the cloak shortly after gloaming fell that night jean encountered her master in the lobby of the manse he was carrying something and when he saw her he slipped it behind his back had he passed her openly she would have suspected nothing but this made her look at him  why do you stare so jean gavin asked consciencestricken and he stood with his back to the wall until she had retired in bewilderment  i have noticed her watching me sharply all day he said to himself though it was only he who had been watching her  gavin carried the cloak to his bedroom thinking to lock it away in his chest but it looked so wicked lying there that he seemed to see it after the lid was shut  the garret was the best place for it he took it out of the chest and was opening his door gently when there was jean again she had been employed very innocently in his mothers room but he said tartly  jean i really cannot have this which sent jean to the kitchen with her apron at her eyes  gavin stowed the cloak beneath the garret bed and an hour afterwards was engaged on his sermon when he distinctly heard some one in the garret he ran up the ladder with a terrible brow for jean but it was not jean it was margaret  mother he said in alarm what are you doing here  i am only tidying up the garret gavin  yes butit is too cold for you did jeandid jean ask you to come up here  jean she knows her place better  gavin took margaret down to the parlour but his confidence in the garret had gone he stole up the ladder again dragged the cloak from its lurking place and took it into the garden he very nearly met jean in the lobby again but hearing him coming she fled precipitately which he thought very suspicious  in the garden he dug a hole and there buried the cloak but even now he was not done with it he was wakened early by a noise of scraping in the garden and his first thought was jean but peering from the window he saw that the resurrectionist was a dog which already had its teeth in the cloak  that forenoon gavin left the manse unostentatiously carrying a brownpaper parcel he proceeded to the hill and having dropped the parcel there retired hurriedly on his way home nevertheless he was overtaken by d fittis who had been cutting down whins fittis had seen the parcel fall and running after gavin returned it to him gavin thanked d fittis and then sat down gloomily on the cemetery dyke half an hour afterwards he flung the parcel into a tillyloss garden  in the evening margaret had news for him got from jean  do you remember gavin that the egyptian every one is still speaking of wore a long cloak well would you believe it the cloak was captain halliwells and she took it from the townhouse when she escaped she is supposed to have worn it inside out he did not discover that it was gone until he was leaving thrums  mother is this possible gavin said  the policeman wearyworld has told it he was ordered it seems to look for the cloak quietly and to take any one into custody in whose possession it was found  has it been found  no  the minister walked out of the parlour for he could not trust his face what was to be done now the cloak was lying in mason baxters garden and baxter was therefore in all probability within fourandtwenty hours of the tilliedrum gaol  does mr dishart ever wear a cap at nichts femie wilkie asked saml fairweather three hours later  na na he has ower muckle respect for his lum hat answered saml and richtly for its the crowning stone o the edifice  then it couldna hae been him i met at the back o tillyloss the now said femie though like him it was he joukit back when he saw me  while femie was telling her story in the tenements mason baxter standing at the window which looked into his garden was shouting whas that in my yard there was no answer and baxter closed his window under the impression that he had been speaking to a cat the man in the cap then emerged from the corner where he had been crouching and stealthily felt for something among the cabbages and pea sticks it was no longer there however and by andby he retired emptyhanded  the egyptians cloak has been found margaret was able to tell gavin next day mason baxter found it yesterday afternoon  in his garden gavin asked hurriedly  no in the quarry he says but according to jean he is known not to have been at the quarry today some seem to think that the gypsy gave him the cloak for helping her to escape and that he has delivered it up lest he should get into difficulties  whom has he given it to mother gavin asked  to the policeman  and has wearyworld sent it back to halliwell  yes he told jean he sent it off at once with the information that the masons had found it in the quarry  the next day was sabbath when a new trial now to be told awaited gavin in the pulpit but it had nothing to do with the cloak of which i may here record the end wearyworld had not forwarded it to its owner meggy his wife took care of that it made its reappearance in thrums several months after the riot as two pairs of sabbath breeks for her sons james and andrew     chapter x  first sermon against women   on the afternoon of the following sabbath as i have said something strange happened in the auld licht pulpit the congregation despite their troubles turned it over and peered at it for days but had they seen into the inside of it they would have weaved few webs until the session had sat on the minister the affair baffled me at the time and for the egyptians sake i would avoid mentioning it now were it not one of gavins milestones it includes the first of his memorable sermons against woman  i was not in the auld licht church that day but i heard of the sermon before night and this i think is as good an opportunity as another for showing how the gossip about gavin reached me up here in the glen schoolhouse since margaret and her son came to the manse i had kept the vow made to myself and avoided thrums only once had i ventured to the kirk and then instead of taking my old seat the fourth from the pulpit i sat down near the plate where i could look at margaret without her seeing me to spare her that agony i even stole away as the last word of the benediction was pronounced and my haste scandalised many for with auld lichts it is not customary to retire quickly from the church after the manner of the godless u ps and the free kirk is little better who have their hats in their hand when they rise for the benediction so that they may at once pour out like a burst dam we resume our seats look straight before us clear our throats and stretch out our hands for our womenfolk to put our hats into them in time we do get out but i am never sure how  one may gossip in a glen on sabbaths though not in a town without losing his character and i used to await the return of my neighbour the farmer of waster lunny and of silva birse the glen quharity post at the end of the schoolhouse path waster lunny was a man whose care in his leisure hours was to keep from his wife his great pride in her his horse catlaw on the other hand he told outright what he thought of it praising it to its face and blackguarding it as it deserved and i have seen him when completely baffled by the brute sit down before it on a stone and thus harangue you think youre clever catlaw my lass but youre mistaen youre a thrawn limmer thats what you are you think you have blood in you you hae blood gae away and dinna blether i tell you what catlaw i met a man yestreen that kent your mither and he says she was a feikie fushionless besom what do you say to that  as for the post i will say no more of him than that his bitter topic was the unreasonableness of humanity which treated him graciously when he had a letter for it but scowled at him when he had none aye implying that i hae a letter but keep it back  on the sabbath evening after the riot i stood at the usual place awaiting my friends and saw before they reached me that they had something untoward to tell the farmer his wife and three children holding each others hands stretched across the road birse was a little behind but a conversation was being kept up by shouting all were walking the sabbath pace and the family having started half a minute in advance the post had not yet made up on them  its sitting to snaw waster lunny said drawing near and just as i was to reply it is so silva slipped in the words before me  you wasna at the kirk was elspeths salutation i had been at the glen church but did not contradict her for it is established and so neither here nor there i was anxious too to know what their long faces meant and so asked at once  was mr dishart on the riot  forenoon ay afternoon no replied waster lunny walking round his wife to get nearer me dominie a queery thing happened in the kirk this day sic as  waster lunny interrupted elspeth sharply have you on your sabbath shoon or have you no on your sabbath shoon  guid care you took i should hae the dagont oncanny things on retorted the farmer  keep out o the gutter then said elspeth on the lords day  him said her man that is forced by a foolish woman to wear genteel lasticsided boots canna forget them till he takes them aff whaurs the extra reverence in wearing shoon twa sizes ower sma  it mayna be mair reverent suggested birse to whom elspeths kitchen was a pleasant place but its grand and you canna expect to be baith grand and comfortable  i reminded them that they were speaking of mr dishart  we was saying began the post briskly that  it was me that was saying it said waster lunny so dominie  haud your gabs baith o you interrupted elspeth youve been roaring the story to ane another till youre hoarse  in the forenoon waster lunny went on determinedly mr dishart preached on the riot and fine he was oh dominie you should hae heard him ladling it on to lang tammas no by name but in sic a way that there was no mistaking wha he was preaching at sal oh losh tammas got it strong  but hes dull in the uptake broke in the post by what i expected i spoke to him after the sermon and i says just to see if he was properly humbled ay tammas i says them that discourse was preached against winna think themselves seven feet men for a while again ay birse he answers and glad i am to hear you admit it for he had you in his eye i was fair scunnered at tammas the day  mr dishart was preaching at the whole clanjamfray o you said elspeth  maybe he was said her husband leering but you needna cast it at us for my certie if the men got it frae him in the forenoon the women got it in the afternoon  he redd them up most michty said the post thae was his very words or something like them adam says he was an erring man but aside eve he was respectable  ay but it wasna a women he meant elspeth explained for when he said that he pointed his finger direct at tnowheads lassie and i hope itll do her good  but i wonder i said that mr dishart chose such a subject to day i thought he would be on the riot at both services  youll wonder mair said elspeth when you hear what happened afore he began the afternoon sermon but i canna get in a word wi that man o mine  weve been speaking about it said birse ever since we left the kirk door tod weve been sawing it like seed a alang the glen  and we meant to tell you about it at once said waster lunny but theres aye so muckle to say about a minister dagont to hae ane keeps a body out o langour ay but this breaks the drum dominie either mr dishart wasna weel or he was in the devils grip  this startled me for the farmer was looking serious  he was weel eneuch said birse for a heap o fowk speired at jean if he had taen his porridge as usual and she admitted he had but the lassie was skeered hersel and said it was a mercy mrs dishart wasna in the kirk  why was she not there i asked anxiously  oh he winna let her out in sic weather  i wish you would tell me what happened i said to elspeth  so i will she answered if waster lunny would haud his wheesht for a minute you see the afternoon diet began in the ordinary way and a was richt until we came to the sermon you will find my text he says in his piercing voice in the eighth chapter of ezra  and at thae words said waster lunny my heart gae a loup for ezra is an unca ill book to find ay and so is ruth  i kent the books o the bible by heart said elspeth scornfully when i was a sax year auld  so did i said waster lunny and i ken them yet except when im hurried when mr dishart gave out ezra he a sort o keeked round the kirk to find out if he had puzzled onybody and so there was a kind o a competition among the congregation wha would lay hand on it first that was what doited me ay there was ruth when she wasna wanted but ezra dagont it looked as if ezra had jumped clean out o the bible  you wasna the only distressed crittur said his wife i was ashamed to see eppie mclaren looking up the order o the books at the beginning o the bible  tibbie birse was even mair brazen said the post for the sly cuttie opened at kings and pretended it was ezra  none o thae things would i do said waster lunny and sal i dauredna for davit lunan was glowering over my shuther ay you may scrowl at me elspeth proctor but as far back as i can mind ezra has done me mony a time afore i start for the kirk i take my bible to a quiet place and look ezra up in the very pew i says canny to mysel ezra nehemiah esther job the which should be a help but the moment the minister gies out that awfu book away goes ezra like the egyptian  and you after her said elspeth like the weavers that wouldna fecht you make a windmill of your bible  oh i winna admit im beat never mind theres queer things in the world forby ezra how is cripples aye so puffed up mair than other folk how does flourbread aye fall on the buttered side  i will mind elspeth said for i was terrified the minister would admonish you frae the pulpit  he couldna hae done that for was he no baffled to find ezra himsel  him no find ezra cried elspeth i hae telled you a dozen times he found it as easy as you could yoke a horse  the thing can be explained in no other way said her husband doggedly if he was weel and in sound mind  maybe the dominie can clear it up suggested the post him being a scholar  then tell me what happened i asked  godsake hae we no telled you birse said i thocht we had  it was a terrible scene said elspeth giving her husband a shove as i said mr dishart gave out ezra eighth weel i turned it up in a jiffy and syne looked cautiously to see how eppie mclaren was getting on just at that minute i heard a groan frae the pulpit it didna stop short o a groan ay you may be sure i looked quick at the minister and there i saw a sicht that would hae made the grandest gape his face was as white as a bakers and he had a sort of fallen against the back o the pulpit staring dementedlike at his open bible  and i saw him said birse put up his hand atween him and the book as if he thocht it was to jump at him  twice said elspeth he tried to speak and twice he let the words fall  that says waster lunny the whole congregation admits but i didna see it mysel for a this time you may picture me hunting savagelike for ezra i thocht the minister was waiting till i found it  hendry munn said birse stood upon one leg wondering whether he should run to the sessionhouse for a glass of water  but by that time said elspeth the fit had left mr dishart or rather it had taen a new turn he grew red and its gospel that he stamped his foot  he had the face of one using bad words said the post he didna swear of course but that was the face he had on  i missed it said waster lunny for i was in full cry after ezra with the sweat running down my face  but the most astounding thing has yet to be telled went on elspeth the minister shook himsel like one wakening frae a nasty dream and he cries in a voice of thunder just as if he was shaking his fist at somebody  he cries birse interposed cleverly he cries you will find the text in genesis chapter three verse six  yes said elspeth first he gave out one text and then he gave out another being the most amazing thing to my mind that ever happened in the town of thrums what will our childrens children think ot i wouldna hae missed it for a pound note  nor me said waster lunny though i only got the tail ot dominie no sooner had he said genesis third and sixth than i laid my finger on ezra was it no provoking onybody can turn up genesis but it needs an ablebodied man to find ezra  he preached on the fall elspeth said for an hour and twenty five minutes but powerful though he was i would rather he had telled us what made him gie the goby to ezra  all i can say said waster lunny is that i never heard him mair aweinspiring whaur has he got sic a knowledge of women he riddled them he fair riddled them till i was ashamed o being married  its easy kent whaur he got his knowledge of women birse explained its a in the original hebrew you can howk ony mortal thing out o the original hebrew the which all ministers hae at their finger ends what else makes them ken to jump a verse now and then when giving out a psalm  it wasna women like me he denounced elspeth insisted but young lassies that leads men astray wi their abominable wheedling ways  tod said her husband if they try their hands on mr dishart theyll meet their match  they will chuckled the post the hebrews a grand thing though teuch im telled michty teuch  his sublimest burst waster lunny came back to tell me was about the beauty o the soul being everything and the beauty o the face no worth a snuff what a scorn he has for bonny faces and toom souls i dinna deny but what a bonny face fell takes me but mr dishart wouldna gie a blade o grass fort ay and i used to think that in their foolishness about women there was dagont little differ atween the unlearned and the highly edicated  the gossip about gavin brought hitherto to the schoolhouse had been as bread to me but this i did not like for a minister to behave thus was as unsettling to us as a change of government to londoners and i decided to give my scholars a holiday on the morrow and tramp into the town for fuller news but all through the night it snowed and next day and then intermittingly for many days and every fall took the school miles farther away from thrums birse and the crows had now the glen road to themselves and even birse had twice or thrice to bed with me at these times had he not been so interested in describing his progress through the snow maintaining that the crying want of our glen road was palings for postmen to kick their feet against he must have wondered why i always turned the talk to the auld licht minister  ony explanation o his sudden change o texts birse said repeating my question tod and there is and to spare for i hear tell theres saxteen explanations in the tenements alone as tammas haggart says thats a blessing for if there had just been twa explanations the kirk micht hae split on them  ay he said at another time twa or three even dared to question the minister but im thinking they made nothing ot the majority agrees that he was just inspired to change his text but lang tammas is dour tammas telled the session a queer thing he says that after the diet o worship on that eventful afternoon mr dishart carried the bible out o the pulpit instead o leaving that duty as usual to the kirkofficer weel tammas being precentor has a richt as you ken to leave the kirk by the sessionhouse door just like the minister himsel he did so that afternoon and what think you did he see he saw mr dishart tearing a page out o the bible and flinging it savagely into the sessionhouse fire you dinna credit it weel its staggering but theres hendry munns evidence too hendry took his first chance o looking up ezra in the ministers bible and behold the page wi the eighth chapter was gone them that thinks tammas wasna blind wi excitement hauds it had been ezra eighth that gaed into the fire onyway theres no doubt about the pages being missing for whatever excitement tammas was in hendry was as cool as ever  a week later birse told me that the congregation had decided to regard the incident as adding lustre to their kirk this was largely i fear because it could then be used to belittle the established minister that fervent auld licht snecky hobart feeling that gavins action was unsound had gone on the following sabbath to the parish kirk and sat under mr duthie but mr duthie was a close reader so that snecky flung himself about in his pew in misery the minister concluded his sermon with these words but on this subject i will say no more at present  because you canna snecky roared and strutted out of the church comparing the two scenes it is obvious that the auld lichts had won a victory after preaching impromptu for an hour and twentyfive minutes it could never be said of gavin that he needed to read he became more popular than ever yet the change of texts was not forgotten if in the future any other indictments were brought against him it would certainly be pinned to them  i marvelled long over gavins jump from ezra to genesis and at this his first philippic against woman but i have known the cause for many a year the bible was the one that had lain on the summerseat while the egyptian hid there it was the great pulpit bible which remains in the church as a rule but gavin had taken it home the previous day to make some of its loose pages secure with paste he had studied from it on the day preceding the riot but had used a small bible during the rest of the week when he turned in the pulpit to ezra where he had left the large bible open in the summerseat he found this scrawled across chapter eight  i will never tell who flung the clod at captain halliwell but why did you fling it i will never tell that you allowed me to be called mrs dishart before witnesses but is not this a scotch marriage signed babbie the egyptian     chapter xi  tells in a whisper of mans fall during the curling season   no snow could be seen in thrums by the beginning of the year though clods of it lay in waster lunnys fields where his hens wandered all day as if looking for something they had dropped a black frost had set in and one walking on the glen road could imagine that through the cracks in it he saw a loch glistening from my door i could hear the roar of curling stones at rashie bog which is almost four miles nearer thrums on the day i am recalling i see that i only made one entry in my diary at last bought waster lunnys bantams well do i remember the transaction and no wonder for i had all but bought the bantams every day for a six months  about noon the doctors dogcart was observed by all the tenements standing at the auld licht manse the various surmises were wrong margaret had not been suddenly taken ill jean had not swallowed a darningneedle the minister had not walked out at his study window in a moment of sublime thought gavin stepped into the dog cart which at once drove off in the direction of rashiebog but equally in error were those who said that the doctor was making a curler of him  there was however ground for gossip for thrums folk seldom called in a doctor until it was too late to cure them and mcqueen was not the man to pay social visits of his skill we knew fearsome stories as that by looking at archie allardyce who had come to broken bones on a ladder he discovered which rung archie fell from when he entered a stuffy room he would poke his staff through the window to let in fresh air and then fling down a shilling to pay for the breakage he was deaf in the right ear and therefore usually took the left side of prosy people thus as he explained making a blessing of an affliction a pity i dont hear better i have heard him say not at all if my misfortune as you call it were to be removed you cant conceive how i should miss my deaf ear he was a fine fellow though brusque and i never saw him without his pipe until two days before we buried him which was fiveandtwenty years ago come martinmas  were all quite weel jean said apprehensively as she answered his knock on the manse door and she tried to be pleasant too for well she knew that if a doctor willed it she could have fever in five minutes  ay jean ill soon alter that he replied ferociously is the master in  hes at his sermon jean said with importance  to interrupt the minister at such a moment seemed sacrilege to her for her upbringing had been good her mother had once fainted in the church but though the familys distress was great they neither bore her out nor signed to the kirkofficer to bring water they propped her up in the pew in a respectful attitude joining in the singing meanwhile and she recovered in time to look up 2nd chronicles 21st and 7th  tell him i want to speak to him at the door said the doctor fiercely or ill bleed you this minute  mcqueen would not enter because his horse might have seized the opportunity to return stablewards at the houses where it was accustomed to stop it drew up of its own accord knowing where the doctors cases were as well as himself but it resented new patients  you like misery i think mr dishart mcqueen said when gavin came to him at least i am always finding you in the thick of it and that is why i am here now i have a rare job for you if you will jump into the machine you know nanny webster who lives on the edge of windyghoul no you dont for she belongs to the other kirk well at all events you knew her brother sanders the molecatcher  i remember him you mean the man who boasted so much about seeing a ball at lord rintouls place  the same and as you may know his boasting about maltreating policemen whom he never saw led to his being sentenced to nine months in gaol lately  that is the man said gavin i never liked him  no but his sister did mcqueen answered drily and with reason for he was her breadwinner and now she is starving  anything i can give her  would be too little sir  but the neighbours  she has few near her and though the thrums poor help each other bravely they are at present nigh as needy as herself nanny is coming to the poorhouse mr dishart  god help her exclaimed gavin  nonsense said the doctor trying to make himself a hard man she will be properly looked after there andand in time she will like it  dont let my mother hear you speaking of taking an old woman to that place gavin said looking anxiously up the stair i cannot pretend that margaret never listened  you all speak as if the poorhouse was a gaol the doctor said testily but so far as nanny is concerned everything is arranged i promised to drive her to the poorhouse today and she is waiting for me now dont look at me as if i was a brute she is to take some of her things with her to the poorhouse and the rest is to be left until sanderss return when she may rejoin him at least we said that to her to comfort her  you want me to go with you  yes though i warn you it may be a distressing scene indeed the truth is that i am loth to face nanny alone today mr duthie should have accompanied me for the websters are established kirk ay and so he would if rashiebog had not been bearing a terrible snare this curling mr disharthere the doctor sighedi have known mr duthie wait until midnight struck on sabbath and then be off to rashiebog with a torch  i will go with you gavin said putting on his coat  jump in then you wont smoke i never see a respectable man not smoking sir but i feel indignant with him for such sheer waste of time  gavin smiled at this and snecky hobart who happened to be keeking over the manse dyke bore the news to the tenements  ill no sleep the nicht snecky said for wondering what made the minister lauch ay it would be no trifle  a minister it is certain who wore a smile on his face would never have been called to the auld licht kirk for life is a wrestle with the devil and only the frivolous think to throw him without taking off their coats yet though gavins zeal was what the congregation reverenced many loved him privately for his boyishness he could unbend at marriages of which he had six on the last day of the year and at every one of them he joked the same joke like a layman some did not approve of his playing at the teetotum for ten minutes with kitty dundass invalid son but the way kitty boasted about it would have disgusted anybody at the present day there are probably a score of gavins in thrums all called after the little minister and there is one gavinia whom he hesitated to christen he made humorous remarks the same remark about all these children and his smile as he patted their heads was for thinking over when ones work was done for the day  the doctors horse clattered up the backwynd noisily as if a minister behind made no difference to it instead of climbing the roods however the nearest way to nannys it went westward which gavin in a reverie did not notice the truth must be told the egyptian was again in his head  have i fallen deaf in the left ear too said the doctor i see your lips moving but i dont catch a syllable  gavin started coloured and flung the gypsy out of the trap  why are we not going up the roods he asked  well said the doctor slowly at the top of the roods there is a stance for circuses and this old beast of mine wont pass it you know unless you are behind in the clashes and clavers of thrums that i bought her from the manager of a travelling show she was the horse lightning they called her that galloped round the ring at a mile an hour and so at the top of the roods she is still unmanageable she once dragged me to the scene of her former triumphs and went revolving round it dragging the machine after her  if you had not explained that said gavin i might have thought that you wanted to pass by rashiebog  the doctor indeed was already standing up to catch a first glimpse of the curlers  well he admitted i might have managed to pass the circus ring though what i have told you is true however i have not come this way merely to see how the match is going i want to shame mr duthie for neglecting his duty it will help me to do mine for the lord knows i am finding it hard with the music of these stones in my ears  i never saw it played before gavin said standing up in his turn what a din they make mcqueen i believe they are fighting  no no said the excited doctor they are just a bit daft thats the proper spirit for the game look thats the baron bailie near standing on his head and theres mr duthie off his head a thegither yons twa weavers and a mason cursing the laird and the man wi the besom is the master of crumnathie  a democracy at all events said gavin  by no means said the doctor its an aristocracy of intellect gee up lightning or the frost will be gone before we are there  it is my opinion doctor said gavin that you will have bones to set before that game is finished i can see nothing but legs now  dont say a word against curling sir to me said mcqueen whom the sight of a game in which he must not play had turned crusty dangerous its the best medicine i know of look at that man coming across the field it is jo strachan well sir curling saved jos life after i had given him up you dont believe me hie jo jo strachan come here and tell the minister how curling put you on your legs again  strachan came forward a tough little wizened man with red flannel round his ears to keep out the cold  its gospel what the doctor says mr dishart he declared me and my brither sandy was baith ill and in the same bed and the doctor had hopes o sandy but nane o me ay weel when i heard that i thocht i micht as weel die on the ice as in my bed so i up and on wi my claethes sandy was mad at me for he was no curler and he says jo strachan if you gang to rashiebog youll assuredly be brocht hame a corp i didna heed him though and off i gaed  and i see you did not die said gavin  not me answered the fish cadger with a grin na but the joke ot is it was sandy that died  not the joke jo corrected the doctor the moral  ay the moral im aye forgetting the word  mcqueen enjoying gavins discomfiture turned lightning down the rashiebog road which would be impassable as soon as the thaw came in summer rashiebog is several fields in which a cart does not sink unless it stands still but in winter it is a loch with here and there a spring where dead men are said to lie there are no rushes at its east end and here the dogcart drew up near the curlers a crowd of men dancing screaming shaking their fists and sweeping while half a hundred onlookers got in their way gesticulating and advising  hold me tight the doctor whispered to gavin or ill be leaving you to drive nanny to the poorhouse by yourself  he had no sooner said this than he tried to jump out of the trap  you donnert fule john robbie he shouted to a player soop her up man soop her up no no dinna dinna leave her alane bailie leave her alane you blazing idiot mr dishart let me go what do you mean sir by hanging on to my coat tails dang it all duthies winning he has it he has it  youre to play doctor some cried running to the dogcart we hae missed you sair  jeames ii no i daurna  then we get our licks i never saw the minister in sic form we can do nothing against him  then cried mcqueen ill play come what will ill play let go my tails mr dishart or ill cut them off duty fiddlesticks  shame on you sir said gavin yes and on you others who would entice him from his duty  shame the doctor cried look at mr duthie is he ashamed and yet that man has been reproving me for a twelvemonths because ive refused to become one of his elders duthie he shouted think shame of yourself for curling this day  mr duthie had carefully turned his back to the trap for gavins presence in it annoyed him we seldom care to be reminded of our duty by seeing another do it now however he advanced to the dogcart taking the far side of gavin  put on your coat mr duthie said the doctor and come with me to nanny websters you promised  mr duthie looked quizzically at gavin and then at the sky  the thaw may come at any moment he said  i think the frost is to hold said gavin  it may hold over tomorrow mr duthie admitted but to morrows the sabbath and so a lost day  a what exclaimed gavin horrified  i only mean mr duthie answered colouring that we cant curl on the lords day as for what it may be like on monday no one can say no doctor i wont risk it were in the middle of a game man  gavin looked very grave  i see what you are thinking mr dishart the old minister said doggedly but then you dont curl you are very wise i have forbidden my sons to curl  then you openly snap your fingers at your duty mr duthie said the doctor loftily you can let go my tails now mr dishart for the madness has passed  none of your virtuous airs mcqueen said mr duthie hotly what was the name of the doctor that warned women never to have bairns while it was hauding  and what retorted mcqueen was the name of the minister that told his session he would neither preach nor pray while the black frost lasted  hoots doctor said duthie dont lose your temper because im in such form  dont lose yours duthie because i aye beat you  you beat me mcqueen go home sir and dont talk havers who beat you at  who made you sing small at  who won  who  who  ill play you on monday for whatever you like shrieked the doctor  if it holds cried the minister ill be here the whole day name the stakes yourself a stone  no the doctor said but ill tell you what well play for youve been dinging me doited about that eldership and well play fort if you win i accept office  done said the minister recklessly  the dogcart was now turned toward windyghoul its driver once more goodhumoured but gavin silent  you would have been the better of my deaf ear just now mr dishart mcqueen said after the loch had been left behind aye and im thinking my pipe would soothe you but dont take it so much to heart man ill lick him easily hes a decent man the minister but vain of his play ridiculously vain however i think the sight of you in the place that should have been his has broken his nerve for this day and our side may win yet  i believe gavin said with sudden enlightenment that you brought me here for that purpose  maybe chuckled the doctor  maybe then he changed the subject suddenly mr dishart he asked were you ever in love  never answered gavin violently  well well said the doctor dont terrify the horse i have been in love myself its bad but its nothing to curling     chapter xii  tragedy of a mud house   the dogcart bumped between the trees of caddam flinging gavin and the doctor at each other as a wheel rose on some beechroot or sank for a moment in a pool i suppose the wood was a pretty sight that day the pines only white where they had met the snow as if the numbed painter had left his work unfinished the brittle twigs snapping overhead the water as black as tar but it matters little what the wood was like within a squirrels leap of it an old woman was standing at the door of a mud house listening for the approach of the trap that was to take her to the poorhouse can you think of the beauty of the day now  nanny was not crying she had redd up her house for the last time and put on her black merino her mouth was wide open while she listened if yon had addressed her you would have thought her polite and stupid look at her a flabbyfaced woman she is now with a swollen body and no one has heeded her much these thirty years i can tell you something it is almost droll nanny webster was once a gay flirt and in airlie square there is a weaver with an unsteady head who thought all the earth of her his loom has taken a foot from his stature and gone are nannys raven locks on which he used to place his adoring hand down in airlie square he is weaving for his life and here is nanny ripe for the poorhouse and between them is the hill where they were lovers that is all the story save that when nanny heard the dogcart she screamed  no neighbour was with her if you think this hard it is because you do not understand perhaps nanny had never been very lovable except to one man and him it is said she lost through her own vanity but there was much in her to like the neighbours of whom there were two not a hundred yards away would have been with her now but they feared to hurt her feelings no heart opens to sympathy without letting in delicacy and these poor people knew that nanny would not like them to see her being taken away for a week they had been aware of what was coming and they had been most kind to her but that hideous word the poorhouse they had not uttered poorhouse is not to be spoken in thrums though it is nothing to tell a man that you see death in his face did nanny think they knew where she was going was a question they whispered to each other and her suffering eyes cut scars on their hearts so now that the hour had come they called their children into their houses and pulled down their blinds  if you would like to see her by yourself the doctor said eagerly to gavin as the horse drew up at nannys gate ill wait with the horse not he added hastily that i feel sorry for her we are doing her a kindness  they dismounted together however and nanny who had run from the trap into the house watched them from her window  mcqueen saw her and said glumly i should have come alone for if you pray she is sure to break down mr dishart could you not pray cheerfully  you dont look very cheerful yourself gavin said sadly  nonsense answered the doctor i have no patience with this false sentiment stand still lightning and be thankful you are not your master today  the door stood open and nanny was crouching against the opposite wall of the room such a poor dull kitchen that you would have thought the furniture had still to be brought into it the blanket and the piece of old carpet that was nannys coverlet were already packed in her box the plate rack was empty only the round table and the two chairs and the stools and some pans were being left behind  well nanny the doctor said trying to bluster i have come and you see mr dishart is with me  nanny rose bravely she knew the doctor was good to her and she wanted to thank him i have not seen a great deal of the world myself but often the sweet politeness of the aged poor has struck me as beautiful nanny dropped a curtesy an ungainly one maybe but it was an old woman giving the best she had  thank you kindly sirs she said and then two pairs of eyes dropped before hers  please to take a chair she added timidly it is strange to know that at that awful moment for let none tell me it was less than awful the old woman was the one who could speak  both men sat down for they would have hurt nanny by remaining standing some ministers would have known the right thing to say to her but gavin dared not let himself speak i have again to remind you that he was only oneandtwenty  im drouthy nanny the doctor said to give her something to do and i would be obliged for a drink of water  nanny hastened to the pan that stood behind her door but stopped before she reached it  its toom she said ii didna think i needed to fill it this morning she caught the doctors eye and could only half restrain a sob i couldna help that she said apologetically im richt angry at myself for being so ungrateful like  the doctor thought it best that they should depart at once he rose  oh no doctor cried nanny in alarm  but you are ready  ay she said i have been ready this twa hours but you micht wait a minute hendry munn and andrew allardyce is coming yont the road and they would see me  wait doctor gavin said  thank you kindly sir answered nanny  but nanny the doctor said you must remember what i told you about the poo about the place you are going to it is a fine house and you will be very happy in it  ay ill be happy int nanny faltered but doctor if i could just hae bidden on here though i wasna happy  think of the food you will get broth nearly every day  ititll be terrible enjoyable nanny said  and there will be pleasant company for you always continued the doctor and a nice room to sit in why after you have been there a week you wont be the same woman  thats it cried nanny with sudden passion na na ill be a woman on the poors rates oh mither mither you little thocht when you bore me that i would come to this  nanny the doctor said rising again i am ashamed of you  i humbly speir your forgiveness sir she said and you micht bide just a wee yet ive been ready to gang these twa hours but now that the machine is at the gate i dinna ken how it is but im terrible sweer to come awa oh mr dishart its richt true what the doctor says about thethe place but i canna just take it in imim gey auld  you will often get out to see your friends was all gavin could say  na na na she cried dinna say that ill gang but you mauna bid me ever come out except in a hearse dinna let onybody in thrums look on my face again  we must go said the doctor firmly put on your mutch nanny  i dinna need to put on a mutch she answered with a faint flush of pride i have a bonnet  she took the bonnet from her bed and put it on slowly  are you sure theres naebody looking she asked  the doctor glanced at the minister and gavin rose  let us pray he said and the three went down on their knees  it was not the custom of auld licht ministers to leave any house without offering up a prayer in it and to us it always seemed that when gavin prayed he was at the knees of god the little minister pouring himself out in prayer in a humble room with awed people around him who knew much more of the world than he his voice at times thick and again a squeal and his hands clasped not gracefully may have been only a comic figure but we were old fashioned and he seemed to make us better men if i only knew the way i would draw him as he was and not fear to make him too mean a man for you to read about he had not been long in thrums before he knew that we talked much of his prayers and that doubtless puffed him up a little sometimes i daresay he rose from his knees feeling that he had prayed well today which is a dreadful charge to bring against anyone but it was not always so nor was it so now  i am not speaking harshly of this man whom i have loved beyond all others when i say that nanny came between him and his prayer had he been of gods own image unstained he would have forgotten all else in his makers presence but nanny was speaking too and her words choked his at first she only whispered but soon what was eating her heart burst out painfully and she did not know that the minister had stopped  they were such moans as these that brought him back to earth  ill hae to gang im a base woman no to be mair thankfu to them that is so good to me i dinna like to prig wi them to take a roundabout road and im sair fleid a the roods will see me if it could just be said to poor sanders when he comes back that i died hurriedly syne he would be able to haud up his head  oh mither  i wish terrible they had come and taen me at nicht its a dogcart and i was praying it micht be a cart so that they could cover me wi straw  this is more than i can stand the doctor cried  nanny rose frightened  ive tried you sair she said but oh im grateful and im ready now  they all advanced toward the door without another word and nanny even tried to smile but in the middle of the floor something came over her and she stood there gavin took her hand and it was cold she looked from one to the other her mouth opening and shutting  i canna help it she said  its cruel hard muttered the doctor i knew this woman when she was a lassie  the little minister stretched out his hands  have pity on her o god he prayed with the presumptuousness of youth  nanny heard the words  oh god she cried you micht  god needs no minister to tell him what to do but it was his will that the poorhouse should not have this woman he made use of a strange instrument no other than the egyptian who now opened the mudhouse door     chapter xiii  second coming of the egyptian woman   the gypsy had been passing the house perhaps on her way to thrums for gossip and it was only curiosity born suddenly of gavins cry that made her enter on finding herself in unexpected company she retained hold of the door and to the amazed minister she seemed for a moment to have stepped into the mud house from his garden her eyes danced however as they recognised him and then he hardened this is no place for you he was saying fiercely when nanny too distraught to think fell crying at the egyptians feet  they are taking me to the poorhouse she sobbed dinna let them dinna let them  the egyptians arms clasped her and the egyptian kissed a sallow cheek that had once been as fair as yours madam who may read this story no one had caressed nanny for many years but do you think she was too poor and old to care for these young arms around her neck there are those who say that women cannot love each other but it is not true woman is not undeveloped man but something better and gavin and the doctor knew it as they saw nanny clinging to her protector when the gypsy turned with flashing eyes to the two men she might have been a mother guarding her child  how dare you she cried stamping her foot and they quaked like malefactors  you dont see gavin began but her indignation stopped him  you coward she said  even the doctor had been impressed so that he now addressed the gypsy respectfully  this is all very well he said but a womans sympathy  a womanah if i could be a man for only five minutes  she clenched her little fists and again turned to nanny  you poor dear she said tenderly i wont let them take you away  she looked triumphantly at both minister and doctor as one who had foiled them in their cruel designs  go she said pointing grandly to the door  is this the egyptian of the riots the doctor said in a low voice to gavin or is she a queen hoots man dont look so shamefaced we are not criminals say something  then to the egyptian gavin said firmly  you mean well but you are doing this poor woman a cruelty in holding out hopes to her that cannot be realised sympathy is not meal and bedclothes and these are what she needs  and you who live in luxury retorted the girl would send her to the poorhouse for them i thought better of you  tuts said the doctor losing patience mr dishart gives more than any other man in thrums to the poor and he is not to be preached to by a gypsy we are waiting for you nanny  ay im coming said nanny leaving the egyptian ill hae to gang lassie dinna greet for me  but the egyptian said no you are not going it is these men who are going go sirs and leave us  and you will provide for nanny asked the doctor contemptuously  yes  and where is the siller to come from  that is my affair and nannys begone both of you she shall never want again see how the very mention of your going brings back life to her face  i wont begone the doctor said roughly till i see the colour of your siller  oh the money said the egyptian scornfully she put her hand into her pocket confidently as if used to wellfilled purses but could only draw out two silver pieces  i had forgotten she said aloud though speaking to herself  i thought so said the cynical doctor come nanny  you presume to doubt me the egyptian said blocking his way to the door  how could i presume to believe you he answered you are a beggar by profession and yet talk as ifpooh nonsense  i would live on terrible little nanny whispered and sanders will be out again in august month  seven shillings a week rapped out the doctor  is that all the egyptian asked she shall have it  when  at once no it is not possible tonight but tomorrow i will bring five pounds no i will send it no you must come for it  and where o daughter of dives do you reside the doctor asked  no doubt the egyptian could have found a ready answer had her pity for nanny been less sincere as it was she hesitated wanting to propitiate the doctor while holding her secret fast  i only asked mcqueen said eyeing her curiously because when i make an appointment i like to know where it is to be held but i suppose you are suddenly to rise out of the ground as you have done today and did six weeks ago  whether i rise out of the ground or not the gypsy said keeping her temper with an effort there will be a fivepound note in my hand you will meet me tomorrow about this hour atsay the kaims of cushie  no said the doctor after a moments pause i wont even if i went to the kaims i should not find you there why can you not come to me  why do you carry a womans hair replied the egyptian in that locket on your chain  whether she was speaking of what she knew or this was only a chance shot i cannot tell but the doctor stepped back from her hastily and could not help looking down at the locket  yes said the egyptian calmly it is still shut but why do you sometimes open it at nights  lassie the old doctor cried are you a witch  perhaps she said but i ask for no answer to my questions if you have your secrets why may i not have mine now will you meet me at the kaims  no i distrust you more than ever even if you came it would be to play with me as you have done already how can a vagrant have five pounds in her pocket when she does not have five shillings on her back  you are a cruel hard man the egyptian said beginning to lose hope but see she cried brightening look at this ring do you know its value  she held up her finger but the stone would not live in the dull light  i see it is gold the doctor said cautiously and she smiled at the ignorance that made him look only at the frame  certainly it is gold said gavin equally stupid  mercy on us nanny cried i believe its what they call a diamond  how did you come by it the doctor asked suspiciously  i thought we had agreed not to ask each other questions the egyptian answered drily but see i will give it to you to hold in hostage if i am not at the kaims to get it back you can keep it  the doctor took the ring in his hand and examined it curiously  there is a quirk in this he said at last that i dont like take back your ring lassie mr dishart give nanny your arm and ill carry her box to the machine  now all this time gavin had been in the dire distress of a man possessed of two minds of which one said this is a true woman and the other remember the seventeenth of october they were at war within him and he knew that he must take a side yet no sooner had he cast one out than he invited it back he did not answer the doctor  unless mcqueen said nettled by his hesitation you trust this womans word  gavin tried honestly to weigh those two minds against each other but could not prevent impulse jumping into one of the scales  you do trust me the egyptian said with wet eyes and now that he looked on her again  yes he said firmly i trust you and the words that had been so difficult to say were the right words he had no more doubt of it  just think a moment first the doctor warned him i decline to have anything to do with this matter you will go to the kaims for the siller  if it is necessary said gavin  it is necessary the egyptian said  then i will go  nanny took his hand timidly and would have kissed it had he been less than a minister  you dare not man the doctor said gruffly make an appointment with this gypsy think of what will be said in thrums  i honour gavin for the way in which he took this warning for him who was watched from the rising of his congregation to their lying down whose every movement was expected to be a text to thrums it was no small thing that he had promised this he knew but he only reddened because the doctor had implied an offensive thing in a womans presence  you forget yourself doctor he said sharply  send some one in your place advised the doctor who liked the little minister  he must come himself and alone said the egyptian you must both give me your promise not to mention who is nannys friend and she must promise too  well said the doctor buttoning up his coat i cannot keep my horse freezing any longer remember mr dishart you take the sole responsibility of this  i do said gavin and with the utmost confidence  give him the ring then lassie said mcqueen  she handed the minister the ring but he would not take it  i have your word he said that is sufficient  then the egyptian gave him the first look that he could think of afterwards without misgivings  so be it said the doctor get the money and i will say nothing about it unless i have reason to think that it has been dishonestly come by dont look so frightened at me nanny i hope for your sake that her stockingfoot is full of gold  surely its worth risking nanny said not very brightly when the ministers on her side  ay but on whose side nanny asked the doctor lassie i bear you no grudge will you not tell me who you are  only a puir gypsy your honour said the girl becoming mischievous now that she had gained her point only a wandering hallenshaker and will i tell you your fortune my pretty gentleman  no you shant replied the doctor plunging his hands so hastily into his pockets that gavin laughed  i dont need to look at your hand said the gypsy i can read your fortune in your face  she looked at him fixedly so that he fidgeted  i see you said the egyptian in a sepulchral voice and speaking slowly become very frail your eyesight has almost gone you are sitting alone in a cauld room cooking your ain dinner ower a feeble fire the soot is falling down the lum your bearish manners towards women have driven the servant lassie frae your house and your wife beats you  ay you spoil your prophecy there the doctor said considerably relieved for im not married my pipes the only wife i ever had  you will be married by that time continued the egyptian frowning at this interruption for i see your wife she is a shrew she marries you in your dotage she lauchs at you in company she doesna allow you to smoke  away with you you jade cried the doctor in a fury and feeling nervously for his pipe mr dishart you had better stay and arrange this matter as you choose but i want a word with you outside  and youre no angry wi me doctor are you asked nanny wistfully youve been richt good to me but i canna thole the thocht o that place and oh doctor you winna tell naebody that i was so near taen to it  in the garden mcqueen said to gavin  you may be right mr dishart in this matter for there is this in our favour that the woman can gain nothing by tricking us she did seem to feel for nanny but who can she be you saw she could put on and off the scotch tongue as easily as if it were a cap  she is as much a mystery to me as to you gavin answered but she will give me the money and that is all i ask of her  ay that remains to be seen but take care of yourself a mans second childhood begins when a woman gets hold of him  dont alarm yourself about me doctor i daresay she is only one of those gypsies from the south they are said to be wealthy many of them and even when they like to have a grand manner the thrums people had no doubt but that she was what she seemed to be  ay but what does she seem to be even that puzzles me and then there is this mystery about her which she admits herself though perhaps only to play with us  perhaps said gavin she is only taking precautions against her discovery by the police you must remember her part in the riots  yes but we never learned how she was able to play that part besides there is no fear in her or she would not have ventured back to thrums however good luck attend you but be wary you saw how she kept her feet among her shalls and wills never trust a scotch man or woman who does not come to grief among them  the doctor took his seat in the dogcart  and mr dishart he called out that was all nonsense about the locket     chapter xiv  the minister dances to the womans piping   gavin let the doctors warnings fall in the grass in his joy over nannys deliverance he jumped the garden gate whose hinges were of yarn and cleverly caught his hat as it was leaving his head in protest he then reentered the mud house staidly pleasant was the change nannys home was as a clock that had been run out and is set going again already the old woman was unpacking her box to increase the distance between herself and the poorhouse but gavin only saw her in the background for the egyptian singing at her work had become the heart of the house she had flung her shawl over nannys shoulders and was at the fireplace breaking peats with the leg of a stool she turned merrily to the minister to ask him to chop up his staff for firewood and he would have answered wittily but could not then as often the beauty of the egyptian surprised him into silence i could never get used to her face myself in the afterdays it has always held me wondering like my own glen quharity on a summer day when the sun is lingering and the clouds are on the march and the glen is never the same for two minutes but always so beautiful as to make me sad never will i attempt to picture the egyptian as she seemed to gavin while she bent over nannys fire never will i describe my glen yet a hundred times have i hankered after trying to picture both  an older minister believing that nannys anguish was ended might have gone on his knees and finished the interrupted prayer but now gavin was only doing this girls bidding  nanny and i are to have a dish of tea as soon as we have set things to rights she told him do you think we should invite the minister nanny  we couldna dare nanny answered quickly  youll excuse her mr dishart for the presumption  presumption said the egyptian making a face  lassie nanny said fearful to offend her new friend yet horrified at this affront to the minister i ken you mean weel but mr dishartll think youre putting yoursel on an equality wi him she added in a whisper dinna be so free hes the auld licht minister  the gypsy bowed with mock awe but gavin let it pass he had indeed forgotten that he was anybody in particular and was anxious to stay to tea  but there is no water he remembered and is there any tea  i am going out for them and for some other things the egyptian explained but no she continued reflectively if i go for the tea you must go for the water  lassie cried nanny mind wha youre speaking to to send a minister to the well  i will go said gavin recklessly lifting the pitcher the well is in the wood i think  gie me the pitcher mr dishart said nanny in distress what a town there would be if you was seen wit  then he must remain here and keep the house till we come back said the egyptian and thereupon departed with a friendly wave of her hand to the minister  shes an awfu lassie nanny said apologetically but itll just be the way she has been brought up  she has been very good to you nanny  she has leastwise she promises to be mr dishart shes awa what if she doesna come back  nanny spoke nervously and gavin drew a long face  i think she will he said faintly i am confident of it he added in the same voice  and has she the siller  i believe in her said gavin so doggedly that his own words reassured him she has an excellent heart  ay said nanny to whom the ministers faith was more than the egyptians promise and thats hardly natural in a gaenaboot body yet a gypsy she maun be for naebody would pretend to be ane that wasna tod she proved she was an egyptian by dauring to send you to the well  this conclusive argument brought her prospective dower so close to nannys eyes that it hid the poorhouse  i suppose shell gie you the money she said and syne youll gie me the seven shillings a week  that seems the best plan gavin answered  and what will you gie it me in nanny asked with something on her mind i would be terrible obliged if you gae it to me in saxpences  do the smaller coins go farther gavin asked curiously  na its no that but ive heard tell o folk giving away half crowns by mistake for twashilling bits ay and theres something dizzying in haen fowerandtwenty pennies in one piece it has sic terrible little bulk sanders had aince a gold sovereign and he looked at it so often that it seemed to grow smaller and smaller in his hand till he was feared it micht just be a half after all  her mind relieved on this matter the old woman set off for the well a minute afterwards gavin went to the door to look for the gypsy and behold nanny was no further than the gate have you who read ever been sick near to death and then so far recovered that you could once again stand at your window if so you have not forgotten how the beauty of the world struck you afresh so that you looked long and said many times how fair a world it is like one who had made a discovery it was such a look that nanny gave to the hill and caddam while she stood at her garden gate  gavin returned to the fire and watched a girl in it in an officers cloak playing at hide and seek with soldiers after a time he sighed then looked round sharply to see who had sighed then absentmindedly lifted the empty kettle and placed it on the glowing peats he was standing glaring at the kettle his arms folded when nanny returned from the well  ive been thinking she said o something that proves the lassie to be just an egyptian ay i noticed she wasna nane awed when i said you was the auld licht minister weel ise uphaud that came frae her living ower muckle in the open air is there no a smell o burning in the house  i have noticed it gavin answered sniffing since you came in i was busy until then putting on the kettle the smell is becoming worse  nanny had seen the empty kettle on the fire as he began to speak and so solved the mystery her first thought was to snatch the kettle out of the blaze but remembering who had put it there she dared not she sidled toward the hearth instead and saying craftily ay here it is its a clout among the peats softly laid the kettle on the earthen floor it was still red with sparks however when the gypsy reappeared  who burned the kettle she asked ignoring nannys signs  lassie nanny said it was me but gavin flushing confessed his guilt  oh you stupid exclaimed the egyptian shaking her two ounces of tea which then cost six shillings the pound in his face  at this nanny wrung her hands crying thats waur than swearing  if men said the gypsy severely would keep their hands in their pockets all day the worlds affairs would be more easily managed  wheesht cried nanny if mr dishart cared to set his mind to it he could make the kettle boil quicker than you or me but his thochts is on higher things  no higher than this retorted the gypsy holding her hand level with her brow confess mr dishart that this is the exact height of what you were thinking about see nanny he is blushing as if i meant that he had been thinking about me he cannot answer nanny we have found him out  and kindly of him it is no to answer said nanny who had been examining the gypsys various purchases for what could he answer except that he would need to be sure o living a thousand years afore he could spare five minutes on you or me of course it would be different if we sat under him  and yet said the egyptian with great solemnity he is to drink tea at that very table i hope you are sensible of the honour nanny  am i no said nanny whose education had not included sarcasm im trying to keep frae thinking ot till hes gone in case i should let the teapot fall  you have nothing to thank me for nanny said gavin but much for which to thank thisthis  this haggartytaggarty egyptian suggested the girl then looking at gavin curiously she said but my name is babbie  thats short for barbara said nanny but babbie what  yes babbie watt replied the gypsy as if one name were as good as another  weel men lift the lid off the kettle babbie said nanny for its boiling ower  gavin looked at nanny with admiration and envy for she had said babbie as coolly as if it was the name of a pepperbox  babbie tucked up her sleeves to wash nannys cups and saucers which even in the most prosperous days of the mud house had only been in use once a week and gavin was so eager to help that he bumped his head on the platerack  sit there said babbie authoritatively pointing with a cup in her hand to a stool and dont rise till i give you permission   to nannys amazement he did as he was bid  i got the things in the little shop you told me of the egyptian continued addressing the mistress of the house but the horrid man would not give them to me until he had seen my money  enoch would be suspicious o you nanny explained you being an egyptian  ah said babbie with a sideglance at the minister i am only an egyptian is that why you dislike me mr dishart gavin hesitated foolishly over his answer and the egyptian with a towel round her waist made a pretty gesture of despair  he neither likes you nor dislikes you nanny explained you forget hes a minister  that is what i cannot endure said babbie putting the towel to her eyes to be neither liked nor disliked please hate me mr dishart if you cannot loove me  her face was behind the towel and gavin could not decide whether it was the face or the towel that shook with agitation he gave nanny a look that asked is she really crying and nanny telegraphed back i question it  come come said the minister gallantly i did not say that i disliked you  even this desperate compliment had not the desired effect for the gypsy continued to sob behind her screen  i can honestly say went on gavin as solemnly as if he were making a statement in a court of justice that i like you  then the egyptian let drop her towel and replied with equal solemnity  oh tank oo nanny the minister says me is a dood ittle dirl  he didna gang that length said nanny sharply to cover gavins confusion set the things babbie and ill make the tea  the egyptian obeyed demurely pretending to wipe her eyes every time gavin looked at her he frowned at this and then she affected to be too overcome to go on with her work  tell me nanny she asked presently what sort of man this enoch is from whom i bought the things  he is not very regular i fear answered gavin who felt that he had sat silent and selfconscious on his stool too long  do you mean that he drinks asked babbie  no i mean regular in his attendance  the egyptians face showed no enlightenment  his attendance at church gavin explained  hes far frae it said nanny and as a body kens joe cruickshanks the atheist has the wite o that the scoundrel telled enoch that the great ministers in edinbury and london believed in no hell except sic as your ain conscience made for you and ever since syne enoch has been careless about the future state  ah said babbie waving the church aside what i want to know is whether he is a single man  he is not gavin replied but why do you want to know that  because single men are such gossips i am sorry he is not single as i want him to repeat to everybody what i told him  trust him to tell susy said nanny and susy to tell the town  his wife is a gossip  ay shes aye tonguing especially about her teeth theyre folk wi siller and she has a set o false teeth its fair scumfishing to hear her blawing about thae teeth shes so fleid we dinna ken that theyre false  nanny had spoken jealously but suddenly she trembled with apprehension  babbie she cried you didna speak about the poorhouse to enoch  the egyptian shook her head though of the poorhouse she had been forced to speak for enoch having seen the doctor going home alone insisted on knowing why  but i knew the gypsy said that the thrums people would be very unhappy until they discovered where you get the money i am to give you and as that is a secret i hinted to enoch that your benefactor is mr dishart  you should not have said that interposed gavin i cannot foster such a deception  they will foster it without your help the egyptian said besides if you choose you can say you get the money from a friend  ay you can say that nanny entreated with such eagerness that babbie remarked a little bitterly  there is no fear of nannys telling any one that the friend is a gypsy girl  na na agreed nanny again losing babbies sarcasm i winna let on its so queer to be befriended by an egyptian  it is scarcely respectable babbie said  its no answered simple nanny  i suppose nannys unintentional cruelty did hurt babbie as much as gavin thought she winced and her face had two expressions the one cynical the other pained her mouth curled as if to tell the minister that gratitude was nothing to her but her eyes had to struggle to keep back a tear gavin was touched and she saw it and for a moment they were two people who understood each other  i at least gavin said in a low voice will know who is the benefactress and think none the worse of her because she is a gypsy  at this babbie smiled gratefully to him and then both laughed for they had heard nanny remarking to the kettle but i wouldna hae been nane angry if she had telled enoch that the minister was to take his tea here susyll no believet though i tell her as tell her i will  to nanny the table now presented a rich appearance for besides the teapot there were butter and loafbread and cheesies a biscuit of which only thrums knows the secret  draw in your chair mr dishart she said in suppressed excitement  yes said babbie you take this chair mr dishart and nanny will have that one and i can sit humbly on the stool  but nanny held up her hands in horror  keep us a she exclaimed the lassie thinks her and me is to sit down wi the minister were no to gang that length babbie were just to stand and serve him and syne well sit down when he has risen  delightful said babbie clapping her hands nanny you kneel on that side of him and i will kneel on this you will hold the butter and i the biscuits  but gavin as this girl was always forgetting was a lord of creation  sit down both of you at once he thundered i command you  then the two women fell into their seats nanny in terror babbie affecting it     chapter xv  the minister bewitchedsecond sermon against women   to nanny it was a dizzying experience to sit at the head of her own table and with assumed calmness invite the minister not to spare the loafbread babbies prattle and even gavins answers were but an indistinct noise to her to be as little regarded in the excitement of watching whether mr dishart noticed that there was a knife for the butter as the music of the river by a man who is catching trout every time gavins cup went to his lips nanny calculated correctly how much he had drunk and yet when the right moment arrived she asked in the english voice that is fashionable at ceremonies if his cup was toom  perhaps it was well that nanny had these matters to engross her for though gavin spoke freely he was saying nothing of lasting value and some of his remarks to the egyptian if preserved for the calmer contemplation of the morrow might have seemed frivolous to himself usually his observations were scrambled for like hapence at a wedding but today they were only for one person infected by the egyptians high spirits gavin had laid aside the minister with his hat and what was left was only a young man he who had stamped his feet at thought of a soldiers cloak now wanted to be reminded of it the little minister who used to address himself in terms of scorn every time he wasted an hour was at present dallying with a teaspoon he even laughed boisterously flinging back his head and little knew that behind nannys smiling face was a terrible dread because his chair had once given way before  even though our thoughts are not with our company the mention of our name is a bell to which we usually answer hearing hers nanny started  you can tell me nanny the egyptian had said with an arch look at the minister oh nanny for shame how can you expect to follow our conversation when you only listen to mr dishart  she is saying nanny gavin broke in almost gaily for a minister that she saw me recently wearing a cloak you know i have no such thing  na nanny answered artlessly you have just the thin brown coat wi the braid round it forby the ane you have on the now  you see gavin said to babbie i could not have a new neckcloth not to speak of a cloak without everybody in thrums knowing about it i dare say nanny knows all about the braid and even what it cost  three bawbees the yard at kyowowys shop replied nanny promptly and your mother sewed it on saml fairweather has the marrows ot on his top coat no that it has the same look on him  nevertheless babbie persisted i am sure the minister has a cloak but perhaps he is ashamed of it no doubt it is hidden away in the garret  na we would hae kent ot if it was there said nanny  but it may be in a chest and the chest may be locked the egyptian suggested  ay but the kist in the garret isna locked nanny answered  how do you get to know all these things nanny asked gavin sighing  your congregation tells me naebody would lay by news about a minister  but how do they know  i dinna ken they just find out because theyre so fond o you  i hope they will never become so fond of me as that said babbie still nanny the ministers cloak is hidden somewhere  losh what would make him hod it demanded the old woman folk that has cloaks doesna bury them in boxes  at the word bury gavins hand fell on the table and he returned to nanny apprehensively  that would depend on how the cloak was got said the cruel egyptian if it was not his own  lassie cried nanny behave yoursel  or if he found it in his possession against his will suggested gavin slyly he might have got it from some one who picked it up cheap  from his wife for instance said babbie whereupon gavin suddenly became interested in the floor  ay ay the minister was hitting at you there babbie nanny explained for the way you made off wi the captains cloak the thrums folk wondered less at your taking it than at your no keeping it its said to be michty grand  it was rather like the one the ministers wife gave him said babbie  the minister has neither a wife nor a cloak retorted nanny  he isnt married asked babbie the picture of incredulity  nanny gathered from the ministers face that he deputed to her the task of enlightening this ignorant girl so she replied with emphasis na they hinna got him yet and im cheated if it doesna tak them all their time  thus do the best of women sell their sex for nothing  i did wonder said the egyptian gravely at any mere womans daring to marry such a minister  ay replied nanny spiritedly but theres dauring limmers wherever theres a single man  so i have often suspected said babbie duly shocked but nanny i was told the minister had a wife by one who said he saw her  he lied then answered nanny turning to gavin for further instructions  but see the minister does not deny the horrid charge himself  no and for the reason he didna deny the cloak because its no worth his while ill tell you wha your friend had seen it would be somebody that would like to be mrs dishart theres a hantle o that kind ay lassie but wishing winna land a woman in a manse  it was one of the soldiers babbie said who told me about her he said mr dishart introduced her to him  sojers cried nanny i could never thole the name o them sanders in his young days hankered after joining them and so he would if it hadna been for the fechting ay and now theyve taen him awa to the gaol and sworn lies about him dinna put any faith in sojers lassie  i was told babbie went on that the ministers wife was rather like me  heaven forbid ejaculated nanny so fervently that all three suddenly sat back from the table  im no meaning nanny continued hurriedly fearing to offend her benefactress but what youre the bonniest tid i ever saw out o an almanack but you would ken mr disharts contempt for bonny faces if you had heard his sermon against them i didna hear it mysel for im no auld licht but it did the work o the town for an aucht days  if nanny had not taken her eyes off gavin for the moment she would have known that he was now anxious to change the topic babbie saw it and became suspicious  when did he preach against the wiles of women nanny  it was long ago said gavin hastily  no so very lang syne corrected nanny it was the sabbath after the sojers was in thrums the day you changed your text so hurriedly some thocht you wasna weel but lang tammas  thomas whamond is too officious gavin said with dignity i forbid you nanny to repeat his story  but what made you change your text asked babbie  you see he winna tell nanny said wistfully ay i dinna deny but what i would like richt to ken but the sessions as puzzled as yoursel babbie  perhaps more puzzled answered the egyptian with a smile that challenged gavins frowns to combat and overthrow them what surprises me mr dishart is that such a great man can stoop to see whether women are pretty or not it was very good of you to remember me today i suppose you recognized me by my frock  by your face he replied boldly by your eyes  nanny exclaimed the egyptian did you hear what the minister said  woe is me answered nanny i missed it  he says he would know me anywhere by my eyes  so would i mysel said nanny  then what colour are they mr dishart demanded babbie dont speak nanny for i want to expose him  she closed her eyes tightly gavin was in a quandary i suppose he had looked at her eyes too long to know much about them  blue he guessed at last  na theyre black said nanny who had doubtless known this for an hour i am always marvelling over the cleverness of women as every one must see who reads this story  no but what they micht be blue in some lichts nanny added out of respect to the minister  oh dont defend him nanny said babbie looking reproachfully at gavin i dont see that any minister has a right to denounce women when he is so ignorant of his subject i will say it nanny and you need not kick me beneath the table  was not all this intoxicating to the little minister who had never till now met a girl on equal terms at twentyone a man is a musical instrument given to the other sex but it is not as instruments learned at school for when she sits down to it she cannot tell what tune she is about to play that is because she has no notion of what the instrument is capable babbies kind heartedness her gaiety her coquetry her moments of sadness had been a witchs fingers and gavin was still trembling under their touch even in being taken to task by her there was a charm for every pout of her mouth every shake of her head said you like me and therefore you have given me the right to tease you men sign these agreements without reading them but indeed man is a stupid animal at the best and thinks all his life that he did not propose until he blurted out i love you  it was later than it should have been when the minister left the mud house and even then he only put on his hat because babbie said that she must go  but not your way she added i go into the wood and vanish you know nanny i live up a tree  dinna say that said nanny anxiously or ill be fleid about the siller  dont fear about it mr dishart will get some of it tomorrow at the kaims i would bring it here but i cannot come so far to morrow  then ill hae peace to the end o my days said the old woman and babbie i wish the same to you wi all my heart  ah babbie replied mournfully i have read my fortune nanny and there is not much happiness in it  i hope that is not true gavin said simply  they were standing at the door and she was looking toward the hill perhaps without seeing it all at once it came to gavin that this fragile girl might have a history far sadder and more turbulent than his  do you really care she asked without looking at him  yes he said stoutly i care  because you do not know me she said  because i do know you he answered  now she did look at him  i believe she said making a discovery that you misunderstand me less than those who have known me longer  this was a perilous confidence for it at once made gavin say babbie  ah she answered frankly i am glad to hear that i thought you did not really like me because you never called me by my name  gavin drew a great breath  that was not the reason he said  the reason was now unmistakable  i was wrong said the egyptian a little alarmed you do not understand me at all  she returned to nanny and gavin set off holding his head high his brain in a whirl five minutes afterwards when nanny was at the fire the diamond ring on her little finger he came back looking like one who had just seen sudden death  i had forgotten he said with a fierceness aimed at himself that tomorrow is the sabbath  need that make any difference asked the gypsy  at this hour on monday said gavin hoarsely i will be at the kaims  he went away without another word and babbie watched him from the window nanny had not looked up from the ring  what a pity he is a minister the girl said reflectively nanny you are not listening  the old woman was making the ring flash by the light of the fire  nanny do you hear me did you see mr dishart come back  i heard the door open nanny answered without taking her greedy eyes off the ring was it him whaur did you get this lassie  give it me back nanny i am going now  but nanny did not give it back she put her other hand over it to guard it and there she crouched warming herself not at the fire but at the ring  give it me nanny  it winna come off my finger she gloated over it nursed it kissed it  i must have it nanny  the egyptian put her hand lightly on the old womans shoulder and nanny jumped up pressing the ring to her bosom her face had become cunning and ugly she retreated into a corner  nanny give me back my ring or i will take it from you  the cruel light of the diamond was in nannys eyes for a moment and then shuddering she said tak your ring awa tak it out o my sicht  in the meantime gavin was trudging home gloomily composing his second sermon against women i have already given the entry in my own diary for that day this is hisnotes on jonah exchanged vol xliii european magazine for owens justification per flying stationer began second samuel visited nanny webster there is no mention of the egyptian     chapter xvi  continued misbehaviour of the egyptian woman   by the following monday it was known at many looms that something sat heavily on the auld licht ministers mind on the previous day he had preached his second sermon of warning to susceptible young men and his first mention of the word woman had blown even the sleepy heads upright now he had salt fish for breakfast and on clearing the table jean noticed that his knife and fork were uncrossed he was observed walking into a gooseberry bush by susy linn who possessed the pioneer springbed of thrums and always knew when her man jumped into it by suddenly finding herself shot to the ceiling lunan the tinsmith and two women who had the luck to be in the street at the time saw him stopping at dr mcqueens door as if about to knock and then turning smartly away his hat blew off in the school wynd where a wind wanders ever looking for hats and he chased it so passionately that lang tammas went into allardyces smiddy to say  i dinna like it of course he couldna afford to lose his hat but he should hae run after it mair reverently  gavin indeed was troubled he had avoided speaking of the egyptian to his mother he had gone to mcqueens house to ask the doctor to accompany him to the kaims but with the knocker in his hand he changed his mind and now he was at the place of meeting alone it was a day of thaw nothing to be heard from a distance but the swish of curlingstones through water on rashiebog where the match for the eldership was going on around him gavin saw only dejected firs with drops of water falling listlessly from them clods of snow and grass that rustled as if animals were crawling through it all the roads were slack  i suppose no young man to whom society has not become a cheap thing can be in gavins position awaiting the coming of an attractive girl without giving thought to what he should say to her when in the pulpit or visiting the sick words came in a rush to the little minister but he had to set his teeth to determine what to say to the egyptian  this was because he had not yet decided which of two women she was hardly had he started on one line of thought when she crossed his vision in a new light and drew him after her  her need that make any difference sang in his ear like another divit cast this time at religion itself and now he spoke aloud pointing his finger at a fir i said at the mud house that i believed you because i knew you to my shame be it said that i spoke falsely how dared you bewitch me in your presence i flung away the precious hours in frivolity i even forgot the sabbath for this i have myself to blame i am an unworthy preacher of the word i sinned far more than you who have been brought up godlessly from your cradle nevertheless whoever you are i call upon you before we part never to meet again to repent of your  and then it was no mocker of the sabbath he was addressing but a woman with a childs face and there were tears in her eyes do you care she was saying and again he answered yes i care this girls name was not woman but babbie  now gavin made an heroic attempt to look upon both these women at once yes i believe in you he said to them but henceforth you must send your money to nanny by another messenger you are a gypsy and i am a minister and that must part us i refuse to see you again i am not angry with you but as a minister  it was not the disappearance of one of the women that clipped this argument short it was babbie singing     it fell on a day on a bonny summer day       when the corn grew green and yellow    that there fell out a great dispute       between argyle and airly     the duke of montrose has written to argyle       to come in the morning early    an lead in his men by the back o dunkeld       to plunder the bonny house o airly  where are you cried gavin in bewilderment  i am watching you from my window so high answered the egyptian and then the minister looking up saw her peering at him from a fir  how did you get up there he asked in amazement  on my broomstick babbie replied and sang on     the lady looked oer her window sae high       and oh but she looked weary    and there she espied the great argyle       come to plunder the bonny house o airly  what are you doing there gavin said wrathfully  this is my home she answered i told you i lived in a tree  come down at once ordered gavin to which the singer responded      come down come down lady margaret he says       come down and kiss me fairly    or before the morning clear day light       ill no leave a standing stane in airly  if you do not come down this instant gavin said in a rage and give me what i was so foolish as to come for i  the egyptian broke in    i wouldna kiss thee great argyle     i wouldna kiss thee fairly    i wouldna kiss thee great argyle     gin you shouldna leave a standing stane in airly  you have deceived nanny gavin cried hotly and you have brought me here to deride me i will have no more to do with you  he walked away quickly but she called after him i am coming down i have the money and next moment a snowball hit his hat  that is for being cross she explained appearing so unexpectedly at his elbow that he was taken aback i had to come close up to you before i flung it or it would have fallen over my shoulder why are you so nasty today and oh do you know you were speaking to yourself  you are mistaken said gavin severely i was speaking to you  you didnt see me till i began to sing did you  nevertheless i was speaking to you or rather i was saying to myself what  what you had decided to say to me said the delighted gypsy do you prepare your talk like sermons i hope you have prepared something nice for me if it is very nice i may give you this bunch of holly  she was dressed as he had seen her previously but for a cluster of holly berries at her breast  i dont know that you will think it nice the minister answered slowly but my duty if it is about duty entreated babbie dont say it dont and i will give you the berries  she took the berries from her dress smiling triumphantly the while like one who had discovered a cure for duty and instead of pointing the finger of wrath at her gavin stood expectant  but no he said remembering who he was and pushing the gift from him i will not be bribed i must tell you  now said the egyptian sadly i see you are angry with me is it because i said i lived in a tree do forgive me for that dreadful lie  she had gone on her knees before he could stop her and was gazing imploringly at him with her hands clasped  you are mocking me again said gavin but i am not angry with you only you must understand  she jumped up and put her fingers to her ears  you see i can hear nothing she said  listen while i tell you  i dont hear a word why do you scold me when i have kept my promise if i dared to take my fingers from my ears i would give you the money for nanny and mr dishart i must be gone in five minutes  in five minutes echoed gavin with such a dismal face that babbie heard the words with her eyes and dropped her hands  why are you in such haste he asked taking the five pounds mechanically and forgetting all that he had meant to say  because they require me at home she answered with a sly glance at her fir and remember when i run away you must not follow me  i wont said gavin so promptly that she was piqued  why not she asked but of course you only came here for the money well you have got it goodbye  you know that was not what i meant said gavin stepping after her i have told you already that whatever other people say i trust you i believe in you babbie  was that what you were saying to the tree asked the egyptian demurely then perhaps thinking it wisest not to press this point she continued irrelevantly it seems such a pity that you are a minister  a pity to be a minister exclaimed gavin indignantly why why youwhy babbie how have you been brought up  in a curious way babbie answered shortly but i cant tell you about that just now would you like to hear all about me suddenly she seemed to have become confidential  do you really think me a gypsy she asked  i have tried not to ask myself that question  why  because it seems like doubting your word  i dont see how you can think of me at all without wondering who i am  no and so i try not to think of you at all  oh i dont know that you need do that  i have not quite succeeded  the egyptians pique had vanished but she may have thought that the conversation was becoming dangerous for she said abruptly  well i sometimes think about you  do you said gavin absurdly gratified what do you think about me  i wonder answered the egyptian pleasantly which of us is the taller  gavins fingers twitched with mortification and not only his fingers but his toes  let us measure she said sweetly putting her back to his you are not stretching your neck are you  but the minister broke away from her  there is one subject he said with great dignity that i allow no one to speak of in my presence and that is mymy height  his face was as white as his cravat when the surprised egyptian next looked at him and he was panting like one who has run a mile she was ashamed of herself and said so  it is a topic i would rather not speak about gavin answered dejectedly especially to you  he meant that he would rather be a tall man in her company than in any other and possibly she knew this though all she answered was  you wanted to know if i am really a gypsy well i am  an ordinary gypsy  do you think me ordinary  i wish i knew what to think of you  ah well that is my forbidden topic but we have a good many ideas in common after all have we not though you are only a minisi mean though i am only a gypsy  there fell between them a silence that gave babbie time to remember she must go  i have already stayed too long she said give my love to nanny and say that i am coming to see her soon perhaps on monday i dont suppose you will be there on monday mr dishart  ii cannot say  no you will be too busy are you to take the holly berries  i had better not said gavin dolefully  oh if you dont want them  give them to me he said and as he took them his hand shook  i know why you are looking so troubled said the egyptian archly you think i am to ask you the colour of my eyes and you have forgotten again  he would have answered but she checked him  make no pretence she said severely i know you think they are blue  she came close to him until her face almost touched his  look hard at them she said solemnly and after this you may remember that they are black black black  at each repetition of the word she shook her head in his face she was adorable gavins armsbut they met on nothing she had run away  when the little minister had gone a man came from behind a tree and shook his fist in the direction taken by the gypsy it was rob dow black with passion  its the egyptian he cried you limmer wha are you that hae got haud o the minister  he pursued her but she vanished as from gavin is windyghoul  a common egyptian he muttered when he had to give up the search but take care you little devil he called aloud take care if i catch you playing pranks wi that man again ill wring your neck like a hens     chapter xvii  intrusion of haggart into these pages against the authors wish   margaret having heard the doctor say that one may catch cold in the back had decided instantly to line gavins waistcoat with flannel she was thus engaged with pins in her mouth and the scissors hiding from her every time she wanted them when jean red and flurried abruptly entered the room  there i forgot to knock at the door again jean exclaimed pausing contritely  never mind is it rob dow wanting the minister asked margaret who had seen rob pass the manse dyke  na he wasna wanting to see the minister  ah then he came to see you jean said margaret archly  a widow man cried jean tossing her head but rob dow was in no condition to be friendly wi onybody the now  jean you dont mean that he has been drinking again  i canna say he was drunk  then what condition was he in  he was in aa swearing condition jean answered guardedly but what i want to speir at you is can i gang down to the tenements for a minute ill run there and back  certainly you can go jean but you must not run you are always running did dow bring you word that you were wanted in the tenements  no exactly but ii want to consult tammas haggart aboutabout something  about dow i believe jean  na but about something he has done oh maam you surely dinna think i would take a widow man  it was the day after gavins meeting with the egyptian at the kaims and here is jeans real reason for wishing to consult haggart half an hour before she hurried to the parlour she had been at the kitchen door wondering whether she should spread out her washing in the garret or risk hanging it in the courtyard she had just decided on the garret when she saw rob dow morosely regarding her from the gateway  whaur is he growled rob  hes out but its no for me to say whaur he is replied jean whose weakness was to be considered a church official no that i ken truthfulness compelled her to add for she had an ambition to be everything she thought gavin would like a woman to be  rob seized her wrists viciously and glowered into her face  youre ane o them he said  let me go ane o what  ane o thae limmers called women  sal retorted jean with spirit youre ane o thae brutes called men youre drunk rob dow  in the legs maybe but no higher i haud a heap  drunk again after all your promises to the minister and you said yoursel that he had pulled you out o hell by the root  its himsel that has flung me back again rob said wildly jean baxter what does it mean when a minister carries flowers in his pouch ay and takes them out to look at them ilka minute  how do you ken about the holly asked jean off her guard  you limmer said dow youve been in his pouches  its a lie cried the outraged jean i just saw the holly this morning in a jug on his chimley  carefully put by is it hod on the chimley does he stand looking at it do you tell me hes fondlike ot  mercy me jean exclaimed beginning to shake wha is she rob dow  let me see it first in its jug rob answered slyly and syne i may tell you this was not the only time jean had been asked to show the ministers belongings snecky hobart among others had tried on gavins hat in the manse kitchen and felt queer for some time afterwards women had been introduced on tiptoe to examine the handle of his umbrella but rob had not come to admire he snatched the holly from jeans hands and casting it on the ground pounded it with his heavy boots crying greet as you like jean thats the end o his flowers and if i had the tawpie he got them frae i would serve her in the same way  ill tell him what youve done said terrified jean who had tried to save the berries at the expense of her fingers  tell him dow roared and tell him what i said too ay and tell him i was at the kaims yestreen tell him im hunting high and low for an egyptian woman  he flung recklessly out of the courtyard leaving jean looking blankly at the mud that had been holly lately not his act of sacrilege was distressing her but his news were these berries a love token had god let rob dow say they were a gypsys love token and not slain him  that rob spoke of the egyptian of the riots jean never doubted it was known that the minister had met this woman in nanny websters house but was it not also known that he had given her such a talkingto as she could never come above many could repeat the words in which he had announced to nanny that his wealthy friends in glasgow were to give her all she needed they could also tell how majestic he looked when he turned the egyptian out of the house in short nanny having kept her promise of secrecy the people had been forced to construct the scene in the mud house for themselves and it was only their story that was known to jean  she decided that so far as the gypsy was concerned rob had talked trash he had seen the holly in the ministers hand and being in drink had mixed it up with the gossip about the egyptian but that gavin had preserved the holly because of the donor was as obvious to jean as that the vase in her hand was empty who could she be no doubt all the single ladies in thrums were in love with him but that jean was sure had not helped them a step forward  to think was to jean a waste of time discovering that she had been thinking she was dismayed there were the wet clothes in the basket looking reproachfully at her she hastened back to gavins room with the vase but it too had eyes and they said when the minister misses his holly he will question you now gavin had already smiled several times to jean and once he had marked passages for her in her pilgrims progress with the result that she prized the marks more even than the passages to lose his good opinion was terrible to her in her perplexity she decided to consult wise tammas haggart and hence her appeal to margaret  to avoid chirsty the humourists wife jean sought haggart at his workshop window which was so small that an old book sufficed for its shutter haggart whom she could see distinctly at his loom soon guessed from her knocks and signs for he was strangely quick in the uptake that she wanted him to open the window  i want to speak to you confidentially jean said in a low voice if you saw a grand man gey fond o a flower what would you think  i would think jean haggart answered reflectively that he had gien siller fort ay i would wonder  what would you wonder  i would wonder how muckle he paid  but if he was aa minister and keepit the flowersay it was a common rosefondlike on his chimley what would you think  i would think it was a blackburning disgrace for a minister to be fond o flowers  i dinna haud wi that  jean said haggart i allow no one to contradict me  it wasna my design but tammas if aa minister was fond o a particular flowersay a roseand you destroyed it by an accident when he wasna looking what would you do  i would gie him another rose fort  but if you didna want him to ken you had meddled wit on his chimley what would you do  i would put the new rose on the chimley and he would never ken the differ  thats what ill do muttered jean but she said aloud  but it micht be that particular rose he liked  havers jean to a thinking man one rose is identical wi another rose but how are you speiring  just out o curiosity and i maun be stepping now thank you kindly tammas for your humour  youre welcome haggart answered and closed his window  that day rob dow spent in misery but so little were his fears selfish that he scarcely gave a thought to his conduct at the manse for an hour he sat at his loom with his arms folded then he slouched out of the house cursing little micah so that a neighbour cried you drunken scoundrel after him he may be a wee drunk said micah in his fathers defense but hes no mortal rob wandered to the kaims in search of the egyptian and returned home no happier he flung himself upon his bed and dared micah to light the lamp about gloaming he rose unable to keep his mouth shut on his thoughts any longer and staggered to the tenements to consult haggart he found the humourists door ajar and wearyworld listening at it out o the road cried rob savagely and flung the policeman into the gutter  that was illdune rob dow wearyworld said picking himself up leisurely  im thinking it was weeldune snarled rob  ay said weary world we needna quarrel about a difference o opeenion but rob  dow however had already entered the house and slammed the door  ay ay muttered wearyworld departing you micht hae stood still rob and argued it out wi me  in less than an hour after his conversation with jean at the window it had suddenly struck haggart that the minister she spoke of must be mr dishart in two hours he had confided his suspicions to chirsty in ten minutes she had filled the house with gossips rob arrived to find them in full cry  ay rob said chirsty genially for gossip levels ranks youre just in time to hear a query about the minister  rob said the glen quharity post from whom i subsequently got the story mr dishart has fallen ininwhat do you call the thing chirsty  birse knew well what the thing was called but the word is a staggerer to say in company  in love answered chirsty boldly  now we ken what he was doing in the country yestreen said snecky hobart the which has been bothering us sair  the manse is fu o the flowers she sends him said tibbie craik jeans at her witsend to ken whaur to put them a  wha is she  it was rob dow who spoke all saw he had been drinking or they might have wondered at his vehemence as it was everybody looked at every other body and then everybody sighed  ay wha is she repeated several  i see you ken nothing about her said rob much relieved and he then lapsed into silence  we ken a about her said snecky except just wha she is ay thats what we canna bottom maybe you could guess tammas  maybe i could sneck haggart replied cautiously but on that point i offer no opinion  if she bides on the kaims road said tibbie craik she maun be a farmers dochter what say you to bell finlay  na shes u p but it micht be loups o malcolms sister shes promised to muckle haws but no doubt she would gie him the goby at a word frae the minister  its mair likely said chirsty to be the factor at the spittals lassie the factor has a grand garden and that would account for such basketfuls o flowers  whaever she is said birse im thinking he could hae done better  ill be fine pleased wi ony o them said tibbie who had a magenta silk and so was jealous of no one  it hasna been proved haggart pointed out that the flowers came frae thae parts she may be sending them frae glasgow  i aye understood it was a glasgow lady said snecky hell be like the tilliedrum minister that got a lady to send him to the college on the promise that he would marry her as soon as he got a kirk she made him sign a paper  the farseeing limmer exclaimed chirsty but if thats what mr dishart has done how has he kept it so secret  he wouldna want the women o the congregation to ken he was promised till after they had voted for him  i dinna haud wi that explanation ot said haggart but i may tell you that i ken for sure shes a glasgow leddy lads ministers is near aye bespoke afore theyre licensed theres a michty competition for them in the big toons ay the leddies just stand at the college gates as you may say and snap them up as they come out  and just as well for the ministers ise uphaud said tibbie for it saves them a heap o persecution when they come to the like o thrums there was mr meiklejohn the u p minister he was no sooner placed than every genteel woman in the town was persecuting him the miss dobies was the maist shameless they fair hunted him  ay said snecky and in the tail o the day ane o them snacked him up billies did you ever hear o a minister being refused  never  weel then i have and by a widow woman too his name was samson and if it had been tamson she would hae taen him ay you may look but its true her name was turnbull and she had another gent after her name o tibbets she couldna make up her mind atween them and for a while she just keeped them dangling on ay but in the end she took tibbets and what think you was her reason as you ken thae grand folk has their initials on their spoons and nichtgowns ay weel she thocht it would be mair handy to take tibbets because if she had taen the minister the ts would have had to be changed to ss it was thoctfu o her  is tibbets living asked haggart sharply  no hes dead  what asked haggart was the corp to trade  i dinna ken  i thocht no said haggart triumphantly weel i warrant he was a minister too ay catch a woman giving up a minister except for another minister  all were looking on haggart with admiration when a voice from the door cried  listen and ill tell you a queerer ane than that  dagont cried birse its wearywarld and he has been hearkening leave him to me  when the post returned the conversation was back at mr dishart  yes lathies haggart was saying daftness about women comes to all gentle and simple common and colleged humourists and no humourists you say mr dishart has preached ower muckle at women to stoop to marriage but that makes no differ mony a humorous thing hae i said about women and yet chirsty has me its the same wi ministers a at aince they see a lassie no unlike ither lassies away goes their learning and they skirl out you dawtie thats what comes to all  but it hasna come to mr dishart cried rob dow jumping to his feet he had sought haggart to tell him all but now he saw the wisdom of telling nothing im sick o your blathers instead o the ministers being sweethearting yesterday he was just at the kaims visiting the gamekeeper i met him in the wast townend and gaed there and back wi him  thats proof its a glasgow leddy said snecky  i tell you theres no leddy ava swore rob  yea and wha sends the baskets o flowers then  there was only one flower said rob turning to his host  i aye understood said haggart heavily that there was only one flower  but though there was just ane persisted chirsty what we want to ken is wha gae him it  it was me that gae him it said rob it was growing on the roadside and i plucked it and gae it to him  the company dwindled away shamefacedly yet unconvinced but haggart had courage to say slowly  yes rob i had aye a notion that he got it frae you  meanwhile gavin unaware that talk about him and a woman unknown had broken out in thrums was gazing sometimes lovingly and again with scorn at a little bunch of hollyberries which jean had gathered from her fathers garden once she saw him fling them out of his window and then she rejoiced but an hour afterwards she saw him pick them up and then she mourned nevertheless to her great delight he preached his third sermon against woman on the following sabbath it was universally acknowledged to be the best of the series it was also the last     chapter xviii  caddamlove leading to a rupture   gavin told himself not to go near the mud house on the following monday but he went the distance is half a mile and the time he took was two hours this was owing to his setting out due west to reach a point due north yet with the intention of deceiving none save himself his reason had warned him to avoid the egyptian and his desires had consented to be dragged westward because they knew he had started too soon when the proper time came they knocked reason on the head and carried him straight to caddam here reason came to and again began to state its case desires permitted him to halt as if to argue the matter out but were thus tolerant merely because from where he stood he could see nannys doorway when babbie emerged from it reason seems to have made one final effort for gavin quickly took that side of a tree which is loved of squirrels at the approach of an enemy he looked round the treetrunk at her and then reason discarded him the gypsy had two empty pans in her hands for a second she gazed in the ministers direction then demurely leaped the ditch of leaves that separated nannys yard from caddam and strolled into the wood discovering with indignation that he had been skulking behind the tree gavin came into the open how good of the egyptian he reflected to go to the well for water and thus save the old womans arms reason shouted from near the manse he only heard the echo that he could still make up on it come along said his desires and marched him prisoner to the well  the path which babbie took that day is lost in blaeberry leaves now and my little maid and i lately searched for an hour before we found the well it was dry choked with broom and stones and broken rusty pans but we sat down where babbie and gavin had talked and i stirred up many memories probably two of those pans that could be broken in the hands today like shortbread were nannys and almost certainly the stones are fragments from the great slab that used to cover the well children like to peer into wells to see what the world is like at the other side and so this covering was necessary rob angus was the strong man who bore the stone to caddam flinging it a yard before him at a time the well had also a wooden lid with leather hinges and over this the stone was dragged  gavin arrived at the well in time to offer babbie the loan of his arms in her struggle she had taken her lips into her mouth but in vain did she tug at the stone which refused to do more than turn round on the wood but for her presence the ministers efforts would have been equally futile though not strong however he had the national horror of being beaten before a spectator and once at school he had won a fight by telling his big antagonist to come on until the boy was tired of pummelling him as he fought with the stone now pains shot through his head and his arms threatened to come away at the shoulders but remove it he did  how strong you are babbie said with open admiration  i am sure no words of mine could tell how pleased the minister was yet he knew he was not strong and might have known that she had seen him do many things far more worthy of admiration without admiring them this indeed is a sad truth that we seldom give our love to what is worthiest in its object  how curious that we should have met here babbie said in her dangerously friendly way as they filled the pans do you know i quite started when your shadow fell suddenly on the stone did you happen to be passing through the wood  no answered truthful gavin i was looking for you i thought you saw me from nannys door  did you i only saw a man hiding behind a tree and of course i knew it could not be you  gavin looked at her sharply but she was not laughing at him  it was i he admitted but i was not exactly hiding behind the tree  you had only stepped behind it for a moment suggested the egyptian  her gravity gave way to laughter under gavins suspicious looks but the laughing ended abruptly she had heard a noise in the wood gavin heard it too and they both turned round in time to see two ragged boys running from them when boys are very happy they think they must be doing wrong and in a wood of which they are among the natural inhabitants they always take flight from the enemy adults if given time for my own part when i see a boy drop from a tree i am as little surprised as if he were an apple or a nut but gavin was startled picturing these spies handing in the new sensation about him at every door as a district visitor distributes tracts the gypsy noted his uneasiness and resented it  what does it feel like to be afraid she asked eyeing him  i am afraid of nothing gavin answered offended in turn  yes you are when you saw me come out of nannys you crept behind a tree when these boys showed themselves you shook you are afraid of being seen with me go away then i dont want you  fear said gavin is one thing and prudence is another  another name for it babbie interposed  not at all but i owe it to my position to be careful unhappily you do not seem to feelto recogniseto know  to know what  let us avoid the subject  no the egyptian said petulantly i hate not to be told things why must you be prudent  you should see gavin replied awkwardly that there is aa difference between a minister and a gypsy  but if i am willing to overlook it asked babbie impertinently  gavin beat the brushwood mournfully with his staff  i cannot allow you he said to talk disrespectfully of my calling it is the highest a man can follow i wish  he checked himself but he was wishing she could see him in his pulpit  i suppose said the gypsy reflectively one must be very clever to be a minister  as for that answered gavin waving his hand grandly  and it must be nice too continued babbie to be able to speak for a whole hour to people who can neither answer nor go away is it true that before you begin to preach you lock the door to keep the congregation in  i must leave you if you talk in that way  i only wanted to know  oh babbie i am afraid you have little acquaintance with the inside of churches do you sit under anybody  do i sit under anybody repeated babbie blankly  is it any wonder that the minister sighed whom do you sit under was his form of salutation to strangers  i mean where do you belong he said  wanderers babbie answered still misunderstanding him belong to nowhere in particular  i am only asking you if you ever go to church  oh that is what you mean yes i go often  what church  you promised not to ask questions  i only mean what denomination do you belong to  oh thetheis there an english church denomination  gavin groaned  well that is my denomination said babbie cheerfully some day though i am coming to hear you preach i should like to see how you look in your gown  we dont wear gowns  what a shame but i am coming nevertheless i used to like going to church in edinburgh  you have lived in edinburgh  we gypsies have lived everywhere babbie said lightly though she was annoyed at having mentioned edinburgh  but all gypsies dont speak as you do said gavin puzzled again i dont understand you  of course you dinna replied babbie in broad scotch maybe if you did you would think that its mair imprudent in me to stand here cracking clavers wi the minister than for the minister to waste his time cracking wi me  then why do it  becauseoh because prudence and i always take different roads  tell me who you are babbie the minister entreated at least tell me where your encampment is  you have warned me against imprudence she said  i want gavin continued earnestly to know your people your father and mother  why  because he answered stoutly i like their daughter  at that babbies fingers played on one of the pans and for the moment there was no more badinage in her  you are a good man she said abruptly but you will never know my parents  are they dead  they may be i cannot tell  this is all incomprehensible to me  i suppose it is i never asked any one to understand me  perhaps not said gavin excitedly but the time has come when i must know everything of you that is to be known  babbie receded from him in quick fear  you must never speak to me in that way again she said in a warning voice  in what way  gavin knew what way very well but he thirsted to hear in her words what his own had implied she did not choose to oblige him however  you never will understand me she said i daresay i might be more like other people now ifif i had been brought up differently not she added passionately that i want to be like others do you never feel when you have been living a humdrum life for months that you must break out of it or go crazy  her vehemence alarmed gavin who hastened to reply  my life is not humdrum it is full of excitement anxieties pleasures and i am too fond of the pleasures perhaps it is because i have more of the luxuries of life than you that i am so content with my lot  why what can you know of luxuries  i have eighty pounds a year  babble laughed are ministers so poor she asked calling back her gravity  it is a considerable sum said gavin a little hurt for it was the first time he had ever heard any one speak disrespectfully of eighty pounds  the egyptian looked down at her ring and smiled  i shall always remember your saying that she told him after we have quarrelled  we shall not quarrel said gavin decidedly  oh yes we shall  we might have done so once but we know each other too well now  that is why we are to quarrel  about what said the minister i have not blamed you for deriding my stipend though how it can seem small in the eyes of a gypsy  who can afford broke in babbie to give nanny seven shillings a week  true gavin said uncomfortably while the egyptian again toyed with her ring she was too impulsive to be reticent except now and then and suddenly she said you have looked at this ring before now do you know that if you had it on your finger you would be more worth robbing than with eighty pounds in each of your pockets  where did you get it demanded gavin fiercely  i am sorry i told you that the gypsy said regretfully  tell me how you got it gavin insisted his face now hard  now you see we are quarrelling  i must know  must know you forget yourself she said haughtily  no but i have forgotten myself too long where did you get that ring  good afternoon to you said the egyptian lifting her pans  it is not good afternoon he cried detaining her it is good bye for ever unless you answer me  as you please she said i will not tell you where i got my ring it is no affair of yours  yes babbie it is  she was not perhaps greatly grieved to hear him say so for she made no answer  you are no gypsy he continued suspiciously  perhaps not she answered again taking the pans  this dress is but a disguise  it may be why dont you go away and leave me  i am going he replied wildly i will have no more to do with you formerly i pitied you but  he could not have used a word more calculated to rouse the egyptians ire and she walked away with her head erect only once did she look back and it was to say  this is prudencenow     chapter xix  circumstances leading to the first sermon in approval of women   a young man thinks that he alone of mortals is impervious to love and so the discovery that he is in it suddenly alters his views of his own mechanism it is thus not unlike a rap on the funnybone did gavin make this discovery when the egyptian left him apparently he only came to the brink of it and stood blind he had driven her from him for ever and his sense of loss was so acute that his soul cried out for the cure rather than for the name of the malady  in time he would have realised what had happened but time was denied him for just as he was starting for the mud house babbie saved his dignity by returning to him it was not her custom to fix her eyes on the ground as she walked but she was doing so now and at the same time swinging the empty pans doubtless she had come back for more water in the belief that gavin had gone he pronounced her name with a sense of guilt and she looked up surprised or seemingly surprised to find him still there  i thought you had gone away long ago she said stiffly  otherwise asked gavin the dejected you would not have come back to the well  certainly not  i am very sorry had you waited another moment i should have been gone  this was said in apology but the wilful egyptian chose to change its meaning  you have no right to blame me for disturbing you she declared with warmth  i did not i only  you could have been a mile away by this time nanny wanted more water  babbie scrutinised the minister sharply as she made this statement surely her conscience troubled her for on his not answering immediately she said do you presume to disbelieve me what could have made me return except to fill the pans again  nothing gavin admitted eagerly and i assure you  babbie should have been grateful to his denseness but it merely set her mind at rest  say anything against me you choose she told him say it as brutally as you like for i wont listen  she stopped to hear his response to that and she looked so cold that it almost froze on gavins lips  i had no right he said dolefully to speak to you as i did  you had not answered the proud egyptian she was looking away from him to show that his repentance was not even interesting to her however she had forgotten already not to listen  what business is it of mine asked gavin amazed at his late presumption whether you are a gypsy or no  none whatever  and as for the ring  here he gave her an opportunity of allowing that his curiosity about the ring was warranted she declined to help him however and so he had to go on  the ring is yours he said and why should you not wear it  why indeed  i am afraid i have a very bad temper  he paused for a contradiction but she nodded her head in agreement  and it is no wonder he continued that you think me aa brute  im sure it is not  but babbie i want you to know that i despise myself for my base suspicions no sooner did i see them than i loathed them and myself for harbouring them despite this mystery i look upon you as a noblehearted girl i shall always think of you so  this time babbie did not reply  that was all i had to say concluded gavin except that i hope you will not punish nanny for my sins goodbye  goodbye said the egyptian who was looking at the well  the ministers legs could not have heard him give the order to march for they stood waiting  i thought said the egyptian after a moment that you said you were going  i was onlybrushing my hat gavin answered with dignity you want me to go  she bowed and this time he did set off  you can go if you like she remarked now  he turned at this  but you said he began diffidently  no i did not she answered with indignation  he could see her face at last  youyou are crying he exclaimed in bewilderment  because you are so unfeeling sobbed babbie  what have i said what have i done cried gavin in an agony of selfcontempt oh that i had gone away at once  that is cruel  what is  to say that  what did i say  that you wished you had gone away  but surely the minister faltered you asked me to go  how can you say so asked the gypsy reproachfully  gavin was distracted on my word he said earnestly i thought you did and now i have made you unhappy babbie i wish i were anybody but myself i am a hopeless lout  now you are unjust said babbie hiding her face  again to you  no you stupid she said beaming on him in her most delightful manner to yourself  she gave him both her hands impetuously and he did not let them go until she added  i am so glad that you are reasonable at last men are so much more unreasonable than women dont you think  perhaps we are gavin said diplomatically  of course you are why every one knows that well i forgive you only remember you have admitted that it was all your fault  she was pointing her finger at him like a schoolmistress and gavin hastened to answer  you were not to blame at all  i like to hear you say that explained the representative of the more reasonable sex because it was really all my fault  no no  yes it was but of course i could not say so until you had asked my pardon you must understand that  the representative of the less reasonable sex could not understand it but he agreed recklessly and it seemed so plain to the woman that she continued confidentially  i pretended that i did not want to make it up but i did  did you asked gavin elated  yes but nothing could have induced me to make the first advance you see why  because i was so unreasonable asked gavin doubtfully  yes and nasty you admit you were nasty  undoubtedly i have an evil temper it has brought me to shame many times  oh i dont know said the egyptian charitably i like it i believe i admire bullies  did i bully you  i never knew such a bully you quite frightened me  gavin began to be less displeased with himself  you are sure inquired babbie that you had no right to question me about the ring  certain answered gavin  then i will tell you all about it said babbie for it is natural that you should want to know  he looked eagerly at her and she had become serious and sad  i must tell you at the same time she said who i am and then then we shall never see each other any more  why should you tell me cried gavin his hand rising to stop her  because you have a right to know she replied now too much in earnest to see that she was yielding a point i should prefer not to tell you yet there is nothing wrong in my secret and it may make you think of me kindly when i have gone away  dont speak in that way babbie after you have forgiven me  did i hurt you it was only because i know that you cannot trust me while i remain a mystery i know you would try to trust me but doubts would cross your mind yes they would they are the shadows that mysteries cast who can believe a gypsy if the odds are against her  i can said gavin but she shook her head and so would he had he remembered three recent sermons of his own preaching  i had better tell you all she said with an effort  it is my turn now to refuse to listen to you exclaimed gavin who was only a chivalrous boy babbie i should like to hear your story but until you want to tell it to me i will not listen to it i have faith in your honour and that is sufficient  it was boyish but i am glad gavin said it and now babbie admired something in him that deserved admiration his faith no doubt made her a better woman  i admit that i would rather tell you nothing just now she said gratefully you are sure you will never say again that you dont understand me  quite sure said gavin bravely and byandby you will offer to tell me of your free will  oh dont let us think of the future answered babbie let us be happy for the moment  this had been the egyptians philosophy always but it was ill suited for auld licht ministers as one of them was presently to discover  i want to make one confession though babbie continued almost reluctantly when you were so nasty a little while ago i didnt go back to nannys i stood watching you from behind a tree and then for an excuse to come back ii poured out the water yes and i told you another lie i really came back to admit that it was all my fault if i could not get you to say that it was yours i am so glad you gave in first  she was very near him and the tears had not yet dried on her eyes they were laughing eyes eyes in distress imploring eyes her pale face smiling sad dimpled yet entreating forgiveness was the one prominent thing in the world to him just then he wanted to kiss her he would have done it as soon as her eyes rested on his but she continued without regarding him  how mean that sounds oh if i were a man i should wish to be everything that i am not and nothing that i am i should scorn to be a liar i should choose to be open in all things i should try to fight the world honestly but i am only a woman and sowell that is the kind of man i should like to marry  a minister may be all these things said gavin breathlessly  the man i could love babbie went on not heeding him almost forgetting that he was there must not spend his days in idleness as the men i know do  i do not  he must be brave no mere worker among others but a leader of men  all ministers are  who makes his influence felt  assuredly  and takes the side of the weak against the strong even though the strong be in the right  always my tendency  a man who has a mind of his own and having once made it up stands to it in defiance even of  of his session  of the world he must understand me  i do  and be my master  it is his lawful position in the house  he must not yield to my coaxing or tempers  it would be weakness  but compel me to do his bidding yes even thrash if  if you wont listen to reason babbie cried gavin i am that man  here the inventory abruptly ended and these two people found themselves staring at each other as if of a sudden they had heard something dreadful i do not know how long they stood thus motionless and horrified i cannot tell even which stirred first all i know is that almost simultaneously they turned from each other and hurried out of the wood in opposite directions     chapter xx  end of the state of indecision   long before i had any thought of writing this story i had told it so often to my little maid that she now knows some of it better than i if you saw me looking up from my paper to ask her what was it that birse said to jean about the ministers flowers or where was hendry munn hidden on the night of the riots and heard her confident answers you would conclude that she had been in the thick of these events instead of born many years after them i mention this now because i have reached a point where her memory contradicts mine she maintains that rob dow was told of the meeting in the wood by the two boys whom it disturbed while my own impression is that he was a witness of it if she is right rob must have succeeded in frightening the boys into telling no other person for certainly the scandal did not spread in thrums after all however it is only important to know that rob did learn of the meeting its first effect was to send him sullenly to the drink  many a time since these events have i pictured what might have been their upshot had dow confided their discovery to me had i suspected why rob was grown so dour again gavins future might have been very different i was meeting rob now and again in the glen asking with an affected carelessness he did not bottom for news of the little minister but what he told me was only the gossip of the town and what i should have known that thrums might never know it he kept to himself i suppose he feared to speak to gavin who made several efforts to reclaim him but without avail  yet robs heart opened for a moment to one man or rather was forced open by that man a few days after the meeting at the well rob was bringing the smell of whisky with him down bankers close when he ran against a famous staff with which the doctor pinned him to the wall  ay said the outspoken doctor looking contemptuously into robs bleary eyes so this is what your conversion amounts to faugh rob dow if you were half a man the very thought of what mr dishart has done for you would make you run past the public houses  its the thocht o him that sends me running to them growled rob knocking down the staff let me alane  what do you mean by that demanded mcqueen hooking him this time  speir at himsel speir at the woman  what woman  take your staff out o my neck  not till you tell me why you of all people are speaking against the minister  torn by a desire for a confidant and loyalty to gavin rob was already in a fury  say again he burst forth that i was speaking agin the minister and ill practise on you what im awid to do to her  who is she  whas wha  the woman whom the minister  i said nothing about a woman said poor rob alarmed for gavin doctor im ready to swear afore a bailie that i never saw them thegither at the kaims  the kaims exclaimed the doctor suddenly enlightened pooh you only mean the egyptian rob make your mind easy about this i know why he met her there  do you ken that she has bewitched him do you ken i saw him trying to put his arms round her do you ken they have a trysting place in caddam wood  this came from rob in a rush and he would fain have called it all back  im drunk doctor roaring drunk he said hastily and it wasna the minister i saw ava it was another man  nothing more could the doctor draw from rob but he had heard sufficient to smoke some pipes on like many who pride themselves on being recluses mcqueen loved the gossip that came to him uninvited indeed he opened his mouth to it as greedily as any man in thrums he respected gavin however too much to find this new dish palatable and so his researches to discover whether other auld lichts shared robs fears were conducted with caution is there no word of your ministers getting a wife yet he asked several but only got for answers theres word o a glasgow leddys sending him baskets o flowers or he has his een open but hes taking his time ay hes looking for the blade o corn in the stack o chaff  this convinced mcqueen that the congregation knew nothing of the egyptian but it did not satisfy him and he made an opportunity of inviting gavin into the surgery it was to the doctor the cosiest nook in his house but to me and many others a room that smelled of hearses on the top of the pipes and tobacco tins that littered the table there usually lay a death certificate placed there deliberately by the doctor to scare his sister who had a passion for putting the surgery to rights  by the way mcqueen said after he and gavin had talked a little while did i ever advise you to smoke  it is your usual form of salutation gavin answered laughing but i dont think you ever supplied me with a reason  i daresay not i am too experienced a doctor to cheapen my prescriptions in that way however here is one good reason i have noticed sir that at your age a man is either a slave to a pipe or to a woman do you want me to lend you a pipe now  then i am to understand asked gavin slyly that your locket came into your possession in your presmoking days and that you merely wear it from habit  tuts answered the doctor buttoning his coat i told you there was nothing in the locket if there is i have forgotten what it is  you are a hopeless old bachelor i see said gavin unaware that the doctor was probing him he was surprised next moment to find mcqueen in the ecstasies of one who has won a rubber  now then cried the jubilant doctor as you have confessed so much tell me all about her name and address please  confess what have i confessed  it wont do mr dishart for even your face betrays you no no i am an old bird but i have not forgotten the ways of the fledgelings hopeless bachelor sir is a sweetmeat in every young mans mouth until of a sudden he finds it sour and that means the banns when is it to be  we must find the lady first said the minister uncomfortably  you tell me in spite of that face that you have not fixed on her  the difficulty i suppose would be to persuade her to fix on me  not a bit of it but you admit there is some one  who would have me  you are wriggling out of it is it the bankers daughter  no gavin cried  i hear you have walked up the back wynd with her three times this week the town is in a ferment about it  she is a great deal in the back wynd  fiddlededee i am oftener in the back wynd than you and i never meet her there  that is curious  no it isnt but never mind perhaps you have fallen to miss pennycuicks piano did you hear it going as we passed the house  she seems always to be playing on her piano  not she but you are supposed to be musical and so when she sees you from her window she begins to thump if i am in the school wynd and hear the piano going i know you will turn the corner immediately however i am glad to hear it is not miss pennycuick then it is the factor at the spittals lassie well done sir you should arrange to have the wedding at the same time as the old earls which comes off in summer i believe  one foolish marriage is enough in a day doctor  eh you call him a fool far marrying a young wife well no doubt he is but he would have been a bigger fool to marry an old one however it is not lord rintoul we are discussing but gavin dishart i suppose you know that the factors lassie is an heiress  and therefore would scorn me  try her said the doctor drily her father and mother as i know married on a tenpound note but if i am wrong again i must adopt the popular view in thrums it is a glasgow lady after all man you neednt look indignant at hearing that the people are discussing your intended you can no more stop it than a doctors orders could keep lang tammas out of church they have discovered that she sends you flowers twice every week  they never reach me answered gavin then remembered the holly and winced  some persisted the relentless doctor even speak of your having been seen together but of course if she is a glasgow lady that is a mistake  where did they see us asked gavin with a sudden trouble in his throat  you are shaking said the doctor keenly like a medical student at his first operation but as for the story that you and the lady have been seen together i can guess how it arose do you remember that gypsy girl  the doctor had begun by addressing the fire but he suddenly wheeled round and fired his question in the ministers face gavin however did not even blink  why should i have forgotten her he replied coolly  oh in the stress of other occupations but it was your getting the money from her at the kaims for nanny that i was to speak of absurd though it seems i think some dotard must have seen you and her at the kaims and mistaken her for the lady  mcqueen flung himself back in his chair to enjoy this joke  fancy mistaking that woman for a lady he said to gavin who had not laughed with him  i think nanny has some justification for considering her a lady the minister said firmly  well i grant that but what made me guffaw was a vision of the harumscarum devilmaycare little egyptian mistress of an auld licht manse  she is neither harumscarum nor devilmaycare gavin answered without heat for he was no longer a distracted minister you dont understand her as i do  no i seem to understand her differently  what do you know of her  that is just it said the doctor irritated by gavins coolness i know she saved nanny from the poorhouse but i dont know where she got the money i know she can talk fine english when she chooses but i dont know where she learned it i know she heard that the soldiers were coming to thrums before they knew of their destination themselves but i dont know who told her you who understand her can doubtless explain these matters  she offered to explain them to me gavin answered still unmoved but i forbade her  why  it is no business of yours doctor forgive me for saying so  in thrums replied mcqueen a ministers business is everybodys business i have often wondered who helped her to escape from the soldiers that night did she offer to explain that to you  she did not  perhaps said the doctor sharply because it was unnecessary  that was the reason  you helped her to escape  i did  and you are not ashamed of it  i am not  why were you so anxious to screen her  she saved some of my people from gaol  which was more than they deserved  i have always understood that you concealed two of them in your own stable  maybe i did the doctor had to allow but i took my stick to them next morning besides they were thrums folk while you had never set eyes on that imp of mischief before  i cannot sit here doctor and hear her called names gavin said rising but mcqueen gripped him by the shoulder  for pitys sake sir dont let us wrangle like a pair of women i brought you here to speak my mind to you and speak it i will i warn you mr dishart that you are being watched you have been seen meeting this lassie in caddam as well as at the kaims  let the whole town watch doctor i have met her openly  and why oh dont make nanny your excuse  i wont i met her because i love her  are you mad cried mcqueen you speak as if you would marry her  yes replied gavin determinedly and i mean to do it  the doctor flung up his hands  i give you up he said raging i give you up think of your congregation man  i have been thinking of them and as soon as i have a right to do so i shall tell them what i have told you  and until you tell them i will keep your madness to myself for i warn you that as soon as they do know there will be a vacancy in the auld licht kirk of thrums  she is a woman said gavin hesitating though preparing to go of whom any minister might be proud  she is a woman the doctor roared that no congregation would stand oh if you will go there is your hat  perhaps gavins face was whiter as he left the house than when he entered it but there was no other change those who were watching him decided that he was looking much as usual except that his mouth was shut very firm from which they concluded that he had been taking the doctor to task for smoking they also noted that he returned to mcqueens house within half a hour after leaving it but remained no time  some explained this second visit by saying that the minister had forgotten his cravat and had gone back for it what really sent him back however was his conscience he had said to mcqueen that he helped babbie to escape from the soldiers because of her kindness to his people and he returned to own that it was a lie  gavin knocked at the door of the surgery but entered without waiting for a response mcqueen was no longer stamping through the room red and furious he had even laid aside his pipe he was sitting back in his chair looking halfmournfully half contemptuously at something in his palm his hand closed instinctively when he heard the door open but gavin had seen that the object was an open locket  it was only your reference to the thing the detected doctor said with a grim laugh that made me open it forty fears ago sir iphew it is fortytwo years and i have not got over it yet he closed the locket with a snap i hope you have come back dishart to speak more rationally  gavin told him why he had come back and the doctor said he was a fool for his pains  is it useless dishart to make another appeal to you  quite useless doctor gavin answered promptly my mind is made up at last     chapter xxi  nightmargaretflashing of a lantern   that evening the little minister sat silently in his parlour darkness came and with it weavers rose heavyeyed from their looms sleepy children sought their mothers and the gate of the field above the manse fell forward to let cows pass to their byre the great bible was produced in many homes and the ten oclock bell clanged its last word to the night margaret had allowed the lamp to burn low thinking that her boy slept she moved softly to his side and spread her shawl over his knees he had forgotten her the doctors warnings scarcely troubled him he was babbies lover the mystery of her was only a veil hiding her from other men and he was looking through it upon the face of his beloved  it was a night of long ago but can you not see my dear margaret still as she bends over her son not twice in many days dared the minister snatch a moments sleep from grey morning to midnight and when this did happen he jumped up byandby in shame to revile himself for an idler and ask his mother wrathfully why she had not tumbled him out of his chair tonight margaret was divided between a desire to let him sleep and a fear of his selfreproach when he awoke and so perhaps the tear fell that roused him  i did not like to waken you margaret said apprehensively you must have been very tired gavin  i was not sleeping mother he said slowly i was only thinking  ah gavin you never rise from your loom it is hardly fair that your hands should be so full of other peoples troubles  they only fill one hand mother i carry the peoples joys in the other hand and that keeps me erect like a woman between her pan and pitcher i think the joys have outweighed the sorrows since we came here  it has been all joy to me gavin for you never tell me of the sorrows an old woman has no right to be so happy  old woman mother said gavin but his indignation was vain margaret was an old woman i made her old before her time  as for these terrible troubles he went on i forget them the moment i enter the garden and see you at your window and maybe i keep some of the joys from you as well as the troubles  words about babbie leaped to his mouth but with an effort he restrained them he must not tell his mother of her until babbie of her free will had told him all there was to tell  i have been a selfish woman gavin  you selfish mother gavin said smiling tell me when you did not think of others before yourself  always gavin has it not been selfishness to hope that you would never want to bring another mistress to the manse do you remember how angry you used to be in glasgow when i said that you would marry some day  i remember gavin said sadly  yes you used to say dont speak of such a thing mother for the horrid thought of it is enough to drive all the hebrew out of my head was not that lightning just now  i did not see it what a memory you have mother for all the boyish things i said  i cant deny margaret admitted with a sigh that i liked to hear you speak in that way though i knew you would go back on your word you see you have changed already  how mother asked gavin surprised  you said just now that those were boyish speeches gavin i cant understand the mothers who are glad to see their sons married though i had a dozen i believe it would be a wrench to lose one of them it would be different with daughters you are laughing gavin  yes at your reference to daughters would you not have preferred me to be a girl  deed i would not answered margaret with tremendous conviction gavin every woman on earth be she rich or poor good or bad offers up one prayer about her firstborn and that is may he be a boy  i think you are wrong mother the bankers wife told me that there is nothing for which she thanks the lord so much as that all her children are girls  may she be forgiven for that gavin exclaimed margaret though she maybe did right to put the best face on her humiliation no no there are many kinds of women in the world but there never was one yet that didnt want to begin with a laddie you can speculate about a boy so much more than about a girl gavin what is it a woman thinks about the day her son is born yes and the day before too she is picturing him a grown man and a slip of a lassie taking him from her ay that is where the lassies have their revenge on the mothers i remember as if it were this morning a harvie fishwife patting your head and asking who was your sweetheart and i could never thole the woman again we were at the door of the cottage and i mind i gripped you up in my arms you had on a tartan frock with a sash and diamond socks when i look back gavin it seems to me that you have shot up from that frock to manhood in a single hour  there are not many mothers like you gavin said laying his hand fondly on margarets shoulder  there are many better mothers but few such sons it is easily seen why god could not afford me another gavin i am sure that was lightning  i think it was but dont be alarmed mother  i am never frightened when you are with me  and i always will be with you  ah if you were married  do you think asked gavin indignantly that it would make any difference to you  margaret did not answer she knew what a difference it would make  except continued gavin with a mans obtuseness that you would have a daughter as well as a son to love you and take care of you  margaret could have told him that men give themselves away needlessly who marry for the sake of their mother but all she said was  gavin i see you can speak more composedly of marrying now than you spoke a year ago if i did not know better i should think a thrums young lady had got hold of you  it was a moment before gavin replied then he said gaily  really mother the way the best of women speak of each other is lamentable you say i should be better married and then you take for granted that every marriageable woman in the neighbourhood is trying to kidnap me i am sure you did not take my father by force in that way  he did not see that margaret trembled at the mention of his father he never knew that she was many times pining to lay her head upon his breast and tell him of me yet i cannot but believe that she always shook when adam dishart was spoken of between them i cannot think that the longcherishing of the secret which was hers and mine kept her face steady when that horror suddenly confronted her as now gavin would have suspected much had he ever suspected anything  i know margaret said courageously that you would be better married but when it comes to selecting the woman i grow fearful o gavin she said earnestly it is an awful thing to marry the wrong man  here in a moment had she revealed much though far from all and there must have been many such moments between them but gavin was thinking of his own affairs  you mean the wrong woman dont you mother he said and she hastened to agree but it was the wrong man she meant  the difficulty i suppose is to hit upon the right one gavin said blithely  to know which is the right one in time answered margaret solemnly but i am saying nothing against the young ladies of thrums gavin though i have scarcely seen them i know there are good women among them jean says  i believe mother gavin interposed reproachfully that you have been questioning jean about them  just because i was afraidi mean because i fanciedyou might be taking a liking to one of them  and what is jeans verdict  she says every one of them would jump at you like a bird at a berry  but the berry cannot be divided how would miss pennycuick please you mother  gavin cried margaret in consternation you dont mean tobut you are laughing at me again  then there is the bankers daughter  i cant thole her  why i question if you ever set eyes on her mother  perhaps not gavin but i have suspected her ever since she offered to become one of your tract distributors  the doctor said gavin not illpleased was saying that either of these ladies would suit me  what business has he asked margaret vindictively to put such thoughts into your head  but he only did as you are doing mother i see you will never be satisfied without selecting the woman for me yourself  ay gavin said margaret earnestly and i question if i should be satisfied even then but i am sure i should be a better guide to you than dr mcqueen is  i am convinced of that but i wonder what sort of woman would content you  whoever pleased you gavin would content me margaret ventured to maintain you would only take to a clever woman  she must be nearly as clever as you mother  hoots gavin said margaret smiling im not to be caught with chaff i am a stupid ignorant woman  then i must look out for a stupid ignorant woman for that seems to be the kind i like answered gavin of whom i may confess here something that has to be told sooner or later it is this he never realised that babbie was a great deal cleverer than himself forgive him you who read if you have any tolerance for the creature man  she will be terribly learned in languages pursued margaret so that she may follow you in your studies as i have never been able to do  your face has helped me more than hebrew mother replied gavin i will give her no marks for languages  at any rate margaret insisted she must be a grand housekeeper and very thrifty  as for that gavin said faltering a little one cant expect it of a mere girl  i should expect it maintained his mother  no no but she would have you said gavin happily to teach her housekeeping  it would be a pleasant occupation to me that margaret admitted and she would soon learn she would be so proud of her position as mistress of a manse  perhaps gavin said doubtfully he had no doubt on the subject in his college days  and we can take for granted continued his mother that she is a lassie of fine character  of course said gavin holding his head high as if he thought the doctor might be watching him  i have thought margaret went on that there was a great deal of wisdom in what you said at that last marriage in the manse the one where you remember the best man and the bridesmaid joined hands instead of the bride and bridegroom  what did i say asked the little minister with misgivings  that there was great danger when people married out of their own rank of life  ohahwell of course that would depend on circumstances  they were wise words gavin there was the sermon too that you preached a month or two ago against marrying into other denominations jean told me that it greatly impressed the congregation it is a sad sight as you said to see an auld licht lassie changing her faith because her man belongs to the u ps  did i say that  you did and it so struck jean that she told me she would rather be an old maid for life the which she said is a dismal prospect than marry out of the auld licht kirk  it is harmless gavin answered going to the window he started back next moment and crying dont look out mother hastily pulled down the blind  why gavin margaret said in fear you look as if it had struck you  oh no gavin answered with a forced laugh and he lit her lamp for her  but it had struck him though it was not lightning it was the flashing of a lantern against the window to attract his attention and the holder of the lantern was babbie  goodnight mother  goodnight gavin dont sit up any later tammas though he is so obstinate has a love for you passing the love of woman these were her words jean is more sentimental than you might think  i wish he would show his love said gavin by contradicting me less frequently  you have rob dow to weigh against him  no i cannot make out what has come over rob lately he is drinking heavily again and avoiding me the lightning is becoming very vivid  yes and i hear no thunder there is another thing gavin i am one of those that like to sit at home but if you had a wife she would visit the congregation a truly religious wife would be a great help to you  religious gavin repeated slowly yes but some people are religious without speaking of it if a woman is good she is religious a good woman who has been let us say foolishly brought up only needs to be shown the right way to tread it mother i question if any man minister or layman ever yet fell in love because the woman was thrifty or clever or went to church twice on sabbath  i believe that is true margaret said and i would not have it otherwise but it is an awful thing gavin as you said from the pulpit two weeks ago to worship only at a beautiful face  you think too much about what i say in the pulpit mother gavin said with a sigh though of course a man who fell in love merely with a face would be a contemptible creature yet i see that women do not understand how beauty affects a man  yes yes my boyoh indeed they do said margaret who on some matters knew far more than her son  twelve oclock struck and she rose to go to bed alarmed lest she should not waken early in the morning but i am afraid i shant sleep she said if that lightning continues  it is harmless gavin answered going to the window he started back next moment and crying dont look out mother hastily pulled down the blind  why gavin margaret said in fear you look as if it had struck you  oh no gavin answered with a forced laugh and he lit her lamp for her  but it had struck him though it was not lightning it was the flashing of a lantern against the window to attract his attention and the holder of the lantern was babbie  goodnight mother  goodnight gavin dont sit up any later     chapter xxii  lovers   only something terrible gavin thought could have brought babbie to him at such an hour yet when he left his mothers room it was to stand motionless on the stair waiting for a silence in the manse that would not come a house is never still in darkness to those who listen intently there is a whispering in distant chambers an unearthly hand presses the snib of the window the latch rises ghosts were created when the first man woke in the night  now margaret slept two hours earlier jean sitting on the salt bucket had read the chapter with which she always sent herself to bed in honour of the little minister she had begun her bible afresh when he came to thrums and was progressing through it a chapter at night sighing perhaps on washing days at a long chapter such as exodus twelfth but never making two of it the kitchen wagatthewall clock was telling every room in the house that she had neglected to shut her door as gavin felt his way down the dark stair awakening it into protest at every step he had a glimpse of the pendulums shadow running back and forward on the hearth he started back from another shadow on the lobby wall and then seeing it start too knew it for his own he opened the door and passed out unobserved it was as if the sounds and shadows that filled the manse were too occupied with their game to mind an interloper  is that you he said to a bush for the garden was in semi darkness then the lanterns flash met him and he saw the egyptian in the summerseat  at last she said reproachfully evidently a lantern is a poor doorbell  what is it gavin asked in suppressed excitement for the least he expected to hear was that she was again being pursued for her share in the riot the tremor in his voice surprised her into silence and he thought she faltered because what she had to tell him was so woeful so in the darkness of the summerseat he kissed her and she might have known that with that kiss the little minister was hers forever  now babbie had been kissed before but never thus and she turned from gavin and would have liked to be alone for she had begun to know what love was and the flash that revealed it to her laid bare her own shame so that her impulse was to hide herself from her lover but of all this gavin was unconscious and he repeated his question the lantern was swaying in her hand and when she turned fearfully to him its light fell on his face and she saw how alarmed he was  i am going away back to nannys she said suddenly and rose cowed but he took her hand and held her  babbie he said huskily tell me what has happened to bring you here at this hour  she sought to pull her hand from him but could not  how you are trembling he whispered babbie he cried something terrible has happened to you but do not fear tell me what it is and thenthen i will take you to my mother yes i will take you now  the egyptian would have given all she had in the world to be able to fly from him then that he might never know her as she was but it could not be and so she spoke out remorselessly if her voice had become hard it was a newborn scorn of herself that made it so  you are needlessly alarmed she said i am not at all the kind of person who deserves sympathy or expects it there is nothing wrong i am staying with nanny overnight and only came to thrums to amuse myself i chased your policeman down the roods with my lantern and then came here to amuse myself with you that is all  it was nothing but a love of mischief that brought you here gavin asked sternly after an unpleasant pause  nothing the egyptian answered recklessly  i could not have believed this of you the minister said i am ashamed of you  i thought babbie retorted trying to speak lightly until she could get away from him that you would be glad to see me your last words in caddam seemed to justify that idea  i am very sorry to see you he answered reproachfully  then i will go away at one she said stepping out of the summerseat  yes he replied you must go at once  then i wont she said turning back defiantly i know what you are to say that the thrums people would be shocked if they knew i was here as if i cared what the thrums people think of me  i care what they think of you gavin said as if that were decisive and i tell you i will not allow you to repeat this freak  you will not allow me echoed babbie almost enjoying herself despite her sudden loss of selfrespect  i will not gavin said resolutely henceforth you must do as i think fit  since when have you taken command of me demanded babbie  since a minute ago gavin replied when you let me kiss you  let you exclaimed babbie now justly incensed you did it yourself i was very angry  no you were not  i am not allowed to say that even asked the egyptian tell me something i may say then and i will repeat it after you  i have something to say to you gavin told her after a moments reflection yes and there is something i should like to hear you repeat after me but not tonight  i dont want to hear what it is babbie said quickly but she knew what it was and even then despite the new pain at her heart her bosom swelled with pride because this man still loved her now she wanted to run away with his love for her before he could take it from her and then realising that this parting must be forever a great desire filled her to hear him put that kiss into words and she said faltering  you can tell me what it is if you like  not tonight said gavin  tonight if at all the gypsy almost entreated  tomorrow at nannys answered gavin decisively and this time he remembered without dismay that the morrow was the sabbath  in the fairy tale the beast suddenly drops his skin and is a prince and i believed it seemed to babbie that some such change had come over this man her plaything  your lantern is shining on my mothers window were the words that woke her from this discovery and then she found herself yielding the lantern to him she became conscious vaguely that a corresponding change was taking place in herself  you spoke of taking me to your mother she said bitterly  yes he answered at once tomorrow but she shook her head knowing that tomorrow he would be wiser  give me the lantern she said in a low voice i am going back to nannys now  yes he said we must set out now but i can carry the lantern  you are not coming with me she exclaimed shaking herself free of his hand  i am coming he replied calmly though he was not calm take my arm babbie  she made a last effort to free herself from bondage crying passionately i will not let you come  when i say i am coming gavin answered between his teeth i mean that i am coming and so let that be an end of this folly take my arm  i think i hate you she said retreating from him  take my arm he repeated and though her breast was rising rebelliously she did as he ordered and so he escorted her from the garden at the foot of the field she stopped and thought to frighten him by saying what would the people say if they saw you with me now  it does not much matter what they would say he answered still keeping his teeth together as if doubtful of their courage as for what they would do that is certain they would put me out of my church  and it is dear to you  dearer than life  you told me long ago that your mothers heart would break if  yes i am sure it would  they had begun to climb the fields but she stopped him with a jerk  go back mr dishart she implored clutching his arm with both hands you make me very unhappy for no purpose oh why should you risk so much for me  i cannot have you wandering here alone at midnight gavin answered gently  that is nothing to me she said eagerly but no longer resenting his air of proprietorship  you will never do it again if i can prevent it  but you cannot she said sadly oh yes you can mr dishart if you will turn back now i shall promise never to do anything again without first asking myself whether it would seem right to you i know i acted very wrongly tonight  only thoughtlessly he said  then have pity on me she besought him and go back if i have only been thoughtless how can you punish me thus mr dishart she entreated her voice breaking if you were to suffer for this folly of mine do you think i could live  we are in gods hands dear he answered firmly and he again drew her arm to him so they climbed the first field and were almost at the hill before either spoke again  stop babbie whispered crouching as she spoke i see some one crossing the hill  i have seen him for some time gavin answered quietly but i am doing no wrong and i will not hide  the egyptian had to walk on with him and i suppose she did not think the less of him for that yet she said warningly  if he sees you all thrums will be in an uproar before morning  i cannot help that gavin replied it is the will of god  to ruin you for my sins  if he thinks fit  the figure drew nearer and with every step babbies distress doubled  we are walking straight to him she whispered i implore you to wait here until he passes if not for your own sake for your mothers  at that he wavered and she heard his teeth sliding against each other as if he could no longer clench them  but no he said moving on again i will not be a skulker from any man if it be gods wish that i should suffer for this i must suffer  oh why cried babbie beating her hands together in grief should you suffer for me  you are mine gavin answered babbie gasped  and if you act foolishly he continued it is right that i should bear the brunt of it no i will not let you go on alone you are not fit to be alone you need some one to watch over you and care for you and love you and if need be to suffer with you  turn back dear before he sees us  he has seen us  yes i had seen them for the figure on the hill was no other than the dominie of glen quharity the park gate clicked as it swung to and i looked up and saw gavin and the egyptian my eyes should have found them sooner but it was to gaze upon margarets home while no one saw me that i had trudged into thrums so late and by that time i suppose my eyes were of little service for seeing through yet when i knew that of these two people suddenly beside me on the hill one was the little minister and the other a strange woman i fell back from their side with dread before i could step forward and cry gavin  i am mr dishart he answered with a composure that would not have served him for another sentence he was more excited than i for the gavin fell harmlessly on him while i had no sooner uttered it than there rushed through me the shame of being false to margaret it was the only time in my life that i forgot her in him though he has ever stood next to her in my regard  i looked from gavin to the gypsy woman and again from her to him and she began to tell a lie in his interest but she got no farther than i met mr disbart accid when she stopped ashamed it was reverence for gavin that checked the lie not every man has had such a compliment paid him  it is natural gavin said slowly that you sir should wonder why i am here with this woman at such an hour and you may know me so little as to think ill of me for it  i did not answer and he misunderstood my silence  no he continued in a harder voice as if i had asked him a question i will explain nothing to you you are not my judge if you would do me harm sir you have it in your power  it was with these cruel words that gavin addressed me he did not know how cruel they were the egyptian i think must have seen that his suspicions hurt me for she said softly with a look of appeal in her eyes  you are the schoolmaster in glen quharity then you will perhaps save mr dishart the trouble of coming farther by showing me the way to old nanny websters house at windyghoul  i have to pass the house at any rate i answered eagerly and she came quickly to my side  i knew though in the darkness i could see but vaguely that gavin was holding his head high and waiting for me to say my worst i had not told him that i dared think no evil of him and he still suspected me now i would not trust myself to speak lest i should betray margaret and yet i wanted him to know that base doubts about him could never find a shelter in me i am a timid man who long ago lost the glory of my life by it and i was again timid when i sought to let gavin see that my faith in him was unshaken i lifted my bonnet to the gypsy and asked her to take my arm it was done clumsily i cannot doubt but he read my meaning and held out his hand to me i had not touched it since he was three years old and i trembled too much to give it the grasp i owed it he and i parted without a word but to the egyptian he said to morrow dear i will see you at nannys and he was to kiss her but i pulled her a step farther from him and she put her hands over her face crying no no  if i asked her some questions between the hill and windyghoul you must not blame me for this was my affair as well as theirs she did not answer me i know now that she did not hear me but at the mud house she looked abruptly into my face and said  you love him too  i trudged to the schoolhouse with these words for company and it was less her discovery than her confession that tortured me how much i slept that night you may guess     chapter xxiii  contains a birth which is sufficient for one chapter   the kirk bell will soon be ringing nanny said on the following morning as she placed herself carefully on a stool one hand holding her bible and the other wandering complacently over her aged merino gown ay lassie though youre only an egyptian i would hae taen you wi me to hear mr duthie but its speiring ower muckle o a woman to expect her to gang to the kirk in her ilka day claethes  the babbie of yesterday would have laughed at this but the new babbie sighed  i wonder you dont go to mr disharts church now nanny she said gently i am sure you prefer him  babbie babbie exclaimed nanny with spirit may i never be so far left to mysel as to change my kirk just because i like another minister better its easy seen lassie that you ken little o religious questions  very little babbie admitted sadly  but dinna ba so waeful about it the old woman continued kindly for thats no nane like you ay and if you see muckle mair o mr dishart hell soon cure your ignorance  i shall not see much more of him babbie answered with averted head  the like o you couldna expect it nanny said simply whereupon babbie went to the window i had better be stepping nanny said rising for i am aye late unless im on the hill by the time the bell begins ay babbie im doubting my merinos no sair in the fashion  she looked down at her dress half despondently and yet with some pride  it was fowerpence the yard and no less she went on fondling the worn merino when we bocht it at saml currs ay but it has been turned sax times since syne  she sighed and babbie came to her and put her arms round her saying nanny you are a dear  im a gey auldfarrantlooking dear i doubt said nanny ruefully  now nanny rejoined babbie you are just wanting me to flatter you you know the merino looks very nice  its a guid merino yet admitted the old woman but oh babbie what does the material matter if the cut isna fashionable its fine isnt it to be in the fashion  she spoke so wistfully that instead of smiling babbie kissed her  i am afraid to lay hand on the merino nanny but give me off your bonnet and ill make it ten years younger in as many minutes  could you asked nanny eagerly unloosening her bonnetstrings mercy on me she had to add to think about altering bonnets on the sabbathday lassie how could you propose sic a thing  forgive me nanny babbie replied so meekly that the old woman looked at her curiously  i dinna understand what has come ower you she said theres an unca difference in you since last nicht i used to think you were mair like a bird than a lassie but youve lost a your daft capers o singing and lauching and i take ill wit twa or three times ive catched you greeting babbie what has come ower you  nothing nanny i think i hear the bell  down in thrums two kirkofficers had let their bells loose waking echoes in windyghoul as one dog in country parts sets all the others barking but nanny did not hurry off to church such a surprising notion had filled her head suddenly that she even forgot to hold her dress off the floor  babbie she cried in consternation dinna tell me youve gotten ower fond o mr dishart  the like of me nanny the gypsy answered with affected raillery but there was a tear in her eye  it would be a wild presumptious thing nanny said and him a grand minister but  babbie tried to look her in the face but failed and then all at once there came back to nanny the days when she and her lover wandered the hill together  ah my dawtie she cried so tenderly what does it matter wha he is when you canna help it  two frail arms went round the egyptian and babbie rested her head on the old womans breast but do you think it could have happened had not nanny loved a weaver twoscore years before  and now nanny has set off for church and babbie is alone in the mud house some will pity her not at all this girl who was a dozen women in the hour and all made of impulses that would scarce stand still to be photographed to attempt to picture her at any time until now would have been like chasing a spirit that changes to something else as your arms clasp it yet she has always seemed a pathetic little figure to me if i understand babbie at all it is i think because i loved margaret the only woman i have ever known well and one whose nature was not like the egyptians complex but most simple as if god had told her only to be good throughout my life since she came into it she has been to me a glass in which many things are revealed that i could not have learned save through her and something of all womankind even of bewildering babbie i seem to know because i knew margaret  no woman is so bad but we may rejoice when her heart thrills to love for then god has her by the hand there is no love but this she may dream of what love is but it is only of a sudden that she knows babbie who was without a guide from her baby days had dreamed but little of it hearing its name given to another thing she had been born wild and known no home no one had touched her heart except to strike it she had been educated but never tamed her life had been thrown strangely among those who were great in the worlds possessions but she was not of them her soul was in such darkness that she had never seen it she would have danced away cynically from the belief that there is such a thing and now all at once she had passed from disbelief to knowledge is not love gods doing to gavin he had given something of himself and the moment she saw it the flash lit her own soul  it was but little of his master that was in gavin but far smaller things have changed the current of human lives the spiders thread that strikes our brow on a country road may do that yet this i will say though i have no wish to cast the little minister on my pages larger than he was that he had some heroic hours in thrums of which one was when babbie learned to love him until the moment when he kissed her she had only conceived him a quaint fellow whose life was a string of sundays but behold what she saw in him now evidently to his noble mind her mystery was only some misfortune not of her making and his was to be the part of leading her away from it into the happiness of the open life he did not doubt her for he loved and to doubt is to dip love in the mire she had been given to him by god and he was so rich in her possession that the responsibility attached to the gift was not grievous she was his and no mortal man could part them those who looked askance at her were looking askance at him in so far as she was wayward and wild he was those things so long as she remained strange to religion the blame lay on him  all this babbie read in the gavin of the past night and to her it was the book of love what things she had known said and done in that holy name how shamefully have we all besmirched it she had only known it as the most selfish of the passions a brittle image that men consulted because it could only answer in the words they gave it to say but here was a man to whom love was something better than his own desires leering on a pedestal such love as babbie had seen hitherto made strong men weak but this was a love that made a weak man strong all her life strength had been her idol and the weakness that bent to her cajolery her scorn but only now was it revealed to her that strength instead of being the lusty child of passions grows by grappling with and throwing them  so babbie loved the little minister for the best that she had ever seen in man i shall be told that she thought far more of him than he deserved forgetting the mean in the worthy but who that has had a glimpse of heaven will care to let his mind dwell henceforth on earth love it is said is blind but love is not blind it is an extra eye which shows us what is most worthy of regard to see the best is to see most clearly and it is the lovers privilege  down in the auld licht kirk that forenoon gavin preached a sermon in praise of woman and up in the mudhouse in windyghoul babbie sat alone but it was the sabbath day to her the first sabbath in her life her discovery had frozen her mind for a time so that she could only stare at it with eyes that would not shut but that had been in the night already her love seemed a thing of years for it was as old as herself as old as the new babbie it was such a dear delight that she clasped it to her and exulted over it because it was hers and then she cried over it because she must give it up  for babbie must only look at this love and then turn from it my heart aches for the little egyptian but the promised land would have remained invisible to her had she not realized that it was only for others that was the condition of her seeing     chapter xxiv  new world and the woman who may not dwell therein   up here in the glen schoolhouse after my pupils have straggled home there comes to me at times and so sudden that it may be while i am infusing my tea a hot desire to write great books perhaps an hour afterwards i rise beaten from my desk flinging all i have written into the fire yet rescuing some of it on second thought and curse myself as an inglenook man for i see that one can only paint what he himself has felt and in my passion i wish to have all the vices even to being an impious man that i may describe them better for this may i be pardoned it comes to nothing in the end save that my tea is brackish  yet though my solitary life in the glen is cheating me of many experiences more helpful to a writer than to a christian it has not been so tame but that i can understand why babbie cried when she went into nannys garden and saw the new world let no one who loves be called altogether unhappy even love unreturned has its rainbow and babbie knew that gavin loved her yet she stood in woe among the stiff berry bushes as one who stretches forth her hands to love and sees him looking for her and knows she must shrink from the arms she would lie in and only call to him in a voice he cannot hear this is not a love that is always bitter it grows sweet with age but could that dry the tears of the little egyptian who had only been a woman for a day  much was still dark to her of one obstacle that must keep her and gavin ever apart she knew and he did not but had it been removed she would have given herself to him humbly not in her own longing but because he wanted her behold what i am she could have said to him then and left the rest to him believing that her unworthiness would not drag him down it would lose itself so readily in his strength that thrums could rise against such a man if he defied it she did not believe but she was to learn the truth presently from a child  to most of us i suppose has come some shock that was to make us different men from that hour and yet how many days elapsed before something of the man we had been leapt up in us babbie thought she had buried her old impulsiveness and then remembering that from the top of the field she might see gavin returning from church she hastened to the hill to look upon him from a distance before she reached the gate where i had met her and him however she stopped distressed at her selfishness and asked bitterly why am i so different from other women why should what is so easy to them be so hard to me  gavin my beloved the egyptian cried in her agony and the wind caught her words and flung them in the air making sport of her  she wandered westward over the bleak hill and byandby came to a great slab called the standing stone on which children often sit and muse until they see gay ladies riding by on palfreysa kind of horseand knights in glittering armour and goblins and fiery dragons and other wonders now extinct of which barelegged laddies dream as well as boys in socks the standing stone is in the dyke that separates the hill from a fir wood and it is the fairybook of thrums if you would be a knight yourself you must sit on it and whisper to it your desire  babbie came to the standing stone and there was a little boy astride it his hair stood up through holes in his bonnet and he was very ragged and miserable  why are you crying little boy babbie asked him gently but he did not look up and the tongue was strange to him  how are you greeting so sair she asked  im no greeting very sair he answered turning his head from her that a woman might not see his tears im no greeting so sair but what i grat sairer when my mither died  when did she die babbie inquired  lang syne he answered still with averted face  what is your name  micah is my name rob dows my father  and have you no brothers nor sisters asked babbie with a fellowfeeling for him  no juist my father he said  you should be the better laddie to him then did your mither no tell you to be that afore she died  ay he answered she telled me ay to hide the bottle frae him when i could get haed ot she took me into the bed to make me promise that and syne she died  does your father drina  he hauds mair than ony other man in thrums micah replied almost proudly  and he strikes you babbie asked compassionately  thats a lie retorted the boy fiercely leastwise he doesna strike me except when hes mortal and syne i can jouk him  what are you doing there  im wishing its a wishing stane  you are wishing your father wouldna drink  no im no answered micah there was a lang time he didna drink but the woman has sent him to it again its about her im wishing im wishing she was in hell  what woman is it asked babbie shuddering  i dinna ken micah said but shes an ill ane  did you never see her at your fathers house  na if he could get grip o her he would break her ower his knee i hearken to him saying that when hes wild he says she should be burned for a witch  but if he hates her asked babbie how can she have sic power ower him  its no him that she has haud o replied micah still looking away from her  wha is it then  its mr dishart  babbie was struck as if by an arrow from the wood it was so unexpected that she gave a cry and then for the first time micah looked at her  how should that send your father to the drink she asked with an effort  because my fathers michty fond o him answered micah staring strangely at her and when the folk ken about the woman theyll stane the minister out o thrums  the wood faded for a moment from the egyptians sight when it came back the boy had slid off the standing stone and was stealing away  why do you run frae me babbie asked pathetically  im fleid at you he gasped coming to a standstill at a safe distance youre the woman  babbie cowered before her little judge and he drew nearer her slowly  what makes you think that she said  it was a curious time for babbies beauty to be paid its most princely compliment  because youre so bonny micah whispered across the dyke her tears gave him courage you might gang awa he entreated if you kent what a differ mr dishart made in my father till you came you would maybe gang awa when lies roaring fou i have to sleep in the wood and its awful cauld im doubting hell kill me woman if you dinna gang awa  poor babbie put her hand to her heart but the innocent lad continued mercilessly  if ony shame comes to the minister his auld mitherll die how have you sic an ill will at the minister  babbie held up her hands like a supplicant  ill gie you my rabbit micah said if youll gang awa ive juist the ane she shook her head and misunderstanding her he cried with his knuckles in his eye ill gie you them baith though im michty sweer to part wi spotty  then at last babbie found her voice  keep your rabbits laddie she said and greet no more im gaen awa  and youll never come back no more a your life pleaded micah  never no more a my life repeated babbie  and yell leave the minister alane for ever and ever  for ever and ever  micah rubbed his face dry and said will you let me stand on the standing stane and watch you gaen awa for ever and ever  at that a sob broke from babbies heart and looking at her doubtfully micah said  maybe youre gey ill for what youve done  ay babbie answered im gey ill for what ive done  a minute passed and in her anguish she did not know that still she was standing at the dyke micahs voice roused her  you said you would gang awa and youre no gaen  then babbie went away the boy watched her across the hill he climbed the standing stone and gazed after her until she was but a coloured ribbon among the broom when she disappeared into windyghoul he ran home joyfully and told his father what a good days work he had done rob struck him for a fool for taking a gypsys word and warned him against speaking of the woman in thrums  but though dow believed that gavin continued to meet the egyptian secretly he was wrong a sum of money for nanny was sent to the minister but he could guess only from whom it came in vain did he search for babbie some months passed and he gave up the search persuaded that he should see her no more he went about his duties with a drawn face that made many folk uneasy when it was stern and pained them when it tried to smile but to margaret though the effort was terrible he was as he had ever been and so no thought of a woman crossed her loving breast     chapter xxv  beginning of the twentyfour hours   i can tell still how the whole of the glen was engaged about the hour of noon on the fourth of august month a day to be among the last forgotten by any of us though it began as quietly as a roaring march at the spittal between which and thrums this is a halfway house were gathered two hundred men in kilts and many gentry from the neighboring glens to celebrate the earls marriage which was to take place on the morrow and thither too had gone many of my pupils to gather gossip at which girls of six are trustier hands than boys of twelve those of us however who were neither children nor of gentle blood remained at home the farmers more taken up with the want of rain now become a calamity than with an old mans wedding and their womenfolk wringing their hands for rain also yet finding time to marvel at the marriages taking place at the spittal instead of in england of which the ignorant spoke vaguely as an estate of the brides  for my own part i could talk of the disastrous drought with waster lunny as i walked over his parched fields but i had not such cause as he to brood upon it by day and night and the ins and outs of the earls marriage were for discussing at a teatable where there were women to help one to conclusions rather than for the reflections of a solitary dominie who had seen neither bride nor bridegroom so it must be confessed that when i might have been regarding the sky moodily or at the spittal where a free table that day invited all i was sitting in the schoolhouse heeling my left boot on which i have always been a little hard  i made small speed not through lack of craft but because one can no more drive in tackets properly than take cities unless he gives his whole mind to it and half of mine was at the auld licht manse since our meeting six months earlier on the hill i had not seen gavin but i had heard much of him and of a kind to trouble me  i saw nothing queer about mr dishart was waster lunnys frequent story till i hearkened to elspeth speaking about it to the lasses for im the last elspeth would tell anything to though im her man and syne i minded i had been noticing it for months elspeth says he would go on for he could no more forbear quoting his wife than complaining of her that the ministerll listen to you nowadays wi his een glaring at you as if he had a perfectly passionate interest in what you were telling him though it may be only about a hen wi the croup and then after all he hasna heard a sylib ay i listened to elspeth saying that when she thocht i was at the byre and yet would you believe it when i says to her after lousing times ive been noticing of late that the minister loses what a body tells him all she answers is havers tod but womens provoking  i allow birse said that on the first sabbath o june month and again on the third sabbath he poured out the word grandly but ive taen note this curran sabbaths that if hes no michty magnificent hes michty poor theres something damming up his mind and when he gets by it hes a roaring water but when he doesna hes a despizable trickle the folk thinks its a woman thats getting in his way but dinna tell me that about sic a scholar i tell you he would gang ower a toon o women like a loaded cart ower newlaid stanes  wearyworld hobbled after me up the roods one day pelting me with remarks though i was doing my best to get away from him even rob dow sees theres something come ower the minister he bawled for robs fou ilka sabbath now ay but this i will say for mr dishart that he aye gies me a civil word i thought i had left the policeman behind with this but next minute he roared and whatever is the matter wi him it has made him kindlier to me than ever he must have taken the short cut through lunans close for at the top of the roods his voice again made up on me dagone you for a cruel pack to put your fingers to your lugs ilka time i open my mouth  as for waster lunnys daughter easie who got her schooling free for redding up the schoolhouse and breaking my furniture she would never have been off the gossip about the minister for she was her mother in miniature with a tongue that ran like a pump after the pans are full not for use but for the mere pleasure of spilling  on that awful fourth of august i not only had all this confused talk in my head but reason for jumping my mind between it and the egyptian as if to catch them together unawares and i was like one who with the mechanism of a watch jumbled in his hand could set it going if he had the art  of the gypsy i knew nothing save what i had seen that night yet what more was there to learn i was aware that she loved gavin and that he loved her a moment had shown it to me now with the auld lichts i have the smiths acquaintance with his irons and so i could not believe that they would suffer their minister to marry a vagrant had it not been for this knowledge which made me fearful for margaret i would have done nothing to keep these two young people apart some to whom i have said this maintain that the egyptian turned my head at our first meeting such an argument is not perhaps worth controverting i admit that even now i straighten under the fire of a bright eye as a pensioner may salute when he sees a young officer in the shooting season should i chance to be leaning over my dyke while english sportsmen pass as is usually the case if i have seen them approaching i remember nought of them save that they call me she and end their greetings with whatever which waster lunny takes to be a southron mode of speech but their ladies dwell pleasantly in my memory from their engaging faces to the pretty crumpled thing dangling on their arms that is a hat or a basket i am seldom sure which the egyptians beauty therefore was a gladsome sight to me and none the less so that i had come upon it as unexpectedly as some men step into a bog had she been alone when i met her i cannot deny that i would have been content to look on her face without caring what was inside it but she was with her lover and that lover was gavin and so her face was to me as little for admiring as this glen in a thunderstorm when i know that some fellowcreature is lost on the hills  if however it was no quick liking for the gypsy that almost tempted me to leave these two lovers to each other what was it it was the warning of my own life adam dishart had torn my arm from margarets and i had not recovered the wrench in eighteen years rather than act his part between these two i felt tempted to tell them deplorable as the result may be if you who are a minister marry this vagabond it will be still more deplorable if you do not  but there was margaret to consider and at thought of her i cursed the egyptian aloud what could i do to keep gavin and the woman apart i could tell him the secret of his mothers life would that be sufficient it would if he loved margaret as i did not doubt pity for her would make him undergo any torture rather than she should suffer again but to divulge our old connection would entail her discovery of me and i questioned if even the saving of gavin could destroy the bitterness of that  i might appeal to the egyptian i might tell her even what i shuddered to tell him she cared for him i was sure well enough to have the courage to give him up but where was i to find her  were she and gavin meeting still perhaps the change which had come over the little minister meant that they had parted yet what i had heard him say to her on the hill warned me not to trust in any such solution of the trouble  boys play at casting a hummingtop into the midst of others on the ground and if well aimed it scatters them prettily i seemed to be playing such a game with my thoughts for each new one sent the others here and there and so what could i do in the end but fling my tops aside and return to the heeling of my boot  i was thus engaged when the sudden waking of the glen into life took me to my window there is seldom silence up here for if the wind be not sweeping the heather the quharity that i may not have heard for days seems to have crept nearer to the school house in the night and if both wind and water be out of earshot there is the crack of a gun or waster lunnys shepherd is on a stone near at hand whistling or a lamb is scrambling through a fence and kicking foolishly with its hind legs these sounds i am unaware of until they stop when i look up such a stillness was broken now by music  from my window i saw a string of people walking rapidly down the glen and waster lunny crossing his potatofield to meet them remembering that though i was in my stocking soles the ground was dry i hastened to join the farmer for i like to miss nothing i saw a curious sight in front of the little procession coming down the glen road and so much more impressive than his satellites that they may be put of mind as merely ploughman and the like following a show was a highlander that i knew to be lauchlan campbell one of the pipers engaged to lend music to the earls marriage he had the name of a thrawn man when sober but pretty at the pipes at both times and he came marching down the glen blowing gloriously as if he had the clan of campbell at his heels i know no man who is so capable on occasion of looking like twenty as a highland piper and never have i seen a face in such a blaze of passion as was lauchlan campbells that day his following were keeping out of his reach jumping back every time he turned round to shake his fist in the direction of the spittal while this magnificent man was yet some yards from us i saw waster lunny who had been in the middle of the road to ask questions fall back in fear and not being a fighting man myself i jumped the dyke lauchlan gave me a look that sent me farther into the field and strutted past shrieking defiance through his pipes until i lost him and his followers in a bend of the road  thats a terrifying spectacle i heard waster lunny say when the music had become but a distant squeal youre bonny at louping dykes dominie when there is a wild bull in front o you na i canna tell what has happened but at the least lauchlan maun hae dirked the earl thae loons cried out to me as they gaed by that he has been blawing awa at that tune till he canna halt what a winds in the crittur im thinking theres a hell in ilka highlandman  take care then waster lunny that you dinna licht it said an angry voice that made us jump though it was only duncan the farmers shepherd who spoke  i had forgotten you was a highlandman yoursel duncan waster lunny said nervously but elspeth who had come to us unnoticed ordered the shepherd to return to the hillside which he did haughtily  how did you no lay haud on that blast o wind lauchlan campbell asked elspeth of her husband and speir at him what had happened at the spittal a quarrel afore a marriage brings ill luck  im thinking said the farmer that rintouls making his ain ill luck by marrying on a young leddy  a mans never ower auld to marry said elspeth  no nor a woman rejoined waster lunny when she gets the chance but elspeth i believe i can guess what has fired that fearsome piper depend upon it somebody has been speaking disrespectful about the critturs ancestors  his ancestors exclaimed elspeth scornfully im thinking mine could hae bocht them at a crown the dozen  hoots said the farmer youre o a weaving stock and dinna understand about ancestors take a stick to a highland laddie and its no him you hurt but his ancestors likewise its his ancestors that stanes you for it when duncan stalked awa the now what think you he saw he saw a farmers wife dauring to order about his ancestors and if thats the way wi a shepherd what will it be wi a piper that has the kilts on him a day to mind him o his ancestors ilka time he looks down  elspeth retired to discuss the probable disturbance at the spittal with her family giving waster lunny the opportunity of saying to me impressively  man man has it never crossed you that its a queer thing the like o you and me having no ancestors ay we had them in a manner o speaking no doubt but theyre as completely lost sicht o as a flagon lid thats fallen ahint the dresser hech sirs but they would need a gey rubbing to get the rust off them now ive been thinking that if i was to get my laddies to say their grandfathers name a curran times ilka day like the catechism and they were to do the same wi their bairns and it was continued in future generations we micht raise a fell field o ancestors in time ay but elspeth wouldna hear ot nothing angers her mair than to hear me speak o planting trees for the benefit o them thats to be farmers here after me and as for ancestors she would howk them up as quick as i could plant them losh dominie is that a boot in your hand  to my mortification i saw that i had run out of the schoolhouse with the boot on my hand as if it were a glove and back i went straightway blaming myself for a man wanting in dignity it was but a minor trouble this however even at the time and to recall it later in the day was to look back on happiness for though i did not know it yet lauchlans playing raised the curtain on the great act of gavins life and the twentyfour hours had begun to which all i have told as yet is no more than the prologue     chapter xxvi  scene at the spittal   within an hour after i had left him waster lunny walked into the schoolhouse and handed me his snuffmull which i declined politely it was with this ceremony that we usually opened our conversations  ive seen the post he said and he tells me there has been a queer ploy at the spittal its a wonder the marriage hasna been turned into a burial and all because o that highland stirk lauchlan campbell  waster lunny was a man who had to retrace his steps in telling a story if he tried short cuts and so my custom was to wait patiently while he delved through the ploughed fields that always lay between him and his destination  as you ken rintouls so little o a scotchman that hes no muckle better than an englisher that maun be the reason he hadna mair sense than to tramp on a highlandmans ancestors as he tried to tramp on lauchlans this day  if lord rintoul insulted the piper i suggested giving the farmer a helping hand cautiously it would be through inadvertence rintoul only bought the spittal a year ago and until then i daresay he had seldom been on our side of the border  this was a foolish interruption for it set walter lunny off in a new direction  thats what elspeth says says she when the earl has grand estates in england what for does he come to a barren place like the spittal to be married its gey like she says as if he wanted the marriage to be got by quietly a thing says she that no woman can stand furthermore elspeth says how has the marriage been postponed twice we ken what the servants at the spittal says to that namely that the young lady is no keen to take him but elspeth winna listen to sic arguments she says either the earl had grown timid as mony a man does when the weddingday drew near or else his sister that keeps his house is mad at the thocht o losing her place but as for the young leddys being sweer says elspeth an earls an earl however auld he is and a lassies a lassie however young she is and weel she kens youre never sure o a mans no changing his mind about you till youre tied to him by law after which it doesna so muckle matter whether he changes his mind about you or no ay theres a quirk in it some gait dominie but its a deep water elspeth canna bottom  it is i agreed but you were to tell me what birse told you of the disturbance at the spittal  ay weel he answered the post puts the wite ot on her little leddyship as they call her though she winna be a leddyship till the morn all i can say is that if the earl was saft enough to do sic a thing out of fondness for her its time he was married on her so that he may come to his senses again thats what i say but elspeth conters me of course and says she if the young leddy was so careless o insulting other folks ancestors it proves she has nane o her ain for them that has china plates themsels is the maist careful no to break the china plates of others  but what was the insult was lauchlan dismissed na faags it was waur than that dominie youre dull in the uptake compared to elspeth i hadna telled her half the story afore she jaloused the rest however to begin again theres great feasting and rejoicings gaen on at the spittal the now and also a banquet which the post says is twa dinners in one weel theres a curran ogilvys among the guests and it was them that egged on her little leddyship to make the daring proposal to the earl what was the proposal it was no less than that the twa pipers should be ordered to play the bonny house o airlie dominie i wonder you can tak it so calm when you ken thats the ogilvys sang and that its aimed at the clan o campbell  pooh i said the ogilvys and the campbells used to be mortal enemies but the feud has been long forgotten  ay ive heard tell waster lunny said sceptically that airlie and argyle shakes hands now like christians but im thinking thats just afore the queen dinna speak now for im in the thick ot her little leddyship was all hinging in gold and jewels the which winna be her ain till the morn and she leans ower to the earl and whispers to him to get the pipers to play the bonny house he wasna willing for says he theres ogilvys at the table and ane o the pipers is a campbell and well better let sleeping dogs lie however the ogilvys lauched at his caution and he was so infatuated wi her little leddyship that he gae in and he cried out to the pipers to strike up the bonny house  waster lunny pulled his chair nearer me and rested his hand on my knees  dominie he said in a voice that fell now and again into a whisper them looking on swears that when lauchlan campbell heard these monstrous orders his face became ugly and black so that they kent in a jiffy what he would do its said a body jumped back frae him in a sudden dread except poor angus the other piper wha was busy tuning up for the bonny house weel angus had got no farther in the tune than the first skirl when lauchlan louped at him and ripped up the startled critturs pipes wi his dirk the pipes gae a roar o agony like a stuck swine and fell gasping on the floor what happened next was that lauchlan wi his dirk handy for onybody that micht try to stop him marched once round the table playing the campbells are coming and then straucht out o the spittal his chest far afore him and his head so weel back that he could see what was going on ahint frae the spittal to here he never stopped that fearsome tune and ise warrant hes blawing away at it at this moment through the streets o thrums  waster lunny was not in his usual spirits or he would have repeated his story before he left me for he had usually as much difficulty in coming to an end as in finding a beginning the drought was to him as serious a matter as death in the house and as little to be forgotten for a lengthened period  theres to be a prayermeeting for rain in the auld licit kirk the night he told me as i escorted him as far as my side of the quharity now almost a dead stream pitiable to see and im gaen though im sweer to leave thae puir cattle o mine you should see how they look at me when i gie them mair o that rotten grass to eat its eneuch to mak a man greet for what richt hae i to keep kye when i canna meat them  waster lunny has said to me more than once that the great surprise of his life was when elspeth was willing to take him many a time however i have seen that in him which might have made any weavers daughter proud of such a man and i saw it again when we came to the river side  im no ane o thae farmers he said truthfully thats aye girding at the weather and elspeth and me kens that we hae been dealt wi bountifully since we took this farm wi gey anxious hearts that woman dominie is eneuch to put a brave face on a coward and its no langer syne than yestreen when i was sitting in the dumps looking at the aurora borealis which i canna but regard as a messenger o woe that she put her hand on my shoulder and she says waster lunny twenty year syne we began life thegither wi nothing but the claethes on our back and an it please god we can begin it again for i hae you and you hae me and im no cast down if youre no dominie is there mony sic women in the warld as that  many a one i said  ay man it shamed me for i hae a kind o delight in angering elspeth just to see what shell say i could hae taen her on my knee at that minute but the bairns was there and so it wouldna hae dune but i cheered her up for after all the drought canna put us so far back as we was twenty years syne unless its true what my father said that the aurora borealis is the devils rainbow i saw it sax times in july month and it made me shut my een you was out admiring it dominie but i can never forget that it was seen in the year twelve just afore the great storm i was only a laddie then but i mind how that awful wind stripped a the standing corn in the glen in less time than weve been here at the waters edge it was called the deils besom my fathers hinmost words to me was its time eneuch to greet laddie when you see the aurora borealis i mind he was so complete ruined in an hour that he had to apply for relief frae the poors rates think o that and him a proud man he would tak nothing till one winter day when we was a starving and syne i gaed wi him to speir fort and he telled me to grip his hand ticht so that the cauldness o mine micht gie him courage they were doling out the charity in the towns house and i had never been int afore i canna look at it now without thinking o that day when me and my father gaed up the stair thegither mr duthie was presiding at the time and he wasna muckle older than mr dishart is now i mind he speired for proof that we was needing and my father couldna speak he just pointed at me but you have a good coat on your back yoursel mr duthie said for there were mony waiting sair needing it was lended him to come here i cried and without a word my father opened the coat and they saw he had nothing on aneath and his skin blue wi cauld dominie mr duthie handed him one shilling and saxpence and my fathers fingers closed greedily ont for a minute and syne it fell to the ground they put it back in his hand and it slipped out again and mr duthie gave it back to him saying are you so cauld as that but oh man it wasna cauld that did it but shame o being on the rates the blood a ran to my fathers head and syne left it as quick and he flung down the siller and walked out o the town house wi me running after him we warstled through that winter god kens how and its near a pleasure to me to think ot now for rain or no rain i can never be reduced to sic straits again  the farmer crossed the water without using the stilts which were no longer necessary and i little thought as i returned to the schoolhouse what terrible things were to happen before he could offer me his snuffmull again serious as his talk had been it was neither of drought nor of the incident at the spittal that i sat down to think my anxiety about gavin came back to me until i was like a man imprisoned between walls of his own building it may be that my presentiments of that afternoon look gloomier now than they were because i cannot return to them save over a night of agony black enough to darken any time connected with it perhaps my spirits only fell as the wind rose for wind ever takes me back to harvie and when i think of harvie my thoughts are of the saddest i know that i sat for some hours now seeing gavin pay the penalty of marrying the egyptian and again drifting back to my days with margaret until the wind took to playing tricks with me so that i heard adam dishart enter our home by the sea every time the schoolhouse door shook  i became used to the illusion after starting several times and thus when the door did open about seven oclock it was only the wind rushing to my fire like a shivering dog that made me turn my head then i saw the egyptian staring at me and though her sudden appearance on my threshold was a strange thing i forgot it in the whiteness of her face she was looking at me like one who has asked a question of life or death and stopped her heart for the reply  what is it i cried and for a moment i believe i was glad she did not answer she seemed to have told me already as much as i could bear  he has not heard she said aloud in an expressionless voice and turning would have slipped away without another word  is any one dead i asked seizing her hands and letting them fall they were so clammy she nodded and trying to speak could not  he is dead she said at last in a whisper mr dishart is dead and she sat down quietly  at that i covered my face crying god help margaret and then she rose saying fiercely so that i drew back from her there is no margaret he only cared for me  she is his mother i said hoarsely and then she smiled to me so that i thought her a harmless mad thing he was killed by a piper called lauchlan campbell she said looking up at me suddenly it was my fault  poor margaret i wailed  and poor babbie she entreated pathetically will no one say poor babbie     chapter xxvii  first journey of the dominie to thrums during the twentyfour hours   how did it happen i asked more than once but the egyptian was only with me in the body and she did not hear i might have been talking to some one a mile away whom a telescope had drawn near my eyes  when i put on my bonnet however she knew that i was going to thrums and she rose and walked to the door looking behind to see that i followed  you must not come i said harshly but her hand started to her heart as if i had shot her and i added quickly come we were already some distance on our way before i repeated my question  what matter how it happened she answered piteously and they were words of which i felt the force but when she said a little later i thought you would say it is not true i took courage and forced her to tell me all she knew she sobbed while she spoke if one may sob without tears  i heard of it at the spittal she said the news broke out suddenly there that the piper had quarrelled with some one in thrums and that in trying to separate them mr dishart was stabbed there is no doubt of its truth  we should have heard of it here i said hopefully before the news reached the spittal it cannot be true  it was brought to the spittal she answered by the hill road  then my spirits sank again for i knew that this was possible there is a path steep but short across the hills between thrums and the top of the glen which mr glendinning took frequently when he had to preach at both places on the same sabbath it is still called the ministers road  yet if the earl had believed it he would have sent some one into thrums for particulars i said grasping at such comfort as i could make  he does believe it she answered he told me of it himself  you see the egyptian was careless of her secret now but what was that secret to me an hour ago it would have been much and already it was not worth listening to if she had begun to tell me why lord rintoul took a gypsy girl into his confidence i should not have heard her  i ran quickly she said even if a messenger was sent he might be behind me  was it her words or the tramp of a horse that made us turn our heads at that moment i know not but far back in a twist of the road we saw a horseman approaching at such a reckless pace that i thought he was on a runaway we stopped instinctively and waited for him and twice he disappeared in hollows of the road and then was suddenly tearing down upon us i recognised in him young mr mckenzie a relative of rintoul and i stretched out my arms to compel him to draw up he misunderstood my motive and was raising his whip threateningly when he saw the egyptian it is not too much to say that he swayed in the saddle the horse galloped on though he had lost hold of the reins he looked behind until he rounded a corner and i never saw such amazement mixed with incredulity on a human face for some minutes i expected to see him coming back but when he did not i said wonderingly to the egyptian  he knew you  did he she answered indifferently and i think we spoke no more until we were in windyghoul soon we were barely conscious of each others presence never since have i walked between the school house and thrums in so short a time nor seen so little on the way  in the egyptians eyes i suppose was a picture of gavin lying dead but if her grief had killed her thinking faculties mine that was only less keen because i had been struck down once before had set all the wheels of my brain in action for it seemed to me that the hour had come when i must disclose myself to margaret  i had realised always that if such a necessity did arise it could only be caused by gavins premature death or by his proving a bad son to her some may wonder that i could have looked calmly thus far into the possible but i reply that the night of adam disharts homecoming had made of me a man whom the future could not surprise again though i saw gavin and his mother happy in our auld licht manse that did not prevent my considering the contingencies which might leave her without a son in the school house i had brooded over them as one may think over moves on a draughtboard it may have been idle but it was done that i might know how to act best for margaret if any thing untoward occurred the time for such action had come gavins death had struck me hard but it did not crush me i was not unprepared i was going to margaret now  what did i see as i walked quickly along the glen road with babbie silent by my side and i doubt not pods of the broom cracking all around us i saw myself entering the auld licht manse where margaret sat weeping over the body of gavin and there was none to break my coming to her for none but she and i knew what had been  i saw my margaret again so fragile now so thin the wrists her hair turned grey no nearer could i go but stopped at the door grieving for her and at last saying her name aloud  i saw her raise her face and look upon me for the first time for eighteen years she did not scream at sight of me for the body of her son lay between us and bridged the gulf that adam dishart had made  i saw myself draw near her reverently and say margaret he is dead and that is why i have come back and i saw her put her arms around my neck as she often did long ago  but it was not to be never since that night at harvie have i spoken to margaret  the egyptian and i were to come to windyghoul before i heard her speak she was not addressing me here gavin and she had met first and she was talking of that meeting to herself  it was there i heard her say softly as she gazed at the bush beneath which she had seen him shaking his fist at her on the night of the riots a little farther on she stopped where a path from windyghoul sets off for the well in the wood she looked up it wistfully and there i left her behind and pressed on to the mudhouse to ask nanny webster if the minister was dead nannys gate was swinging in the wind but her door was shut and for a moment i stood at it like a coward afraid to enter and hear the worst  the house was empty i turned from it relieved as if i had got a respite and while i stood in the garden the egyptian came to me shuddering her twitching face asking the question that would not leave her lips  there is no one in the house i said nanny is perhaps at the well  but the gypsy went inside and pointing to the fire said it has been out for hours do you not see the murder has drawn every one into thrums  so i feared a dreadful night was to pass before i knew that this was the day of the release of sanders webster and that frail nanny had walked into tilliedrum to meet him at the prison gate  babbie sank upon a stool so weak that i doubt whether she heard me tell her to wait there until my return i hurried into thrums not by the hill though it is the shorter way but by the roods for i must hear all before i ventured to approach the manse from windyghoul to the top of the roods it is a climb and then a steep descent the road has no sooner reached its highest point than it begins to fall in the straight line of houses called the roods and thus i came upon a full view of the street at once a cart was laboring up it there were women sitting on stones at their doors and girls playing at palaulays and out of the house nearest me came a black figure my eyes failed me i was asking so much from them they made him tall and short and spare and stout so that i knew it was gavin and yet looking again feared but all the time i think i knew it was he     chapter xxviii  the hill before darkness fellscene of the impending catastrophe   you are better now i heard gavin ask presently  he thought that having been taken ill suddenly i had waved to him for help because he chanced to be near with all my wits about me i might have left him in that belief for rather would i have deceived him than had him wonder why his welfare seemed so vital to me but i who thought the capacity for being taken aback had gone from me clung to his arm and thanked god audibly that he still lived he did not tell me then how my agitation puzzled him but led me kindly to the hill where we could talk without listeners by the time we reached it i was again wary and i had told him what had brought me to thrums without mentioning how the story of his death reached my ears or through whom  mr mckenzie he said interrupting me galloped all the way from the spittal on the same errand however no one has been hurt much except the piper himself  then he told me how the rumor arose  you know of the incident at the spittal and that campbell marched off in high dudgeon i understand that he spoke to no one between the spittal and thrums but by the time he arrived here he was more communicative yes and thirstier he was treated to drink in several publichouses by persons who wanted to hear his story and byandby he began to drop hints of knowing something against the earls bride do you know rob dow  yes i answered and what you have done for him  ah sir he said sighing for a long time i thought i was to be gods instrument in making a better man of rob but my power over him went long ago ten short months of the ministry takes some of the vanity out of a man  looking sideways at him i was startled by the unnatural brightness of his eyes unconsciously he had acquired the habit of pressing his teeth together in the pauses of his talk shutting them on some woe that would proclaim itself as men do who keep their misery to themselves  a few hours ago he went on i heard robs voice in altercation as i passed the bull tavern and i had a feeling that if i failed with him so should i fail always throughout my ministry i walked into the publichouse and stopped at the door of a room in which dow and the piper were sitting drinking i heard rob saying fiercely if what you say about her is true highlandman shes the woman ive been looking for this half year and mair what is she like i guessed from what i had been told of the piper that they were speaking of the earls bride but rob saw me and came to an abrupt stop saying to his companion dinna say another word about her afore the minister rob would have come away at once in answer to my appeal but the piper was drunk and would not be silenced ill tell the minister about her too he began you dinna ken what youre doing rob roared and then as if to save my ears from scandal at any cost he struck campbell a heavy blow on the mouth i tried to intercept the blow with the result that i fell and then some one ran out of the tavern crying hes killed the piper had been stunned but the story went abroad that he had stabbed me for interfering with him that is really all nothing as you know can overtake an untruth if it has a minutes start  where is campbell now  sleeping off the effect of the blow but dow has fled he was terrified at the shouts of murder and ran off up the west town end the doctors dogcart was standing at a door there and rob jumped into it and drove off they did not chase him far because he is sure to hear the truth soon and then doubtless he will come back  though in a few hours we were to wonder at our denseness neither gavin nor i saw why dow had struck the highlander down rather than let him tell his story in the ministers presence one moments suspicion would have lit our way to the whole truth but of the spring to all robs behavior in the past eight months we were ignorant and so to gavin the bull had only been the scene of a drunken brawl while i forgot to think in the joy of finding him alive  i have a prayermeeting for rain presently gavin said breaking a picture that had just appeared unpleasantly before me of babbie still in agony at nannys but before i leave you tell me why this rumor caused you such distress  the question troubled me and i tried to avoid it crossing the hill we had by this time drawn near a hollow called the toads hole then gay and noisy with a caravan of gypsies they were those same wild lindsays for whom gavin had searched caddam one eventful night and as i saw them crowding round their king a man well known to me i guessed what they were at  mr dishart i said abruptly would you like to see a gypsy marriage one is taking place there just now that big fellow is the king and he is about to marry two of his people over the tongs the ceremony will not detain us five minutes though the rejoicings will go on all night  i have been present at more than one gypsy wedding in my time and at the wild weird orgies that followed them but what is interesting to such as i may not be for a ministers eyes and frowning at my proposal gavin turned his back upon the toads hole then as we recrossed the hill to get away from the din of the camp i pointed out to him that the report of his death had brought mckenzie to thrums as well as me  as soon as mckenzie heard i was not dead he answered he galloped off to the spittal without ever seeing me i suppose he posted back to be in time for the nights rejoicings there so you see it was no solicitude for me that brought him he came because a servant at the spittal was supposed to have done the deed  well mr dishart i had to say why should deny that i have a warm regard for you you have done brave work in our town  it has been little he replied with gods help it will be more in future  he meant that he had given time to his sad love affair that he owed to his people of seeing babbit again i saw that he had given up hope instead of repining he was devoting his whole soul to gods work i was proud of him and yet i grieved for i could no think that god wanted him to bury his youth so soon  i had thought he confessed to me that you were one of those who did not like my preaching  you were mistaken i said gravely i dared not tell him that except his mother none would have saw under him so eagerly as i  nevertheless he said you were a member of the auld licht church in mr carfraes time and you left it when i came  i heard your first sermon i said  ah he replied i had not been long in thrums before i discovered that if i took tea with any of my congregation and declined a second cup they thought it a reflection on their brewing  you must not look upon my absence in that light was all i could say there are reasons why i cannot come  he did not press me further thinking i meant that the distance was too great though frailer folk than i walked twenty miles to hear him we might have parted thus had we not wandered by chance to the very spot where i had met him and babbie there is a seat there now for those who lose their breath on the climb up and so i have two reasons nowadays for not passing the place by  we read each others thoughts and gavin said calmly i have not seen her since that night she disappeared as into a grave  how could i answer when i knew that babbie was dying for want of him not half a mile away  you seemed to understand everything that night he went on or if you did not your thoughts were very generous to me  in my sorrow for him i did not notice that we were moving on again this time in the direction of windyghoul  she was only a gypsy girl he said abruptly and i nodded but i hoped he continued that she would be my wife  i understood that i said  there was nothing monstrous to you he asked looking me in the face in a ministers marrying a gypsy  i own that if i had loved a girl however far below or above me in degree i would have married her had she been willing to take me but to gavin i only answered these are matters a man must decide for himself  i had decided for myself he said emphatically  yet i said wanting him to talk to me of margaret in such a case one might have others to consider besides himself  a mans marriage he answered is his own affair i would have brooked no interference from my congregation  i thought there is some obstinacy left in him still but aloud i said it was of your mother i was thinking  she would have taken babbie to her heart he said with the fond conviction of a lover  i doubted it but i only asked your mother knows nothing of her  nothing he rejoined it would be cruelty to tell my mother of her now that she is gone  gavins calmness had left him and he was striding quickly nearer to windyghoul i was in dread lest he should see the egyptian at nannys door yet to have turned him in another direction might have roused his suspicions when we were within a hundred yards of the mudhouse i knew that there was no babbie in sight we halved the distance and then i saw her at the open window gavins eyes were on the ground but she saw him i held my breath fearing that she would run out to him  you have never seen her since that night gavin asked me without hope in his voice  had he been less hopeless he would have wondered why i did not reply immediately i was looking covertly at the mudhouse of which we were now within a few yards babbies face had gone from the window and the door remained shut that she could hear every word we uttered now i could not doubt but she was hiding from the man for whom her soul longed she was sacrificing herself for him  never i answered notwithstanding my pity of the brave girl and then while i was shaking lest he should go in to visit nanny i heard the echo of the auld licht bell  that calls me to the meeting for rain gavin said bidding me goodnight i had acted for margaret and yet i had hardly the effrontery to take his hand i suppose he saw sympathy in my face for suddenly the cry broke from him  if i could only know that nothing evil had befallen her  babbie heard him and could not restrain a heartbreaking sob  what was that he said starting  a moment i waited to let her show herself if she chose but the mudhouse was silent again  it was some boy in the wood i answered  goodbye he said trying to smile  had i let him go here would have been the end of his love story but that piteous smile unmanned me and i could not keep the words back  she is in nannys house i cried  in another moment these two were together for weal or woe and i had set off dizzily for the schoolhouse feeling now that i had been false to margaret and again exulting in what i had done by and by the bell stopped and gavin and babbie regarded it as little as i heeded the burns now crossing the glen road noisily at places that had been dry two hours before     chapter xxix  story of the egyptian   god gives us more than were we not overbold we should dare to ask for and yet how often perhaps after saying thank god so curtly that it is only a form of swearing we are suppliants again within the hour gavin was to be satisfied if he were told that no evil had befallen her he loved and all the way between the schoolhouse and windyghoul babbie craved for no more than gavins life now they had got their desires but do you think they were content  the egyptian had gone on her knees when she heard gavin speak of her it was her way of preventing herself from running to him then when she thought him gone he opened the door she rose and shrank back but first she had stepped toward him with a glad cry his disappointed arms met on nothing  you too heard that i was dead he said thinking her strangeness but grief too sharply turned to joy  there were tears in the word with which she answered him and he would have kissed her but she defended her face with her hand  babbie he asked beginning to fear that he had not sounded her deepest woe why have you left me all this time you are not glad to see me now  i was glad she answered in a low voice to see you from the window but i prayed to god not to let you see me  she even pulled away her hand when he would have taken it no no i am to tell you everything now and then  say that you love me first he broke in when a sob checked her speaking  no she said i must tell you first what i have done and then you will not ask me to say that i am not a gypsy  what of that cried gavin it was not because you were a gypsy that i loved you  that is the last time you will say you love me said babbie mr dishart i am to be married tomorrow  she stopped afraid to say more lest he should fall but except that his arms twitched he did not move  i am to be married to lord rintoul she went on now you know who i am  she turned from him for his piercing eyes frightened her never again she knew would she see the lovelight in them he plucked himself from the spot where he had stood looking at her and walked to the window when he wheeled round there was no anger on his face only a pathetic wonder that he had been deceived so easily it was at himself that he was smiling grimly rather than at her and the change pained babbie as no words could have hurt her he sat down on a chair and waited for her to go on  dont look at me she said and i will tell you everything he dropped his eyes listlessly and had he not asked her a question from time to time she would have doubted whether he heard her  after all she said a gypsy dress is my birthright and so the thrums people were scarcely wrong in calling me an egyptian it is a pity any one insisted on making me something different i believe i could have been a good gypsy  who were your parents gavin asked without looking up  you ask that she said because you have a good mother it is not a question that would occur to me my motherif she was bad may not that be some excuse for me ah but i have no wish to excuse myself have you seen a gypsy cart with a sort of hammock swung beneath it in which gypsy children are carried about the country if there are no children the pots and pans are stored in it unless the roads are rough it makes a comfortable cradle and it was the only one i ever knew well one day i suppose the road was rough for i was capsized i remember picking myself up after a little and running after the cart but they did not hear my cries i sat down by the roadside and stared after the cart until i lost sight of it that was in england and i was not three years old  but surely gavin said they came back to look for you  so far as i know babbie answered hardly they did not come back i have never seen them since i think they were drunk my only recollection of my mother is that she once took me to see the dead body of some gypsy who had been murdered she told me to dip my hand in the blood so that i could say i had done so when i became a woman it was meant as a treat to me and is the one kindness i am sure i got from her curiously enough i felt the shame of her deserting me for many years afterwards as a child i cried hysterically at thought of it it pained me when i was at school in edinburgh every time i saw the other girls writing home i cannot think of it without a shudder even now it is what makes me worse than other women  her voice had altered and she was speaking passionately  sometimes she continued more gently i try to think that my mother did come back for me and then went away because she heard i was in better hands than hers it was lord rintoul who found me and i owe everything to him you will say that he has no need to be proud of me he took me home on his horse and paid his gardeners wife to rear me she was scotch and that is why i can speak two languages it was he too who sent me to school in edinburgh  he has been very kind to you said gavin who would have preferred to dislike the earl  so kind answered babbie that now he is to marry me but do you know why he has done all this  now again she was agitated and spoke indignantly  it is all because i have a pretty face she said her bosom rising and falling men think of nothing else he had no pity for the deserted child i knew that while i was yet on his horse when he came to the gardeners afterwards it was not to give me some one to love it was only to look upon what was called my beauty i was merely a picture to him and even the gardeners children knew it and sought to terrify me by saying you are losing your looks the earl will not care for you any more sometimes he brought his friends to see me because i was such a lovely child and if they did not agree with him on that point he left without kissing me throughout my whole girlhood i was taught nothing but to please him and the only way to do that was to be pretty it was the only virtue worth striving for the others were never thought of when he asked how i was getting on once i had fever and nearly died yet this knowledge that my face was everything was implanted in me so that my fear lest he should think me ugly when i recovered terrified me into hysterics i dream still that i am in that fever and all my fears return he did think me ugly when he saw me next i remember the incident so well still i had run to him and he was lifting me up to kiss me when he saw that my face had changed what a cruel disappointment he said and turned his back on me i had given him a childs love until then but from that day i was hard and callous  and when was it you became beautiful again gavin asked by no means in the mind to pay compliments  a year passed she continued before i saw him again in that time he had not asked for me once and the gardener had kept me out of charity it was by an accident that we met and at first he did not know me then he said why babbie i believe you are to be a beauty after all i hated him for that and stalked away from him but he called after me bravo she walks like a queen and it was because i walked like a queen that he sent me to an edinburgh school he used to come to see me every year and as i grew up the girls called me lady rintoul he was not fond of me he is not fond of me now he would as soon think of looking at the back of a picture as at what i am apart from my face but he dotes on it and is to marry it is that love long before i left school which was shortly before you came to thrums he had told his sister that he was determined to marry me and she hated me for it making me as uncomfortable as she could so that i almost looked forward to the marriage because it would be such a humiliation to her  in admitting this she looked shamefacedly at gavin and then went on  it is humiliating him too i understand him he would like not to want to marry me for he is ashamed of my origin but he cannot help it it is this feeling that has brought him here so that the marriage may take place where my history is not known  the secret has been well kept gavin said for they have failed to discover it even in thrums  some of the spittal servants suspect it nevertheless babbie answered though how much they know i cannot say he has not a servant now either here or in england who knew me as a child the gardener who befriended me was sent away long ago lord rintoul looks upon me as a disgrace to him that he cannot live without  i dare say he cares for you more than you think gavin said gravely  he is infatuated about my face or the pose of my head or something of that sort babbie said bitterly or he would not have endured me so long i have twice had the wedding postponed chiefly i believe to enrage my natural enemy his sister who is as much aggravated by my reluctance to marry him as by his desire to marry me however i also felt that imprisonment for life was approaching as the day drew near and i told him that if he did not defer the wedding i should run away he knows i am capable of it for twice i ran away from school if his sister only knew that  for a moment it was the old babbie gavin saw but her glee was shortlived and she resumed sedately  they were kind to me at school but the life was so dull and prim that i ran off in a gypsy dress of my own making that is what it is to have gypsy blood in one i was away for a week the first time wandering the country alone telling fortunes dancing and singing in woods and sleeping in barns i am the only woman in the world well brought up who is not afraid of mice or rats that is my gypsy blood again after that wild week i went back to the school of my own will and no one knows of the escapade but my schoolmistress and lord rintoul the second time however i was detected singing in the street and then my future husband was asked to take me away yet miss feversham cried when i left and told me that i was the nicest girl she knew as well as the nastiest she said she should love me as soon as i was not one of her boarders  and then you came to the spittal  yes and lord rintoul wanted me to say i was sorry for what i had done but i told him i need not say that for i was sure to do it again as you know i have done it several times since then and though i am a different woman since i knew you i dare say i shall go on doing it at times all my life you shake your head because you do not understand it is not that i make up my mind to break out in that way i may not have had the least desire to do it for weeks and then suddenly when i am out riding or at dinner or at a dance the craving to be a gypsy again is so strong that i never think of resisting it i would risk my life to gratify it yes whatever my life in the future is to be i know that must be a part of it i used to pretend at the spittal that i had gone to bed and then escape by the window i was mad with glee at those times but i always returned before morning except once the last time i saw you when i was away for nearly twentyfour hours lord rintoul was so glad to see me come back then that he almost forgave me for going away there is nothing more to tell except that on the night of the riot it was not my gypsy nature that brought me to thrums but a desire to save the poor weavers i had heard lord rintoul and the sheriff discussing the contemplated raid i have hidden nothing from you in time perhaps i shall have suffered sufficiently for all my wickedness  gavin rose weariedly and walked through the mudhouse looking at her  this is the end of it all he said harshly coming to a standstill i loved you babbie  no she answered shaking her head you never knew me until now and so it was not me you loved i know what you thought i was and i will try to be it now  if you had only told me this before the minister said sadly it might not have been too late  i only thought you like all the other men i knew she replied until the night i came to the manse it was only my face you admired at first  no it was never that gavin said with such conviction that her mouth opened in alarm to ask him if he did not think her pretty she did not speak however and he continued you must have known that i loved you from the first night  no you only amused me she said like one determined to stint nothing of the truth even at the well i laughed at your vows  this wounded gavin afresh wretched as her story had made him and he said tragically you have never cared for me at all  oh always always she answered since i knew what love was and it was you who taught me  even in his misery he held his head high with pride at least she did love him  and then babbie said hiding her face i could not tell you what i was because i knew you would loathe me i could only go away  she looked at him forlornly through her tears and then moved toward the door he had sunk upon a stool his face resting on the table and it was her intention to slip away unnoticed but he heard the latch rise and jumping up said sharply babbie i cannot give you up  she stood in tears swinging the door unconsciously with her hand  dont say that you love me still she cried and then letting her hand fall from the door added imploringly oh gavin do you     chapter xxx  the meeting for rain   meanwhile the auld lichts were in church waiting for their minister and it was a full meeting because nearly every well in thrums had been scooped dry by anxious palms yet not all were there to ask gods rain for themselves old charles yuill was in his pew after dreaming thrice that he would break up with the drought and bell christison had come though her man lay dead at home and she thought it could matter no more to her how things went in the world  you who do not love that little congregation would have said that they were waiting placidly but probably so simple a woman as meggy rattray could have deceived you into believing that because her eyes were downcast she did not notice who put the threepenny bit in the plate a few men were unaware that the bell was working overtime most of them farmers with their eyes on the windows but all the women at least were wondering they knew better however than to bring their thoughts to their faces and none sought to catch anothers eye the menfolk looked heavily at their hats in the seats in front even when hendry munn instead of marching to the pulpit with the big bible in his hands came as far as the plate and signed to peter tosh elder that he was wanted in the vestry you could not have guessed how every woman there except bell christison wished she was peter tosh peter was so taken aback that he merely gaped at hendry until suddenly he knew that his five daughters were furious with him when he dived for his hat and staggered to the vestry with his mouth open his boots cheeped all the way but no one looked up  i hadna noticed the minister was lang in coming waster lunny told me afterward but elspeth noticed it and with a quickness that baffles me she saw i was thinking o other things so she let out her foot at me i gae a low cough to let her ken i wasna sleeping but in a minute out goes her foot again ay syne i thocht i micht hae dropped my hanky into snecky hobarts pew but no it was in my tails yet her hand was on the board and she was working her fingers in a way that i kent meant she would like to shake me next i looked to see if i was sitting on her frock the which tries a woman sair but i wasna does she want to change bibles wi me i wondered or is she sliding yont a peppermint to me it was neither so i edged as far frae her as i could gang weel would you credit it i saw her body coming nearer me inch by inch though she was looking straucht afore her till she was within kick o me and then out again goes her foot at that dominie i lost patience and i whispered fiercelike keep your foot to yoursel you limmer ay her intent you see was to waken me to what was gaen on but i couldna be expected to ken that  in the vestry hendry munn was now holding counsel with three elders of whom the chief was lang tammas  the laddie i sent to the manse hendry said canna be back this five minutes and the question is how were to fill up that time ill ring no langer for the bell has been in a passion ever since a quarterpast eight its as sweer to clang past the quarter as a horse to gallop by its stable  you could gang to your box and gie out a psalm tammas suggested john spens  and would a psalm sung wi sic an object retorted the precentor mount higher think you than a bairns kite ill insult the almighty to screen no minister  youre screening him better by standing whaur you are said the imperturbable hendry for as lang as you dinna show your face theyll think it may be you thats missing instead o mr dishart  indeed gavins appearance in church without the precentor would have been as surprising as tammass without the minister as certainly as the shutting of a moneybox is followed by the turning of the key did the precentor walk stiffly from the vestry to his box a toll of the bell in front of the minister tammass halfpenny rang in the plate as gavin passed tnowheads pew and gavins sixpence with the snappingto of the precentors door the two men might have been connected by a string that tightened at ten yards  the congregation ken me ower weel tammas said to believe i would keep the lord waiting  and they are as sure o mr dishart rejoined spens with spirit though he feared the precentor on sabbaths and at prayer meetings youre a hard man  i speak the blunt truth whamond answered  ay said spens and to tak credit for that may be like blawing that youre ower honest to wear claethes  hendry who had gone to the door returned now with the information that mr dishart had left the manse two hours ago to pay visits meaning to come to the prayermeeting before he returned home  theres a quirk in this hendry said tosh was it mistress dishart the laddie saw  no hendry replied it was jean she canna get to the meeting because the mistress is nervous in the manse by herself and jean didna like to tell her that hes missing for fear o alarming her what are we to do now  hes an unfaithful shepherd cried the precentor while hendry again went out i see it written on the walls  i dinna said spens doggedly  because retorted tammas having eyes you see not  tammas i aye thocht you was fond o mr dishart  if my right eye were to offend me answered the precentor i would pluck it out i suppose you think and baith o you farmers too that theres no necessity for praying for rain the nicht youll be content will ye if mr dishart just drops in to the kirk some day accidentallike and offers up a bit prayer  as for the rain spens said triumphantly i wouldna wonder though its here afore the minister you canna deny peter tosh that theres been a smell o rain in the air this twa hours back  john peter said agitatedly dinna speak so confidently ive kent it he whispered since the day turned but it wants to tak us by surprise lad and so im no letting on  see that you dinna make an idol o the rain thundered whamond your thochts is no wi him but wi the clouds and whaur your thochts are there will your prayers stick also  if you saw my lambs tosh began and then ashamed of himself said looking upward he holds the rain in the hollow of his hand  and hes closing his neive ticht ont again said the precentor solemnly hearken to the wind rising  god help me cried tosh wringing his hands is it fair think you he said passionately addressing the sky to show your wrath wi mr dishart by ruining my neeps  you were richt tammas whamond spens said growing hard as he listened to the wind the sanctuary o the lord has been profaned this nicht by him wha should be the chief pillar o the building  they were lowering brows that greeted hendry when he returned to say that mr dishart had been seen last on the hill with the glen quharity dominie  some thinks said the kirk officer that hes awa hunting for rob dow  nothingll excuse him replied spens short o his having fallen over the quarry  hendrys was usually a blank face but it must have looked troubled now for tosh was about to say hendry youre keeping something back when the precentor said it before him  wi that story o mr disharts murder no many hours auld yet the kirk officer replied evasively we should be wary o trusting gossip  what hae you heard  its through the town hendry answered that a woman was wi the dominie  a woman cried tosh the woman theres been sic talk about in connection wi the minister whaur are they now  its no kent butthe dominie was seen goin hame by himsel  leaving the minister and her thegither cried the three men at once  hendry munn tammas said sternly theres mair about this wha is the woman  they are liars hendry answered and shut his mouth tight  gie her a name i say the precentor ordered or as chief elder of this kirk supported by mair than half o the session i command you to lift your hat and go  hendry gave an appealing look to tosh and spens but the precentors solemnity had cowed them  they say then he answered sullenly that its the egyptian yes and i believe they ken  the two farmers drew back from this statement incredulously but tammas whamond jumped at the kirk officers throat and some who were in the church that night say they heard hendry scream then the precentors fingers relaxed their grip and he tottered into the middle of the room  hendry he pleaded holding out his arms pathetically tak back these words oh man have pity and tak them back  but hendry would not and then lang tammass mouth worked convulsively and he sobbed crying nobody kent it but mair than mortal son o god i did love the lad  so seldom in a lifetime had any one seen into this mans heart that spens said amazed  tammas tammas whamond its no like you to break down  the rusty door of whamonds heart swung to  who broke down he asked fiercely let no member of this session dare to break down till his work be done  what work tosh said uneasily we canna interfere  i would rather resign spens said but shook when whamond hurled these words at him  and jesus said unto him no man having put his hand to the plough and looking back is fit for the kingdom of god  it mayna be true hendry said eagerly  well soon see  he would gie her up said tosh  peter tosh answered whamond sternly i call upon you to dismiss the congregation  should we no rather haud the meeting oursels  we have other work afore us replied the precentor  but what can i say tosh asked nervously should i offer up a prayer  i warn you all broke in hendry that though the congregation is sitting there quietly theyll be tigers for the meaning o this as soon as theyre in the street  let no ontruth be telled them said the precentor peter tosh do your duty john spens remain wi me  the church emptied silently but a buzz of excitement arose outside many persons tried to enter the vestry but were ordered away and when tosh joined his fellowelders the people were collecting in animated groups in the square or scattering through the wynds for news  and now said the precentor i call upon the three o you to come wi me hendry munn you gang first  i maun bide ahint hendry said with a sudden fear to lock up the kirk  ill lock up the kirk whamond answered harshly  you maun gie me the keys though entreated the kirk officer  ill take care o the keys said whamond  i maun hae them hendry said to open the kirk on sabbath  the precentor locked the doors and buttoned up the keys in his trousers pockets  wha kens he said in a voice of steel that the kirkll be open next sabbath  hae some mercy on him tamtnas spens implored hes no twa andtwenty  wha kens continued the precentor but that the next time this kirk is opened will be to preach it toom  what road do we tak  the road to the hill whaur he was seen last     chapter xxxi  various bodies converging on the hill   it would be coming on for a quarterpast nine and a misty night when i reached the schoolhouse and i was so weary of mind and body that i sat down without taking off my bonnet i had left the door open and i remember listlessly watching the wind making a target of my candle but never taking a sufficiently big breath to do more than frighten it from this lethargy i was roused by the sound of wheels  in the daytime our glen road leads to many parts but in the night only to the doctors then the gallop of a horse makes farmers start up in bed and cry whos ill i went to my door and listened to the trap coming swiftly down the lonely glen but i could not see it for there was a trailing scarf of mist between the schoolhouse and the road presently i heard the swish of the wheels in water and so learned that they were crossing the ford to come to me i had been unstrung by the events of the evening and fear at once pressed thick upon me that this might be a sequel to them as indeed it was  while still out of sight the trap stopped and i heard some one jump from it then came this conversation as distinct as though it had been spoken into my ear  can you see the schoolhouse now mckenzie  i am groping for it rintoul the mist seems to have made off with the path  where are you mckenzie i have lost sight of you  it was but a ribbon of mist and as these words were spoken mckenzie broke through it i saw him though to him i was only a stone at my door  i have found the house rintoul he shouted and there is a light in it so that the fellow has doubtless returned  then wait a moment for me  stay where you are rintoul i entreat you and leave him to me he may recognize you  no no mckenzie i am sure he never saw me before i insist on accompanying you  your excitement rintoul will betray you let me go alone i can question him without rousing his suspicions remember she is only a gypsy to him  he will learn nothing from me i am quite calm now  rintoul i warn you your manner will betray you and tomorrow it will be roared through the countryside that your bride ran away from the spittal in a gypsy dress and had to be brought back by force  the altercation may have lasted another minute but the suddenness with which i learned babbies secret had left my ears incapable of learning more i daresay the two men started when they found me at my door but they did not remember as few do remember who have the noisy day to forget it in how far the voice carries in the night  they came as suddenly on me as i on them for though they had given unintentional notice of their approach i had lost sight of the speakers in their amazing words only a moment did young mckenzies anxiety to be spokesman give me to regard lord rintoul i saw that he was a thin man and tall straight in the figure but his head began to sink into his shoulders and not very steady on them his teeth had grip of his underlip as if this was a method of controlling his agitation and he was opening and shutting his hands restlessly he had a dog with him which i was to meet again  well met mr ogilvy said mckenzie who knew me slightly having once acted as judge at a cockfight in the schoolhouse we were afraid we should have to rouse you  you will step inside i asked awkwardly and while i spoke i was wondering how long it would be before the earls excitement broke out  it is not necessary mckenzie answered hurriedly my friend and i this is mr mcclure have been caught in the mist without a lamp and we thought you could perhaps favor us with one  unfortunately i have nothing of the kind i said and the state of mind i was in is shown by my answering seriously  then we must wish you a goodnight and manage as best we can he said and then before he could touch with affected indifference on the real object of their visit the alarmed earl said angrily mckenzie no more of this  no more of this delay do you mean mcclure asked mckenzie and then turning to me said by the way mr ogilvy i think this is our second meeting tonight i met you on the road a few hours ago with your wife or was it your daughter  it was neither mr mckenzie i answered with the calmness of one not yet recovered from a shock it was a gypsy girl  where is she now cried rintoul feverishly but mckenzie speaking loudly at the same time tried to drown his interference as one obliterates writing by writing over it  a strange companion for a schoolmaster he said what became of her  i left her near caddam wood i replied but she is probably not there now  ah they are strange creatures these gypsies he said casting a warning look at the earl now i wonder where she had been bound for  there is a gypsy encampment on the hill i answered though i cannot say why  she is there exclaimed rintoul and was done with me  i daresay mckenzie said indifferently however it is nothing to us goodnight sir  the earl had started for the trap but mckenzies salute reminded him of a forgotten courtesy and despite his agitation he came back to apologize i admired him for this then my thoughtlessness must needs mar all  goodnight mr mckenzie i said goodnight lord rintoul  i had addressed him by his real name never a turnip fell from a bumping laden cart and the driver more unconscious of it than i that i had dropped that word i reentered the house but had not reached my chair when mckenzies hand fell roughly on me and i was swung round  mr ogilvy he said the more savagely i doubt not because his passions had been chained so long you know more than you would have us think beware sir of recognising that gypsy should you ever see her again in different attire i advise you to have forgotten this night when you waken tomorrow morning  with a menacing gesture he left me and i sank into a chair glad to lose sight of the glowering eyes with which he had pinned me to the wall i did not hear the trap cross the ford and renew its journey when i looked out next the night had fallen very dark and the glen was so deathly in its drowsiness that i thought not even the cry of murder could tear its eyes open  the earl and mckenzie would be some distance still from the hill when the officebearers had scoured it in vain for their minister the gypsies now dancing round their fires to music that on ordinary occasions lang tammas would have stopped by using his fists to the glory of god had seen no minister they said and disbelieved in the existence of the mysterious egyptian  liars they are to trade spens declared to his companions but now and again they speak truth like a standing clock and im beginning to think the ministers lassie was invented in the square  not so said the precentor for we saw her oursels a short year syne and hendry munn there allows theres townsfolk that hae passed her in the glen mair recently  i only allowed hendry said cautiously that some sic talk had shot up suddenlike in the town them that pretends they saw her says that she joukit quick out o sicht  ay and theres another quirk in that responded the suspicious precentor  ise uphaud the ministers sitting in the manse in his slippers by this time hendry said  im willing replied whamond to gang back and speir or to search caddam next but let the matter drop i winna though i ken youre a awid to be hame now  and naturally retorted tosh for the nichts coming on as black as pick and by the time were at caddam well no even see the trees  toward caddam nevertheless they advanced hearing nothing but a distant wind and the whish of their legs in the broom  whaurs john spens hendry said suddenly  they turned back and found spens rooted to the ground as a boy becomes motionless when he thinks he is within arms reach of a nest and the bird sitting on the eggs  what do you see man hendry whispered  as sure as death answered spens awestruck i felt a drap o rain  its no rain were here to look for said the precentor  peter tosh cried spens it was a drap oh peter how are you looking at me so queer peter when you should be thanking the lord for the promise thats in that drap  come away whamond said impatiently but spens answered no till ive offered up a prayer for the promise thats in that drap peter tosh youve forgotten to take off your bonnet  think twice john spens gasped tosh afore you pray for rain this nicht  the others thought him crazy but he went on with a catch in his voice  i felt a drap o rain mysel just afore it came on dark so hurried and my first impulse was to wish that i could carry that drap about wi me and look at it but john spens when i looked up i saw sic a change running ower the sky that i thocht hell had taken the place o heaven and that there was waterspouts gathering therein for the drowning o the world  theres no water in hell the precentor said grimly  genesis ix said spens verses 8 to 17 ay but peter youve startled me and im thinking we should be stepping hame is that a licht  itll be in nanny websters hendry said after they had all regarded the light  i never heard that nanny needed a candle to licht her to her bed the precentor muttered  she was awa to meet sanders the day as he came out o the tilliedrum gaol spens remembered and i daresay the licht means theyre hame again  its well kent began hendry and would have recalled his words  hendry munn cried the precentor if you hae minded onything that may help us out wit  i was just minding the kirk officer answered reluctantly that nanny allows its mr dishart that has been keeping her frae the poorhouse you canna censure him for that tammas  can i no retorted whamond what business has he to befriend a woman that belongs to another denomination ill see to the bottom o that this nicht lads follow me to nannys and dinna be surprised if we find baith the minister and the egyptian there  they had not advanced many yards when spens jumped to the side crying be wary thats no the wind its a machine  immediately the doctors dogcart was close to them with rob dow for its only occupant he was driving slowly or whamond could not have escaped the horses hoofs  is that you rob dow said the precentor sourly i tell you youll be gaoled for stealing the doctors machine  the hielandman wasna muckle hurt rob hendry said more good naturedly  i ken that replied rob scowling at the four of them what are you doing here on sic a nicht  do you see anything strange in the nicht rob tosh asked apprehensively  its setting to rain dow replied i dinna see it but i feel it  ay said tosh eagerly but will it be a saft cowdie sweet dingon  let the heavens open if they will interposed spens recklessly i would swap the drought for rain though it comes down in a sheet as in the year twelve  and like a sheet itll come replied dow and the deilll blaw it about wi his biggest bellowses  tosh shivered but whamond shook him roughly saying  keep your oaths to yoursel rob dow and tell me hae you seen mr dishart  i hinna rob answered curtly preparing to drive on  nor the lassie they call the egyptian  rob leaped from the dogcart crying what does that mean  hands off said the precentor retreating from him it means that mr dishart neglected the prayermeeting this nicht to philander after that heathen woman  were no sure ot tammas remonstrated the kirk officer dow stood quite still i believe rob kens its true hendry added sadly or he would hae flown at your throat tammas whamond for saying these words  even this did not rouse dow  rob doesna worship the minister as he used to do said spens  and what for no cried the precentor rob dow is it because youve found out about this woman  youre a pack o liars roared rob desperately and if you say again that ony wandering hussy has haud o the minister ill let you see whether i can loup at throats  youll swear by the book asked whamond relentlessly that youve seen neither o them this nicht nor them thegither at any time  i so swear by the book answered poor loyal rob but what makes you look for mr dishart here he demanded with an uneasy look at the light in the mudhouse  go hame replied the precentor and deliver up the machine you stole and leave this session to do its duty john we maun fathom the meaning o that licht  dow started and was probably at that moment within an ace of felling whamond  ill come wi you he said hunting in his mind for a better way of helping gavin  they were at nannys garden but in the darkness whamond could not find the gate rob climbed the paling and was at once lost sight of then they saw his head obscure the window they did not however hear the groan that startled babbie  theres nobody there he said coming back but nanny and sanders youll mind sanders was to be freed the day  ill go in and see sanders said hendry but the precentor pulled him back saying youll do nothing o the kind hendry munn youll come awa wi me now to the manse  its mair than me and peterll do then said spens who had been consulting with the other farmer were gaun as straucht hame as the darkness ll let us  with few more words the session parted spens and tosh setting off for their farms and hendry accompanying the precentor no one will ever know where dow went i can fancy him however returning to the wood and there drawing rein i can fancy his mind made up to watch the mudhouse until gavin and the gypsy separated and then pounce upon her i daresay his whole plot could be condensed into a sentence if shes got rid o this nicht we may cheat the session yet but this is mere surmise all i know is that he waited near nannys house and by and by heard another trap coming up windyghoul that was just before the ten oclock bell began to ring     chapter xxxii  leading swiftly to the appalling marriage   the little minister bowed his head in assent when babbies cry oh gavin do you leapt in front of her unselfish wish that he should care for her no more  but that matters very little now he said  she was his to do with as he willed and perhaps the joy of knowing herself loved still begot a wild hope that he would refuse to give her up if so these words laid it low but even the sentence they passed upon her could not kill the selfrespect that would be hers henceforth that matters very little now the man said but to the woman it seemed to matter more than anything else in the world  throughout the remainder of this interview until the end came gavin never faltered his duty and hers lay so plainly before him that there could be no straying from it did babbie think him strangely calm at the glen quharity gathering i once saw rob angus lift a boulder with such apparent ease that its weight was discredited until the cry arose that the effort had dislocated his arm perhaps gavins quietness deceived the egyptian similarly had he stamped she might have understood better what he suffered standing there on the hot embers of his passion  we must try to make amends now he said gravely for the wrong we have done  the wrong i have done she said correcting him you will make it harder for me if you blame yourself how vile i was in those days  those days she called them they seemed so far away  do not cry babbie gavin replied gently he knew what you were and why and he pities you for his anger endureth but a moment in his favor is life weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning  not to me  yes to you he answered babbie you will return to the spittal now and tell lord rintoul everything  if you wish it  not because i wish it but because it is right he must be told that you do not love him  i never pretended to him that i did babbie said looking up oh she added with emphasis he knows that he thinks me incapable of caring for any one  and that is why he must be told of me gavin replied you are no longer the woman you were babbie and you know it and i know it but he does not know it he shall know it before he decides whether he is to marry you  babbie looked at gavin and wondered he did not see that this decision lay with him  nevertheless she said the wedding will take place tomorrow if it did not lord rintoul would be the scorn of his friends  if it does the minister answered he will be the scorn of himself babbie there is a chance  there is no chance she told him i shall be back at the spittal without any ones knowing of my absence and when i begin to tell him of you he will tremble lest it means my refusal to marry him when he knows it does not he will wonder only why i told him anything  he will ask you to take time  no he will ask me to put on my weddingdress you must not think anything else possible  so be it then gavin said firmly  yes it will be better so babbie answered and then seeing him misunderstand her meaning exclaimed reproachfully i was not thinking of myself in the time to come whatever be my lot i shall have the one consolation that this is best for you think of your mother  she will love you gavin said when i tell her of you  yes said babbie wringing her hands she will almost love me but for what for not marrying you that is the only reason any one in thrums will have for wishing me well  no others gavin answered will ever know why i remained unmarried  will you never marry babbie asked exultingly ah she cried ashamed but you must  never  well many a man and many a woman has made that vow in similar circumstances and not all have kept it but shall we who are old smile cynically at the brief and burning passion of the young the day you say will come when good sir hold your peace their agony was great and now is dead and maybe they have forgotten where it lies buried but dare you answer lightly when i ask you which of these things is saddest  babbie believed his never and doubtless thought no worse of him for it but she saw no way of comforting him save by disparagement of herself  you must think of your congregation she said a minister with a gypsy wife  would have knocked them about with a flail gavin interposed showing his teeth at the thought of the precentor until they did her reverence  she shook her head and told him of her meeting with micah dow it silenced him not however on account of its pathos as she thought but because it interpreted the riddle of robs behavior  nevertheless he said ultimately my duty is not to do what is right in my peoples eyes but what seems right in my own  babbie had not heard him  i saw a face at the window just now she whispered drawing closer to him  there was no face there the very thought of rob dow raises him before you gavin answered reassuringly though rob was nearer at that moment than either of them thought  i must go away at once she said still with her eyes in the window no no you shall not come or stay with me it is you who are in danger  do not fear for me  i must if you will not before you came in did i not hear you speak of a meeting you had to attend tonight  my pray his teeth met on the word so abruptly did it conjure up the forgotten prayermeeting that before the shock could reach his mind he stood motionless listening for the bell for one instant all that had taken place since he last heard it might have happened between two of its tinkles babbie passed from before him like a figure in a panorama and he saw instead a congregation in their pews  what do you see babbie cried in alarm for he seemed to be gazing at the window  only you he replied himself again i am coming with you  you must let me go alone she entreated if not for your own safetybut it was only him she consideredthen for the sake of lord rintoul were you and i to be seen together now his name and mine might suffer  it was an argument the minister could not answer save by putting his hands over his face his distress made babbie strong she moved to the door trying to smile  go babbie gavin said controlling his voice though it had been a smile more pitiful than her tears god has you in his keeping it is not his will to give me this to bear for you  they were now in the garden  do not think of me as unhappy she said it will be happiness to me to try to be all you would have me be  he ought to have corrected her all that god would have me be is what she should have said but he only replied you will be a good woman and none such can be altogether unhappy god sees to that  he might have kissed her and perhaps she thought so  i ami am going now dear she said and came back a step because he did not answer then she went on and was out of his sight at three yards distance neither of them heard the approaching dogcart  you see i am bearing it quite cheerfully she said i shall have everything a woman loves do not grieve for me so much  gavin dared not speak nor move never had he found life so hard but he was fighting with the ignoble in himself and winning she opened the gate and it might have been a signal to the dogcart to stop they both heard a dog barking and then the voice of lord rintoul  that is a light in the window jump down mckenzie and inquire  gavin took one step nearer babbie and stopped he did not see how all her courage went from her so that her knees yielded and she held out her arms to him but he heard a great sob and then his name  gavin i am afraid  gavin understood now and i say he would have been no man to leave her after that only a moment was allowed him and it was their last chance on earth he took it his arm went round his beloved and he drew her away from nannys  mckenzie found both house and garden empty  and yet he said i swear some one passed the window as we sighted it  waste no more time cried the impatient earl we must be very near the hill now you will have to lead the horse mckenzie in this darkness the dog may find the way through the broom for us  the dog has run on mckenzie replied now in an evil temper who knows it may be with her now so we must feel our way cautiously there is no call for capsizing the trap in our haste but there was call for haste if they were to reach the gypsy encampment before gavin and babbie were made man and wife over the tongs  the spittal dogcart rocked as it dragged its way through the broom rob dow followed the ten oclock bell began to ring     chapter xxxiii  while the ten oclock bell was ringing        in the square and wyndsweavers in groups   no no davit mr dishart hadna felt the blow the piper gave him till he ascended the pulpit to conduct the prayermeeting for rain and then he fainted awa tammas whamond and peter tosh carried him to the sessionhouse ay an awful scene  how did the minister no come to the meeting i wonder how you could expect it snecky and his mother taen so suddenly ill hes at her bedside but the doctor has little hope  this is what has occurred tailor mr dishart never got the length of the pulpit he fell in a swound on the vestry floor what caused it oh nothing but the heat thrums is so dry that one spark would set it in a blaze  i canna get at the richts o what keeped him frae the meeting femie but it had something to do wi an egyptian on the hill very like he had been trying to stop the gypsy marriage there i gaed to the manse to speir at jean what was wrang but im thinking i telled her mair than she could tell me  man man andrew the wite ot lies wi peter tosh he thocht we was to hae sic a terrible rain that he implored the minister no to pray for it and so angry was mr dishart that he ordered the whole session out o the kirk i saw them in couthies close and michty dour they looked  yes as sure as death tammas whamond locked the kirkdoor in mr disharts face  im a shaking and small wonder marget when ive heard this minute that mr disharts been struck by lichtning while looking for rob dow hes no killed but woes me they say hell never preach again  nothing o the kind it was rob that the lichtning struck dead in the doctors machine the horse wasna touched it came tearing down the roods wi the corpse sitting in the machine like a living man  what are you listening to woman is it to a dog barking ive heard it this while but its far awa       in

dog barking  i thocht maamat first i thocht it was mr dishart opening the door ay its just a dog some gypsy dog on the hill im thinking for sound would carry far the nicht  even you jean are nervous at nights i see if there is no man in the house we shall hear no more distant dogs barking i warrant when the minister comes home  when he comes home maam       on the middle of a hilla man and a woman  courage beloved we are nearly there  but gavin i cannot see the encampment  the night is too dark  but the gypsy fires  they are in the toadshole  listen to that dog barking  there are several dogs at the encampment babbie  there is one behind us see there it is  i have driven it away dear you are trembling  what we are doing frightens me gavin it is at your heels again  it seems to know

after  i will take you straight to the manse to my mother  were it not for that dog i should think we were alone on the hill  but we are not see there are the gypsy fires       on the west side of the hilltwo figures  tammas tammas whamond ive lost you should we gang to the manse down the fields  wheesht hendry  what are you listening for  i heard a dog barking  only a gypsy dog tammas barking at the coming storm  the gypsy dogs are all tied up and this ones atween us and the toadshole what was that  it was nothing but the rubbing of the branches in the cemetery on ane another its said trees mak that fearsome sound when theyre terrified  it was a dog barking at somebody thats stoning it i ken that sound hendry munn  may i die the death tammas whamond if a great drap o rain didna strike me

rintoul there is not a light on the hill  mckenzie can that schoolmaster have deceived us  it is probable  urge on the horse however there is a road through the broom i know have we stuck again  rintoul she is not here i promised to help you to bring her back to the spittal before this escapade became known but we have failed to find her if she is to be saved it must be by herself i daresay she has returned already let me turn the horses head there is a storm brewing  i will search this gypsy encampment first if it is on the hill hark that was a dogs bark yes it is snap but he would not bark at nothing why do you look behind you so often mczenzie  for some time rintoul it has seemed to me that we are being followed listen  i hear nothing at last mckenzie at last we are out of the broom  and as i live rintoul i see the gypsy lights  it might have been a lantern that was flashed across the hill then all that part of the world went suddenly on fire everything was horribly distinct in that white light the firs of caddam were so near that it seemed to have arrested them in a silent march upon the hill the grass would not hide a pebble the ground was scored with shadows of men and things twice the light flickered and recovered itself a red serpent shot across it and then again black night fell  the hill had been illumined thus for nearly half a minute during that time not even a dog stirred the shadows of human beings lay on the ground as motionless as logs what had been revealed seemed less a gypsy marriage than a picture or was it that during the ceremony every person on the hill had been turned into stone the gypsy king with his arm upraised had not had time to let it fall the men and women behind him had their mouths open as if struck when on the point of calling out lord rintoul had risen in the dogcart and was leaning forward one of mckenzies feet was on the shaft the man crouching in the dogcarts wake had flung up his hands to protect his face the precentor his neck outstretched had a hand on each knee all eyes were fixed as in the death glare on gavin and babbie who stood before the king their hands clasped over the tongs fear was petrified on the womans face determination on the mans  they were all released by the crack of the thunder but for another moment none could have swaggered  that was lord rintoul in the dogcart babbie whispered drawing in her breath  yes dear gavin answered resolutely and now is the time for me to have my first and last talk with him remain here babbie do not move till i come back  but gavin he has seen i fear him still  he cannot touch you now babbie you are my wife  in the vivid light gavin had thought the dogcart much nearer than it was he called lord rintouls name but got no answer there were shouts behind gypsies running from the coming rain dogs whining but silence in front the minister moved on some paces away to the left he heard voices  who was the man mckenzie  my lord i have lost sight of you this is not the way to the camp  tell me mckenzie that you did not see what i saw  rintoul i beseech you to turn back we are too late  we are not too late  gavin broke through the darkness between them and him but they were gone he called to them and stopped to listen to their feet  is that you gavin babbie asked just then  for reply the man who had crept up to her clapped his hand upon her mouth only the beginning of a scream escaped from her a strong arm drove her quickly southward  gavin heard her cry and ran back to the encampment babbie was gone none of the gypsies had seen her since the darkness cause back he rushed hither and thither with a torch that only showed his distracted face to others he flung up his arms in appeal for another moment of light then he heard babbie scream again and this time it was from a distance he dashed after her he heard a trap speeding down the green sward through the broom  lord rintoul had kidnapped babbie gavin had no other thought as he ran after the dogcart from which the cry had come the earls dog followed him snapping at his heels the rain began     chapter xxxiv  the great rain   gavin passed on through windyghoul thinking in his frenzy that he still heard the trap in a rain that came down like iron rods every other sound was beaten dead he slipped and before he could regain his feet the dog bit him to protect himself from dikes and trees and other horrors of the darkness he held his arm before him but soon it was driven to his side wet whips cut his brow so that he had to protect it with his hands until it had to bear the lash again for they would not now he had forced up his knees and would have succumbed but for a dread of being pinned to the earth this fight between the man and the rain went on all night and long before it ended the man was past the power of thinking  in the ringing of the ten oclock bell gavin had lived the seventh part of a mans natural life only action was required of him that accomplished his mind had begun to work again when suddenly the loss of babbie stopped it as we may put out a fire with a great coal the last thing he had reflected about was a dogcart in motion and consequently this idea clung to him his church his mother were lost knowledge of but still he seemed to hear the trap in front  the rain increased in violence appalling even those who heard it from under cover however rain may storm though it be an army of archers battering roofs and windows it is only terrifying when the noise swells every instant in those hours of darkness it again and again grew in force and doubled its fury and was louder louder and louder until its next attack was to be more than men and women could listen to they held each others hands and stood waiting then abruptly it abated and people could speak i believe a rain that became heavier every second for ten minutes would drive many listeners mad gavin was in it on a night that tried us repeatedly for quite half that time  by and by even the vision of babbie in the dogcart was blotted out if nothing had taken its place he would not have gone on probably and had he turned back objectless his strength would have succumbed to the rain now he saw babbie and rintoul being married by a minister who was himself and there was a fair company looking on and always when he was on the point of shouting to himself whom he could see clearly that this woman was already married the rain obscured his words and the light went out presently the ceremony began again always to stop at the same point he saw it in the lightningflash that had startled the hill it gave him courage to fight his way onward because he thought he must be heard if he could draw nearer to the company  a regiment of cavalry began to trouble him he heard it advancing from the spittal but was not dismayed for it was as yet far distant the horsemen came thundering on filling the whole glen of quharity now he knew that they had been sent out to ride him down he paused in dread until they had swept past him they came back to look for him riding more furiously than ever and always missed him yet his fears of the next time were not lessened they were only the rain  all through the night the dog followed him he would forget it for a time and then it would be so close that he could see it dimly he never heard it bark but it snapped at him and a grin had become the expression of its face he stoned it he even flung himself at it he addressed it in caressing tones and always with the result that it disappeared to come back presently  he found himself walking in a lake and now even the instinct of selfpreservation must have been flickering for he waded on rejoicing merely in getting rid of the dog something in the water rose and struck him instead of stupefying him the blow brought him to his senses and he struggled for his life the ground slipped beneath his feet many times but at last he was out of the water that he was out in a flood he did not realize yet he now acted like one in full possession of his faculties when his feet sank in water he drew back and many times he sought shelter behind banks and rocks first testing their firmness with his hands once a torrent of stones earth and heather carried him down a hillside until he struck against a tree he twined his arms round it and had just done so when it fell with him after that when he touched trees growing in water he fled from them thus probably saving himself from death  what he heard now might have been the roll and crack of the thunder it sounded in his ear like nothing else but it was really something that swept down the hill in roaring spouts of water and it passed on both sides of him so that at one moment had he paused it would have crashed into him and at another he was only saved by stopping he felt that the struggle in the dark was to go on till the crack of doom  then he cast himself upon the ground it moved beneath him like some great animal and he rose and stole away from it several times did this happen the stones against which his feet struck seemed to acquire life from his touch so strong had he become or so weak all other things that whatever clump he laid hands on by which to pull himself out of the water was at once rooted up  the daylight would not come he longed passionately for it he tried to remember what it was like and could not he had been blind so long it was away in front somewhere and he was struggling to overtake it he expected to see it from a dark place when he would rush forward to bathe his arms in it and then the elements that were searching the world for him would see him and he would perish but death did not seem too great a penalty to pay for light  and at last day did come back gray and drear he saw suddenly once more i think he must have been wandering the glen with his eyes shut as one does shut them involuntarily against the hidden dangers of black night how different was daylight from what he had expected he looked and then shut his dazed eyes again for the darkness was less horrible than the day had he indeed seen or only dreamed that he saw once more he looked to see what the world was like and the sight that met his eyes was so mournful that he who had fought through the long night now sank hopeless and helpless among the heather the dog was not far away and it too lost heart gavin held out his hand and snap crept timidly toward him he unloosened his coat and the dog nestled against him cowed and shivering hiding its head from the day thus they lay and the rain beat upon them     chapter xxxv  the glen at break of day   my first intimation that the burns were in flood came from waster lunny close on the strike of ten oclock this was some minutes before they had any rain in thrums i was in the schoolhouse now piecing together the puzzle lord rintoul had left with me and anon starting upright as mckenzies hand seemed to tighten on my arm waster lunny had been whistling to me with his fingers in his mouth for some time before i heard him and hurried out i was surprised and pleased knowing no better to be met on the threshold by a whisk of rain  the night was not then so dark but that when i reached the quharity i could see the farmer take shape on the other side of it he wanted me to exult with him i thought in the end of the drought and i shouted that i would fling him the stilts  its yoursel that wants them he answered excitedly if youre fleid to be left alone in the schoolhouse the nicht do you hear me dominie there has been frichtsome rain among the hills and the bog burn is coming down like a sea it has carried awa the millers brig and the steading o muckle pirley is standing three feet in water  youre dreaming man i roared back but beside his news he held my doubts of no account  the reterys in flood he went on and running wild through hazel wood tnowdunnies tattie fields out o sicht and at the kirkton theyre fleid theyve lost twa kye  there has been no rain here i stammered incredulously  its coming now he replied and listen the storys out that the backbone has fallen into the loch you had better cross dominie and thole out the nicht wi us  the backbone was a piece of mountainside overhanging a loch among the hills and legend said that it would one day fall forward and squirt all the water into the glen something of the kind had happened but i did not believe it then with little wit i pointed to the shallow quharity  it may come down at any minute the farmer answered and syne mind you youll be five miles frae waster lunny for therell be no crossing but by the brig o march if you winna come i maun awa back i mauna bide langer on the wrang side o the moss ditch though it has been as dry this month back as a tabbits roady but if you his voice changed gods sake man he cried youre ower late look at that dinna lookrun run  if i had not run before he bade me i might never have run again on earth i had seen a great shadowy yellow river come riding down the quharity i sprang from it for my life and when next i looked behind it was upon a turbulent loch the further bank lost in darkness i was about to shout to waster lunny when a monster rose in the torrent between me and the spot where he had stood it frightened me to silence until it fell when i knew it was but a tree that had been flung on end by the flood for a time there was no answer to my cries and i thought the farmer had been swept away then i heard his whistle and back i ran recklessly through the thickening darkness to the schoolhouse when i saw the tree rise i had been on ground hardly wet as yet with the rain but by the time waster lunny sent that reassuring whistle to me i was ankledeep in water and the rain was coming down like hail i saw no lightning  for the rest of the night i was only out once when i succeeded in reaching the henhouse and brought all my fowls safely to the kitchen except a hen which would not rise off her young between us we had the kitchen floor a pool of water and the rain had put out my fires already as effectually as if it had been an overturned brothpot that i never took off my clothes that night i need not say though of what was happening in the glen i could only guess a flutter against my window now and again when the rain had abated told me of another bird that had flown there to die and with waster lunny i kept up communication by waving a light to which he replied in a similar manner before morning however he ceased to answer my signals and i feared some catastrophe had occurred at the farm as it turned out the family was fighting with the flood for the years shearing of wool half of which eventually went down the waters with the woolshed on top of it  the schoolhouse stands too high to fear any flood but there were moments when i thought the rain would master it not only the windows and the roof were rattling then but all the walls and i was like one in a great drum when the rain was doing its utmost i heard no other sound but when the lull came there was the wash of a heavy river or a crack as of artillery that told of landslips or the plaintive cry of the peesweep as it rose in the air trying to entice the waters away from its nest  it was a dreary scene that met my gaze at break of day already the quharity had risen six feet and in many parts of the glen it was two hundred yards wide waster lunnys cornfield looked like a bog grown over with rushes and what had been his turnips had become a lake with small islands in it no dike stood whole except one that the farmer unaided had built in a straight line from the road to the top of mount bare and my own the further end of which dipped in water of the plot of firs planted fifty years earlier to help on waster lunnys crops only a triangle had withstood the night  even with the aid of my fieldglass i could not estimate the damage on more distant farms for the rain though now thin and soft as it continued for six days was still heavy and of a brown color after breakfastwhich was interrupted by my bantam cocks twice spilling my milksaw waster lunny and his son matthew running towards the shepherds house with ropes in their hands the house i thought must be in the midst beyond and then i sickened knowing all at once that it should be on this side of the mist when i had nerve to look again i saw that though the roof had fallen in the shepherd was astride one of the walls from which he was dragged presently through the water by the help of the ropes i remember noticing that he returned to his house with the rope still about him and concluded that he had gone back to save some of his furniture i was wrong however there was too much to be done at the farm to allow this but waster lunny had consented to duncans forcing his way back to the shieling to stop the clock to both men it seemed horrible to let a clock go on ticking in a deserted house  having seen this rescue accomplished i was letting my glass roam in the opposite direction when one of its shakes brought into view something on my own side of the river i looked at it long and saw it move slightly was it a human being no it was a dog no it was a dog and something else i hurried out to see more clearly and after a first glance the glass shook so in my hands that i had to rest it on the dike for a full minute i daresay did i look through the glass without blinking and then i needed to look no more that black patch was indeed gavin  he lay quite near the schoolhouse but i had to make a circuit of half a mile to reach him it was pitiful to see the dog doing its best to come to me and falling every few steps the poor brute was discolored almost beyond recognition and when at last it reached me it lay down at my feet and licked them i stepped over it and ran on recklessly to gavin at first i thought he was dead if tears rolled down my cheeks they were not for him  i was no strong man even in those days but i carried him to the schoolhouse the dog crawling after us gavin i put upon my bed and i lay down beside him holding him close to me that some of the heat of my body might be taken in by his when he was able to look at me however it was not with understanding and in vain did my anxiety press him with questions only now and again would some word in my speech strike upon his brain and produce at least an echo to did you meet lord rintouls dogcart he sat up saying quickly  listen the dogcart  egyptian was not that forenoon among the words he knew and i did not think of mentioning hill at rain he shivered but spittal was what told me most  he has taken her back he replied at once from which i learned that gavin now knew as much of babbie as i did  i made him as comfortable as possible and despairing of learning anything from him in his present state i let him sleep then i went out into the rain very anxious and dreading what he might have to tell me when he woke i waded and jumped my way as near to the farm as i dared go and waster lunny seeing me came to the waters edge at this part the breadth of the flood was not forty yards yet for a time our voices could no more cross its roar than one may send a snowball through a stone wall i know not whether the river then quieted for a space or if it was only that the ears grow used to dins as the eyes distinguish the objects in a room that is at first black to them but after a little we were able to shout our remarks across much as boys fling pebbles many to fall into the water but one occasionally to reach the other side waster lunny would have talked of the flood but i had not come here for that  how were you home so early from the prayermeeting last night i bawled  no meeting  i came straucht hame  but terrible stories  mr dishart was all i caught after waster lunny had flung his words across a dozen times  i could not decide whether it would be wise to tell him that gavin was in the schoolhouse and while i hesitated he continued to shout  some woman  the session  lang tammas  god forbid  maun back to the farm  byre running like a milldam  he signed to me that he must be off but my signals delayed him and after much trouble he got my question any news about lord rintoul my curiosity about the earl must have surprised him but he answered  marriage is to be the day  cannon  i signed that i did not grasp his meaning  a cannon is to be fired as soon as theyre man and wife he bellowed well hear it  with that we parted on my way home i remember i stepped on a brood of drowned partridge i was only out half an hour but i had to wring my clothes as if they were fresh from the tub  the day wore on and i did not disturb the sleeper a dozen times i suppose i had to relight my fire of wet peats and roots but i had plenty of time to stare out at the window plenty of time to think probably gavins life depended on his sleeping but that was not what kept my hands off him knowing so little of what had happened in thrums since i left it i was forced to guess and my conclusion was that the earl had gone off with his own and that gavin in a frenzy had followed them my wisest course i thought was to let him sleep until i heard the cannon when his struggle for a wife must end fifty times at least did i stand regarding him as he slept and if i did not pity his plight sufficiently you know the reason what were margarets sufferings at this moment was she wringing her hands for her son lost in the flood her son in disgrace with the congregation by one oclock no cannon had sounded and my suspense had become intolerable i shook gavin awake and even as i shook him demanded a knowledge of all that had happened since we parted at nannys gate  how long ago is that he asked with bewilderment  it was last night i answered this morning i found you senseless on the hillside and brought you here to the glen quharity schoolhouse that dog was with you  he looked at the dog but i kept my eyes on him and i saw intelligence creep back like a blush into his face  now i remember he said shuddering you have proved yourself my friend sir twice in the four and twenty hours  only once i fear i replied gloomily i was no friend when i sent you to the earls bride last night  you know who she is he cried clutching me and finding it agony to move his limbs  i know now i said and had to tell him how i knew before he would answer another question then i became listener and you who read know to what alarming story  and all that time i cried reproachfully when he had done you gave your mother not a thought  not a thought he answered and i saw that he pronounced a harsher sentence on himself than could have come from me all that time he repeated after a moment it was only a few minutes while the ten oclock bell was ringing  only a few minutes i said but they changed the channel of the quharity and perhaps they have done not less to you  that may be he answered gravely but it is of the present i must think just now mr ogilvy what assurance have i while lying here helpless that the marriage at the spittal is not going on  none i hope i said to myself and listened longingly for the cannon but to him i only pointed out that no woman need go through a form of marriage against her will  rintoul carried her off with no possible purport he said but to set my marriage at defiance and she has had a conviction always that to marry me would be to ruin me it was only in the shiver lord rintouls voice in the darkness sent through her that she yielded to my wishes if she thought that marriage last night could be annulled by another today she would consent to the second i believe to save me from the effects of the first you are incredulous sir but you do not know of what sacrifices love is capable  something of that i knew but i did not tell him i had seen from his manner rather than his words that he doubted the validity of the gypsy marriage which the king had only consented to celebrate because babbie was herself an egyptian the ceremony had been interrupted in the middle  it was no marriage i said with a confidence i was far from feeling  in the sight of god he replied excitedly we took each other for man and wife  i had to hold him down in bed  you are too weak to stand man i said and yet you think you could start off this minute for the spittal  i must go he cried she is my wife that impious marriage may have taken place already  oh that it had was my prayer it has not i said to him a cannon is to be fired immediately after the ceremony and all the glen will hear it i spoke on the impulse thinking to allay his desire to be off but he said then i may yet be in time somewhat cruelly i let him rise that he might realize his weakness every bone in him cried out at his first step and he sank into a chair  you will go to the spittal for me he implored  i will not i told him you are asking me to fling away my life  to prove my words i opened the door and he saw what the flood was doing nevertheless he rose and tottered several times across the room trying to revive his strength though every bit of him was aching i saw that he would make the attempt  listen to me i said lord rintoul can maintain with some reason that it was you rather than he who abducted babbie nevertheless there will not i am convinced be any marriage at the spittal today when he carried her off from the toadshole he acted under impulses not dissimilar to those that took you to it then i doubt not he thought possession was all the law but that scene on the hill has staggered him by this morning even though she thinks to save you by marrying him he will defer his wedding until he learns the import of yours  i did not believe in my own reasoning but i would have said anything to detain him until that cannon was fired he seemed to read my purpose for he pushed my arguments from him with his hands and continued to walk painfully to and fro  to defer the wedding he said would be to tell all his friends of her gypsy origin and of me he will risk much to avoid that  in any case i answered you must now give some thought to those you have forgotten your mother and your church  that must come afterwards he said firmly my first duty is to my wife  the door swung to sharply just then and he started he thought it was the cannon  i wish to god it had been i cried interpreting his thoughts  why do you wish me ill he asked  mr dishart i said solemnly rising and facing him and disregarding his question if that woman is to be your wife it will be at a cost you cannot estimate till you return to thrums do you think that if your congregation knew of this gypsy marriage they would have you for their minister for another day do you enjoy the prospect of taking one who might be an earls wife into povertyay and disgraceful poverty do you know your mother so little as to think she could survive your shame let me warn you sir of what i see i see another minister in the auld licht kirk i see you and your wife stoned through our wynds stoned from thrums as malefactors havebeen chased out of it ere now and as certainly as i see these things i see a hearse standing at the manse door and stern men denying a sons right to help to carry his mothers coffin to it go your way sir but first count the cost  his face quivered before these blows but all he said was i must dree my dreed  god is merciful i went on and these things need not be he is more merciful to you sir than to some for the storm that he sent to save you is ruining them and yet the farmers are today thanking him for every pound of wool every blade of corn he has left them while you turn from him because he would save you not in your way but in his it was his hand that stayed your marriage he meant babbie for the earl and if it is on her part a loveless match she only suffers for her own sins of that scene on the hill no one in thrums or in the glen need ever know rintoul will see to it that the gypsies vanish from these parts forever and you may be sure the spittal will soon be shut up he and mckenzie have as much reason as yourself to be silent you sir must go back to your congregation who have heard as yet only vague rumors that your presence will dispel even your mother will remain ignorant of what has happened your absence from the prayermeeting you can leave to me to explain  he was so silent that i thought him mine but his first words undeceived me  i thought i had nowhere so keen a friend he said but mr ogilvy it is devils work you are pleading am i to return to my people to act a living lie before them to the end of my days do you really think that god devastated a glen to give me a chance of becoming a villain no sir i am in his hands and i will do what i think right  you will be dishonored i said in the sight of god and man  not in gods sight he replied it was a sinless marriage mr ogilvy and i do not regret it god ordained that she and i should love each other and he put it into my power to save her from that man i took her as my wife before him and in his eyes i am her husband knowing that sir how could i return to thrums without her  i had no answer ready for him i knew that in my grief for margaret i had been advocating an unworthy course but i would not say so i went gloomily to the door and there presently his hand fell on my shoulder  your advice came too late at any rate he said you forget that the precentor was on the hill and saw everything  it was he who had forgotten to tell me this and to me it was the most direful news of all  my god i cried he will have gone to your mother and told her and straightway i began to lace my boots  where are you going he asked staring at me  to thrums i answered harshly  you said that to venture out into the glen was to court death he reminded me  what of that i said and hastily put on my coat  mr ogilvy he cried i will not allow you to do this for me  for you i said bitterly it is not for you  i would have gone at once but he got in front of me asking did you ever know my mother  long ago i answered shortly and he said no more thinking i suppose that he knew all he limped to the door with me and i had only advanced a few steps when i understood better than before what were the dangers i was to venture into since i spoke to waster lunny the river had risen several feet and even the hillocks in his turnipfield were now submerged the mist was creeping down the hills but what warned me most sharply that the flood was not satisfied yet was the top of the schoolhouse dike it was lined with fieldmice i turned back and gavin mistaking my meaning said i did wisely  i have not changed my mind i told him and then had some difficulty in continuing i expect i said to reach thrums safely even though i should be caught in the mist but i shall have to go round by the kelpie brig in order to get across the river and it is possible thatthat something may befall me  i have all my life been something of a coward and my voice shook when i said this so that gavin again entreated me to remain at the schoolhouse saying that if i did not he would accompany me  and so increase my danger tenfold i pointed out no no mr dishart i go alone and if i can do nothing with the congregation i can at least send your mother word that you still live but if anything should happen to me i want you  but i could not say what i had come back to say i had meant to ask him in the event of my death to take a hundred pounds which were the savings of my life but now i saw that this might lead to margarets hearing of me and so i stayed my words it was bitter to me this and yet after all a little thing when put beside the rest  goodby mr dishart i said abruptly i then looked at my desk which contained some trifles that were once margarets should anything happen to me i said i want that old desk to be destroyed unopened  mr ogilvy he answered gently you are venturing this because you loved my mother if anything does befall you be assured that i will tell her what you attempted for her sake  i believe he thought it was to make some such request that i had turned back  you must tell her nothing about me i exclaimed in consternation swear that my name will never cross your lips before her no that is not enough you must forget me utterly whether i live or die lest some time you should think of me and she should read your thoughts swear man  must this be he said gazing at me  yes i answered more calmly it must be for nearly a score of years i have been blotted out of your mothers life and since she came to thrums my one care has been to keep my existence from her i have changed my buryingground even from thrums to the glen lest i should die before her and she seeing the hearse go by the tenements might ask whose funeral is this  in my anxiety to warn him i had said too much his face grew haggard and there was fear to speak on it and i saw i knew that some damnable suspicion of margaret  she was my wife i cried sharply we were married by the minister of harvie you are my son     chapter xxxvi  story of the dominie   when i spoke next i was back in the schoolhouse sitting there with my bonnet on my head gavin looking at me we had forgotten the cannon at last  in that chair i had anticipated this scene more than once of late i had seen that a time might come when gavin would have to be told all and i had even said the words aloud as if he were indeed opposite me so now i was only repeating the tale and i could tell it without emotion because it was nigh nineteen years old and i did not look at gavin for i knew that his manner of taking it could bring no change to me  did you never ask your mother i said addressing the fire rather than him why you were called gavin  yes he answered it was because she thought gavin a prettier name than adam  no i said slowly it was because gavin is my name you were called after your father do you not remember my taking you one day to the shore at harvie to see the fishermen carried to their boats upon their wives backs that they might start dry on their journey  no he had to reply i remember the women carrying the men through the water to the boats but i thought it was my father whoi mean  i know whom you mean i said that was our last day together but you were not three years old yet you remembered me when you came to thrums you shake your head but it is true between the diets of worship that first sabbath i was introduced to you and you must have had some shadowy recollection of my face for you asked surely i saw you in church in the forenoon mr ogilvy i said yes but i had not been in the church in the forenoon you have forgotten even that and yet i treasured it  i could hear that he was growing impatient though so far he had been more indulgent than i had any right to expect  it can all be put into a sentence i said calmly margaret married adam dishart and afterwards believing herself a widow she married me you were born and then adam dishart came back  that is my whole story and here was i telling it to my son and not a tear between us it ended abruptly and i fell to mending the fire  when i knew your mother first i went on after gavin had said some boyish things that were of no avail to me i did not think to end my days as a dominie i was a student at aberdeen with the ministry in my eye and sometimes on saturdays i walked forty miles to harvie to go to church with her she had another lover adam dishart a sailor turned fisherman and while i lingered at corners wondering if i could dare to meet her and her mother on their way to church he would walk past with them he was accompanied always by a lanky black dog which he had brought from a foreign country he never signed for any ship without first getting permission to take it with him and in harvie they said it did not know the language of the native dogs i have never known a man and dog so attached to each other  i remember that black dog gavin said i have spoken of it to my mother and she shuddered as if it had once bitten her  while adam strutted by with them i continued i would hang back raging at his assurance or my own timidity but i lost my next chance in the same way in margarets presence something came over me a kind of dryness in the throat that made me dumb i have known divinity students stricken in the same way just as they were giving out their first text it is no aid in getting a kirk or wooing a woman  if any one in harvie recalls me now it is as a hobbledehoy who strode along the cliffs shouting homer at the seamews with all my learning i who gave margaret the name of lalage understood women less than any fisherman who bandied words with them across a boat i remember a yule night when both adam and i were at her mothers cottage and as we were leaving he had the audacity to kiss margaret she ran out of the room and adam swaggered off and when i recovered from my horror i apologized for what he had done i shall never forget how her mother looked at me and said ay gavin i see they dinna teach everything at aberdeen you will not believe it but i walked away doubting her meaning i thought more of scholarship then than i do now adam dishart taught me its proper place  well that is the dull man i was and yet though adam was always saying and doing the things i was making up my mind to say and do i think margaret cared more for me nevertheless there was something about him that all women seemed to find lovable a dash that made them send him away and then wellnigh run after him at any rate i could have got her after her mothers death if i had been half a man but i went back to aberdeen to write a poem about her and while i was at it adam married her  i opened my desk and took from it a yellow manuscript  here i said is the poem you see i never finished it  i was fingering the thing grimly when gavins eye fell on something else in the desk it was an ungainly claspknife as rusty as if it had spent a winter beneath a hedge  i seem to remember that knife he said  yes i answered you should remember it well after three months adam tired of his wife  i stopped again this was a story in which only the pauses were eloquent  perhaps i have no right to say he tired of her one day however he sauntered away from harvie whistling his dog at his heels as ever and was not seen again for nearly six years when i heard of his disappearance i packed my books in that kist and went to harvie where i opened a school you see every one but margaret believed that adam had fallen over the cliffs and been drowned  but the dog said gavin  we were all sure that if he had fallen over it had jumped after him the fisherfolk said that he could have left his shadow behind as easily as it yet margaret thought for long that he had tired of harvie merely and gone back to sea and not until two years had passed would she marry me we lived in adams house it was so near the little school that when i opened the window in summertime she could hear the drone of our voices during the weeks before you were born i kept that window open all day long and often i went to it and waved my hand to her  sometimes when she was washing or baking i brought you to the school the only quarrel she and i ever had was about my teaching you the lords prayer in greek as soon as you could say father and mother it was to be a surprise for her on your second birthday on that day while she was ironing you took hold of her gown to steady yourself and began iiater haemon ho en tois ohuranois and to me behind the door it was music but at agiasthaeto of which you made two syllables you cried and margaret snatched you up thinking this was some new ailment after i had explained to her that it was the lords prayer in greek she would let me take you to the schoolhouse no more  not much longer could i have taken you in any case for already we are at the day when adam dishart came back it was the 7th of september and all the week most of the women in harvie had been setting off at dawn to the harvest fields and straggling home at nights merry and with yellow corn in their hair i had sat on in the schoolhouse that day after my pupils were gone i still meant to be a minister and i was studying hebrew and so absorbed in my book that as the daylight went i followed it step by step as far as my window and there i read without knowing until i chanced to look up that i had left my desk i have not opened that book since  from the window i saw you on the waste ground that separated the school from our home you were coming to me on your hands and feet and stopping now and again to look back at your mother who was at the door laughing and shaking her fist at you i beckoned to you and took the book back to my desk to lock it up while my head was inside the desk i heard the schoolhouse door pushed open and thinking it was you i smiled without looking up then something touched my hand and i still thought it was you but i looked down and i saw adam disharts black dog  i did not move it looked up at me and wagged its tail then it drew backi suppose because i had no words for it i watched it run halfround the room and stop and look at me again then it slunk out  all that time one of my hands had been holding the desk open now the lid fell i put on my bonnet and went to the door you were only a few yards away with flowers in your fist margaret was laughing still i walked round the school and there was no dog visible margaret nodded to me meaning that i should bring you home you thrust the flowers into my hand but they fell i stood there dazed  i think i walked with you some way across the waste ground then i dropped your hand and strode back to the school i went down on my knees looking for marks of a dogs paws and i found them  when i came out again your mother was no longer at our door and you were crying because i had left you i passed you and walked straight to the house margaret was skinning rushes for wicks there must have been fear in my face for as soon as she saw it she ran to the door to see if you were still alive she brought you in with her and so had strength to cry what is it speak  come away i said come away and i was drawing her to the door but she pressed me into a chair i was up again at once  margaret i said ask no questions put on your bonnet give me the boy and let us away  i could not take my eyes off the door and she was walking to it to look out when i barred the way with my arm  what have you seen she cried and then as i only pointed to her bonnet she turned to you and you said was it the black dog father  gavin then she knew and i stood helpless and watched my wife grow old in that moment she lost the sprightliness i loved the more because i had none of it myself and the bloom went from her face never to return  he has come back she said  i told her what i had seen and while i spoke she put on her bonnet and i exulted thinkingand then she took off her bonnet and i knew she would not go away with me  margaret i cried i am that bairns father  adams my man she said and at that i gave her a look for which god might have struck me dead but instead of blaming me she put her arms round my neck  after that we said very little we sat at opposite sides of the fire waiting for him and you played on the floor the harvesters trooped by and there was a fiddle and when it stopped long stillness and then a step it was not adam you fell asleep and we could hear nothing but the sea there was a harvest moon  once a dog ran past the door and we both rose margaret pressed her hands on her breast sometimes she looked furtively at me and i knew her thoughts to me it was only misery that had come but to her it was shame so that when you woke and climbed into her lap she shivered at your touch i could not look at her after that for there was a horror of me growing in her face  ten oclock struck and then again there was no sound but the sea pouring itself out on the beach it was long after this when to me there was still no other sound that margaret screamed and you hid behind her then i heard it  gavin margaret said to me be a good man all your life  it was louder now and then it stopped above the wash of the sea we heard another sounda sharp tap tap you said i know what sound that is its a man knocking the ashes out of his pipe against his boot  then the dog pushed the door off the latch and adam lurched in he was not drunk but he brought the smell of drink into the room with him he was grinning like one bringing rare news and before she could shrink back or i could strike him he had margaret in his arms  lord lass he said with many jovial oaths to think im back again there shes swounded what folks be women to be sure  we thought you were dead adam she said coming to  bless your blue eyes he answered gleefully often i says to myself meggy will be thinking im with the fishes and then i chuckles  where have you been all this time i demanded sternly  gavin he said effusively your hand and dont look so feared man i bear no malice for what youve done i heard all about it at the cross anchors  where have you been these five years and a half i repeated  where have i no been lad he replied  at harvie i said  right you are said he goodnaturedly meggie i had no intention of leaving you that day though i was yawning myself to death in harvie but i sees a whaler and i thinks thats a tidy boat and im a tidy man and if theyll take me and the dog off we go  you never wrote to me margaret said  i meant to send you some scrapes he answered but it wasna till i changed ships that i had the chance and then i minds meggy kens im no hand with the pen but i swear i often thought of you lass and look you here thats better than letters and so is that and every penny of it is yours  he flung two bags of gold upon the table and their chink brought you out from behind your mother  hallo adam cried  he is mine i said gavin come here but margaret held you back  heres a go adam muttered and scratched his head then he slapped his thigh gavin he said in his friendliest way well toss for him  he pulled the knife that is now in my desk from his pocket spat on it and flung it up dry the kids ours meggy he explained wet he goes to gavin i clinched my fist tobut what was the use he caught the knife and showed it to me  dry he said triumphantly so he is ours meggy kiddy catch the knife it is yours and mind you have changed dads and now that we have settled that gavin theres my hand again  i went away and left them and i never saw margaret again until the day you brought her to thrums but i saw you once a few days after adam came back i was in the schoolhouse packing my books and you were playing on the waste ground i asked you how your mother was and you said shes fleid to come to the door till you gang awa and my fathers buying a boat  im your father i said but you answered confidently  youre no a living man youre just a man i dreamed about and i promised my mother no to dream about you again  i am your father i repeated  my fathers awa buying a fishingboat you insisted and when i speir at my mother whaur my first father is she says im havering  gavin ogilvy is your name i said no you answered i have a new name my mother telled me my name is aye to be gavin dishart now she telled me too to fling awa this knife my father gave me and ive flung it awa a lot o times but i aye pick it up again  give it to me i said with the wicked thoughts of a fool in my head  that is how your knife came into my possession i left harvie that night in the carriers cart but i had not the heart to return to college accident brought me here and i thought it a fitting place in which to bury myself from margaret     chapter xxxvii  second journey of the dominie to thrums during the twentyfour hours  here was a nauseous draught for me having finished my tale i turned to gavin for sympathy and behold he had been listening for the cannon instead of to my final words so like an old woman at her hearth we warm our hands at our sorrows and drop in faggots and each thinks his own fire a sun in presence of which all other fires should go out i was soured to see gavin prove this and then i could have laughed without mirth for had not my bitterness proved it too  and now i said rising whether margaret is to hold up her head henceforth lies no longer with me but with you  it was not to that he replied  you have suffered long mr ogilvy he said father he added wringing my hand i called him son but it was only an exchange of musty words that we had found too late a father is a poor estate to come into at two and twenty  i should have been told of this he said  your mother did right sir i answered slowly but he shook his head  i think you have misjudged her he said doubtless while my fa  while adam dishart lived she could only think of you with pain but after his death  after his death i said quietly i was still so horrible to her that she left harvie without letting a soul know whither she was bound she dreaded my following her  stranger to me he said after a pause than even your story is her being able to keep it from me i believed no thought ever crossed her mind that she did not let me share  and none i am sure ever did i answered save that and such thoughts as a woman has with god only it was my lot to bring disgrace on her she thought it nothing less and she has hidden it all these years for your sake until now it is not burdensome i suppose she feels that god has taken the weight off her now you are to put a heavier burden in its place  he faced me boldly and i admire him for it now  i cannot admit he said that i did wrong in forgetting my mother for that fateful quarter of an hour babbie and i loved each other and i was given the opportunity of making her mine or losing her forever have you forgotten that all this tragedy you have told me of only grew out of your own indecision i took the chance that you let slip by  i had not forgotten i replied what else made me tell you last night that babbie was in nannys house  but now you are afraidnow when the deed is done when for me there can be no turning back whatever be the issue i should be a cur to return to thrums without my wife every minute i feel my strength returning and before you reach thrums i will have set out to the spittal  there was nothing to say after that he came with me in the rain as far as the dike warning me against telling his people what was not true  my first part i answered will be to send word to your mother that you are in safety after that i must see whamond much depends on him  you will not go to my mother  not so long as she has a roof over her head i said but that may not be for long  so i think we partedeach soon to forget the other in a woman  but i had not gone far when i heard something that stopped me as sharply as if it had been mckenzies hand once more on my shoulder for a second the noise appalled me and then before the echo began i knew it must be the spittal cannon my only thought was one of thankfulness now gavin must see the wisdom of my reasoning i would wait for him until he was able to come with me to thrums i turned back and in my haste i ran through water i had gone round before  i was too late he was gone and into the rain i shouted his name in vain that he had started for the spittal there could be no doubt that he would ever reach it was less certain the earls collie was still crouching by the fire and thinking it might be a guide to him i drove the brute to the door and chased it in the direction he probably had taken not until it had run from me did i resume my own journey i do not need to be told that you who read would follow gavin now rather than me but you must bear with the dominie for a little while yet as i see no other way of making things clear  in some ways i was not illequipped for my attempt i do not know any one of our hillsides as it is known to the shepherd to whom every rabbithole and glimmer of mica is a landmark but he like his flock has only to cross a dike to find himself in a strange land while i have been everywhere in the glen  in the foreground the rain slanted transparent till it reached the ground where a mist seemed to blow it along as wind ruffles grass in the distance all was a driving mist i have been out for perhaps an hour in rains as wetting and i have watched floods from my window but never since have i known the fifth part of a seasons rainfall in eighteen hours and if there should be the like here again we shall be found better prepared for it men have been lost in the glen in mists so thick that they could plunge their fingers out of sight in it as into a meal girnel but this mist never came within twenty yards of me i was surrounded by it however as if i was in a round tent and out of this tent i could not walk for it advanced with me on the other side of this screen were horrible noises at whose cause i could only guess save now and again when a tongue of water was shot at my feet or great stones came crashing through the canvas of mist then i ran wherever safety prompted and thus tangled my bearings until i was like that one in the childs game who is blindfolded and turned round three times that he may not know east from west  once i stumbled over a dead sheep and a living lamb and in a clump of trees which puzzled mefor they were where i thought no trees should bea woodpigeon flew to me but struck my breast with such force that i picked it up dead i saw no other living thing though half a dozen times i must have passed within cry of farmhouses at one time i was in a cornfield where i had to lift my hands to keep them out of water and a dread filled me that i had wandered in a circle and was still on waster lunnys land i plucked some corn and held it to my eyes to see if it was green but it was yellow and so i knew that at last i was out of the glen  people up here will complain if i do not tell how i found the farmer of green braes fifty pounds it is one of the best remembered incidents of the flood and happened shortly after i got out of the cornfield a house rose suddenly before me and i was hastening to it when as suddenly three of its walls fell before my mind could give a meaning to what my eyes told it the water that had brought down the house had lifted me off my feet and flung me among waves that would have been the last of the dominie had i not struck against a chest then halfway on its voyage to the sea i think the lid gave way tinder me but that is surmise for from the time the house fell till i was on the river in a kist that was like to be my coffin is almost a blank after what may have been but a short journey though i had time in it to say my prayers twice we stopped jammed among fallen trees and seeing a bank within reach i tried to creep up it in this there would have been little difficulty had not the contents of the kist caught in my feet and held on to them like living things afraid of being left behind i let down my hands to disentangle my feet but failed and then grown desperate i succeeded in reaching firm ground dragging i knew not what after me it proved to be a pillowslip green brae still shudders when i tell him that my first impulse was to leave the pillowslip unopened however i ripped it up for to undo the wet strings that had ravelled round my feet would have wearied even a man with a needle to pick open the knots and among broken gimlets the head of a grape and other things no beggar would have stolen i found a tin canister containing fifty pounds waster lunny says that this should have made a religious man of green brae and it did to this extent that he called the fall of the cotters house providential otherwise the cotter at whose expense it may be said the money was found remains the more religious man of the two  at last i came to the kelpies brig and i could have wept in joy and might have been better employed when like everything i saw on that journey it broke suddenly through the mist and seemed to run at me like a living monster next moment i ran back for as i stepped upon the bridge i saw that i had been about to walk into the air what was left of the kelpies brig ended in midstream instead of thanking god for the light without which i should have gone abruptly to my death i sat down miserable and hopeless  presently i was up and trudging to the loups of malcolm at the loups the river runs narrow and deep between cliffs and the spot is so called because one malcolm jumped across it when pursued by wolves next day he returned boastfully to look at his jump and gazing at it turned dizzy and fell into the river since that time chains have been hung across the loups to reduce the distance between the farms of carwhimple and keepwhatyoucan from a mile to a hundred yards you must cross the chains on your breast they were suspended there by rob angus who was also the first to breast them  but i never was a rob angus when my pupils practise what they call the high jump two small boys hold a string aloft and the bigger ones run at it gallantly until they reach it when they stop meekly and creep beneath they will repeat this twenty times and yet never when they start for the string seem to know where their courage will fail nay they will even order the small boys to hold the string higher i have smiled at this but it was the same courage while the difficulty is far off that took me to the loups at sight of them i turned away  i prayed to god for a little of the mettle of other men and he heard me for with my eyes shut i seemed to see margaret beckoning from across the abyss as if she had need of me then i rose calmly and tested the chains and crossed them on my breast many have done it with the same danger at which they laugh but without that vision i should have held back  i was now across the river and so had left the chance of drowning behind but i was farther from thrums than when i left the schoolhouse and this countryside was almost unknown to me the mist had begun to clear so that i no longer wandered into fields but though i kept to the roads i could not tell that they led toward thrums and in my exhaustion i had often to stand still then to make a new start in the mud was like pulling stakes out of the ground so long as the rain faced me i thought i could not be straying far but after an hour i lost this guide for a wind rose that blew it in all directions  in another hour when i should have been drawing near thrums i found myself in a wood and here i think my distress was greatest nor is this to be marvelled at for instead of being near thrums i was listening to the monotonous roar of the sea i was too spent to reason but i knew that i must have travelled direct east and must be close to the german ocean i remember putting my back against a tree and shutting my eyes and listening to the lash of the waves against the beach and hearing the faint toll of a bell and wondering listlessly on what lighthouse it was ringing doubtless i would have lain down to sleep forever had i not heard another sound near at hand it was the knock of a hammer on wood and might have been a fisherman mending his boat the instinct of selfpreservation carried me to it and presently i was at a little house a man was standing in the rain hammering new hinges to the door and though i did not recognize him i saw with bewilderment that the woman at his side was nanny  its the dominie she cried and her brother added  losh sir you hinna the look o a living man  nanny i said in perplexity what are you doing here  whaur else should i be she asked  i pressed my hands over my eyes crying where am i  nanny shrank from me but sanders said has the rain driven you gyte man youre in thrums  but the sea i said distrusting him i hear it listen  thats the wind in windyghoul sanders answered looking at me queerly come awa into the house     thrums during the twentyfour hoursdefence of the manse  hardly had i crossed the threshold of the mudhouse when such a sickness came over me that i could not have looked up though nannys voice had suddenly changed to margarets vaguely i knew that nanny had put the kettle on the firea womans first thought when there is illness in the houseand as i sat with my hands over my face i heard the water dripping from my clothes to the floor  why is that bell ringing i asked at last ignoring all questions and speaking through my fingers an artist i suppose could paint all expression out of a human face the sickness was having that effect on my voice  its the auld licht bell sanders said and its almost as fearsome to listen to as last nichts rain i wish i kent what theyre ringing it for  wish no sic things said nanny nervously  theres things its best to put off kenning as lang as we can  its that illcleakit witch erne mcbean that makes nanny speak so doleful sanders told me there was to be a prayermeeting last nicht but mr dishart never came to t though they rang till they wraxed their arms and now effie says itll ring on by itsel till hes brocht hame a corp the hellicat says the rains a dispensation to drown him in for neglect o duty sal i would think little o the lord if he needed to create a new sea to drown one man in nanny yon cuttie thats no swearing i defy you to find a single lonely oath in what ive said  never mind effie mcbean i interposed what are the congregation saying about the ministers absence  we ken little except what effie telled us nanny answered i was at tilliedrum yestreen meeting sanders as he got out o the gaol and that awfu onding began when we was on the bellies braes we focht our way through it but not a soul did we meet and wha would gang out the day that can bide at hame ay but effie says its kent in thrums that mr dishart has run off wiwi an egyptian  youre waur than her nanny sanders said roughly for you hae twa reasons for kenning better in the first place has mr dishart no keeped you in siller a the time i was awa and for another have i no been at the manse  my head rose now  he gaed to the manse nanny explained to thank mr dishart for being so good to me ay but jean wouldna let him in im thinking that looks gey gray  whatever was her reason sanders admitted jean wouldna open the door but i keeked in at the parlor window and saw mrs dishart int looking very cosylike and lauching and do you think i would hae seen that if i had come ower the minister  not if margaret knew of it i said to myself and wondered at whamonds forbearance  she had a skein o worsted stretched out on her hands sanders continued and a young leddy was winding it i didna see her richt but she wasna a thrums leddy  effie mcbean says shes his intended come to call him to account nanny said but i hardly listened for i saw that i must hurry to tammas whamonds nanny followed me to the gate with her gown pulled over her head and said excitedly  oh dominie i warrant its true itll be babbie sanders doesna suspect because ive telled him nothing about her oh whats to be done they were baith so good to me  i could only tell her to keep what she knew to herself  has rob dow come back i called out after i had started  whaur frae she replied and then i remembered that all these things had happened while nanny was at tilliedrum in this life some of the seven ages are spread over two decades and others pass as quickly as a stage play though a fifth of a seasons rain had fallen in a night and a day it had scarcely kept pace with gavin  i hurried to the town by the roods that brae was as deserted as the country roads except where children had escaped from their mothers to wade in it here and there dams were keeping the water away from one door to send it with greater volume to another and at points the ground had fallen in but this i noticed without interest i did not even realize that i was holding my head painfully to the side where it had been blown by the wind and glued by the rain i have never held my head straight since that journey  only a few looms were going their pedals in water i was addressed from several doors and windows once by charles yuill  dinna pretend he said that youve walked in frae the school house alane the rain chased me into this house yestreen and here it has keeped me though i bide no further awa than tillyloss  charles i said in a low voice why is the auld licht bell ringing  hae you no heard about mr dishart he asked ob man thats lang tammas in the kirk by himsel tearing at the bell to bring the folk thegither to depose the minister  instead of going to whamonds house in the school wynd i hastened down the bankers close to the kirk and had almost to turn back so choked was the close with floating refuse i could see the bell swaying but the kirk was locked and i battered on the door to no purpose then remembering that henry munn lived in coutts trance i set off for his house he saw me crossing the square but would not open his door until i was close to it  when i open he cried squeeze through quick but though i did his bidding a rush of water darted in before me hendry reclosed the door by flinging himself against it  when i saw you crossing the square he said it was surprise enough to cure the hiccup  hendry i replied instantly why is the auld licht bell ringing  he put his finger to his lip i see he said imperturbably youve met our folk in the glen and heard frae them about the minister  what folk  mair than half the congregation he replied i started for glen quharity twa hours syne to help the farmers you didna see them  no they must have been on the other side of the river again that question forced my lips why is the bell ringing  canny dominie he said till were up the stair mysy moncurs lugs at her keyhole listening to you  you lie hendry munn cried an invisible woman the voice became more plaintive i ken a heap hendry so you may as well tell me a  lick away at the bone you hae the shoemaker replied heartlessly and conducted me to his room up one of the few inside stairs then in thrums hendrys oddest furniture was five boxes fixed to the wait at such a height that children could climb into them from a high stool in these his bairns slept and so space was economized i could never laugh at the arrangement as i knew that betty had planned it on her deathbed for her mans sake five little heads bobbed up in their beds as i entered but more vexing to me was wearyworld on a stool  in by dominie he said sociably sal you needna fear burning wi a that water on you youre in mair danger o coming aboil  i want to speak to you alone hendry i said bluntly  you winna put me out hendry the alarmed policeman entreated mind you said in sic weather you would be friendly to a brute beast ay ay dominie whats your news its welcome be it good or bad you would meet the townsfolk in the glen and they would tell you about mr dishart what you hinna heard oh sirs hes a lost man there would hae been a meeting the day to depose him if so many hadna gaen to the glen but the mornll do as weel the very women is cursing him and the laddies has begun to gather stanes hes married on an egyp  hendry i cried like one giving an order  wearyworld step said hendry sternly and then added soft heartedly heres a bit news thatll open mysy moncurs door to you you can tell her frae me that the bells ringing just because i forgot to tie it up last nicht and the winds shaking it and i winna gang out in the rain to stop it  ay the policeman said looking at me sulkily she may open her door for that but itll no let me in tell me mair tell me wha the leddy at the manse is  out you go answered hendry once she opens the door you can shove your foot in and syne shes in your power he pushed wearyworld out and came back to me saying it was best to tell him the truth to keep him frae making up lies  but is it the truth i was told lang tammas  ay i ken that story but tammas has other work on hand  then tie up the bell at once hendry i urged  i canna he answered gravely tammas took the keys o the kirk fram me yestreen and winna gie them up he says the bells being rung by the hand o god  has he been at the manse does mrs dishart know  hes been at the manse twa or three times but jean barred him out shell let nobody in till the minister comes back and so the mistress kens nothing but whats the use o keeping it frae her ony langer  every use i said  none answered hendry sadly dominie the minister was married to the egyptian on the hill last nicht and tammas was witness not only were they married but theyve run aff thegither  you are wrong hendry i assured him telling as much as i dared i left mr dishart in my house  what but if that is so how did he no come back wi you  because he was nearly drowned in the flood  shell be wi him  he was alone  hendrys face lit up dimly with joy and then he shook his head tammas was witness he said can you deny the marriage  all i ask of you i answered guardedly is to suspend judgment until the minister returns  there can be nothing done at ony rate he said till the folk themsels come back frae the glen and i needna tell you how glad we would a be to be as fond o him as ever but tammas was witness  have pity on his mother man  weve done the best for her we could he replied we prigged wi tammas no to gang to the manse till we was sure the minister was living for if he has been drowned we said his mother need never ken what we were thinking o doing ay and were sorry for the young leddy too  what young lady is this you all talk of i asked  shes his intended ay you needna start she has come a the road frae glasgow to challenge him about the gypsy the pitiful thing is that mrs dishart lauched awa her fears and now theyre baith waiting for his return as happy as ignorance can make them  there is no such lady i said  but there is he answered doggedly for she came in a machine late last nicht and i was ane o a dozen that baith heard and saw it through my window it stopped at the manse near half an hour whats mair the lady hersel was at saml farquharsons in the tenements the day for twa hours  i listened in bewilderment and fear  samls bairns down wi scarlet fever and like to die and him being a widowman he has gone useless you mauna blame the wives in the tenements for hauding back theyre fleid to smit their ain litlins and as it happens samls friends is a aff to the glen weel he ran greeting to the manse for mr dishart and the lady heard him crying to jean through the door and what does she do but gang straucht to the tenements wi saml her goodness has naturally put the folk on her side against the minister  this does not prove her his intended i broke in  she was heard saying to saml answered the kirk officer that the minister being awa it was her duty to take his place yes and though she little kent it he was already married  hendry i said rising i must see this lady at once is she still at farquharsons house  she may be back again by this time tammas set off for samls as soon as he heard she was there but he just missed her i left him there an hour syne he was waiting for her determined to tell her all  i set off for the tenements at once declining hendrys company the wind had fallen so that the bell no longer rang but the rain was falling doggedly the streets were still deserted i pushed open the precentors door in the school wynd but there was no one in the house tibbie birse saw me and shouted from her door  hae you heard o mr dishart hell never daur show face in thrums again  without giving her a word i hastened to the tenements  the leddys no here saml farquharson told me and tammas is back at the manse again trying to force his way in  from saml too i turned with no more than a groan but he cried after me perdition on the man that has played that leddy false  had margaret been at her window she must have seen me so recklessly did i hurry up the ministers road with nothing in me but a passion to take whamond by the throat he was not in the garden the kitchen door was open jean was standing at it with her apron to her eyes  tammas whamond i demanded and my face completed the question  youre ower late she wailed hes wi her oh dominie whaurs the minister  you base woman i cried why did you unbar the door  it was the mistress she answered she heard him shaking it and i had to tell her wha it was dominie its a my wite he tried to get in last nicht and roared threats through the door and after he had gone awa she speired wha i had been speaking to i had to tell her but i said he had come to let her ken that the minister was taking shelter frae the rain in a farmhouse ay i said he was to bide there till the flood gaed down and thats how she has been easy a day i acted for the best but im sair punished now for when she heard tammas at the door twa or three minutes syne she ordered me to let him in so that she could thank him for bringingthe news last nicht despite the rain theyre in the parlor oh dominie gang in and stop his mouth  this was hard i dared not go to the parlor margaret might have died at sight of me i turned my face from jean  jean said some one opening the inner kitchen door why did you  she stopped and that was what turned me round as she spoke i thought it was the young lady when i looked i saw it was babbie though no longer in a gypsys dress then i knew that the young lady and babbie were one     how babbie spent the night of august fourth  how had the egyptian been spirited here from the spittal i did not ask the question to interest myself in babbie at that dire hour of margarets life would have been as impossible to me as to sit down to a book to others however it is only an old woman on whom the parlor door of the manse has closed only a garrulous dominie that is in pain outside it your eyes are on the young wife  when babbie was plucked off the hill she thought as little as gavin that her captor was rob dow close as he was to her he was but a shadow until she screamed the second time when he pressed her to the ground and tied his neckerchief over her mouth then in the moment that power of utterance was taken from her she saw the face that had startled her at nannys window halfcarried she was borne forward rapidly until some one seemed to rise out of the broom and strike them both they had only run against the doctors trap and huddling her into it dow jumped up beside her he tied her hands together with a cord for a time the horse feared the darkness in front more than the lash behind but when the rains became terrific it rushed ahead wildlyprobably with its eyes shut  in three minutes babbie went through all the degrees of fear in the first she thought lord rintoul had kidnapped her but no sooner had her captor resolved himself into dow drunk with the events of the day and night than in the earls hands would have lain safety next dow was forgotten in the dread of a sudden death which he must share and lastly the rain seemed to be driving all other horrors back that it might have her for its own her perils increased to the unbearable as quickly as an iron in the fire passes through the various stages between warmth and white heat then she had to do something and as she could not cry out she flung herself from the dogcart she fell heavily in caddani wood but the rain would not let her lie there stunned it beat her back to consciousness and she sat up on her knees and listened breathlessly staring in the direction the trap had taken as if her eyes could help her ears  all night i have said the rain poured but those charges only rode down the deluge at intervals as now and again one wave greater than the others stalks over the sea in the first lull it appeared to babbie that the storm had swept by leaving her to dow now she heard the rubbing of the branches and felt the torn leaves falling on her gown she rose to feel her way out of the wood with her bound hands then sank in terror for some one had called her name next moment she was up again for the voice was gavins who was hurrying after her as he thought down windyghoul he was no farther away than a whisper might have carried on a still night but she dared not pursue him for already dow was coming back she could not see him but she heard the horse whinny and the rocking of the dogcart dow was now at the brutes head and probably it tried to bite him for he struck it crying  would you stand still till i find her i heard her move this minute  babbie crouched upon a big stone and sat motionless while he groped for her her breathing might have been tied now as well as her mouth she heard him feeling for her first with his feet and then with his hands and swearing when his head struck against a tree  i ken youre within hearing he muttered and ill hae you yet i have a gullyknife in my hand listen  he severed a whinstalk with the knife and babbie seemed to see the gleam of the blade  what do i mean by wanting to kill you he said as if she had asked the question do you no ken wha said to me kill this woman it was the lord i winna kill her i said but ill cart her out o the country kill her says he why encumbereth she the ground  he resumed his search but with new tactics i see you now he would cry and rush forward perhaps within a yard of her then she must have screamed had she had the power when he tied that neckerchief round her mouth he prolonged her life  then came the second hurricane of rain so appalling that had babbies hands been free she would have pressed them to her ears for a full minute she forgot dows presence a living thing touched her face the horse had found her she recoiled from it but its frightened head pressed heavily on her shoulder she rose and tried to steal away but the brute followed and as the rain suddenly exhausted itself she heard the dragging of the dogcart she had to halt  again she heard dows voice perhaps he had been speaking throughout the roar of the rain if so it must have made him deaf to his own words he groped for the horses head and presently his hand touched babbies dress then jumped from it so suddenly had he found her no sound escaped him and she was beginning to think it possible that he had mistaken her for a bush when his hand went over her face he was making sure of his discovery  the lord has delivered you into my hands he said in a low voice with some awe in it then he pulled her to the ground and sitting down beside her rocked himself backward and forward his hands round his knees she would have bartered the world for power to speak to him  he wouldna hear o my just carting you to some other countryside he said confidentially the devil would just blaw her back again says he therefore kill her and if i kill her i says theyll hang me you can hang yoursel says he what wi i speirs wi the reins o the dogcart says he they would break says i weel weel says he though they do hang you nobodyll miss you thats true says i and you are a just god  he stood up and confronted her  prisoner at the bar he said hae ye onything to say why sentence of death shouldna be pronounced against you she doesna answer she kens death is her deserts  by this time he had forgotten probably why his victim was dumb  prisoner at the bar hand back to me the soul o gavin dishart you winna did the devil your master summon you to him and say either that noble man or me maun leave thrums he did and did you or did you no drag that minister when under your spell to the hill and there marry him ower the tongs you did witnesses rob dow and tammas whamond  she was moving from him on her knees meaning when out of arms reach to make a dash for life  sit down he grumbled or how can you expect a fair trial prisoner at the bar you have been found guilty of witchcraft  for the first time his voice faltered  thats the difficulty for witches canna die except by burning or drowning theres no blood in you for my knife and your neck wouldna twist your master has brocht the rain to put out a the fires and well hae to wait till it runs into a pool deep enough to drown you  i wonder at you god do you believe her masterll mak the pool for her hell rather stop his rain mr dishart said you was mair powerful than the devil butit doesna look like it if you had the power how did you no stop this woman working her will on the minister you kent what she was doing for you ken a things mr dishart says you ken a things if you do the mair shame to you would a shepherd that could help it let dogs worry his sheep kill her its fine to cry kill her but whaurs the bonfire whaurs the pool you that made the heaven and the earth and all that in them is can you no set fire to some wet whins or change this stane into a milldam  he struck the stone with his fist and then gave a cry of exultation he raised the great slab in his arms and flung it from him in that moment babbie might have run away but she fainted almost simultaneously with dow she knew this was the stone which covered the caddam well when she came to dow was speaking and his voice had become solemn  you said your master was mair powerful than mine and i said it too and all the time you was sitting here wi the very pool aneath you that i have been praying for listen  he dropped a stone into the well and she heard it strike the water  what are you shaking at he said in reproof was it no yoursel that chose the spot lassie say your prayers are you saying them  he put his hand over her face to feel if her lips were moving and tore off the neckerchief  and then again the rain came between them in that rain one could not think babbie did not know that she had bitten through the string that tied her hands she planned no escape but she flung herself at the place where dow had been standing he was no longer there and she fell heavily and was on her feet again in an instant and running recklessly trees intercepted her and she thought they were dow and wrestled with them by and by she fell into windyghoul and there she crouched until all her senses were restored to her when she remembered that she had been married lately  how long dow was in discovering that she had escaped and whether he searched for her no one knows after a time he jumped into the dogcart again and drove aimlessly through the rain that wild journey probably lasted two hours and came to an abrupt end only when a tree fell upon the trap the horse galloped off but one of dows legs was beneath the tree and there he had to lie helpless for though the leg was little injured he could not extricate himself a night and day passed and he believed that he must die but even in this plight he did not forget the man he loved he found a piece of slate and in the darkness cut these words on it with his knife  me being about to die i solemnly swear i didna see the minister marrying an egyptian on the hill this nicht may i burn in hell if this is no true  signed rob dow  this document he put in his pocket and so preserved proof of what he was perjuring himself to deny     chapter xl  babbie and margaretdefence of the manse continued   the egyptian was mournful in windyghoul up which she had once danced and sung but you must not think that she still feared dow i felt mckenzies clutch on any arm for hours after he left me but she was far braver than i indeed dangers at which i should have shut my eyes only made hers gleam and i suppose it was sheer love of them that first made her play the coquette with gavin if she cried now it was not for herself it was because she thought she had destroyed him could i have gone to her then and said that gavin wanted to blot out the gypsy wedding that throbbing little breast would have frozen at once and the drooping head would have been proud again and she would have gone away forever without another tear  what do i say i am doing a wrong to the love these two bore each other babbie would not have taken so base a message from my lips he would have had to say the words to her himself before she believed them his what would he want her to do now was the only question she asked herself to follow him was useless for in that rain and darkness two people might have searched for each other all night in a single field that he would go to the spittal thinking her in rintouls dogcart she did not doubt and his distress was painful to her to think of but not knowing that the burns were in flood she underestimated his danger  remembering that the mudhouse was near she groped her way to it meaning to pass the night there but at the gate she turned away hastily hearing from the door the voice of a man she did not know to be nannys brother she wandered recklessly a short distance until the rain began to threaten again and then falling on her knees in the broom she prayed to god for guidance when she rose she set off for the manse  the rain that followed the flash of lightning had brought margaret to the kitchen  jean did you ever hear such a rain it is trying to break into the manse  i canna hear you maam is it the rain youre feared at  what else could it be  jean did not answer  i hope the minister wont leave the church jean till this is over  nobody would daur maam the rainll turn the key on them all  jean forced out these words with difficulty for she knew that the church had been empty and the door locked for over an hour  this rain has come as if in answer to the ministers prayer jean  it wasna rain like this they wanted  jean you would not attempt to guide the lords hand the minister will have to reprove the people for thinking too much of him again for they will say that he induced god to send the rain tonights meeting will be remembered long in thrums  jean shuddered and said its mair like an ordinary rain now maam  but it has put out your fire and i wanted another heater perhaps the one i have is hot enough though  margaret returned to the parlor and from the kitchen jean could hear the heater tilted backward and forward in the boxirona pleasant homely sound when there is happiness in the house soon she heard a step outside however and it was followed by a rough shaking of the barred door  is it you mr dishart jean asked nervously  its me tammas whamond the precentor answered unbar the door  what do you want speak low  i winna speak low let me in i hae news for the ministers mother  what news demanded jean  jean proctor as chief elder of the kirk i order you to let me do my duty  whaurs the minister  hes a minister no longer hes married a gypsy woman and run awa wi her  you lie tammas whamond i believe  your beliefs of no consequence open the door and let me in to tell your mistress what i hae seen  shell hear it first frae his ain lips if she hears it ava i winna open the door  then ill burst it open  whamond flung himself at the door and jean her fingers rigid with fear stood waiting for its fall but the rain came to her rescue by lashing the precentor until even he was forced to run from it  ill be back again he cried woe to you jean proctor that hae denied your god this nicht  who was that speaking to you jean asked margaret reentering the kitchen until the rain abated jean did not attempt to answer  i thought it was the precentors voice margaret said  jean was a poor hand at lying and she stuttered in her answer  there is nothing wrong is there cried margaret in sudden fright my son  nothing nothing  the words jumped from jean to save margaret from falling now she could not take them back i winna believe it o him said jean to herself let them say what they will ill be true to him and when he comes back hell find her as he left her  it was lang tammas she answered her mistress but he just came to say that  quick jean what  mr dishart has been called to a sickbed in the country maam to the farm o lookaboutyou and as its sic a rain hes to bide there a nicht  and whamond came through that rain to tell me this how good of him was there any other message  just that the minister hoped you would go straight to your bed maam said jean thinking to herself there can be no great sin in giving her one mair happy nicht it may be her last  the two women talked for a short time and then read verse about in the parlor from the third chapter of mark  this is the first night we have been left alone in the manse margaret said as she was retiring to her bedroom and we must not grudge the minister to those who have sore need of him i notice that you have barred the doors  ay theyre barred nobody can win in the nicht  nobody will want in jean margaret said smiling  i dinna ken about that answered jean below her breath ay maam may you sleep for baith o us this nicht for i daurna gang to my bed  jean was both right and wrong for two persons wanted in within the next halfhour and she opened the door to both of them the first to come was babbie  so long as women sit up of nights listening for a footstep will they flatten their faces at the window though all without be black jean had not been back in the kitchen for two minutes before she raised the blind her eyes were close to the glass when she saw another face almost meet hers as you may touch your reflection in a mirror but this face was not her own it was white and sad jean suppressed a cry and let the blind fall as if shutting the lid on some uncanny thing  wont you let me in said a voice that might have been only the sob of a rainbeaten wind i am nearly drowned  jean stood like death but her suppliant would not pass on  you are not afraid the voice continued raise the blind again and you will see that no one need fear me  at this request jeans hands sought each others company behind her back  wha are you she asked without stirring are youthe woman  yes  whaurs the minister  the rain again became wild but this time it only tore by the manse as if to a conflict beyond  are you aye there i daurna let you in till im sure the mistress is bedded gang round to the front and see if theres ony licht burning in the high west window  there was a light the voice said presently but it was turned out as i looked  then ill let you in and god kens i mean no wrang by it  babbie entered shivering and jean rebarred the door then she looked long at the woman whom her master loved babbie was on her knees at the hearth holding out her hands to the dead fire  what a pity its a fause face  do i look so false  is it true youre no married to him  yes it is true  and yet you look as if you was fond o him if you cared for him how could you do it  that was why i did it  and him could hae had wha he liked  i gave up lord rintoul for him  what na na youre the egyptian  you judge me by my dress  and soaking it is how youre shiveringwhat neat fingerswhat bonny little feet i could near believe what you tell me aff wi these rags an ill gie you on my black frock ifif you promise me no to gang awa wit  so babbie put on some clothes of jeans including the black frock and stockings and shoes  mr dishart cannot be back jean she said before morning and i dont want his mother to see me till he comes  i wouldna let you near her the nicht though you gaed on your knees to me but whaur is he  babbie explained why gavin had set off for the spittal but jean shook her head incredulously saying i canna believe youre that grand leddy and yet ilka time i look at you i could near believe it  in another minute jean had something else to think of for there came a loud rap upon the front door  its tammas whamond back again she moaned and if the mistress hears shell tell me to let him in  you shall open to me cried a hoarse voice  thats no tammas word jean said in bewilderment  it is lord rintoul babbie whispered  what then its truth you telled me  the knocking continued a door upstairs opened and margaret spoke over the banisters  have you gone to bed jean some one is knocking at the door and a minute ago i thought i heard a carriage stop close by perhaps the farmer has driven mr dishart home  im putting on my things maam jean answered then whispered to babbie whats to be done  he wont go away babbie answered you will have to let him into the parlor jean can she see the door from up there  no but though he was in the parlor  i shall go to him there  make haste jean margaret called if it is any persons wanting shelter we must give it them on such a night  a minute maam jean answered to babbie she whispered what shall i say to her  ii dont know answered babbie ruefully think of something jean but open the door now stop let me into the parlor first  the two women stole into the parlor  tell me what will be the result o his coming here entreated jean  the result babbie said firmly will be that he shall go away and leave me here  margaret heard jean open the front door and speak to some person or persons whom she showed into the parlor     chapter xli  rintoul and babbiebreakdown of the defence of the manse   you dare to look me in the face  they were rintouls words yet babbie had only ventured to look up because he was so long in speaking his voice was low but harsh like a wheel on which the brake is pressed sharply  it seems to be more than the man is capable of he added sourly  do you think babbie exclaimed taking fare that he is afraid of you  so it seems but i will drag him into the light wherever he is skulking  lord rintoul strode to the door and the brake was off his tongue already  go said babbie coldly and shout and stamp through the house you may succeed in frightening the women who are the only persons in it  where is he  he has gone to the spittal to see you  he knew i was on the hill  he lost me in the darkness and thought you had run away with me in your trap  ha so he is off to the spittal to ask me to give you back to him  to compel you corrected babbie  pooh said the earl nervously that was but mummery on the hill  it was a marriage  with gypsies for witnesses their word would count for less than nothing babbie i am still in time to save you  i dont want to be saved the marriage had witnesses no court could discredit  what witnesses  mr mckenzie and yourself  she heard his teeth meet when next she looked at him there were tears in his eyes as well as in her own it was perhaps the first time these two had ever been in close sympathy both were grieving for rintoul  i am so sorry babbie began in a broken voice then stopped because they seemed such feeble words  if you are sorry the earl answered eagerly it is not yet too late mckenzie and i saw nothing come away with me babbie if only in pity for yourself  ah but i dont pity myself  because this man has blinded you  no he has made me see  this mummery on the hill  why do you call it so i believe god approved of that marriage as he could never have countenanced yours and mine  god i never heard the word on your lips before  i know that  it is his teaching doubtless  yes  and he told you that to do to me as you have done was to be pleasing in gods sight  no he knows that it was so evil in gods sight that i shall suffer for it always  but he has done no wrong so there is no punishment for him  it is true that he has done no wrong but his punishment will be worse probably than mine  that said the earl scoffing is not just  it is just he has accepted responsibility for my sins by marrying me  and what form is his punishment to take  for marrying me he will be driven from his church and dishonored in all mens eyes unlessunless god is more merciful to us than we can expect  her sincerity was so obvious that the earl could no longer meet it with sarcasm  it is you i pity now he said looking wonderingly at her do you not see that this man has deceived you where was his boasted purity in meeting you by stealth as he must have been doing and plotting to take you from me  if you knew him babbie answered you would not need to be told that he is incapable of that he thought me an ordinary gypsy until an hour ago  and you had so little regard for me that you waited until the eve of what was to be our marriage and then laughing at my shame ran off to marry him  i am not so bad as that babbie answered and told him what had brought her to thrums i had no thought but of returning to you nor he of keeping me from you we had said goodby at the mudhouse doorand then we heard your voice  and my voice was so horrible to you that it drove you to this  ii love him so much  what more could babbie answer these words told him that if love commands home the friendships of a lifetime kindnesses incalculable are at once as naught nothing is so cruel as love if a rival challenges it to combat  why could you not love me babbie said the earl sadly i have done so much for you  it was little he had done for her that was not selfish men are deceived curiously in such matters when they add a new wing to their house they do not call the action virtue but if they give to a fellowcreature for their own gratification they demand of god a good mark for it babbie however was in no mood to make light of the earls gifts and at his question she shook her head sorrowfully  is it because i am tooold  this was the only time he ever spoke of his age to her  oh no it is not that she replied hastily i love mr dishart because he loves me i think  have i not loved you always  never babbie answered simply if you had perhaps then i should have loved you  babbie he exclaimed if ever man loved woman and showed it by the sacrifices he made for her i  no babbie said you dont understand what it is ah i did not mean to hurt you  if i dont know what it is what is it he asked almost humbly i scarcely know you now  that is it said babbie  she gave him back his ring and then he broke down pitifully doubtless there was good in him but i saw him only once and with nothing to contrast against it i may not now attempt to breathe life into the dust of his senile passion these were the last words that passed between him and babbie  there was nothing he said wistfully in this wide world that you could not have had by asking me for it was not that love  no she answered what right have i to everything i cry for  you should never have had a care had you married me that is love  it is not i want to share my husbands cares as i expect him to share mine  i would have humored you in everything  you always did as if a womans mind were for laughing at like a babys passions  you had your passions too babbie yet did i ever chide you for them that was love  no it was contempt oh she cried passionately what have not you men to answer for who talk of love to a woman when her face is all you know of her and her passions her aspirations are for kissing to sleep her very soul a plaything i tell you lord rintoul and it is all the message i send back to the gentlemen at the spittal who made love to me behind your back that this is a poor folly and well calculated to rouse the wrath of god  now jeans ear had been to the parlor keyhole for a time but some message she had to take to margaret and what she risked saying was this  its lord rintoul and a party that has been catched in the rain and he would be obliged to you if you could gie his bride shelter for the nicht  thus the distracted servant thought to keep margarets mind at rest until gavin came back  lord rintoul exclaimed margaret what a pity gavin has missed him of course she can stay here did you say i bad gone to bed i should not know what to say to a lord but ask her to come up to me after he has goneand jean is the parlor looking tidy  lord rintoul having departed jean told babbie how she had accounted to margaret for his visit and she telled me to gie you dry claethes and her compliments and would you gang up to the bedroom and see her  very slowly babbie climbed the stairs i suppose she is the only person who was ever afraid of margaret her first knock on the bedroom door was so soft that margaret who was sitting up in bed did not hear it when babbie entered the room margarets first thought was that there could be no other so beautiful as this and her second was that the stranger seemed even more timid than herself after a few minutes talk she laid aside her primness a weapon she had drawn in selfdefence lest this fine lady should not understand the grandeur of a manse and at a call me babbie wont you she smiled  that is what some other person calls you said margaret archly do you know that he took twenty minutes to say goodnight my dear she added hastily misinterpreting babbies silence i should have been sorry had he taken one second less every tick of the clock was a gossip telling me how he loves you  in the dim light a face that begged for pity was turned to margaret  he does love you babbie she asked suddenly doubtful  babbie turned away her face then shook her head  but you love him  again babbie shook her head  oh my dear cried margaret in distress if this is so are you not afraid to marry him  she knew now that babbie was crying but she did not know why babbie could not look her in the face  there may be times babbie said most woeful that she had not married rintoul when it is best to marry a man though we do not love him  you are wrong babbie margaret answered gravely if i know anything at all it is that  it may be best for others  do you mean for one other margaret asked and the girl bowed her head ah babbie you speak like a child  you do not understand  i do not need to be told the circumstances to know thisthat if two people love each other neither has any right to give the other up  babbie turned impulsively to cast herself on the mercy of gavins mother but no word could she say a hot tear fell from her eyes upon the coverlet and then she looked at the door as if to run away  but i have been too inquisitive margaret began whereupon babbie cried oh no no no you are very good i have no one who cares whether i do right or wrong  your parents  i have had none since i was a child  it is the more reason why i should be your friend margaret said taking the girls hand  you do not know what you are saying you cannot be my friend  yes dear i love you already you have a good face babbie as well as a beautiful one  babbie could remain in the room no longer she bade margaret good night and bent forward to kiss her then drew back like a judas ashamed  why did you not kiss me margaret asked in surprise but poor babbie walked out of the room without answering  of what occurred at the manse on the following day until i reached it i need tell little more when babbie was tending saml farquharsons child in the tenements she learned of the flood in glen quharity and that the greater part of the congregation had set off to the assistance of the farmers but fearful as this made her for gavins safety she kept the new anxiety from his mother deceived by another story of jeans margaret was the one happy person in the house  i believe you had only a lovers quarrel with lord rintoul last night she said to babbie in the afternoon ah you see i can guess what is taking you to the window so often you must not think him long in coming for you i can assure you that the rain which keeps my son from me must be sufficiently severe to separate even true lovers take an old womans example babbie if i thought the ministers absence alarming i should be in anguish but as it is my mind is so much at ease that see i can thread my needle  it was in less than an hour after margaret spoke thus tranquilly to babbie that the precentor got into the manse     chapter xlii  margaret the precentor and god between   unless andrew luke who went to canadas be still above ground i am now the only survivor of the few to whom lang tammas told what passed in the manse parlor after the door closed on him and margaret with the years the others lost the details but before i forget them the man who has been struck by lightning will look at his arm without remembering what shrivelled it there even came a time when the scene seemed more vivid to me than to the precentor though that was only after he began to break up  she was never the kind o woman whamond said that a body need be nane feared at you can see she is o the timid sort i couldna hae selected a woman easier to speak bold out to though i had haen my pick o them  he was a gaunt man sour and hard and he often paused in his story with a puzzled look on his forbidding face  but man she was so michty windy o him if he had wanted to put a knife into her i believe that woman would just hae telled him to take care no to cut his hands ay and what innocentlike she was if she had heard enough afore i saw her to make her uneasy i could hae begun at once but here she was shaking my hand and smiling to me so that aye when i tried to speak i gaed through ither nobody can despise me for it i tell you mair than i despise mysel  i thocht to mysel let her hae her smile out tammas whamond its her hinmost syne wi shame at my cowardliness i tried to yoke to my duty as chief elder o the kirk and i said to her as thrawn as i could speak dinna thank me ive done nothing for you  i ken it wasna for me you did it she said but for him but oh mr whamond will that make me think the less o you hes my all she says wi that smile back in her face and a look mixed up wit that said as plain and i need no more i thocht o saying that some builds their house upon the sand butdagont dominie its a solemn thing the pride mithers has in their laddies i mind aince my ain mitherwhat the devil are you glowering at andrew luke do you think im greeting  youll sit down mr whamond she says next  no i winna i said angrylike i didna come here to sit  i could see she thocht i was shy at being in the manse parlor ay and i thocht she was pleased at me looking shy weel she took my hat out o my hand and she put it on the chair at the door whaur theres aye an auld chair in grand houses for the servant to sit on at family exercise  youre a man mr whamond says she that the minister delights to honor and so youll oblige me by sitting in his own armchair  gavin never quite delighted to honor the precentor of whom he was always a little afraid and perhaps margaret knew it but you must not think less of her for wanting to gratify her sons chief elder she thought too that he had just done her a service i never yet knew a good woman who did not enjoy flattering men she liked  i saw my chance at that whamond went on and i says to her sternly in worldly position i says im a common man and its no for the like o sic to sit in a ministers chair but it has been gods will i says to wrap around me the mantle o chief elder o the kirk and if the minister falls awa frae grace it becomes my duty to take his place  if she had been looking at me she maun hae grown feared at that and syne i could hae gone on though my ilka word was a knockdown blow but she was picking some things aff the chair to let me down ont  its a pair o mittens im working for the minister she says and she handed them to me ay i tried no to take them butoh lads its queer to think how saft i was  hes no to ken about them till theyre finished she says terrible fondlike  the words came to my mouth theyll never be finished and i could hae cursed mysel for no saying them i dinna ken how it was but there was something pitiful in seeing her take up the mittens and begin working cheerily at one and me kenning all the time that they would never be finished i watched her fingers and i said to mysel another stitch and that maun be your last i said that to mysel till i thocht it was the needle that said it and i wondered at her no hearing  in the tail o the day i says you needna bother hell never wear them and they sounded sic words o doom that i rose up off the chair ay but she took me up wrang and she said i see you have noticed how careless o his ain comforts he is and that in his zeal he forgets to put on his mittens though they may be in his pocket a the time ay says she confidentlike but he winna forget these mittens mr whamond and ill tell you the reason its because theyre his mothers work  i stamped my foot and she gae me an apologetic look and she says i canna help boasting about his being so fond o me  ay but here was me saying to mysel do your duty tammas whamond you sluggard your duty and without lifting my een frae her fingers i said sternly the chances are i said that these mittens will never be worn by the hands they are worked for  you mean says she that hell gie them awa to some illoff body as he gies near a thing he has ay but theres one thing he never parts wi and thats my work theres a young lady in the manse the now says she that offered to finish the mittens for me but he would value them less if i let ony other body put a stitch into them  i thocht to mysel tammas whamond the lord has opened a door to you and youll be disgraced forever if you dinna walk straucht in so i rose again and i says boldly this time whaurs that young leddy i hae something to say to her that canna be kept waiting  shes up the stair she says surprised but you canna ken her mr whamond for she just came last nicht  i ken mair o her than you think says i i ken what brocht her here and ken wha she thinks she is to be married to and ive come to tell her that shell never get him  how no she said amazed like  because said i wi my teeth thegither he is already married  lads i stood waiting to see her fall and when she didna fall i just waited langer thinking she was slow in taking it a in  i see you ken wha she is she said looking at me and yet i canna credit your news  theyre true i cries  even if they are says she considering it may be the best thing that could happen to baith o them  i sank back in the chair in fair bewilderment for i didna ken at that time as we a ken now that she was thinking o the earl when i was thinking o her son dominie it looked to me as if the lord had opened a door to me and syne shut it in my face  syne wi me sitting there in a kind o awe o the womans simpleness she began to tell me what the minister was like when he was a bairn and i was saying a the time to mysel youre chief elder o the kirk tammas whamond and you maun speak out the next time she stops to draw breath they were terrible sma common things she telled me sic as near a mithers minds about their bairns but the kind o holy way she said them drove my words down my throat like as if i was some infidel man trying to break out wi blasphemy in akirk  ill let you see something says she that i ken will interest you  she brocht it out o a drawer and what do you thitik it was as sure as death it was no more than some o his hair when he was a litlin and it was tied up sic carefully in paper that you would hae thocht it was some valuable thing  mr whamond she says solemnly youve come thrice to the manse to keep me frae being uneasy about my sons absence and you was the chief instrument under god in bringing him to thrums and ill gie you a little o that hair  dagont what did i care about his hair and yet to see her fondling it i says to myself mrs dishart i says to mysel i was the chief instrument under god in bringing him to thrums and ive come here to tell you that im to be the chief instrument under god in driving him out ot ay but when i focht to bring out these words my mouth snecked like a box  dinna gie me his hair was a i could say and i wouldna take it frae her but she laid it in my hand andand syne what could i do ay its easy to speak about thae things now and to wonder how i could hae so disgraced the position o chief elder o the kirk but i tell you i was near greeting for the woman call me names dominie i deserve them all  i did not call whamond names for being reluctant to break margarets heart here is a confession i may make sometimes i say my prayers at night in a hurry going on my knees indeed but with as little reverence as i take a drink of water before jumping into bed and for the same reason because it is my nightly habit i am only pattering words i have by heart to a chair then and should be as well employed writing a comic bible at such times i pray for the earthly wellbeing of the precentor though he has been dead for many years he crept into my prayers the day he told me this story and was part of them for so long that when they are only a recitation he is part of them still  she said to me whamond continued that the women o the congregation would be fond to handle the hair could i tell her that the women was waur agin him than the men i shivered to hear her  syne when theyre asitting breathless listening to his preaching she says theyll be able to picture him as a bairn just as i often do in the kirk mysel  andrew luke youre sneering at me but i tell you if you had been there and had begun to say hell preach in our kirk no more i would hae struck you and im chief elder o the kirk  she says oh mr whamond theres times in the kirk when he is praying and the glow on his face is hardly mortal so that i fall ashaking wi a mixture fear and pride me being his mother and sinful though i am to say it i canna help thinking at sic times that i ken what the mother o jesus had in her heart when she found him in the temple  dominie its saxandtwenty years since i was made an elder o the kirk i mind the day as if it was yestreen mr carfrae made me walk hame wi him and he took me into the manse parlor and he set me in that very chair it was the first time i was ever in the manse ay he little thocht that day in his earnestness and i little thocht mysel in the pride o my lusty youth that the time was coming when i would sweat in that reverenced parlor i say swear dominie for when she had finished i jumped to my feet and i cried hell and i lifted up my hat and i was chief elder  she fell back frae my oath he said and syne she took my sleeve and speired what has come ower you mr whamond hae you onything on your mind  ive sin on it i roared at her i have neglect o duty on it i am one o them that cries lord lord and yet do not the things which he commands he has pointed out the way to me and i hinna followed it  what is it you hinna done that you should hae done she said oh mr whamond if you want my help its yours  your sons a the earth to you i cried but my elderships as muckle to me saxandtwenty years hae i been an elder and now i maun gie it up  wha says that she speirs  i say it i cried ive shirked my duty i gie ap my eldership now tammas whamond is no langer an elder o the kirk ay and i was chief elder  dominie i think she began to say that when the minister came hame he wouldna accept my resignation but i paid no heed to her you ken what was the sound that keeped my ears frae her words it was the sound o a machine coming yont the tenements you ken what was the sicht that made me glare through the window instead o looking at her it was the sicht o mr dishart in the machine i couldna speak but i got my body atween her and the window for i heard shouting and i couldna doubt that it was the folk cursing him  but she heard too she heard too and she squeezed by me to the window i couldna look out i just walked saftlike to the parlor door but afore i reached it she cried joyously  its my son come back and see how fond o him they are they are running at the side o the machine and the laddies are tossing their bonnets in the air  god help you woman i said to mysel it canna be bonnets its stanes and divits mair likely that theyre flinging at him syne i creeped out o the manse dominie you mind i passed you in the kitchen and didna say a word  yes i saw the precentor pass through the kitchen with such a face on him as no man ever saw him wear again since tammas whamond died we have had to enlarge the thrums cemetery twice so it can matter not at all to him and but little to me what you who read think of him all his life children ran from him he was the dourest the most unlovable man in thrums but may my right hand wither and may my tongue be cancerbitten and may my mind be gone into a dry rot before i forget what he did for me and mine that day     chapter xliii  rainmistthe jaws   to this day we argue in the glen about the sound mistaken by many of us for the firing of the spittal cannon some calling it thunder and others the tearing of trees in the torrent i think it must have been the roll of stones into the quharity from silver hill of which a corner has been missing since that day silver hill is all stones as if creation had been riddled there and in the sun the mica on them shines like many pools of water  at the roar as they thought of the cannon the farmers looked up from their struggle with the flood to say thats rintoul married as clocks pause simultaneously to strike the hour then every one in the glen save gavin and myself was done with rintoul before the hills had answered the noise gavin was on his way to the spittal the dog must have been ten minutes in overtaking him yet he maintained afterward that it was with him from the start from this we see that the shock he had got carried him some distance before he knew that he had left the schoolhouse it also gave him a new strength that happily lasted longer than his daze of mind  gavin moved northward quicker than i came south climbing over or wading through his obstacles while i went round mine after a time too the dog proved useful for on discovering that it was going homeward it took the lead and several times drew him to the right road to the spittal by refusing to accompany him on the wrong road yet in two hours he had walked perhaps nine miles without being four miles nearer the spittal in that flood the glen milestones were three miles apart  for some time he had been following the dog doubtfully for it seemed to be going too near the river when they struck a cart track however he concluded rightly that they were nearing a bridge his faith in his guide was again tested before they had been many minutes on this sloppy road the dog stopped whined looked irresolute and then ran to the right disappearing into the mist in an instant he shouted to it to come back and was surprised to hear a whistle in reply this was sufficient to make him dash after the dog and in less than a minute he stopped abruptly by the side of a shepherd  have you brocht it the man cried almost into gavins ear yet the roar of the water was so tremendous that the words came faintly as if from a distance wae is me is it only you mr dishart  is it only you no one in the glen would have addressed a minister thus except in a matter of life of death and gavin knew it  hell be ower late the shepherd exclaimed rubbing his hands together in distress im speaking o whinbusses grieve he has run for ropes but hell be ower late  is there some one in danger asked gavin who stood he knew not where with this man enveloped in mist  is there no look  there is nothing to be seen but mist where are we  were on the high bank o the quharity take care man you was stepping ower into the roaring water lie down and tell me if hes there yet maybe i just think that i see him for the sicht is painted on my een  gavin lay prone and peered at the river but the mist came up to his eyes he only knew that the river was below from the sound  is there a man down there he asked shuddering  there was a minute syne on a bit island  why does he not speak  he is senseless dinna move the mists clearing and youll see if hes there syne the mist has been lifting and falling that way ilka minute since me and the grieve saw him  the mist did not rise it only shook like a blanket and then again remained stationary but in that movement gavin had seen twice first incredulously and then with conviction  shepherd he said rising it is lord rintoul  ay its him and you saw his feet was in the water they were dry when the grieve left me mr dishart the ground he is on is being washed awa bit by bit i tell you the floods greedy for him and itll hae himlook did you see him again  is he living  we saw him move hst was that a cry  it was only the howling of the dog which had recognized its master and was peering over the bank the body quivering to jump but the legs restless with indecision  if we were down there gavin said we could hold him secure till rescue comes it is no great jump  how far would you make it i saw him again  it looked further that time  thats it sometimes the ground he is on looks so near that you think you could almost drop on it and the next time its yards and yards awa ive stood ready for the spring mr dishart a dozen times but i aye sickened i daurna do it look at the dog just when its starting to jump it pulls itsel back  as if it had heard the shepherd the dog jumped at that instant  it sprang too far gavin said  it didna spring far enough  they waited and presently the mist thinned for a moment as if it was being drawn out they saw the earl but there was no dog  poor brute said the shepherd and looked with awe at gavin  rintotil is slipping into the water gavin answered you wont jump  no im wae for him and  then i will gavin was about to say but the shepherd continued and him only married twa hours syne  that kept the words in gavins mouth for half a minute and then he spoke them  dinna think ot cried the shepherd taking him by the coat the ground he is on is slippery ive flung a dozen stanes at it and them that hit it slithered off though you landed in the middle ot you would slide into the water  he shook himsel free o me the shepherd told afterward and i saw him bending down and measuring the distance wi his een as cool as if he was calculating a drill o tatties syne i saw his lips moving in prayer it wasna spunk he needed to pray for though next minute there was me my very arms prigging wi him to think better ot and him standing ready to loup has knees bent and not a tremble in them the mist lifted and ilads i couldna gie a look to the earl mr dishart jumped i hardly saw him but i kent i kent for i was on the bank alane what did i do i flung mysel down in a sweat and if een could bore mist mine would hae done it i thocht i heard the ministers deathcry and may i be struck if i dinna believe now that it was a skirl o my ain after that there was no sound but the jaw o the water and i prayed but no to god to the mist to rise and after an awful time it rose and i saw the minister was safe he had pulled the earl into the middle o the bit island and was rubbing him back to consciousness i sweat when i think ot yet  the little ministers jump is always spoken of as a brave act in the glen but at such times i am silent this is not because being timid myself i am without admiration for courage my little maid says that three in every four of my poems are to the praise of prowess and she has not forgotten how i carried her on my shoulder once to tilliedrum to see a soldier who had won the victoria cross and made her shake hands with him though he was very drunk only last year one of my scholars declared to me that nelson never said england expects every man this day to do his duty for which i thrashed the boy and sent him to the cooling stone but was it brave of gavin to jump i have heard some maintain that only misery made him so bold and others that he jumped because it seemed a fine thing to risk his life for an enemy but these are really charges of cowardice and my boy was never a coward of the two kinds of courage however he did not then show the nobler i am glad that he was ready for such an act but he should have remembered margaret and babbie as it was he may be said to have forced them to jump with him not to attempt a gallant deed for which one has the impulse may be braver than the doing of it  though it seemed as lang time the shepherd says as i could hae run up a hill in i dinna suppose it was many minutes afore i saw rintoul opening and shutting his een the next glint i had o them they were speaking to ane another ay and mair than speaking they were quarrelling i couldna hear their words but there was a moment when i thocht they were to grapple lads the memory o thatll hing about deathbed there was twa men edicated to the highest pitch ane a lord and the other a minister and the flood was taking awa a mouthful o their footing ilka minute and the jaws o destruction was gaping for them and yet they were near fechting we ken now it was about a woman ay but does that make it less awful  no that did not make it less awful it was even awful that gavins first words when rintoul opened his eyes and closed them hastily were where is she the earl did not answer indeed for the moment the words had no meaning to him  how did i come here he asked feebly  you should know better than i where is my wife  i remember now rintoul repeated several times yes i had left the spittal to look for youyou were so long in coming how did i find you  it was i who found you gavin answered you must have been swept away by the flood  and you too  in a few words gavin told how he came to be beside the earl  i suppose they will say you have saved my life was rintouls commentary  it is not saved yet if help does not come we shall be dead men in an hour what have you done with my wife  rintoul ceased to listen to him and shouted sums of money to the shepherd who shook his head and bawled an answer that neither gavin nor the earl heard across that thundering water only gavins voice could carry the most powerful ever heard in a thrums pulpit the one voice that could be heard all over the commonty during the time of the tentpreaching yet he never roared as some preachers do of whom we say ah if they could hear the little ministers word  gavin caught the gesticulating earl by the sleeve and said another man has gone for ropes now listen to me how dared you go through a marriage ceremony with her knowing her already to be my wife  rintoul did listen this time  how do you know i married her he asked sharply  i heard the cannon  now the earl understood and the shadow on his face shook and lifted and his teeth gleamed his triumph might be shortlived but he would enjoy it while he could  well he answered picking the pebbles for his sling with care you must know that i could not have married her against her will the frolic on the hill amused her but she feared you might think it serious and so pressed me to proceed with her marriage today despite the flood  this was the point at which the shepherd saw the minister raise his fist it fell however without striking  do you really think that i could doubt her gavin said compassionately and for the second time in twentyfour hours the earl learned that he did not know what love is  for a full minute they had forgotten where they were now again the water seemed to break loose so that both remembered their danger simultaneously and looked up the mist parted for long enough to show them that where had only been the shepherd was now a crowd of men with here and there a woman before the mist again came between the minister had recognized many members of his congregation  in his unsuccessful attempt to reach whinbusses the grieve had met the relief party from thrums already the weavers had helped waster lunny to stave off ruin and they were now on their way to whinbusses keeping together through fear of mist and water every few minutes snecky hobart rang his bell to bring in stragglers  follow me was all the panting grieve could say at first but his agitation told half his story they went with turn patiently only stopping once and then excitedly for they come suddenly on rob dow rob was still lying a prisoner beneath the tree and the grieve now remembered that he had fallen over this tree and neither noticed the man under it nor been noticed by the man fifty hands released poor dow and two men were commissioned to bring him along slowly while the others hurried to the rescue of the earl they were amazed to learn from the shepherd that mr dishart also was in danger and after is there a woman wi him some cried hell get off cheap wi drowning and its the judgment o god  the island on which the two men stood was now little bigger than the round tables common in thrums and its centre was some feet farther from the bank than when gavin jumped a woman looking down at it sickened and would have toppled into the water had not john spens clutched her others were so stricken with awe that they forgot they had hands  peter tosh the elder cast a rope many times but it would not carry the one end was then weighted with a heavy stone and the other tied round the waists of two men but the force of the river had been underestimated the stone fell short into the torrent which rushed off with it so furiously that the men were flung upon their faces and trailed to the verge of the precipice a score of persons sprang to their rescue and the rope snapped there was only one other rope and its fate was not dissimilar this time the stone fell into the water beyond the island and immediately rushed down stream gavin seized the rope but it pressed against his body and would have pushed him off his feet had not tosh cut it the trunk of the tree that had fallen on rob dow was next dragged to the bank and an endeavor made to form a sloping bridge of it the island however was now soft and unstable and though the trunk was successfully lowered it only knocked lumps off the island and finally it had to be let go as the weavers could not pull it back it splashed into the water and was at once whirled out of sight some of the party on the bank began hastily to improvise a rope of cravats and the tags of the ropes still left but the mass stood helpless and hopeless  you may wonder that we could have stood still waiting to see the last o them birse the post has said to me in the school house but dominie i couldna hae moved magre my neck im a hale man but if this minute we was to hear the voice o the almighty saying solemnly afore the clock strikes again birse the post will fall down dead of heart disease what do you think you would do ill tell you you would stand whaur you are and stare tonguetied at me till i dropped how do i ken by the teaching o that nicht ay but theres a mair important thing i dinna ken and that is whether i would be palsied wi fear like the earl or face death with the calmness o the minister  indeed the contrast between rintoul and gavin was now impressive when tosh signed that the weavers had done their all and failed the two men looked in each others faces and gavins face was firm and the earls working convulsively the people had given up attempting to communicate with gavin save by signs for though they heard his sonorous voice when he pitched it at them they saw that he caught few words of theirs he heard our skirls birse said but couldna grip the words ony mair than we could hear the earl and yet we screamed and the minister didna ive heard o highlandmen wi the same gift so that they could be heard across a glen  we must prepare for death gavin said solemnly to the earl and it is for your own sake that i again ask you to tell me the truth worldly matters are nothing to either of us now but i implore you not to carry a lie into your makers presence  i will not give up hope was all rintouls answer and he again tried to pierce the mist with offers of reward after that he became doggedly silent fixing his eyes on the ground at his feet i have a notion that he had made up his mind to confess the truth about babbie when the water had eaten the island as far as the point at which he was now looking     chapter xliv  end of the twentyfour hours   out of the mist came the voice of gavin clear and strong  if you hear me hold up your hands as a sign  they heard and none wondered at his voice crossing the chasm while theirs could not when the mist cleared they were seen to have done as he bade them many hands remained up for a time because the people did not remember to bring them down so great was the awe that had fallen on all as if the lord was near  gavin took his watch from his pocket and he said  i am to fling this to you you will give it to mr ogilvy the schoolmaster as a token of the love i bear him  the watch was caught by james langlands and handed to peter tosh the chief elder present  to mr ogilvy gavin continued you will also give the chain you will take it off my neck when you find the body  to each of my elders and to hendry munn kirk officer and to my servant jean i leave a book and they will go to my study and choose it for themselves  i also leave a book for nanny webster and i charge you peter tosh to take it to her though she be not a member of my church  the pictorial bible with to my son on his sixth birthday on it i bequeath to rob dow no my mother will want to keep that i give to rob dow my bible with the brass clasp  it is my wish that every family in the congregation should have some little thing to remember me by this you will tell my mother  to my successor i leave whatsoever of my papers he may think of any value to him including all my notes on revelation of which i meant to make a book i hope he will never sing the paraphrases  if mr carfraes health permits you will ask him to preach the funeral sermon but if he be too frail then you will ask mr trail under whom i sat in glasgow the illustrated pilgrims progress on the drawers in my bedroom belongs to mr trail and you will return it to him with my affection and compliments  i owe five shillings to hendry munn for mending my boots and a smaller sum to baxter the mason i have two pounds belonging to rob dow who asked me to take charge of them for him i owe no other man anything and this you will bear in mind if matthew cargill the flying stationer again brings forward a claim for the price of whistons josephus which i did not buy from him  mr moncur of aberbrothick had agreed to assist me at the sacrament and will doubtless still lend his services mr carfrae or mr trail will take my place if my successor is not elected by that time the sacrament cups are in the vestry press of which you will find the key beneath the clock in my parlor the tokens are in the topmost drawer in my bedroom  the weekly prayermeeting will be held as usual on thursday at eight oclock and the elders will officiate  it is my wish that the news of my death be broken to my mother by mr ogilvy the schoolmaster and by no other you will say to him that this is my solemn request and that i bid him discharge it without faltering and be of good cheer  but if mr ogilvy be not now alive the news of my death will be broken to my mother by my beloved wife last night i was married on the hill over the tongs but with the sanction of god to her whom you call the egyptian and despite what has happened since then of which you will soon have knowledge i here solemnly declare that she is my wife and you will seek for her at the spittal or elsewhere till you find her and you will tell her to go to my mother and remain with her always for these are the commands of her husband  it was then that gavin paused for lord rintoul had that to say to him which no longer could be kept back all the women were crying sore and also some men whose eyes had been dry at the coffining of their children  now i ken said cruickshanks who had been an atheist that its only the fool wha says in his heart there is no god  another said thats a man  another said that man has a religion to last him all through  a fourth said behold the kingdom of heaven is at hand  a fifth said thats our minister hes the minister o the auld licht kirk o thrums woe is me were to lose him  many cried our hearts was set hard against him o lord are you angry wi your servants that youre taking him frae us just when we ken what he is  gavin did not hear them and again he spoke  my brethren god is good i have just learned that my wife is with my dear mother at the manse i leave them in your care and in his  no more he said of babbie for the island was become very small  the lord calls me hence it is only for a little time i have been with you and now i am going away and you will know me no more too great has been my pride because i was your minister but he who sent me to labor among you is slow to wrath and he ever bore in mind that you were my first charge my people i must say to you farewell  then for the first time his voice faltered and wantingto go on he could not let us read he said quickly in the word of god in the fourteenth of matthew from the twentyeighth verse  he repeated these four verses  and peter answered him and said lord if it be thou bid me come unto thee on the water  and he said come and when peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to jesus  but when he saw the wind boisterous he was afraid and beginning to sink he cried saying lord save me  and immediately jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and said unto him o thou of little faith wherefore didst thou doubt  after this gavins voice was again steady and he said the sand glass is almost run out dearly beloved with what words shall i bid you goodby  many thought that these were to be the words for the mist parted and they saw the island tremble and half of it sink  my people said the voice behind the mist this is the text i leave with you lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth where moth and rust doth corrupt and where thieves break through and steal but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt and where thieves do not break through nor steal that text i read in the flood where the hand of god has written it all the poundnotes in the world would not dam this torrent for a moment so that we might pass over to you safely yet it is but a trickle of water soon to be dried up verily i say unto you only a few hours ago the treasures of earth stood between you and this earl and what are they now compared to this trickle of water god only can turn rivers into a wilderness and the watersprings into dry ground let his word be a lamp unto your feet and a light unto your path may he be your refuge and your strength amen  this amen he said quickly thinking death was now come he was seen to raise his hands but whether to heaven or involuntarily to protect his face as he fell none was sure for the mist again filled the chasm then came a clap of stillness no one breathed  but the two men were not yet gone and gavin spoke once more  let us sing in the twentythird psalm  he himself raised the tune and so long as they heard ms voice they sang    the lords my shepherd ill not want     he makes me down to lie    in pastures green he leadeth me     the quiet waters by    my soul he doth restore again     and me to walk doth make    within the paths of righteousness     evn for his own names sake    yea though i walk in deaths dark vale     yet will i fear none ill    for thou art with me and thy rod     and staff  but some had lost the power to sing in the first verse and others at deaths dark vale and when one man found himself singing alone he stopped abruptly this was because they no longer heard the minister  o lord peter tosh cried lift the mist for its mair than we can bear  the mist rose slowly and those who had courage to look saw gavin praying with the earl many could not look and some of them did not even see rob dow jump  for it was dow the man with the crushed leg who saved gavins life and flung away his own for it suddenly he was seen on the edge of the bank holding one end of the improvised rope in his hand as tosh says  it all happened in the opening and shutting o an eye its a queer thing to say but though i prayed to god to take awa the mist when he did raise it i couldna look i shut my een tight and held my arm afore my face like ane feared o being struck even when i daured to look my arm was shaking so that i could see rob both above it and below it he was on the edge crouching to leap i didna see wha had haud o the other end o the rope i heard the minister cry no dow no and it gae through me as quick as a stab that if rob jumped he would knock them both into the water but he did jump and you ken how it was that he didna knock them off  it was because he had no thought of saving his own life he jumped not at the island now little bigger than the seat of a chair but at the edge of it into the foam and with his arm outstretched for a second the hand holding the rope was on the dot of land gavin tried to seize the hand rintoul clutched the rope the earl and the minister were dragged together into safety and both left the water senseless gavin was never again able to lift his left hand higher than his head dows body was found next day near the schoolhouse     talk of a little maid since grown tall  my scholars have a game they call the little minister in which the boys allow the girls as a treat to join some of the characters in the real drama are omitted as of no importancethe dominie for instanceand the two best fighters insist on being dow and gavin i notice that the game is finished when dow dives from a haystack and gavin and the earl are dragged to the top of it by a rope though there should be another scene it is only a marriage which the girls have therefore to go through without the help of the boys this warns me that i have come to an end of my story for all except my little maid in the days when she sat on my knee and listened it had no end for after i told her how her father and mother were married a second time she would say and then i came didnt i oh tell me about me so it happened that when she was no higher than my staff she knew more than i could write in another book and many a time she solemnly told me what i had told her as  would you like me to tell you a story well its about a minister and the people wanted to be bad to him and then there was a flood and a flood is lochs falling instead of rain and so of course he was nearly drownded and he preached to them till they liked him again and so they let him marry her and they like her awful too and just think it was my father and thats all now tell me about grandmother when father came home  i told her once again that margaret never knew how nearly gavin was driven from his kirk for margaret was as one who goes to bed in the daytime and wakes in it and is not told that there has been a black night while she slept she had seen her son leave the manse the idol of his people and she saw them rejoicing as they brought him back of what occurred at the jaws as the spot where dow had saved two lives is now called she learned but not that these jaws snatched him and her from an ignominy more terrible than death for she never knew that the people had meditated driving him from his kirk this thrums is bleak and perhaps forbidding but there is a moment of the day when a setting sun dyes it pink and the people are like their town thrums was never colder in times of snow than were his congregation to their minister when the great rain began but his fortitude rekindled their hearts he was an obstinate minister and love had led him a dance but in the hour of trial he had proved himself a man  when gavin reached the manse and saw not only his mother but babbie he would have kissed them both but babbie could only say she does not know and then run away crying gavin put his arm round his mother and drew her into the parlor where he told her who babbie was now margaret had begun to love babbie already and had prayed to see gavin happily married but it was a long time before she went upstairs to look for his wife and kiss her and bring her down why was it a long time my little maid would ask and i had to tell her to wait until she was old and had a son when she would find out for herself  while gavin and the earl were among the waters two men were on their way to mr carfraes home to ask him to return with them and preach the auld licht kirk of thrums vacant and he came though now so done that he had to be wheeled about in a little coach he came in sorrow yet resolved to perform what was asked of him if it seemed gods will but instead of banishing gavin all he had to do was to remarry him and kirk him both of which things he did sitting in his coach as many can tell lang tammas spoke no more against gavin but he would not go to the marriage and he insisted on resigning his eldership for a year and a day i think he only once again spoke to margaret she was in the manse garden when he was passing and she asked him if he would tell her now why he had been so agitated when he visited her on the day of the flood he answered gruffly its no business o yours dr mcqueen was gavins best man he died long ago of scarlet fever so severe was the epidemic that for a week he was never in bed he attended fifty cases without suffering but as soon as he had bent over hendry munns youngest boys who both had it he said im smitted and went home to die you may be sure that gavin proved a good friend to micah dow i have the piece of slate on which rob proved himself a good friend to gavin it was in his pocket when we found the body lord rintoul returned to his english estates and never revisited the spittal the last thing i heard of him was that he had been offered the lordlieutenantship of a county and had accepted it in a long letter in which he began by pointing out his unworthiness this undid him for the queen or her councillors thinking from his first page that he had declined the honor read no further and appointed another man waster lunny is still alive but has gone to another farm sanders webster in his gratitude wanted nanny to become an auld licht but she refused saying mr dishart is worth a dozen o mr duthie and im terrible fond o mrs dishart but established i was born and established ill remain till im carried out o this house feet foremost  but nanny went to heaven for all that my little maid told me jean says people can go to heaven though they are not auld lichts but she says it takes them all their time would you like me to tell you a story about my mother putting glass on the manse dike well my mother and my father is very fond of each other and once they was in the garden and my father kissed my mother and there was a woman watching them over the dike and she cried outsomething naughty  it was tibbie birse i said and what she cried was mercy on us thats the third time in half an hour so your mother who heard her was annoyed and put glass on the wall  but its me that is telling you the story you are sure you dont know it well they asked father to take the glass away and he wouldnt but he once preached at mother for having a white feather in her bonnet and another time he preached at her for being too fond of him jean told me thats all  no one seeing babbie going to church demurely on gavins arm could guess her history sometimes i wonder whether the desire to be a gypsy again ever comes over her for a mad hour and whether if so gavin takes such measures to cure her as he threatened in caddam wood i suppose not but here is another story  when i ask mother to tell me about her once being a gypsy she says i am a bad quisitive little girl and to put on my hat and come with her to the prayermeeting and when i asked father to let me see mothers gypsy frock he made me learn psalm fortyeight by heart but once i seed it and it was a long time ago as long as a week ago micah dow gave me rowans to put in my hair and i like micah because he calls me miss and so i woke in my bed because there was noises and i ran down to the parlor and there was my mother in her gypsy frock and my rowans was in her hair and my father was kissing her and when they saw me they jumped and thats all  would you like me to tell you another story it is about a little girl well there was once a minister and his wife and they hadnt no little girls but just little boys and god was sorry for them so he put a little girl in a cabbage in the garden and when they found her they were glad would you like me to tell you who the little girl was well it was me and ugh i was awful cold in the cabbage do you like that story  yes i like it best of all the stories i know  so do i like it too couldnt nobody help loving me cause im so nice why am i so fearful nice  because you are like your grandmother  it was clever of my father to know when he found me in the cabbage that my name was margaret are you sorry grandmother is dead  i am glad your mother and father were so good to her and made her so happy  are you happy  yes  but when i am happy i laugh  i am old you see and you are young  i am nearly six did you love grandmother then why did you never come to see her did grandmother know you was here why not why didnt i not know about you till after grandmother died  ill tell you when you are big  shall i be big enough when i am six  no not till your eighteenth birthday  but birthdays comes so slow will they come quicker when i am big  much quicker  on her sixth birthday micah dow drove my little maid to the schoolhouse in the doctors gig and she crept beneath the table and whispered  grandfather  father told me to call you that if i liked and i like she said when i had taken her upon my knee i know why you kissed me just now it was because i looked like grandmother why do you kiss me when i look like her  who told you i did that  nobody didnt tell me i just found out i loved grandmother too she told me all the stories she knew  did she ever tell you a story about a black dog  no did she know one  yes she knew it  perhaps she had forgotten it  no she remembered it  tell it to me  not till you are eighteen  but will you not be dead when i am eighteen when you go to heaven will you see grandmother  yes  will she be glad to see you  my little maids eighteenth birthday has come and i am still in thrums which i love though it is beautiful to none perhaps save to the very done who lean on their staves and look long at it having nothing else to do till they die i have lived to rejoice in the happiness of gavin and babbie and if at times i have suddenly had to turn away my head after looking upon them in their home surrounded by their children it was but a moments envy that i could not help margaret never knew of the dominie in the glen they wanted to tell her of me but i would not have it she has been long gone from this world but sweet memories of her still grow like honeysuckle up the white walls of the manse smiling in at the parlor window and beckoning from the door and for some filling all the air with fragrance it was not she who raised the barrier between her and me but god himself and to those who maintain otherwise i say they do not understand the purity of a womans soul during the years she was lost to me her face ever came between me and ungenerous thoughts and now i can say all that is carnal in me is my own and all that is good i got from her only one bitterness remains when i found gavin in the rain when i was fighting my way through the flood when i saw how the hearts of the people were turned against himabove all when i found whamond in the mansei cried to god making promises to him if he would spare the lad for margarets sake and he spared him but these promises i have not kept  the end
