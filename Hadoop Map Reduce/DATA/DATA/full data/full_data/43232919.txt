quils sont devenuz se faict il plus rien de nouveau clement marot dialogue de deux amoureux  i love a ballad but even too well if it be doleful matter merrily set down or a very pleasant thing indeed and sung lamentably a winters tale act iv sc 3     introduction    thirty years have passed like a watch in the night since the earlier of the two sets of verses here reprinted ballades in blue china was published  at first there were but twentytwo ballades ten more were added later  they appeared in a little white vellum wrapper with a little blue chinese singer copied from a porcelain jar and the frontispiece was a little design by an etcher now famous  thirty years ago blue china was a kind of fetish in some circles aesthetic circles of which the balladist was not a member  the ballade was an old french form of verse in france revived by theodore de banville and restored to an england which had long forgotten the middle ages by my friends mr austin dobson and mr edmund gosse  they so far as i can trust my memory were the first to reintroduce these pleasant old french nugae while an anonymous author let loose upon the town a whole winged flock of ballades of amazing dexterity  this unknown balladist was mr henley perhaps he was the first englishman who ever burst into a double ballade and his translations of two of villons ballades into modern thieves slang were marvels of dexterity  mr swinburne wrote a serious ballade but the form i venture to think is not wholly serious of its nature in modern days and he did not persevere nor did the taste for these trifles long endure  a good ballade is almost as rare as a good sonnet but a middling ballade is almost as easily written as the majority of sonnets  either form readily becomes mechanical cheap and facile  i have heard mr george meredith improvise a sonnet a petrarchian sonnet obedient to the rules without pen and paper  he spoke and the numbers came he sonneted as easily as a living poet in his eton days improvised latin elegiacs and greek hexameters  the sonnet endures  mr horace hutchinson wrote somewhere  when you have read a sonnet you feel that though there does not seem to be much of it you have done a good deal as when you have eaten a cold hardboiled egg  still people keep on writing sonnets because the sonnet is wholly serious  in an english sonnet you cannot easily be flippant of pen  a few great poets have written immortal sonnetsamong them are milton wordsworth and keats thus the sonnet is a thing which every poet thinks it worth while to try at like felix arvers he may be made immortal by a single sonnet  even i have written one too many  every anthologist wants to anthologise it the odyssey it never was a favourite of my own though it had the honour to be kindly spoken of by mr matthew arnold  on the other hand no man since francois villon has been immortalised by a single ballademais ou sont les neiges dantan  to speak in any detail about these poor ballades would be to indite a part of an autobiography  looking back at the little book what memories it stirs in one to whom   fate has done this wrong that i should write too much and live too long   the ballade of the tweed and the rhymes a la mode were dedicated to the dearest of kinsmen a cricketer and angler  the ballade of roulette was inscribed to r r a gallant veteran of the indian mutiny a leader of light horse whose father was a friend of sir walter scott  he was himself a borderer in whose defeats on the green field of roulette i often shared long long ago  so many have gone into the world of light that it is a happiness to think of him to whom the ballade of golf was dedicated and to remember that he is still capable of scoring his double century at cricket and of lifting the ball high over the trees beyond the boundaries of a great cricketfield  perhaps mr leslie balfour melville will pardon me for mentioning his name linked as it is with so many common memories  one is taken and another left  a different sort of memory attaches itself to a ballade of dead cities  it was written in a theocritean amoebean way in competition with mr edmund gosse he need not be ashamed of the circumstance for another shepherd who was umpire awarded the prize two kids just severed from their dams to his victorious muse  the ballade of the midnight forest the ballade of the huntress artemis was translated from theodore de banville whose beautiful poem came so near the greek that when the late provost of oriel translated a part of its english shadow into greek hexameters you might suppose as you read that they were part of a lost homeric hymn  i never wrote a double ballade and stanzas four and five of the double ballade of primitive man were contributed by the learned doyen of anthropology mr e b tylor author of primitive culture  a tout seigneur tout honneur  in ballade of his choice of a sepulchre the windburg is a hill in teviotdale  a portrait of 1783 was written on a french engraving after morland and benedetta ramus was addressed to a mezzotint an artists proof very rare  it is after romney and is my beauty as charles lamb said once unluckily to a scot of an engraving after lionardo of some fair dead lady  the sonnet natural theology is the germ of what the author has since written in the making of religion on the long neglected fact that many of the lowest savages known share the belief in a benevolent all father and judge of men  concerning verses in rhymes a la mode visitors to st andrews may be warned not to visit st leonards chapel described in the second stanza of almae matres  in the writers youth and even in middle age   he loitered idly where the tall freshbudded mountainashes blow within its desecrated wall   the once beautiful ruins carpeted with grass and wild flowers have been doubly desecrated by persons academic persons having authority and a plentiful lack of taste  the slim mountainashes fair as the young palmtree that odysseus saw beside the shrine of apollo in delos have been cut down by the academic persons to whom power is given  the grass and flowers have been rooted up  hideous little wooden fences enclose the grave slabs  a roof of a massive kind has been dumped down on the old walls and the windows once so graceful in their airy lines have been glazed in a horrible manner while the ugly iron gate precludes entrance to a shrine which is now a black and dismal dungeon   oh be that roof as lead to lead above the dull restorers head a minstrels malison is said   notes explanatory are added to the rhymes and their information however valuable need not here be repeated    a ballade of xxxii ballades    friend when you bear a caredulled eye and brow perplexed with things of weight and fain would

dim wood dian threads her way  she gleans her silvan trophies down the wold she hears the sobbing of the stags that flee mixed with the music of the hunting rolld but her delight is all in archery and naught of ruth and pity wotteth she more than her hounds that follow on the flight the goddess draws a golden bow of might and thick she rains the gentle shafts that slay she tosses loose her locks

 and cupboards shelter friend or foe  this is a realm where people tell    each other when they chance to meet of things that long ago befell     and do most solemnly repeat secrets they both know very well    aloud and in the public street  a land where lovers go in fours    master and mistress man and maid where people listen at the doors    or neath a tables friendly shade and comic irishmen in scores    roam oer the scenes all undismayed  a land where virtue in distress    owes much to uncles in disguise where british sailors frankly bless    their limbs their timbers and their eyes and where the villain doth confess    conveniently before he dies  a land of lovers false and gay    a land where people dread a curse a land of letters gone astray    or intercepted which is worse where weddings false fond maids betray    and all the babes are changed at nurse  oh happy land where things come right    we of the world where things go ill where lovers love but dont unite    where no

longwithdrawing roar beneath the minster and the windy caves the wide north ocean marshalling his waves even so forlornin worlds beyond our ken  may sigh the seas that are not heard of men even so forlorn prophetic of mans fate sounded the cold seawave disconsolate when none but god might hear the boding tone as god shall hear the long lament alone when all is done when all the tale is told and the gray seawave echoes as of old  morning  this was the burden of the night    the saying of the sea but lo the hours have brought the light the laughter of the waves the flight of dipping seabirds foamy white    that are so glad to be forget the happy creatures cry    forget nights monotone with us be glad in sea and sky the days are thine the days that fly the days god gives to know him by    and not the night alone    woman and the weed founded on a new zealand myth    in the morning of time when his fortunes began how bleak how ungreek was the nature of man from his wigwam if ever he ventured to roam there was nobody waiting to welcome him home for the man had been made but the woman had not and earth was a highly detestable spot man hated his neighbours they met and they scowled they did not converse but they struggled and howled for man had no tacthe would neer take a hint and his notions he backed with a hatchet of flint  so man was alone and he wished he could see on the earth some one like him but fairer than he with locks like the red gold a smile like the sun to welcome him back when his hunting was done and he sighed for a voice that should answer him still like the affable echo he heard on the hill that should answer him softly and always agree and oh man reflected how nice it would be  so he prayed to the gods and they stooped to his prayer and they spoke to the sun on his way through the air and he married the echo one fortunate morn and woman their beautiful daughter was born the daughter of sunshine and echo she came with a voice like a song with a face like a flame with a face like a flame and a voice like a song and happy was man but it was not for long  for weathers a painfully changeable thing not always the child of the echo would sing and the face of the sun may be hidden with mist and his child can be terribly cross if she list and unfortunate man had to learn with surprise that a frowns not peculiar to masculine eyes that the sweetest of voices can scold and can sneer and cannot be answeredlike menwith a spear  so man went and called to the gods in his woe and they answered himsir you would needs have it so and the thing must go on as the thing has begun shes immortalyour child of the echo and sun but well send you another and fairer is she this maiden with locks that are flowing and free this maiden so gentle so kind and so fair with a flower like a star in the night of her hair with her eyes like the smoke that is misty and blue with her heart that is heavenly and tender and true she will die in the night but no need you should mourn you shall bury her body and thence shall be born a weed that is green that is fragrant and fair with a flower like the star in the night of her hair and the leaves must ye burn till they offer to you soft smoke like her eyes that are misty and blue  and the smoke shall ye breathe and no more shall ye fret but the child of the echo and sun shall forget shall forget all the trouble and torment she brings shall bethink ye of none but delectable things and the sound of the wars with your brethren shall cease while ye smoke by the campfire the great pipe of peace so the last state of man was by no means the worst the second gift softened the sting of the first  nor the child of the echo and sun doth he heed when he dreams with the maid that was changed to the weed though the echo be silent the sun in a mist the maid is the fairest that ever was kissed and when tempests are over and ended the rain and the child of the sunshine is sunny again he comes back glad at heart and again is at one with the changeable child of the echo and sun    footnotes  1  cf suggestions for academic reorganization  2  the last three stanzas are by an eminent anthropologist  3
