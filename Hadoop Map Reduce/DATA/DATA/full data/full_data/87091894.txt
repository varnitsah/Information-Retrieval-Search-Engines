soldiers were standing in the road near the bungalow of brigadiergeneral mathieson the officer in command of the force in the cantonments of benares and the surrounding district  they are coming now i think one sergeant said to another it is a bad business they say the general is terribly hurt and it was thought better to bring him and the other fellow who was mixed up in it down in doolies i heard captain harvey say in the orderlyroom that they have arranged relays of bearers every five miles all the way down he is a good fellow is the general and we should all miss him he is not one of the sort who has everything comfortable himself and dont care a rap how the soldiers get on he sees to the comfort of everyone and spends his money freely too he dont seem to care what he lays out in making the quarters of the married men comfortable and in getting any amount of ice for the hospital and extra punkawallahs in the barrack rooms during the hot season he goes out and sees to everything himself why on the march i have known him when all the doolies were full give up his own horse to a man who had fallen out he has had bad luck too lost his wife years ago by cholera and he has got no one to care for but his girl she was only a few months old when her mother died of course she was sent off to england and has been there ever since he must be a rich man besides his pay and allowances but it aint every rich man who spends his money as he does there wont be a dry eye in the cantonment if he goes under  how was it the other man got hurt  well i hear that the tiger sprang on to the generals elephant and seized him by the leg they both went off together and the brute shifted its hold to the shoulder and carried him into the jungle then the other fellow slipped off his elephant and ran after the tiger he got badly mauled too but he killed the brute and saved the generals life  by jove that was a plucky thing who was he  why he was the chap who was walking backwards and forwards with the general when the band was playing yesterday evening several of the men remarked how like he was to you sanderson i noticed it too there certainly was a strong likeness  yes some of the fellows were saying so sanderson replied he passed close to me and i saw that he was about my height and build but of course i did not notice the likeness a man does not know his own face much anyhow he only sees his full face and doesnt know how he looks sideways he is a civilian isnt he  yes i believe so i know that the general is putting him up at his quarters he has been here about a week i think he is some man from england traveling i suppose to see the world i heard the adjutant speak of him as mr simcoe when he was talking about the affair  of course they will take him to the generals bungalow  no he is going to the next major walker is away on leave and the doctor says that it is better that they should be in different bungalows because then if one gets delirious and noisy he wont disturb the other dr hunter is going to take up his quarters there to look after him with his own servants and a couple of hospital orderlies  by this time several officers were gathered at the entrance to the generals bungalow two mounted troopers having brought in the news a few minutes before that the doolies were within a mile  they came along now each carried by four men maintaining a swift but smooth and steady pace and abstaining from the monotonous chant usually kept up a doctor was riding by the side of the doolies and two mounted orderlies with baskets containing ice and surgical dressings rode fifty paces in the rear the curtains of the doolies had been removed to allow of a free passage of air and mosquito curtains hung round to prevent insects annoying the sufferers  there was a low murmur of sympathy from the soldiers as the doolies passed them and many a muttered god bless you sir and bring you through it all right then as the injured men were carried into the two bungalows most of the soldiers strolled off some however remaining near in hopes of getting a favorable report from an orderly or servant a group of officers remained under the shade of a tree near until the surgeon who had ridden in with the doolies came out  what is the report mcmanus one of them asked as he approached  there is no change since i sent off my report last night he said the general is very badly hurt i certainly should not like to give an opinion at present whether he will get over it or not if he does it will be a very narrow shave he was insensible till we lifted him into the doolie at eight oclock yesterday evening when the motion seemed to rouse him a little and he just opened his eyes and each time we changed bearers he has had a little ice between his lips and a drink of lime juice and water with a dash of brandy in it he has known me each time and whispered a word or two asking after the other  and how is he  i have no doubt that he will do that is of course if fever does not set in badly his wounds are not so severe as the generals and he is a much younger man and as i should say with a good constitution if there is no complication he ought to be about again in a months time he is perfectly sensible let him lie quiet for a day or two after that it would be as well if some of you who have met him at the generals would drop in occasionally for a short chat with him but of course we must wait to see if there is going to be much fever  and did it happen as they say doctor the dispatch told us very little beyond the fact that the general was thrown from his elephant just as the tiger sprang and that it seized him and carried him into the jungle that simcoe slipped off his pad and ran in and attacked the tiger that he saved the generals life and killed the animal but is sadly hurt himself  that is about it except that he did not kill the tiger metcalf colvin and smith all ran in and firing together knocked it over stone dead it was an extraordinarily plucky action of simcoe for he had emptied his rifle and had nothing but it and a knife when he ran in  you dont say so by jove that was an extraordinary act of pluck one would almost say of madness if he hadnt succeeded in drawing the brute off mathieson and so gaining time for the others to come up it was a miracle that he wasnt killed well we shall not have quite so easy a time of it for a bit of course murdock as senior officer will take command of the brigade but he wont be half as considerate for our comfort as mathieson has been he is rather a scoffer at what he calls newfangled ways and he will be as likely to march the men out in the heat of the day as at five in the morning  the two sergeants who had been talking walked back together to their quarters both of them were on the brigade staff sanderson was the paymasters clerk nichol worked in the orderlyroom at the sergeants mess the conversation naturally turned on the tiger hunt and its consequences  i have been in some tough fights one of the older men said and i dont know that i ever felt badly scaredone hasnt time to think of that when one is at workbut to rush in against a wounded tiger with nothing but an empty gun and a huntingknife is not the sort of job that i should like to tackle it makes ones blood run cold to think of it i consider that everyone in the brigade ought to subscribe a days pay to get something to give that man as a token of our admiration for his pluck and of our gratitude for his having saved general mathiesons life  there was a general expression of approval at the idea then sanderson said  i think it is a thing that ought to be done but it is not for us to begin it if we hear of anything of that sort done by the officers two or three of us might go up and say that it was the general wish among the noncoms and men to take a share in it but it would never do for us to begin  that is right enough the officers certainly would not like such a thing to begin from below we had better wait and see whether there is any movement that way i dare say that it will depend a great deal on whether the general gets over it or not  the opportunity did not come at the end of five weeks mr simcoe was well enough to travel by easy stages down to the coast acting upon the advice that he should for the present give up all idea of making a tour through india and had better take a sea voyage to australia or the cape or better still take his passage home at once had the day and hour of his leaving been known there was not a white soldier in the cantonments who would not have turned out to give him a hearty cheer but although going on well the doctor said that all excitement should be avoided it would be quite enough for him to have to say goodby to the friends who had been in the habit of coming in to talk with him daily but anything like a public greeting by the men would be likely to upset him it was not therefore until simcoe was some way down the river that his departure became known to the troops  six weeks later there was a sensation in the cantonments general mathieson had so far recovered that he was able to be carried up to the hills and the camp was still growling at the irritating orders and regulations of his temporary successor in command when the news spread that staff paysergeant sanderson had deserted he had obtained a fortnights furlough saying that he wanted to pay a visit to some old comrades at allahabad at the end of the fortnight he had not returned and the staff paymaster had gone strictly into his accounts and found that there was a deficiency of over £300 which he himself would of course be called upon to make good he had indeed helped to bring about the deficiency by placing entire confidence in the sergeant and by neglecting to check his accounts regularly  letters were at once written to the heads of the police at calcutta and bombay and to all the principal places on the roads to those ports but it was felt that with such a start as he had got the chances were all in his favor  it was soon ascertained at allahabad that he had not been there inquiries at the various dakbungalows satisfied the authorities that he had not traveled by land if he had gone down to calcutta he had gone by boat but he might have started on the long land journey across to bombay or have even made for madras no distinct clew however could be obtained  the paymaster obtained leave and went down to calcutta and inspected all the lists of passengers and made inquiries as to them but there were then but few white men in the country save those holding civil or military positions and the merchants at the large ports therefore there was not much difficulty in ascertaining the identity of everyone who had left calcutta during the past month unless indeed he had taken a passage in some native craft to rangoon or possibly singapore  on his arrival at calcutta he heard of an event which caused deep and general regret when known at benares and for a time threw even the desertion of sergeant sanderson into the shade the nepaul in which john simcoe had sailed had been lost in a typhoon in the bay of bengal when but six days out there was no possible doubt as to his fate for a vessel half a mile distant had seen her founder but could render no assistance being herself dismasted and unmanageable and the sea so tremendous that no boat could have lived in it for a moment as both ships belonged to the east india company and were well known to each other the captain and officials of the ceylon had no doubt whatever as to her identity and indeed the remains of a boat bearing the nepauls name were picked up a few days later near the spot where she had gone down  its hard luck that is what i call it sergeant nichol said with great emphasis when the matter was talked over in the sergeants mess here is a man who faces a wounded tiger with nothing but a huntingknife and recovers from his wounds here is the general whose life he saved going on firstrate and yet he loses his life himself drowned at sea i call that about as hard luck as anything i have heard of  hard luck indeed another said if he had died of his wounds it would have been only what might have been expected but to get over them and then to get drowned almost as soon as he had started is as you say nichol very hard luck i am sure the general will be terribly cut up about it i heard major butler tell captain thompson that he had heard from dr hunter that when the general began to get round and heard that simcoe had gone while he was lying there too ill to know anything about it he regularly broke down and cried like a child and i am sure the fact that he will never have the chance of thanking him now will hurt him as bad as those tigers claws  and so there is no news of sanderson  not that i have heard maybe he has got clean away but i should say its more likely that he is lying low in some sailors haunt until the matter blows over then like enough he will put on seatogs and ship under another name before the mast in some trader knocking about among the islands and by the time she comes back he could take a passage home without questions being asked he is a sharp fellow is sanderson i never quite liked him myself but i never thought he was a rogue it will teach captain smalley to be more careful in future i heard that he was going home on his long leave in the spring but i suppose he will not be able to do so now for a year or so three hundred pounds is a big sum to have to fork out  the news of the loss of the nepaul with all hands did indeed hit general mathieson very heavily and for a time seriously delayed the progress that he was making towards recovery  its bad enough to think he said that i shall never have an opportunity of thanking that gallant fellow for my life but it is even worse to know that my rescue has brought about his death for had it not been for that he would have by this time been up at delhi or in oude instead of lying at the bottom of the sea i would give half my fortune to grasp his hand again and tell him what i feel  general mathiesons ill luck stuck to him he gained strength so slowly that he was ordered home and it was three years before he rejoined four years later his daughter came out to him and for a time his home in delhi where he was now stationed was a happy one the girl showed no desire to marry and refused several very favorable offers but after she had been out four years she married a rising young civilian who was also stationed at delhi the union was a happy one except that the first two children born to them died in infancy they were girls the third was a boy who at the age of eight months was sent home under the charge of an officers wife returning with her children to england when they arrived there he was placed in charge of mrs covington a niece of the generals but before he reached the shores of england he was an orphan an epidemic of cholera broke out at the station at which his father who was now a deputy collector was living and he and his wife were among the first victims of the scourge  general mathieson was now a majorgeneral and in command of the troops in the calcutta district this blow decided him to resign his command and return to england he was now sixty the climate of india had suited him and he was still a hale active man being generally popular he was soon at home in london where he took a house in hyde park gardens and became a regular frequenter of the oriental and east indian united service clubs of which he had been for years a member went a good deal into society and when at home took a lively interest in his grandson often running down to his nieces place near warwick to see how he was getting on  the ayah who had come with the child from india had been sent back a few months after they arrived for his mother had written to mrs covington requesting that he should have a white nurse the native servants she wrote spoil the children dreadfully and let them have entirely their own way and the consequence is that they grow up domineering badtempered and irritable i have seen so many cases of it here that herbert and i have quite decided that our child shall not be spoilt in this way but shall be brought up in england as english children are to obey their nurses and to do as they are ordered  as mrs covingtons was a large country house the child was no trouble an excellent nurse was obtained and the boy throve under her care  the general now much regretted having remained so many years in india and if an old comrade remarked i never could make out why you stuck to it so long mathieson it was ridiculous for a man with a large private fortune such as you have he would reply i can only suppose it was because i was an old fool but you see i had no particular reason for coming home i lost my only sister three years after i went out and had never seen her only daughter my niece mary covington of course i hoped for another bout of active service and when the chance came at last up in the north there was i stuck down in calcutta if it hadnt been for jane i should certainly have given it up in disgust when i found i was practically shelved but she always used to come down and stay with me for a month or two in the cool season and as she was the only person in the world i cared for i held on from year to year grumbling of course as pretty well every angloindian does but without having sufficient resolution to throw it up i ought to have stayed at home for good after that mauling i got from the tiger but you see i was never really myself while i was at home i did not feel up to going to clubs and could not enter into london life at all but spent most of my time at my own place which was within a drive of mary covingtons who had then just married  well you see i got deucedly tired of life down there i knew nothing whatever of farming and though i tried to get up an interest in it i failed altogether of course there was a certain amount of society of a sort and everyone called and one had to go out to dinnerparties but such dinnerparties why a dinner in india was worth a score of them most of them were very stiff and formal and after the women had gone upstairs the men talked of nothing but hunting and shooting and crops and cattle so at last i could stand it no longer but threw up six months of my furlough and went out again yes of course i had jane but at that time she was but fourteen and was a girl at school and when i talked of bringing her home and having a governess everyone seemed to think that it would be the worst thing possible for her and no doubt they were right for the life would have been as dull for her as it was for me  of course now it is different i feel as young and as well as i did twenty years ago and can thoroughly enjoy my life in london though i still fight very shy of the country it is a satisfaction to me to know that things are pretty quiet in india at present so that i am losing nothing that way and if i were out there i should be only holding inspections at barrakpoor dumdum or on the maidan at calcutta of course it was pleasant enough in its way for i never felt the heat but as a man gets on in life he doesnt have quite so much enjoyment out of it as he used to do the men around him are a good deal younger than himself he knows all the old messroom jokes and one bit of scandal is like scores of others he has heard in his time  i am heartily glad that i have come home many of you here are about my own standing and there is plenty to talk about of old friends and old days you were a young ensign when i was a captain but bulstrode and i got our companies within a few days of each other of course he is only a lieutenantcolonel while i am a majorgeneral but that is because he had the good sense to quit the service years ago there are scores of others in the club just about my own standing and one gets ones rubber of whist in the afternoon and we dine together and run down the cooking and wines although every one of us knows at heart that they are both infinitely better than we got in india except at the clubs in the presidency towns  then of course we all agree that the service is going to the dogs that the sepoys are overindulged and will some day give us a lot of trouble i keep my liver all right by taking a long ride every morning and altogether i think i can say that i thoroughly enjoy myself  the general on his first visit to england had endeavored but in vain to find out the family of john simcoe he had advertised largely but without effect  i want to find them out he said to his niece i owe that man a debt of gratitude i can never repay but doubtless there are some of his family who may be in circumstances where i could give them a helping hand there may be young brothersof course i could get them cadetships in the indian armymaybe portionless sisters  but if he was traveling in india for pleasure he must have been a welltodo young fellow men cannot wander about in the east without having a pretty full purse  yes no doubt but i dont fancy it was so in his case and he said casually that he had come in for some money and as he had always had a great desire to travel he thought that he could do nothing better than spend a year or two in the east but that he hoped before it was gone he should fall on his legs and obtain some sort of employment he did not care much what it was so that it was not quilldriving he thought that he could turn his hands to most things i laughed at the time for i was by no means sure that he was in earnest but i have felt since that he must have been if it had not been so my advertisements would surely have caught the eye of someone who knew his family a family wealthy enough for one of the sons to start on two years travel must be in a fair position whether in town or country had it been so i should have heard of it and therefore i think that what he said must have had some foundation in fact he was certainly a gentleman in manner and my idea now is that he belonged to a middleclass family probably in some provincial town and that having come into some money at the death of his father or some other relative he followed his natural bent and started on a sort of roving expedition thinking as many people do think that india is a land where you have only to stretch out your hands and shake the pagoda tree  he would have found out his mistake poor fellow if he had lived the days are long past when any dashing young adventurer can obtain a post of honor in the pay of an indian rajah still of course after what he did for me had he remained in india and i found that he really wanted a berth i might have done something for him i know numbers of these indian princes some of them intimately and to some i have been of very considerable service and i fancy that i might have got him a berth of some kind or other without much difficulty or had he made up his mind to return to england i would have set him up in any business he had a fancy for he has gone now and i wish i could pay someone he cared for a little of the debt of gratitude i owe him well i have done my best and have failed from no fault of my own but remember that if ever you hear of a family of the name of simcoe i want you to make inquiries about them and to give me full particulars concerning them  but no news ever reached the general on this head and it was a frequent cause of lamentation to him when he finally settled in town that although he had again advertised he had heard nothing whatever of the family of which he was in search     chapter ii  in the south seas   an island in the pacific the sun was shining down from a cloudless sky the sea was breaking on the white beach there was just sufficient breeze to move the leaves of the cocoanut trees that formed a dark band behind the sands a small brig of about a hundred tons burden lay anchored a short distance from the shore the paint was off in many places and everywhere blistered by the sun her sails hung loosely in the gaskets and the slackness of her ropes and her general air of untidiness alike showed the absence of any sort of discipline on board  in front of a rough shanty built just within the line of shade of the cocoanuts sat three men two drunken sailors lay asleep some fifty yards away on the stump of a tree in front of the bench on which the three men were sitting were placed several black bottles and three tin pannikins while two gourds filled with water and covered with broad banana leaves stood erect in holes dug in the sand  i tell you what it is atkins your men are carrying it on too far bill here and i were good friends with the natives the chief gave us wives and we got on well enough with them what with the cocoanuts which are free to us all and the patches of ground to cultivate we had all we wanted and with the store of beads and bright cotton we brought here with us we paid the natives to fish for pearls for us and have collected enough copra to trade for rum and whatever else we want you have got all our copra on board and a good stock of native trumperies and i should recommend you to be off both for your own sake and ours your men have been more or less drunk ever since they came here i dont mind a drinking bout myself now and again but it does not do to keep it up however it would be no odds to us whether your men were drunk all the time or not if they would but get drunk on board but they will bring the liquor on shore and then they get quarrelsome use their fists on the natives and meddle with the women now these fellows are quiet and gentle enough if they are left alone and treated fairly but i dont blame them for getting riled up when they are illtreated and i tell you they are riled up pretty badly now my woman has spoken to me more than once and from what she says there is likely to be trouble not only for you but for us  well sim the man that he was addressing said there is reason enough in what you say i dont care myself a snap for these black fellows a couple of musketshots would send them all flying but you see though i am skipper the men all have shares and do pretty much as they like at present they like to stay here and i suppose they will stay here till they are tired of it  well atkins if i were in your place i should very soon make a change and if you like bill and i will help you you have got six men well if you shot three of them the other three would think better of it and if they didnt i would settle them too  it is all very well talking like that sim how could i sail the brig without hands if i only kept three of them i should be very shorthanded and if i ever did manage to get to port they would lay a complaint against me for shooting the others it is all very well for you to talk you have lived here long enough to know that one can only get the very worst class of fellows to sail with one in craft like this and for this sort of trade it pays well if one gets back safely but what with the risk of being cast ashore or being killed by the natives who are savage enough in some of the islands it stands to reason that a man who can get a berth in any other sort of craft wont sail with us but it is just the sort of life to suit chaps like these it means easy work plenty of loafing about and if things turn out well a good lump of money at the end of the voyage however they ought to have had enough of it this job the rum is nearly gone and if you will come off tomorrow i will let you have what remains though if they are sober i doubt if they will let you take it away  we will risk that the third man said we are not nice about using our pistols if you are i was saying to simcoe here things are going a lot too far enough mischief has been done already and i am by no means sure that when you have gone they wont make it hot for us we are very comfortable here and we are not doing badly and i dont care about being turned out of it  the pearl fishing is turning out well atkins asked quietly  it might be worse and it might be better anyhow we are content to remain here for a bit  i dont like it jack he said as the skipper having in vain tried to rouse the two drunken men rowed himself off to the brig my woman told me this morning that there had been a big talk among the natives and that though they did not tell her anything she thought that they had made up their minds to wipe the whites out altogether they said that if we hadnt been here the brig would not have come which is like enough for atkins only put in because he was an old chum of ours and thought that we should have got copra enough to make it worth his while to come round well if the niggers only wiped out the crew and burned the ship i should say nothing against it as long as they let atkins alone he has stood by me in more than one roughandtumble business and i am bound to stand by him but there aint no discrimination among the niggers besides i am not saying but that he has been pretty rough with them himself  it makes all the difference whether you settle down and go in for making a pile or if you only stop to water and take in fruit we agreed as to that when we landed here when we stopped here before and found them friendly and pleasant and we says to each other if we can but get on smooth with them and set them fishing for us we might make a good thing out of it you see we had bought some oysters one of them brought up after a dive and had found two or three pearls in them  well we have been here nine months and i dont say i am not getting tired of it but it is worth stopping for you know we reckoned last week that the pearls we have got ought to be worth two or three thousand pounds and we agreed that we would stay here till we have two bags the size of the one we have got but unless atkins gets those fellows off i doubt if we shant have to go before that there is no reasoning with these niggers if they had any sense they would see that we cant help these things  perhaps what the women tell us is untrue the other suggested  dont you think that simcoe said these black women are always true to their white men when they are decently treated besides none of the natives have been near us today that of course might be because they are afraid of these chaps but from this shanty we can see the canoes and not one has gone out today who is to blame them when one of their chiefs was shot yesterday without a shadow of excuse i dont say that i think so much of a niggers life one way or another and having been in some stiff fights together as you know i have always taken my share but i am dead against shooting without some reason it spoils trade and makes it unsafe even to land for water i have half a mind bill to go on board and ask atkins to take us away with him we could mighty soon settle matters with the crew and if there was a fight and we had to shoot them all we could take the brig into port well enough  no no said bill it has not come to that yet dont let us give up a good thing until we are sure that the game is up  well just as you like i am ready to run the risk if you are it would be hard if the worst came to the worst if we couldnt fight our way down to our canoe and once on board that we could laugh at them for as we have proved over and over again they have not one that can touch her  well i will be off to my hut the sun is just setting and my supper will be ready for me he strolled off to his shanty which lay back some distance in the wood simcoe entered the hut where a native woman was cooking  nothing fresh i suppose he asked in her language  she shook her head none of our people have been near us today  well pollyfor so her white master had christened her her native appellation being too long for ordinary conversationit is a bad business and i am sorry for it but when these fellows have sailed away it will soon come all right again  polly hopes so she said polly very much afraid  well you had better go tomorrow and see them and tell them as i have told them already we are very sorry for the goings on of these people but it is not our fault you have no fear that they will hurt you have you because if so dont you go  they no hurt polly now she said they know that if i do not come back you be on guard  well i dont think there is any danger at present but it is as well to be ready do you take down to the canoe three or four dozen cocoanuts and four or five big bunches of plantains and you may as well take three or four gourds of water if we have to take to the boat will you go with me or stay here  polly will go with her master the woman said if she stay here they will kill her  i am glad enough for you to go with me polly he said you have been a good little woman and i dont know how i should get on without you now though why they should kill you i dont know seeing that your head chief gave you to me himself  kill everything belonging to white man she said quietly and the man knew in his heart that it would probably be so she put his supper on the table and then made several journeys backwards and forwards to the canoe which lay afloat in a little cove a couple of hundred yards away when she had done she stood at the table and ate the remains of the supper  an hour later the man was sitting on the bench outside smoking his pipe when he heard the sound of heavy footsteps among the trees he knew this was no native tread  what is it bill he asked as the man came up  well i came to tell you that there is a big row going on among the natives i can hear their tomtom things beating furiously and occasionally they set up a tremendous yell i tell you i dont like it simcoe i dont like it a bit i sent my woman to see what it was all about but though she had been away three hours she hadnt come back when i started out to talk it over with you  there has been a biggish row going on on board the brig too the other said i have heard atkins storming and a good deal of shouting among the men i suppose you have got your pearls all right in your belt things begin to have an awkward look and we may have to bolt at short notice  you trust me for that simcoe i have had them on me ever since the brig came in i had no fear of the natives stealing them out of my hut but if one of those fellows were to drop in and see them he would think nothing of knifing the woman and carrying them off  i see you have brought your gun with you  yes and my pistols too i suppose you are loaded and ready to catch up at a moments notice  yes my girl has been carrying down cocoanuts and plantains to the canoe so if we have to make a bolt we can hold on comfortably enough until we get to the next island which is not above three days sail and lies dead to leeward as the wind is at present still bill i hope it is not coming to that i think it is likely enough they may attack the brig in their canoes but they have always been so friendly with us that i really dont think they can turn against us now they must know that we cannot help these peoples doings  that is all very well the other said but you and i know half a dozen cases in which the niggers have attacked a ship and in every case beachcombers were killed too  simcoe made no answer he knew that it was so and could hardly hope that there would be an exception in their case after thinking for a minute he said well bill in that case i think the safest plan will be to take to the canoe at once we can stay away a few weeks and then come back here and see how matters stand  but how about atkins  well we will shout and get him ashore and tell him what we think of it and give him the choice of either stopping or going with us nothing can be fairer than that if he chooses to stop and harm comes of it we cannot blame ourselves if we come back in a few weeks of course we should not land until we had overhauled one of their canoes and found out what the feeling of the people was they will have got over their fit of rage and like enough they will have said to each other we were better off when the two white men were here they paid us for our fishing and our copra and never did us any harm i wish they were back again  that is reasonable enough the other agreed what about the trade things  well we have only got some beads and small knickknacks left polly shall carry them down to the canoe we shall want them for trading till we come back here again  he said a few words to the woman who at once began to carry the things down to the canoe then he went down to the beach and shouted atkins  hullo came back from the brig  come ashore we want to talk to you about something particular they saw the dinghy pulled up to the ships side then atkins rowed ashore  i have been having a row with the crew he said i thought it was coming to fighting two or three of them took up handspikes but i drew my pistols and things calmed down what do you want me for  bill here has brought news that there is a row among the natives they are beating their drums and yelling like fiends and we expect it means mischief at any rate it comes to this we are so convinced that there is going to be trouble that we mean to cut and run at once we have got enough grub put on board our canoe to take us to the next island but we did not want to leave you in the lurch to be speared by the niggers so we have called you to offer you a seat in the canoe  that is friendly atkins said but i should lose the ship and cargo and pretty near all that i have got is in her why should not you two bring your canoe off alongside and hoist her up then we could get up anchor and be off three of the fellows are deaddrunk and the other three half stupid i would give you each a share in the profits of the voyage  well what do you think of that simcoe bill said  i tell you straight i dont care for it you and i are both good paddlers and the canoe sails like a witch in a light wind once afloat in her and we are safe but you cant say as much for the brig i have sailed in her before now and i know that she is slow unless it is blowing half a gale it is like enough that the natives may be watching her now and if they saw us get under way they would be after her and would go six feet to her one as to fighting what could we three do the others would be of no use whatever no i like our plan best by far  well i dont know what to say atkins said it is hard to make a choice of course if i were sure that the natives really meant mischief i would go with you but we cannot be sure of that  i feel pretty sure of it anyhow bill said my girl would be safe to follow me here when she got back and found the hut empty but i am mightily afraid that some harm has come to her or she would have been back long before this it wasnt half a mile to go and she might have been there and back in half an hour and she has been gone now over three hours and i feel nasty about it i can tell you i wish your crew were all sober atkins and that we had a score of men that i could put my hand on among the islands i should not be talking about taking to a canoe then but i would just go in and give it them so hot that they would never try their pranks on again  have you got all the things in polly simcoe asked the woman as she crouched down by the door of the hut  got all in she said why not go very bad wait here  well i think you are about right at any rate we will go and get on board and wait a spearsthrow off the shore for an hour or so if bills susan comes here and finds we have gone she is pretty safe to guess that we shall be on board the canoe and waiting for her what do you say to that bill  that suits me nothing can be fairer if she comes we can take her on board if she doesnt i shall know that they have killed her and i will jot it down against them and come back here some day before long and take it out of them and you atkins  i will go straight on board like enough it is all a false alarm and i aint going to lose the brig and all that she has got on board till i am downright certain that they  he stopped suddenly and the others leaped to their feet as a burst of savage yells broke out across the water  by heavens they are attacking the ship simcoe cried they will be here in a moment come on polly come on atkins we have no choice now taking up his arms he started to run quick quick he cried i can hear them  they had gone but some thirty yards when a number of natives burst from the wood had they arrived a minute sooner at the hut none of its occupants would have lived to tell the tale but the impatience of those in the canoes lying round the brig had caused the alarm to be given before they had placed themselves in readiness for a simultaneous rush on the hut there was no further occasion for silence a wild yell burst out as they caught sight of the flying figures and a dozen spears flew through the air  dont stop to fire simcoe shouted we shall have to make a stand at the boat and shall want every barrel  they were threequarters of the way to the boat and the natives were still some twenty yards behind them suddenly bill stumbled then with a savage oath he turned and emptied both barrels of his fowlingpiece into the natives and the two leading men fell forward on their faces and some shouts and yells told that some of the shots had taken effect on those behind  are you wounded bill simcoe asked  yes i am hit hard run on man i think i am done for  nonsense simcoe exclaimed catch hold of my arm i will help you along  one native was in advance of the rest he raised his arm to hurl his spear but the native woman who had all along been running behind simcoe threw herself forward and the spear pierced her through the body with an exclamation of fury simcoe leveled his musket and shot the native through the head  throw your arms round my neck bill the poor girl is done for curse them can you hold on  yes i think so he replied  simcoe was a very powerful man and with his comrade on his back he ran on almost as swiftly as before  now atkins give them every barrel that you have got then lift bill into the boat and i will keep them back i am not going until i have paid some of them out for poor polly  atkins fired his pistols and with so steady an aim that each shot brought down a savage then he lifted bill from simcoes shoulders and laid him in the canoe  get up the sail simcoe shouted they will riddle us with spears if we paddle he shot down four of the natives with his doublebarreled pistols and then clubbing his gun threw himself with a hoarse shout upon them the loss of seven of their leaders had caused their followers to hesitate and the fury of simcoes attack and the tremendous blows he dealt completed their discomfiture and they turned and fled in dismay  now is your time atkins shouted i have cut the cord and got the sail up turning simcoe was in a moment kneedeep in the water pushing the boat off he threw himself into it  lie down man lie down he shouted to atkins but the warning was too late the moment simcoe turned the natives had turned also and as they reached the waters edge half a dozen spears were flung two of them struck atkins full in the body and with a cry he threw up his arms and fell over the side of the canoe then came several splashes in the water simcoe drew the pistols from his companions belt and raising himself high enough to look over the stern shot two of the savages who were wading out waist deep and were but a few paces behind  the sail was now doing its work and the boat was beginning to glide through the water at a rate that even the best swimmers could not hope to emulate as soon as he was out of reach of the spears simcoe threw the boat up into the wind reloaded his pistols and those of his comrade and opened fire upon the group of natives clustered at the waters edge like most men of his class he was a firstrate shot three of the natives fell and the rest fled then with a stroke of the paddle he put the boat before the wind again and soon left the island far behind  this has been a pretty nights work he muttered poor little polly killed she gave her life to save me and there is no doubt she did save me too for that fellows spear must have gone right through me i am afraid that they have done for bill too he stooped over his comrade the shaft of the spear had broken off but the jagged piece with the head attached stuck out just over the hip i am afraid it is all up with him however i must take it out and bandage him as well as i can  a groan burst from the wounded man as simcoe with some effort drew the jagged spear from the wound then he took off his own shirt and tore some strips off it and tightly bandaged the wound  i can do nothing else until the morning he said well polly i have paid them out for you i have shot seven or eight and smashed the skulls of as many more of course they have done for those drunkards on board the brig i did not hear a single pistol fired and i expect that they knocked them on the head in their drunken sleep the brutes if they had had their senses about them we might have made a fair fight though i expect that they would have been too many for us  just as daylight was breaking bill opened his eyes  how do you feel old man  i am going simcoe you stood by me like a man i heard it all till atkins laid me in the boat where is he  he is gone bill instead of throwing himself down in the boat as i shouted to him directly he got up the sail he stood there watching i suppose until i was in he got two spears in his body and fell overboard dead i have no doubt  look here sim the latter had to bend down his ear to listen the words came faintly and slowly if you ever go back home again you look up my brother he is no more on the square than i was but he is a clever fellow he lives respectablerose cottage pentonville hill dont forget it he goes by the name of harrison i wrote to him every two or three years and got an answer about the same tell him how his brother bill died and how you carried him off when the blacks were yelling round we were fond of each other tom and i you keep the pearls sim he dont want them he is a topsawyer in his way he is and has offered again and again that if i would come home he would set me up in any line i liked i thought perhaps i should go home some day tom and i were great friends i remember his eyelids drooped his lips moved and in another minute no sounds came from them he gave one deep sigh and then all was over  a good partner and a good chum simcoe muttered as he looked down into the mans face well well i have lost a good many chums in the last ten years but not one i missed as i shall miss bill it is hard he and polly going at the same time there are not many fellows that i would have lain down to sleep with with fifteen hundred pounds or so worth of pearls in my belt not out in these islands but i never had any fear with him well well he went on as he took the bag of pearls from his comrades belt and placed it in his own there is a consolation everywhere though we might have doubled and trebled this lot if we had stopped three months longer which we should have done if atkins had not brought that brig of his in i cant think why he did it he might have been sure that with that drunken lot of villains trouble would come of it sooner or later he wasnt a bad fellow either but too fond of liquor     chapter iii  a deaf girl   yes lady moulton i will undertake the gypsy tent business at your fête that is to say i will see to the getting up of the tent provide a gypsy for you and someone to stand at the door and let in one visitor at a time and receive the money do you mean to make it a fixed charge or leave it to each to pay the gypsy  which do you think will be best hilda of course the great thing is to get as much money for the decayed ladies as possible  i should say that it would be best to let them give what they like to the gypsy lady moulton  but she might keep some of it herself  i think i can guarantee that she wont do that i will get a dependable gypsy you see you could not charge above a shilling entrance and very likely she would get a good deal more than that given to her  well my dear i leave it all to you spare no expense about the tent and its fitting up i have set my heart upon the affair being a success and i think everything else has been most satisfactorily arranged it is a very happy thought of yours about the gypsy i hope that you will find a clever one but you must mind and impress upon her that we dont want any evil predictions nothing could be in worse taste it is all very well when a girl is promised a rich husband and everything to match but if she were told that she would never get married or would die young or something of that sort it would be a most unpleasant business  i quite agree with you and will see that everything shall be couleur de rose as to the future and that she shall confine herself as much as possible to the past and present  i leave it in your hands and i am sure that it will be done nicely  lady moulton was a leading member of society a charming woman with a rich and indulgent husband her home was a pleasant one and her balls were among the most popular of the season she had as her friends said but one failing namely her ardor for the society for affording aid to decayed ladies it was on behalf of this institution that she was now organizing a fête in the grounds of her residence at richmond hilda covington was an orphan and an heiress and was the ward of her uncle an old indian officer who had been a great friend of lady moultons father she had been ushered into society under her ladyships auspices she had however rather forfeited that ladys favorable opinion by refusing two or three unexceptionable offers  my dear she remonstrated no girl can afford to throw away such chances even if she is as you are well endowed pretty and clever  the girl laughed  i am not aware that i am clever at all lady moulton i speak german and french perfectly because i have been four or five years in hanover but beyond that i am not aware of possessing any special accomplishments  but you are clever my dear the other said decidedly the way you seem to understand peoples characters astonishes me sometimes it seems to me that you are almost a witch  you are arguing against yourself the girl laughed if i am such a good judge of character i am not likely to make a mistake in such an important matter as choosing a husband for myself  lady moulton was silenced but not convinced however she had good sense enough to drop the subject general mathieson had already told her that although he should not interfere in any way with any choice hilda might make he should make it an absolute condition that she should not marry until she came of age and as she was at present but eighteen many things might occur in the three years interval  on her return home after arranging to provide a gypsy for lady moultons fête hilda related what had occurred to a girl friend who was staying with her  of course netta i mean to be the gypsy myself but you must help me it would never do for me to be suspected of being the sorceress and so you must be my double so that i can from time to time go out and mix with the crowd a few minutes at a time will do  the other laughed but what should i say to them hilda  oh it is as easy as a b c all that you will have to do is to speak ambiguously hint at coming changes foresee a few troubles in the way and prophesy a happy solution of the difficulties i will take upon myself the business of surprising them and i fancy that i shall be able to astonish a few of them so much that even if some do get only commonplaces we shall make a general sensation of course we must get two disguises i shall have a small tent behind the other where i can change it wont take a momenta skirt and a shawl to go over my head and partly hide my face can be slipped on and off in an instant of course i shall have a black wig and some sort of yellow wash that can be taken off with a damp towel i shall place the tent so that i can leave from behind without being noticed as we shall have the tent a good deal darkened there will be no fear of the differences between the two gypsies being discovered and indeed people are not likely to compare notes very closely  well i suppose you will have your way as usual hilda  i like that the other said with a laugh you were my guide and counselor for five years and now you pretend that i always have my own way why i cannot even get my own way in persuading you to come and settle over here i am quite sure that you would get lots of pupils when people understand the system and its advantages  that is all very well hilda but you see in the first place i have no friends here except yourself and in the second it requires a good deal of money to get up an establishment and to wait until one gets pupils my aunt would i know put in the money she saved when you were with us if i were to ask her but i wouldnt do so to begin with she regards that as my fortune at her death she has said over and over again how happy the knowledge makes her that i shall not be left absolutely penniless except of course what i can get for the house and furniture and i would do anything rather than sell that she admits that i might keep myself by teaching deaf children but as she says no one can answer for their health i might have a long illness that would throw me out i might suddenly lose a situation say from the death of a pupil and might be a long time before i could hear of another she said to me once i do hope netta you will never embark one penny of the little money that will come to you in any sort of enterprise or speculation however promising it may look we had been talking of exactly the plan that you are now speaking of the mere furnishing of a house in england large enough to take a dozen children would swallow up a considerable sum at first you might have to wait some time till you could obtain more than two or three children and there would be the rent and expenses going on and you might find yourself without money and in debt before it began to pay its way therefore i do hope that you will keep the money untouched except to meet your expenses in times of illness or of necessity of some kind if you can save up money sufficient to start an establishment it will i think be a good thing especially if you could secure the promise of four or five pupils to come to you at once if in a few years you should see your way to insure starting with enough pupils to pay your way and i am alive at the time i would draw out enough to furnish the house and will look after it for you that was a great concession on her part but i certainly would not let her do it for she is so happy in her home now and i know that she would worry herself to death  well netta you know i am still ready to become the capitalist  both girls laughed merrily  why not netta the speaker went on i know you said that you would not accept money as a loan even from me which as i told you was very stupid and very disagreeable but there is no reason why we should not do it in a business way other women go into business why shouldnt i as you know i cant absolutely touch my money until i come of age and it is nearly three years before that still i feel sure that the general would let me have some money and we could start the institute it would be great fun of course in the first place you would be principal or lady superintendent or whatever you like to call yourself and you would draw say five hundred pounds a year after that we could divide the profits  again both girls laughed  and that is what you call a business transaction the other said i know that your guardian is very kind and indeed spoils you altogether but i dont think that you would get him to advance you money for such a scheme  i am really in earnest netta  oh i dont say that you would not do it if you could however i think anyhow we had better wait until you come of age there is plenty of time i am only twenty yet and even in three years time i doubt whether i should quite look the character of professor or lady superintendent  well directly i get of age i shall carry out my part of the plan hilda said positively and if you are disagreeable and wont do as i want you i shall write to the professor and ask him to recommend a superintendent  the other laughed again  you would have a difficulty hilda you and i are so far the only two english girls who have learned the system and either your superintendent would have to learn english or all her pupils would have to learn german  we will not discuss it further at present miss purcell hilda said with dignity oh dear those were happy days we had in that dear old house with its pretty garden when you were thirteen and i was eleven i have got a great deal of fun from it since one gets such curious little scraps of conversation  then the people do not know what you learned over with us  no indeed as you know it was not for a year after i came back that i became altogether the generals ward and my dear mother said to me just before she died it would be better for you dear not to say anything about that curious accomplishment of yours i know that you would never use it to any harm but if people knew it they would be rather afraid of you uncle said the same thing directly i got here so of course i have kept it to myself and indeed if they had not said so i should never have mentioned it for it gives me a great deal of amusement  when hilda covington was ten years old she had after a severe attack of scarlet fever lost her hearing and though her parents consulted the best specialists of the time their remedies proved of no avail and at last they could only express a hope rather than an opinion that in time with added health and strength nature might repair the damage a year after her illness mr covington heard of an aurist in germany who had a european reputation and he and mrs covington took hilda over to him after examining her he said the mischief is serious but not i think irreparable it is a case requiring great care both as to dieting exercise and clothing if it could be managed i should like to examine her ears once a fortnight or once a month at the least i have a house here where my patients live when under treatment but i should not for a moment advise her being placed there a child to keep in good health requires cheerful companions if you will call again tomorrow i will think the matter over and let you know what i recommend  mr and mrs covington retired much depressed his opinion was perhaps a little more favorable than any that they had received but the thought that their only child must either make this considerable journey once a month or live there altogether was very painful to them however on talking it over they agreed that it was far better that she should reside in hanover for a time with the hope of coming back cured than that she should grow up hopelessly deaf  it will only be as if she were at school here mr covington said she will no doubt be taught to talk german and french and even if she is never able to converse in these languages it will add to her pleasures if she can read them  the next day when they called upon the doctor he said if you can bring yourself to part with the child i have i think found the very thing to suit her in the first place you must know that there is in the town an establishment conducted by a professor menzel for the instruction of deaf mutes it is quite a new system and consists in teaching them to read from the lips of persons speaking to them the words that they are saying the system is by no means difficult for those who have still like your daughter the power of speech and who have lost only their hearing but even those born deaf and dumb have learned to be able to converse to a certain degree though their voices are never quite natural for in nine cases out of ten deaf mutes are mutes only because they have never learned to use their tongue however happily that is beside the question in your daughters case i hope that she will regain her hearing but should this unfortunately not be the case it will at least be a great mitigation to her position to be able to read from the lips of those who address her what is said and therefore to converse like an ordinary person i can assure you that many of herr menzels pupils can converse so easily and rapidly that no one would have the least idea of the misfortune from which they suffer as in fact they feel no inconvenience beyond the fact that they are not aware of being addressed by anyone standing behind them or whose face they do not happen to be watching  that would indeed be a blessing mrs covington exclaimed i never heard of such a system  no it is quite new but as to its success there can be no question i called upon professor menzel last evening he said that as your daughter did not understand german the difficulties of her tuition would be very great he has however among his pupils a young english girl two years older than your daughter she lives with a maiden aunt who has established herself here in order that her niece might have the benefit of learning the new system here is her name and address the professor has reason to believe that her income is a small one and imagines that she would gladly receive your daughter as a boarder her niece who is a bright girl would be a pleasant companion and moreover having in the two years that she has been here made very great progress she would be able to commence your daughters education by conversing with her in english and could act as her teacher in german also and so soon as the language was fairly mastered your daughter could then become a pupil of the professor himself  that would be an excellent plan indeed mrs covington said and her husband fully agreed with her the doctor handed her a slip of paper with the name miss purcell 2nd etage 5 koenigstrasse  hilda had already been informed by the finger alphabet which had been her means of communication since her illness of the result of the conversation with the doctor on the previous day and although she had cried at the thought of being separated from her father and mother she had said that she would willingly bear anything if there was a hope of her regaining her hearing she had watched earnestly the conversation between the doctor and her parents and when the former had left and they explained what was proposed her face brightened up  that will be very nice she exclaimed and if i could but learn to understand in that way what people say instead of watching their fingers and some of them dont know the alphabet and some who do are so slow that one loses all patience it would be delightful  before going to see miss purcell mr and mrs covington talked the matter over together and they agreed that if miss purcell were the sort of person with whom hilda could be happy no plan could be better than that proposed  it certainly would not be nice for her mrs covington said to be living on a second floor in a street she has always been accustomed to be so much in the open air and as the doctors all agree that much depends upon her general health i am sure it will be quite essential that she should be so now i think that we should arrange to take some pretty little house with a good garden just outside the town and furnish it and that miss purcell and her niece should move in there of course we should pay a liberal sum for board and if she would agree i should say that it would be best that we should treat the house as ours and should pay the expenses of keeping it up altogether i dont suppose she keeps a servant at present and there are many little luxuries that hilda has been accustomed to then of course we would pay so much to the niece for teaching hilda german and beginning to teach her this system i dont suppose the whole thing would cost more than three hundred pounds a year  the expense is nothing mr covington said we could afford it if it were five times the amount i think your idea is a very good one and we could arrange for her to have the use of a ponycarriage for two or three hours a day whenever she was disposed the great thing is for her to be healthy and happy  ten minutes after they started with hilda to see miss purcell after having explained to her the plan they proposed at this she was greatly pleased the thought of a little house all to themselves and a girl friend was a great relief to her and she looked brighter and happier than she had done since she had lost her hearing when they knocked at the door of the apartment on the second floor it was opened by a brightfaced girl of thirteen  this is miss purcells is it not mrs covington asked  yes maam the girl replied with a slight expression of surprise which showed that visitors were very rare  will you give my card to her and say that we shall be glad if she will allow us a few minutes conversation with her  the girl went into the room and returned in a minute or two will you come in she said my aunt will be glad to see you  miss purcell was a woman of some fifty years old with a pleasant kindly face the room was somewhat poorly furnished but everything was scrupulously neat and tidy and there was an air of comfort pervading it  we have called miss purcell mrs covington began in consequence of what we have learned from dr hartwig whom we have come over to consult and who has been good enough to see professor menzel he has learned from him that your niece here is acquiring the system of learning to understand what is said by watching the lips of speakers the doctor is of opinion that our daughter may in time outgrow the deafness that came on a year ago after scarlet fever but he wishes her to remain under his eye and he suggested that it would be well that she should learn the new system so that in case she does not recover her hearing she would still be able to mingle with other people hilda is delicate and it is necessary that she should have a cheerful home besides which she could not begin to learn the system until she had become familiar with german the doctor suggested that if we could persuade you to do us the great kindness of taking her under your charge it would be the best possible arrangement  i should be glad to do so madam but i fear that i could not accommodate her for it is a mere closet that my niece sleeps in and the other apartments on this floor are all occupied were it not for that i should certainly be glad to consider the matter it would be pleasant to netta to have a companion for it is but dull work for her alone with me we have few acquaintances i do not mind saying frankly that my means are straitened and that i cannot indulge her with many pleasures she is a grandniece of mine her father died some years ago her mother three years since and naturally she came to me shortly after she lost her hearing through measles just at that time i happened to hear from a german workman of the institution which had been started in this town of which he was a native i had no ties in england and as i heard that living was cheap there and that the fees were not large i decided to come over and have her taught this new system which would not only add greatly to her own happiness but would give her the means of earning her livelihood when she grew up for although i have a small pension as my father was an excise officer this of course will expire at my death  happily miss purcell we are in a position to say that money is no object to us hilda is our only child we have talked it over of course and will tell you exactly what we propose and i hope that you will fall in with the arrangement  she then stated the plan that she and her husband had discussed  you see she went on you would in fact be mistress of the house and would have the entire management of everything as if it was your own we are entirely ignorant of the cost of living here or we might have proposed a fixed monthly payment for the expenses of servants and outgoings and would still do that if you would prefer it though we thought that it would be better that you should at the end of each month send us a line saying what the disbursements had been we would wish everything done on a liberal scale hilda has little appetite and it will for a time want tempting however that matter we could leave to you we propose to pay a hundred a year to you for your personal services as mistress of the house and fifty pounds to your niece as hildas companion and instructor in german and in the system until she understands the language well enough to attend professor menzels classes if the house we take has a stable we should keep a pony and a light carriage and a big lad or young man to look after it and drive and to keep the garden in order in his spare time i do hope miss purcell that you will oblige us by falling in with our plans if you like we can give you a day to consider them  i do not require a minute she replied my only hesitation is because the terms that you offer are altogether too liberal  that is our affair mrs covington said we want a comfortable happy home for our child and shall always feel under a deep obligation to you if you will consent  i do consent most willingly and gratefully the arrangement will be a delightful one for me and i am sure for netta  netta who had been standing where she could watch the lips of both speakers clapped her hands joyously oh auntie it will be splendid fancy having a house and a garden and a ponychaise  you understand all we have been saying then netta  i understand it all the girl replied i did not catch every word but quite enough to know all that you were saying  that certainly is a proof of the goodness of the system mr covington said speaking for the first time how long have you been learning  eighteen months sir we have been here two years but i was six months learning german before i knew enough to begin and for the next six months i could not get on very fast as there were so many words that i did not know so that really i have only been a year at it the professor says that in another year i shall be nearly perfect and fit to begin to teach and he has no doubt that he will be able to find me a situation where i can teach in the daytime and still live with my aunt  in a week the necessary arrangements were all made a pretty furnished house a quarter of a mile out of town with a large garden and stables had been taken and netta and hilda had already become friends for as the former had learned to talk with her fingers before she came out she was able to keep up her share of the conversation by that means while hilda talked in reply  the fingers are useful as a help at first netta said but professor menzel will not allow any of his pupils to use their fingers because they come to rely upon them instead of watching the lips     chapter iv  the gypsy   mr and mrs covington remained for a week after hilda was installed with the purcells in their new home to her the house with its garden and pretty ponycarriage and pony were nothing remarkable but nettas enjoyment in all these things amused her and the thought that she too would some day be able to talk and enjoy life as her companion did greatly raised her spirits her father and mother were delighted at hearing her merry laugh mingled with that of netta as they walked together in the garden and they went home with lighter hearts and more hopeful spirits than they had felt since the childs illness began  every three or four monthsfor a journey to hanover was a longer and more serious business in 1843 than it is at presentthey went over to spend a week there there could be no doubt from the first that the change was most beneficial to hilda her cheeks regained their color and her limbs their firmness she lost the dull look and the apathy to whatever was going on around her that had before distressed them she progressed very rapidly in her study of german and at the end of six months her conversations with netta were entirely carried on in that language she had made some little progress in reading from her companions lips and had just entered at herr menzels academy she could now take long walks with netta and every afternoon or as summer came on every evening they drove together in the ponychaise with renewed health and strength there had been some slight improvement in her hearing she could now faintly distinguish any loud sounds such as those of the band of a regiment marching past her or a sudden peal of bells  i think that we shall make an eventual cure dr hartwig said it will be slow and possibly her hearing may never be absolutely good but at least we may hope that she may be able to eventually hear as well as nine people out of ten  in another year she could indeed though with difficulty hear voices and when she had been at hanover three years her cure was almost complete and she now went every morning to school to learn french and music she herself was quite content to remain there she was very happy in her life and surroundings and could now read with the greatest facility from the lips and indeed preferred watching a speakers mouth to listening to the voice it was a source of endless amusement to her that she could as she and netta walked through the streets read scraps of conversation between persons on the other side of the street or passing in carriages  another six months and both the doctor and professor menzel said that they could do nothing more for her she was still somewhat hard of hearing but not enough so to be noticeable while she could with her eyes follow the most rapid speaker and the professor expressed his regret that so excellent an example of the benefit of his system should not be in circumstances that would compel her to make a living by becoming a teacher in it netta was now a paid assistant at the institution  the end of what had been a very happy time to hilda came abruptly and sadly for three weeks before the date when her parents were to come over to take her home miss purcell on opening a letter that came just as they had finished breakfast said after sitting silent for a few minutes you need not put on your things hilda you cannot go to school this morning i have some bad news dearvery bad news  the tone of voice in which she spoke even more than the words sent a chill into the girls heart  what is it aunt she said for she had from the first used the same term as netta in addressing her  your father has had a serious illness my deara very very serious and sudden illness and your mother wishes you to go home at once  hilda looked at her with frightened questioning eyes while every vestige of color left her cheeks is heis he she asked  here is an inclosure for you miss purcell said as she got up and taking hildas hand in one of hers drew her with the other arm close to her your mother wrote to me that i might prepare you a little before giving it to you a terrible misfortune has happened your dear father is dead he died suddenly of an affection of the heart  oh no no it cannot be hilda cried  it is true my dear god has taken him you must be strong and brave dear for your mothers sake  oh my poor mother my poor mother hilda cried bursting into a sudden flood of tears what will she do  it was not until some time afterwards that she was sufficiently composed to read her mothers letter which caused her tears to flow afresh after giving the details of her fathers death it went on  i have written to your uncle general mathieson who is i know appointed one of the trustees and is joined with me as your guardian i have asked him to find and send over a courier to fetch you home and no doubt he will arrive a day or two after you receive this letter so please get everything ready to start at once when he comes  two days later general mathieson himself arrived accompanied by a courier it was a great comfort to hilda that her uncle had come for her instead of a stranger  it is very kind of you to come yourself uncle she said as she threw herself crying into his arms  of course i should come dear he said who should fetch you except your uncle i had to bring a courier with me for i dont understand any of their languages and he will take all trouble off my hands now let me look at your face it was a pale sad little face that was lifted up but two days of sorrow had not obliterated the signs of health and wellbeing  whiter than it ought to be he said but clear and healthy and very different from what it was when i saw you before you came out you have grown wonderfully child really i should hardly have known you again  and so he kept on for two or three minutes to allow her to recover herself  now dear you must take me in and introduce me to your kind friends here  hilda led the way into the sitting room  i have heard so much of you and your niece miss purcell he said as he shook hands with her that i do do not feel that you are a stranger you certainly seem to have worked wonders between you for my niece and i must own that in the first place i thought it a mistake her being here by herself for i had no belief that either her hearing would be restored or that she would ever be able to follow what people were saying by only staring at their lips  yes indeed hanover has agreed with her sir and it is only a small part of the credit that is due to us  i must differ from you entirely madam if she had not been perfectly happy here with you she would never have got on as she has done  have you any luggage sir of course you will stay with us tonight  no thank you miss purcell we have already been to the kaiserhof and long before this my courier will have taken rooms and made every preparation for me you see i am accustomed to smoke at all times and could not think of scenting a house solely inhabited by ladies with tobacco now if you will excuse me i will ask hilda to put on her bonnet and take a stroll with me  i shall be very glad for her to do so it is just getting cool and pleasant for walking and half an hour in the fresh air will do her good  it was an hour before they returned general mathieson had gently told her all there was to tell of her fathers death and turning from that he spoke of her mother and how nobly she was bearing her troubles and erelong her tears which had burst out anew flowed more quietly and she felt comforted presently she said suddenly  what is going to be done here uncle i have been thinking over that ever since it was settled that i was to come home next month and i am sure that although she has said nothing about it miss purcell has felt the change that is coming she said the other day i shall not go back to the apartments where you found us hilda you see we are a great deal better off than we were before in the first place i have had nothing whatever to spend and during the four years the ridiculously liberal sum paid to netta and myself has been all laid aside and has mounted up to six hundred pounds my pension of eighty pounds a year has also accumulated with the exception of a small sum required for our clothes so that in fact i have nearly a thousand pounds laid by netta is earning thirty pounds a year at the institute with that and my pension and the interest on money saved we shall get on very comfortably i should not like uncle to think of them in a little stuffy place in the town having a nice garden and everything comfortable has done a great deal for miss purcell netta told me that she was very delicate before and that she is quite a different woman since she came out here from the town you cannot tell how kind she has always been if i had been her own child she could not have been more loving in fact no one could have told by her manner that she was not my mother and netta my sister  yes dear i ran down to your mother before starting to fetch you to help in the arrangements and she spoke about miss purcell under ordinary circumstances of course at the end of the four years that you have been here the house would be given up and she would as you say go into a much smaller place but your mother does not consider that these are ordinary circumstances and thinks that her care and kindness have had quite as much to do with the improvement in your health as has the doctor of course we had no time to come to any definite plan but she has settled that things are to go on here exactly as at present except that your friend netta will not be paid for acting as companion to you i am to tell miss purcell that with that exception everything is to go on as before and that your mother will need a change and will probably come out here in a month or so for some time  does she really mean that uncle  certainly and the idea is an excellent one after such a shock as she has had an entire change of scene will be most valuable and as she knows miss purcell well and you like the place very much i dont think that any better plan could be hit upon i dare say she will stay here two or three months and you can continue your studies at the end of that time i have no doubt some plan that will give satisfaction to all parties will be hit upon  hilda returned to hanover with her mother a month later at the end of three months mrs covington bought the house and presented the deeds to miss purcell who had known nothing whatever of her intentions  i could not think of accepting it she exclaimed  but you cannot help accepting it dear miss purcell here are the deeds in your name the house will be rather large for you at present but in a few years indeed in two or three years netta could begin to take a few pupils as soon as she is ready to do so i shall of course mention it among my friends and be able to send a few children whose parents would be ready to pay well to have them taught this wonderful method of brightening their lives which is at present quite unknown in england  so it was arranged but a few months after her return to england mrs covington who had never altogether recovered from the shock of her husbands death died after a short illness and hilda became an inmate of her uncles house since that time three years had elapsed and hilda was now eighteen and netta was over for a two months visit  the scene in the grounds of lady moultons charming villa at richmond a fortnight after the conversation between that lady and hilda was a gay one everyone in society had been invited and there were but few refusals the weather was lovely and all agreed that even at ascot the costumes were not brighter or more varied  although the fête was especially on behalf of a charity no admission fees were charged to guests but everyone understood that it would be his duty to lay out money at the various picturesque tents scattered about under the trees in these were all the most popular entertainers of the day in one pavilion john parry gave a short entertainment every halfhour in a larger one mario grisi jenny lind and alboni gave short concerts and high as were the prices of admission there was never a seat vacant conjurers had a tent electrobiologiststhen the latest rage from the united statesheld their séances and at some distance from the others richardsons booth was in full swing the grenadiers band and a string band played alternately  not the least attraction to many was the gypsy tent erected at the edge of a thick shrubbery for it soon became rumored that the old gypsy woman there was no ordinary impostor but really possessed of extraordinary powers of palmistry everything had been done to add to the air of mystery pervading the place externally it was but a long narrow marquee on entering the inquirer was shown by an attendant to a seat in an apartment carpeted in red with black hangings and black cloth lining the roof from this hung a lamp all other light being excluded as each visitor came out from the inner apartment the next in order was shown in and the heavy curtains shut off all sound of what was passing here sat an apparently aged gypsy on an old stump of a tree a fire burned on the ground and a pot was suspended by a tripod over it a hood above this carried the smoke out of the tent the curtains here were red the roof as in the other compartment black but sprinkled with gold and silver stars a stool was placed for the visitor close enough to the gypsy for the latter to examine her hand by the light of two torches which were fastened to a rough sapling stuck in the ground  hilda possessed every advantage for making the most of the situation owing to her intimacy with lady moulton and her experience for a year in the best london society she knew all its gossip while she had gathered much more than others knew from the conversations both of the dancers and the lookerson  the first to enter was a young man who had been laughingly challenged by the lady he was walking with to go in and have his fortune told  be seated my son the old woman said give me your hand and a piece of money  with a smile he handed her half a sovereign she crossed his palm with it and then proceeded attentively to examine the lines  a fair beginning she said and then troubles and difficulties here i see that some three years back there is the mark of blood you won distinction in war then there is a crossmark which would show a change some good fortune befell you then the lines darken things go from bad to worse as they proceed you took to a vicecards or horseracing here are evil associates but there is a white line that runs through them there is a girl somewhere with fair hair and blue eyes who loves you and whom you love and whose happiness is imperiled by this vice and these associates beyond there is another crossline and signs of a conflict what happens after will depend upon yourself either the white line and the true love will prove too powerful for the bad influences or these will end in ruin andah sudden and violent death your future therefore depends upon yourself and it is for you to say which influence must triumph that is all  without a word he went out  you look pale mr desmond the lady said when he rejoined her what has she told you  i would rather not tell you mrs markham he said seriously i thought it was going to be a joke but it is very far from being one either the woman is a witch or she knew all about me personally which is barely within the limits of possibility at any rate she has given me something to think of  i will try myself the lady said it is very interesting  i should advise you not to he said earnestly  nonsense she laughed i have no superstitions i will go in and hear what she has to say and leaving him she entered the tent  the gypsy examined her hand in silence i would rather not tell you what i see she said as she dropped the hand oh ridiculous the lady exclaimed i have crossed your palm with gold and i expect to get my moneys worth and she held out her hand again  the gypsy again examined it  you stand at the crossing of the ways there are two menone dark quiet and earnest who loves you you love him but not as he loves you but your line of life runs smoothly until the other line that of a brown man becomes mixed up in it he loves you too with a hot passionate love that would soon fade you had a letter from him a day or two back last night as he passed you in a dance he whispered i have not had an answer and the next time he passed you you replied you must give me another day or two upon the answer you give the future of your life will depend here is a broad fair line and here is a short jagged one telling of terrible troubles and misery it is for you to decide which course is to be yours  as she released her hold of the hand it dropped nerveless the gypsy poured out a glass of water from a jug by her side but her visitor waved it aside and with a great effort rose to her feet her face as pale as death  my god she murmured to herself this woman is really a witch  they do not burn witches now the gypsy said i only read what i see on the palm you cannot deny that what i have said is true stay a moment and drink a glass of wine you need it before you go out  she took a bottle of wine from behind her seat emptied the water on to the earth half filled a tumbler and held it out the frightened woman felt that indeed she needed it before going out into the gay scene and tossed it off  thank you she said whoever you are i thank you you have read my fate truly and have helped me to decide it  desmond was waiting for her when she came out but she passed him with a gesture  you are right she said she is a witch indeed  few other stories told were as tragic but in nearly every case the visitors retired puzzled at the knowledge the gypsy possessed of their life and surroundings and it soon became rumored that the old womans powers were something extraordinary and the little anteroom was kept filled with visitors waiting their turn for an audience no one noticed the long and frequent absences of hilda covington from the grounds the tent had been placed with its back hiding a small path through the shrubbery through a peephole arranged in the curtain she was able to see who was waiting and each time before leaving said a few words as to their lives which enabled netta to support the character fairly when the last guest had departed and she joined lady moulton she handed over a bag containing nearly a hundred pounds  i have deducted five pounds for the gypsy she said and eight pounds for the hire of the tent and its fittings  that is at least five times as much as i expected hilda i have heard all sorts of marvelous stories of the power of your old woman several people told me that she seemed to know all about them and told them things that they believed were only known to themselves but how did she get so much money  hilda laughed i hear that they began with halfsovereigns but as soon as they heard of her real powers they did not venture to present her with anything less than a sovereign and in a good many cases they gave moreno doubt to propitiate her into giving them good fortunes you see each visitor only had two or three minutes interview so that she got through from twenty to thirty an hour and as it lasted four hours she did exceedingly well  but who is the gypsy and where did you find her  the gypsy has gone and is doubtless by this time in some caravan or gypsy tent i do not think that you will ever find her again  i should have suspected that you played the gypsy yourself hilda were it not that i saw you half a dozen times  i have no skill in palmistry the girl laughed and certainly have not been in two places at once i did my duty and heard jenny lind sing and parry play though i own that i did not patronize richardsons booth  well it is extraordinary that this old woman should know the history of such a number of people as went into her tent few of whom she could ever have heard of even by name to say nothing of knowing them by sight  several ladies called within the next few days specially to inquire from lady moulton about the gypsy  everyone is talking about her one said certainly she told me several things about the past that it was hardly possible that a woman in her position could know i have often heard that gypsies pick up information from servants or in the country from village gossip but at least a hundred people visited this womans tent and from what i hear everyone was as astonished as i was myself at her knowledge of their family matters it is said that in some cases she went farther than this and told them things about the present known only to themselves and two or three intimate friends some of them seemed to have been quite seriously affected i saw mrs markham just after she had left the tent and she was as white as a sheet and i know she drove away a few minutes afterwards  to all inquiries lady moulton simply replied  i know no more about the gypsy than you do miss covington took the entire management of the gypsy tent off my hands saw to the tent being erected and engaged the gypsy where she picked her up i have no idea but i fancy that she must have got her from their encampment on ham common she turned the matter off when i asked her pointblank and i imagine that she must have given the old crone a promise not to let it be known who she was they are curious people the gypsies and for aught i know may have an objection to any of the tribe going to a gathering like ours to tell fortunes  some appeals were made to hilda personally but lady moulton had told her the answer she had given and taking her cue from it she was able to so shape her replies that her questioners left her convinced that she had really while carrying out lady moultons instructions lighted on a gypsy possessing some of the secrets of the almost forgotten science of palmistry     chapter v  a gambling den   in a corner of one of the winding courts that lie behind fleet street stood a dingylooking house the lamp over the door bearing the words billiards and pool during the daytime no one would be seen to enter save between the hours of twelve and two when perhaps a dozen young fellows after eating a frugal lunch would resort there to pass their hour out of office in smoking and a game of billiards of an evening however there were lights in every window and the click of balls could be heard from the ground floor and that above it in each of these there were two tables and the play continued uninterruptedly from seven until eleven or halfpast  the lights on the second floor however often burned until two or three oclock in the morning and it was here that the proprietor reaped by far the larger proportion of his profits while the billiardroom windows generally stood open those of the large room on the second floor were never raised and when the lights below were extinguished heavy curtains were dropped across the windows to keep both the light and the sounds within from being seen or heard in the court below here was a large roulette table while along the sides of the room were smaller tables for those who preferred other games here almost every evening some thirty or forty men assembled of these perhaps a third were clerks or shop assistants the remainder foreigners of almost every nationality betting lists were exposed at one end of the room underneath these a bookmaker had a small table and carried on his trade  in 1851 there were a score of such places in the neighborhood of the strand and fleet street but few did a larger business than this it was generally understood that wilkinson the proprietor had been a soldier but the belief originated rather from his upright carriage and a certain soldierly walk than from anything he had himself said and he was not the sort of man whom even the most regular of the frequenters of his establishment cared to question he was a tall man some fiveandforty years of age taciturn in speech but firm in manner while business was going on he kept admirable order in the place he was generally to be found in the room on the second floor but when a whistle blew and one of the markers whispered up a speakingtube that there was a dispute going on between the players or lookerson he was at once upon the spot  now gentlemen he would say interposing between them you know the rules of this establishment the markers decision on all points connected with the game is final and must be accepted by both parties i will have no quarrels or disputes here and anyone making a row goes straight out into the street and never comes in here again  in the vast majority of cases this settled the matter but when the men were flushed with liquor and inclined to continue the dispute they were seized by the collar by wilkinsons strong arm and were summarily ejected from the house in the inner room he preserved order as strictly but had much more difficulty in doing so among the foreign element here quarrels were not uncommon and knives occasionally drawn but wilkinson was a powerful man and a good boxer and a flush hit from the shoulder always settled the business  but though stern in the management of his establishment wilkinson was popular among its frequenters he was acquainted with most of their callings and business indeed none were admitted to the upper room unless well introduced by habitués or until he had made private inquiries concerning them thus he knew among the foreigners whom he could trust and how far when after a run of ill luck they came to him and asked him for a loan he could venture to go  with the english portion of his customers he was still more liberal he knew that he should not be a loser from transactions with them they must repay him for were it known to their employers that they were in the habit of gambling it would mean instant dismissal there were among them several lawyers clerks some of whom were in comparison with their means deeply in debt to him one or other of those he would often invite up to his private room on the floor above where a bottle of good wine would be on the table a box of excellent cigars beside it and here they would chat more or less comfortably until the roulette room opened  mr wilkinson made no pretense that these meetings were simply for the purpose of drinking his wine and smoking his cigars i am a straightforward man he would say and business is business i oblige you and i expect you to oblige me i have always had a fancy that there is money to be made in connection with lawyers businesses there are missing heirs to be hunted up there are provisos in deeds of whose existence some one or other would give a good deal to know now i am sure that you are not in a position to pay me the amount i have lent you and for which i hold your i o us i have no idea of pressing you for the money and shall be content to let it run on so long as you will let me know what is being done at your office the arrangement is that you will tell me anything that you think can be used to advantage and if money is made out of any information you may give me i will engage to pay you a third of what it brings in now i call that a fair bargain what do you say  in some cases the offer was closed with at once in others it was only agreed to after threats that the debt must be at once paid or an application would be made forthwith so far the gamblinghouse keepers expectations had not met with the success he had looked for he had spent a good deal of time in endeavoring to find the descendants of persons who stood in the direct line of succession to properties but of whom all clew had been lost he had indeed obtained an insight into various family differences that had enabled him to successfully extort blackmail but his gains in this way had not so far recouped him for the sums he had as he considered invested in the speculation  he was however a patient man and felt no doubt that sooner or later he should be able to make a coup that would set him up for life still he was disappointed his idea had been the one held by many ignorant persons that lawyers are as a class ready to resort to tricks of all kinds in the interests of their clients or themselves he had found that he had been altogether wrong and that although there were a few firms which working in connection with moneylenders financial agents and the lowest class of bill discounters were mixed up in transactions of a more or less shady character these were the black sheep of the profession and that in the vast majority of cases the business transacted was purely technical and connected with the property of their clients nevertheless he took copious notes of all he learned contending that there was no saying what might come in useful some day  well dawkins he said one day to a darkhaired young fellow with a handsome face that already showed traces of the effect of late hours and dissipation i suppose it is the usual thing the lawsuit as to the right of way at brownsgrove is still going on the settlements in mr cochranes marriage to lady gertrude ivory are being drawn up and other business of the same sort you never give me a scrap of information that is of the slightest use i am afraid that your firm is altogether too eminently respectable to have anything to do with doubtful transactions  i told you so from the first wilkinson that whatever your game might be there would be nothing in our office that could be of the least use to you even if you had copies of every deed drawn up in it ours is what you might call a family business our clients have for the most part dealt with the firm for the last hundred years that is to say their families have we have drawn their wills their marriage settlements their leases and done everything relating to their property for years and years my own work for the last two or three days has been drafting and engrossing the will of a general mathieson whose father and grandfather were our clients before him  mathiesonhe is an old indian officer isnt he if it is the man i mean he was in command at benares twenty years ago he was a handsome man then about my height and build  yes i have no doubt that is the manjohn le marchand mathieson  that is him he was very popular with the troops he used to spend a good deal of money in improving their rations and making them comfortable had a firstrate stable and they used to say he was a rich man anyhow he spent a good deal more than his pay  yes he was a second son but his elder brother died and he came into the property but instead of coming home to enjoy it he stopped out in india for years after he came into it  he had a daughter quite a little girl in those days her mother died out there i suppose she inherits his property  well no she married some time back she and her husband are both dead and their son a boy six or seven years old lives with the old man  how much does he leave  something over a hundred thousand pounds at least i know that that is about the value of the estates for we have always acted as his agents collected the rents and so on  i should like to see a copy of his will wilkinson said after sitting for some time silent i dont want all the legal jargon but just the list of the legacies  i can easily jot those down for you the property goes to the grandson and if he dies before coming of age to a niece hilda covington who is his ward and lives with him he leaves her beside only five hundred pounds because she is herself an heiress there are a score of small legacies to old servants soldiers widows and people of that sort  well you may as well give me the list entire  dawkins shrugged his shoulders  just as you like he said the will was signed yesterday but i have the note of instructions still by me and will bring round the list tomorrow evening though upon my word i dont see what interest it can possibly have for you  i dont know myself the other said shortly but there is never any saying  after talking for a few minutes on other subjects he said the room is open downstairs now dawkins and as we have finished the bottle i will not keep you any longer in fact the name of that old general has called up some queer memories of old times and i should like to think them over  when the clerk had left wilkinson sat for a long time in thought  it is a great idea he murmured to himself at last it will want a tremendous lot of planning to arrange it all and of course it is tremendously risky still it can be done and the stake is worth trying for even if it would be seven years transportation if anything went wrong in the first place i have to get some proofs of my identity i own that i have neglected my family scandalously and his face which had been stern and hard softened into a smile then of course i must establish myself in chambers in the west end and as i have three or four thousand pounds in hand i can carry on for two or three years if necessary at the worst the general is likely to add me to his list of legatees but of course that would scarcely be worth playing for alone the will is the thing i dont see my way to that but it is hard if it cant be managed somehow the child is of course an obstacle but that can certainly be got over and as i dont suppose the old man is going to die at present i have time to make my plans when i see how matters go i can put my hand on a man who could be relied on to help me carry out anything i might put in his way well i always thought that i should hit on something good through these young scamps who come here but this is a bigger thing than i ever dreamed of it will certainly be a difficult game to play but knocking about all over the world as i have been for fifteen years before i came back and set up this show i think that i have learned enough to pass muster anywhere  somewhat to the surprise of the habitués of the room below it was nearly eleven oclock before the proprietor made his appearance there and even when he did so he took little interest in what was going on but moved restlessly from one room to another smoking cigar after cigar without intermission and acknowledging but briefly the greetings of those who were the most regular frequenters of his establishment  two days later the following advertisement appeared not only in the london papers but in a large number of country journals       john simcoe any relatives of john simcoe who left england about      the year 1830 or 1831 and is supposed to have been lost at sea in      the bay of bengal in the ship nepaul in december 1832 are      requested to communicate with j w thompson  co newspaper      agents fleet street when they will hear of something to their      advantage  only one reply was received it was dated myrtle cottage stowmarket and was as follows       sir a friend has shown me the advertisement in the ipswich paper      which must i think refer to my nephew who left here twenty years      ago i received a letter from him dated december 2 1832 from      calcutta saying that he was about to sail for china in the      nepaul i never heard from him again but the rector here kindly      made some inquiries for me some months afterwards and learned      that the vessel had never been heard of after sailing but was      believed to have foundered with all hands in a great gale that took      place a few days after she sailed so far as i know i am his only      relative awaiting a further communication from you       i remain      your obedient servant      martha simcoe  great was the excitement caused by the advertisement at myrtle cottage miss simcoe who with a tiny servant was the sole inmate of the cottage had called together all her female acquaintances and consulted them as to what the advertisement could mean and as to the way in which she should answer it  do you think it would be safe to reply at all she inquired anxiously you see my nephew john was a very wild young fellow i do not mean as to his conduct here no one could say anything against that he was a clerk in the bank you know and i believe was very well thought of but when his father died and he came into two thousand pounds it seemed to turn his head i know that he never liked the bank he had always wanted to be either a soldier or a sailor and directly he got the money he gave up his situation at the bank and nothing would do but that he must travel everyone told him that it was madness his aunt mariapoor soul you all knew herand i cried over it but nothing would move him a finelooking fellow he was as some of you will remember standing six feet high and as everyone said looking more like a soldier officer than a clerk at a bank  we asked him what he would do when his money was gone but he laughed it off and said that there were plenty of things for a man to do with a pair of strong arms he said that he might enter the service of some indian prince or marry the daughter of a black king or discover a diamond mine and all sorts of nonsense of that sort he bought such an outfit as you never did seeguns and pistols and all sorts of things and as for clothes why a prince could not have wanted more shirts by the dozen my dear and i should say eight or ten suits of white clothes which i told him would make him look like a cricketer or a baker why it took three big trunks to hold all his things but i will say for him that he wrote regular either to me or to my sister maria last time he wrote he said that he had been attacked by a tiger but had got well again and was going to china though what he wanted to go there for i am sure i dont know he could not want to buy teacups and saucers they would only get broken sending home well his death was a great blow to us  i dont know whether i should answer the advertisement miss simcoe one of her friends said there is no saying what it might mean perhaps he got into debt in india and the people think that they might get paid if they can find out his relations here  the idea came like a douche of cold water upon the little gathering  but the advertisement says will hear of something to their advantage mrs maberley miss simcoe urged timidly  oh that is nothing my dear that may be only a lawyers trick they are capable of anything i have heard  but they could not make miss simcoe pay another urged it seems to me much more likely that her nephew may have left some of his money in the hands of a banker at calcutta and now that it has been so many years unclaimed they are making inquiries to see who is his heir that seems much more likely  a murmur of assent ran round the circle and after much discussion the answer was drafted and miss simcoe in a fever of anxiety awaited the reply  two days later a tall welldressed man knocked at the door of myrtle cottage it was a loud authoritative knock such as none of miss simcoes usual visitors gave  it must be about the advertisement she exclaimed  the little servant had been enjoined to wear her sunday clothes in case a visitor should come and after a hasty glance to see if she was tidy miss simcoe sat down in her little parlor and tried to assume an appearance of calmness the front door opened and a mans voice inquired is miss simcoe in then the parlor door opened and the visitor entered pushing past the girl who had been instructed how to announce him in proper form and exclaiming my dear aunt martha fairly lifted the astonished old lady from her seat and kissed her  dear me dear me she gasped as he put her on her feet again can it be that you are my nephew john  why dont you know me aunt twenty years of knocking about have changed me sadly i am afraid but surely you must remember me  yees she said doubtfully yes i think that i remember you but you see we all thought that you were dead and i have only got that likeness of you that was cut out in black paper by a man who came round when you were only eighteen and somehow i have always thought of you as like that  yes i remember he laughed well aunt i have changed since then there is no doubt so you see i was not drowned after all i was picked up by a passing ship clinging to a spar but i lost all my money in the wreck of the nepaul i shipped before the mast we traded among the islands for some months then i had a row with the captain and ran away and threw in my lot with the natives and i have been knocking about in the east ever since and have come back with enough to live on comfortably and to help you if you need it  poor maria died four years ago she said tearfully it would have been a happiness to her indeed poor creature if you had come back before  i am sorry indeed to hear that he replied then you are living here all alone aunt  yes except for my little maid you see john maria and i laid out the money our father left us in life annuities and as long as we lived together we did very comfortably since then of course i have had to draw in a little but i manage very nicely  well well aunt there will be no occasion for you to stint yourself any more as i said i have come home with my purse warmly lined and i shall make you an allowance of fifty pounds a year you were always very kind to me as a boy and i can very well afford it and i dare say it will make all the difference to you  my dear john i could not think of taking such a sum from you  pooh pooh aunt what is the use of money if one cannot use it to make ones friends comfortable so that is settled and i wont have anything more said about it  the old lady wiped her eyes it is good of you john and it will indeed make all the difference to me it will almost double my income and i shant have to look at every halfpenny before i spend it  that is all right aunt now let us sit down comfortably to chat about old times you dont mind my smoking i hope  miss simcoe for almost the first time in her life told a lie not at all john not at all now how was it that you did not come down yourself instead of putting in an advertisement which i should never have seen if my friend mrs maberley had not happened to notice it in the paper which she takes in regularly and brought it in to show me  well i could not bring myself to come down aunt twenty years make great changes and it would have been horrible to have come down here and found that you had all gone and that i was friendless in the place where i had been brought up as a boy i thought that by my putting it into a local paper someone who had known me would be sure to see it now let me hear about all the people that i knew  john simcoe stayed for three days quietly at the cottage the news of his return spread rapidly and soon many of the friends that had known him came to welcome him his aunt had told her own circle of her nephews wealth and liberality and through them the news that john simcoe had returned home a wealthy man was imparted to all their acquaintances some of his old friends declared that they should have known him anywhere others said frankly that now they knew who he was they saw the likeness but that if they had met him anywhere else they did not think they should have recognized him  john simcoes memory had been greatly refreshed by his aunts incessant talk about his early days and doings and as his visitors were more anxious to hear of his adventures abroad than to talk of the days long past he had no difficulty whatever in satisfying all as to his identity even had not the question been settled by his liberality to his aunt from whom no return whatever could possibly be expected when he left he handed her fifty pounds in gold  i may as well give you a years money at once he said i am a careless man and might forget to send it quarterly  where can i write to you john she asked  i cannot give you an address at present he said i have only been stopping at a hotel until i could find chambers to suit me directly i do so i will drop you a line i shall always be glad to hear of you and will run down occasionally to see you and have a chat again with some of my old friends  the return of john simcoe served stowmarket as a subject for conversation for some time he had spent his money generously while there and had given a dinner at the principal hotel to a score of those with whom he had been most intimate when a boy champagne had flowed in unstinted abundance and it was generally voted that he was a capital fellow and well deserved the good fortune that had attended him in the quiet suffolk town the tales of the adventures that he had gone through created quite a sensation and when repeated by their fathers set half the boys of the place wild with a desire to imitate his example and to embark in a life which was at once delightful and ended in acquiring untold wealth on leaving he pressed several of them especially one who had been a fellowclerk with him at the bank and was now its manager to pay him a visit whenever they came to town  i expect to be in diggings of my own in a week or two he said and shall make a point of having a spare bed to put up a friend at any time  illustration you dont remember me generalpage 65     chapter vi  john simcoe   general mathieson was on the point of going out for a drive with his niece who was buttoning her glove when a servant entered the drawing room and said that a gentleman wished to speak to him  who is he did he give you his name or say what was his business  no sir i have not seen him before he merely asked me to give you his message  i suppose i had better see him hilda  well uncle i will get out of the way and go downstairs when he has come in dont let him keep you for you know that when i have put you down at your club i have an engagement to take lina crossley to do some shopping first and then for a drive in the park  i dont suppose that he will be five minutes whoever he is  hilda slipped away just in time to avoid the visitor as the manservant opened the door the general looked with some interest at the stranger for such it seemed to him his visitor was he was a tall man well dressed and yet without the precision that would mark him as being a member of a good club or an habitué of the row  you dont remember me general he said with a slight smile  i cannot say that i do the general replied your face does not seem unfamiliar to me though i cannot at the present moment place it  it is rather an uncommon name the visitor said but i am not surprised that you do not remember it or me for it is some twenty years since we met my name is simcoe  twenty years the general repeated then it must have been in india for twenty years ago i was in command of the benares district simcoe he broke off excitedly of course i knew a gentleman of that name who did me an inestimable service in fact he saved my life  i dont know that it was as much as that but at least i saved you from being mauled by a tiger  bless me the general exclaimed taking a step forward and you are the man i recognize you now and had i not believed that you had been lost at sea within a month after you had saved my life i should have known you at once though of course twenty years have changed you a good deal my dear sir i am happy indeed to know that the report was a false one and to meet you again and he shook hands with his visitor with the greatest warmth  i am not surprised that you did not recognize me the latter said i was but twentyfive then and have been knocking about the world ever since and have gone through some very rough times and done some very hard work of course you saw my name among the list of the passengers on board the nepaul which went down with as was supposed all hands in that tremendous storm in the bay of bengal happily i escaped i was washed overboard just as the wreck of the mainmast had been cut away a wave carried me close to it i climbed upon it and lashed myself to leeward of the top which sheltered me a good deal five days later i was picked up insensible and was carried to singapore i was in hospital there for some weeks when i quite recovered being penniless without references or friends i shipped on board a vessel that was going on a trading voyage among the islands i had come out to see the world and thought that i might as well see it that way as another it would take a long time to relate my afteradventures suffice it that at last after numerous wanderings i became chief adviser of a powerful chief in burmah and finally have returned home not exactly a rich man but with enough to live upon in more than comfort for the rest of my life  how long have you been in london  i have been here but a fortnight i ran down home to see if i had relatives living but found that an old lady was the sole survivor of my family i need scarcely say that my first business on reaching london was to rig myself out in a presentable sort of way and i may say that at present i feel very uncomfortable in these garments after being twenty years without putting on a black coat i happened the other day to see your name among those who attended the levée and i said to myself at once i will call upon the general and see if he has any remembrances of me  at this moment a servant entered the room with a little note       my dear uncle it is very naughty of you to be so long i am      taking the carriage and have told them to put the other horse into      the brougham and bring it round for you at once  for more than an hour the two men sat talking together and simcoe on leaving accepted a cordial invitation from the general to dinner on the following day                                       well uncle who was it hilda asked when they met in the drawing room a few minutes before the dinner hour you said you would not be five minutes and i waited for a quarter of an hour and then lost patience i asked when i came in how long he had stayed and heard that he did not leave until five oclock  he was a man who had saved my life in india child  dear me and have you never heard of him since uncle  no dear i did my best to find out his family but had no idea of ever seeing the man himself for the simple reason that i believed that he died twenty years ago he had sailed in a vessel that was reported as lost with all hands so you may well imagine my surprise when he told me who he was  did you recognize him at once uncle  not at first twenty years is a long time and he was only about fiveandtwenty when i knew him and of course he has changed greatly however even before he told me who he was i was able to recall his face he was a tall active young fellow then and i could certainly trace the likeness  i suppose he was in the army uncle  no he was a young englishman who was making a tour through india i was in command at benares at the time and he brought me letters of introduction from a man who had come out in the same ship with him and also from a friend of mine in calcutta a few days after he arrived i was on the point of going up with a party to do some tigershooting in the terai and i invited him to come with us he was a pleasant fellow and soon made himself popular he never said much about himself but as far as i understood him he was not a rich man but he was spending his money in seeing the world with a sort of happy confidence that something would turn up when his money was gone  we were out a week and had fair sport as you have often heard me say i was passionately fond of biggame shooting and i had had many narrow escapes in the course of my life but i never had so narrow a one as happened to me on that occasion we had wounded a tiger and had lost him we had spent a couple of hours in beating the jungle but without success and had agreed that the brute could not have been hit as hard as we had believed but must have made off altogether we were within fifty yards of the edge of the jungle when there was a sudden roar and before i could use my rifle the tiger sprang i was not in a howdah but on a pad and the tiger struck one of its forepaws on my knee with the other he clung for a moment to the pad and then we went down together the brute seized me by the shoulder and sprang into the jungle again carried me a dozen yards or so and then lay down still holding me by the shoulder  i was perfectly sensible but felt somewhat dazed and stupid i found myself vaguely thinking that he must after all have been very badly hit and instead of making off had hid up within a short distance of the spot where we saw him i was unable to move hand or foot for he was lying on me and his weight was pressing the life out of me i know that i vaguely hoped i should die before he took a bite at my shoulder i suppose that the whole thing did not last a minute though to me it seemed an interminable time suddenly there was a rustling in the bush with a deep growl the tiger loosed his hold of my shoulder and rising to his feet faced half round what happened after that i only know from hearsay  simcoe it seems was riding in the howdah on an elephant behind mine as the tiger sprang at my elephant he fired and hit the beast on the shoulder it was that no doubt that caused its hold to relax and brought us to the ground together as the tiger sprang with me into the jungle simcoe leaped down from the howdah and followed he had only his empty rifle and a large huntingknife it was no easy work pushing his way through the jungle but in a minute he came upon us clubbing his gun he brought it down on the left side of the tigers head before the brute who was hampered by his broken shoulder and weak from his previous wound could spring had it not been that it was the right shoulder that was broken the blow heavy as it was would have had little effect upon the brute as it was having no support on that side it reeled half over and then with a snarling growl sprang upon its assailant simcoe partly leaped aside and striking again with the barrel of his gunthe butt had splintered with the first blowso far turned it aside that instead of receiving the blow direct which would certainly have broken in his skull it fell in a slanting direction on his left shoulder  the force was sufficient to knock him down but as he fell he drew his knife the tiger had leaped partly beyond him so that he lay under its stomach and it could not for the moment use either its teeth or claws the pressure was terrible but with his last remaining strength he drove the knife to the full length of its blade twice into the tigers body the animal rolled over for a moment but there was still life in it and it again sprang to its feet when a couple of balls struck it in the head and it fell dead three officers had slipped down from their howdahs when they saw simcoe rushing into the jungle and coming up just in time they fired and so finished the conflict  there was not much to choose between simcoe and myself though i had certainly got the worst of it the flesh of his arm had been pretty well stripped off from the shoulder to the elbow my shoulder had been broken and the flesh torn by the brutes teeth but as it had not shifted its hold from the time it first grasped me till it let go to face simcoe it was not so bad as it might have been but the wound on the leg was more serious its claws had struck just above the kneecap and had completely torn it off we were both insensible when we were lifted up and carried down to the camp in a fortnight simcoe was about but it was some months before i could walk again and as you know my right leg is still stiff i had a very narrow escape of my life fever set in and when simcoe went down country a month after the affair i was still lying between life and death and never had an opportunity of thanking him for the manner in which practically unarmed he went in to face a wounded tiger in order to save my life you may imagine then my regret when a month later we got the news that the nepaul in which he had sailed had been lost with all hands  it was a gallant action indeed uncle you told me something about it soon after i came here when i happened to ask you how it was that you walked so stiffly but you did not tell it so fully and what is he going to do now  he is going to settle in london he has been as he says knocking about in the east ever since being engaged in all sorts of adventures he has been for some time in the service of a native chief some way up near the borders of burmah siam and china and somehow got possession of a large number of rubies and other precious stones which he has turned into money and now intends to take chambers and settle down to a quiet life join a club and so on of course i promised to do all in my power to further his object and to introduce him into as much society as he cared for  what is he like uncle  he is about my height and i suppose about fiveandfortythough he looks rather older no wonder after such a life as he has led he carries himself well and he is altogether much more presentable than you would expect under the circumstances indeed had i not known that he had never served i should unhesitatingly have put him down as having been in the army there is something about the way he carries his shoulders that you seldom see except among men who have been drilled he is coming here to dine tomorrow so you will see him  that relieves me of anxiety uncle for you know you had a letter this morning from colonel fitzhugh saying that he had been unexpectedly called out of town and you said that you would ask somebody at the club to fill his place but you know you very often forget things that you ought to remember  i certainly had forgotten that when i asked him to come and as i came home i blamed myself for not having asked someone else so as to make up an even number  a month later mr simcoe had become an intimate of general mathiesons house it had always been a matter of deep regret to the general that he had been unable to thank the man who at terrible risk to his life had saved him from death and that feeling was heightened when the news came that his preserver had been drowned and that the opportunity of doing so was forever lost he now spared no pains to further his wishes he constantly invited him to lunch or dinner at his club introduced him to all his friends in terms of the highest eulogium and repeated over and over again the story of his heroic action as his own club was a military one he could not propose him there but he had no difficulty in getting friends to propose and support him for two other clubs of good standing  several of the officers to whom he introduced simcoe had been at benares at the time he was hurt these he recognized at once and was able to chat with them of their mutual acquaintances and indeed surprised them by his knowledge of matters at the station that they would hardly have thought would be known to one who had made but a short stay there one of them said as much but simcoe said laughing you forget that i was laid up for a month everyone was very good to me and i had generally one or two men sitting with me and the amount of gossip i picked up about the station was wonderful of course there was nothing else to talk about and as i have a good memory i think i could tell you something about the private affairs of pretty nearly every civilian and military man on the station  everyone agreed that simcoe was a very pleasant and amusing companion he was full of anecdotes of the wild people that he had lived among and of the adventures and escapes he had gone through although none of the benares friends of the general recognized simcoe when they first met him they speedily recalled his features his instant recognition of them his acquaintance with persons and scenes at and around benares was such that they never for a moment doubted his identity and as their remembrance of the generals visitor returned they even wondered that their recognition of him had not been as instant as his of them as to his means not even to the general had simcoe explained his exact position he had taken good apartments in jermyn street gave excellent little dinners there kept undeniably good wine and equally excellent cigars dressed well and was regarded as being a thoroughly good fellow  the general was not a close observer had he been so he would speedily have noticed that his niece although always polite and courteous to mr simcoe did not receive him with the warmth and pleasure with which she greeted those who were her favorites on his part the visitor spared no pains to make himself agreeable to her he would at once volunteer to execute any commission for her if she happened to mention in his presence anything that she wanted one evening when she was going to a ball he sent her an expensive bouquet of flowers the next day when she saw him she said  i am very much obliged to you for those lovely flowers and i carried the bouquet last night but please do not send any more i dont think that it is quite nice to accept presents from anyone except very near relations it was very kind of you to think of it but i would really rather that you did not do it again uncle gives me carte blanche in the way of flowers but i do not avail myself of it very largely for the scent is apt to make me feel faint and beyond the smallest spray i seldom carry any i made an exception last night for those you sent me were most lovely you dont mind my saying that do you  not at all miss covington and i quite understand what you mean it seemed natural to me to send you some flowers out in the pacific islands especially at samoa and tahiti and indeed more or less everywhere women wear a profusion of flowers in their hair and no present is so acceptable to them  i fancy flowers do not cost so much there as they do here mr simcoe  no the latter laughed for half a dollar one can get enough to render a girl the envy of all others                                       i think you were right to ask mr simcoe not to repeat his present hilda the general said i particularly noticed the bouquet that you carried last night  yes uncle there was nothing equal to it in the room it must have cost three or four guineas  i dont think that you quite like him do you hilda  i like him uncle because he saved your life but in other respects i do not know that i do like him particularly he is very pleasant and very amusing but i dont feel that i quite understand him  how do you mean that you dont understand him  i cannot quite explain uncle to begin with i dont seem to get any nearer to himi mean to what he really is i know more of his adventures and his life than i did but i know no more of him himself than i did three months ago when i first met him at dinner  at any rate you know that he is brave the general said somewhat gravely  yes i know that of course but a man can be brave exceptionally brave and yet not possess all other good qualities he did behave like a hero in your case and i need not say that i feel deeply grateful to him for the service that he rendered you still that is the only side of his nature that i feel certain about  pooh pooh hilda the general said with some irritation what do you know about ninetenths of the men you meet you cannot even tell that they are brave  no uncle i know only the side they choose to present to me which is a pleasant side and i do not care to know more but it is different in this case mr simcoe is here nearly every day he has become one of our inner circle you are naturally deeply interested in him and i am therefore interested in him also and want to know more of him than i have got to know he is brave and pleasant is he also honest and honorable is he a man of thoroughly good principles we know what he tells us of his life and his adventures but he only tells us what he chooses  the general shrugged his shoulders  my dear child you may say the same thing of pretty nearly every unmarried man you meet when a man marries and sets up a household one does get to know something about him there are his wifes relations who as a rule speak with much frankness concerning a man who has married their daughter sister or cousin but as to bachelors as a rule one has to take them at their own valuation of course i know no more than you do as to whether simcoe is in all respects an honorable gentleman it is quite sufficient that he saved my life almost at the sacrifice of his own and whatever the life he may have led since is no business of mine he is distinctly popular among those i have introduced him to and is not likely in any way to discredit that introduction  that hilda was not entirely satisfied was evident by the letter she wrote when her uncle had as usual gone up one afternoon to his club       my dear netta i have told you several times about the mr simcoe      who saved uncles life out in india and who is so intimate at the      house i cant say that either my acquaintance with or my liking      for him increases he does not stand the test of the system and      the more i watch his lips the less i understand him he talks      fluently and quickly and yet somehow i feel that there is a      hesitation in his speech and that his lips are repeating what they      have learned and not speaking spontaneously you know that we have      noticed the same thing among those who have learned to speak by the      system but are not yet perfect in it so i need not explain further      what i mean as you will understand it for example i can always      tell at a public meeting or when listening to a preacher whether      he is speaking absolutely extemporarily or whether he has learned      his speech by heart beforehand       i really strongly misdoubt the man of course i know that he saved      my uncles life beyond that i know nothing of him and it is this      very feeling that i do know nothing that disquiets me i can no      more see into him than i can into a stone wall i can quite      understand that it is of very great importance to him to stand well      with the general he came here a stranger with a queer history he      knew no one he had money and wanted to get into society through      my uncle he has done so he has been elected to two clubs has made      a great number of acquaintances goes to the row the royal      academy the theaters and so on and is at any rate on nodding      terms with a very large number of people all this he owes to my      uncle and i fail to see what else he can wish for it would be      natural with so many other engagements that he should not come to      us so often as he used to do but there is no falling off in that      respect he is the tame cat of the establishment i dare say you      think me silly to worry over such a thing but i cant help      worrying i hate things i dont understand and i dont understand      this man       another thing is walter does not like him he constantly brings      the child toys but walter does not take to him refuses absolutely      to sit upon his knee or to be petted by him in any way i always      think that it is a bad sign when a child wont take to a man      however i will not bother you more about it now i will keep him      out of my letters as much as i can i wish i could keep him out of      my mind also as i tell myself over and over again he is nothing      to me and whether he possesses all the virtues or none of them is      or at any rate should be a matter of indifference to me i cant      help wishing that you had come over here two months later then i      should have had the benefit of your advice and opinion for you      know netta how accustomed i was for years to consider you almost      if not quite infallible     chapter vii  john simcoes friend   there was a great sensation among the frequenters of the house in elephant court when they were told that wilkinson had sold the business and the new proprietor would come in at once the feeling among those who were in his debt was one of absolute dismay for it seemed to them certain the amounts would be at once called in to their surprise and relief wilkinson went round among the foreigners whose debts in no case exceeded five pounds and handed to them their notes of hand  i am going out of the business he said and shall be leaving for abroad in a day or so i might of course have arranged with the new man for him to take over these papers but he might not be as easy as i have been and i should not like any of you to get into trouble i have never pressed anyone since i have been here still less taken anyone into court and i should like to leave on friendly terms with all so here are your papers tear them up and dont be fools enough to borrow again  towards his english clients whose debts were generally from ten to twenty pounds he took the same course adding a little good advice as to dropping billiards and play altogether and making a fresh start  you have had a sharp lesson he said and i know that you have been on thorns for the last year i wanted to show you what folly it was to place yourself in the power of anyone to ruin you and i fancy i have succeeded very well there is no harm in a game of billiards now and then but if you cannot play without betting you had better cut it altogether as for the tables it is simply madness you must lose in the long run and i am quite sure that i have got out of you several times the amount of the i o us that i hold  never were men more surprised and more relieved they could hardly believe that they were once more free men and until a fresh set of players had succeeded them the billiard rooms were frequently almost deserted to dawkins wilkinson was somewhat more explicit  you know he said the interest i took in that will of general mathieson it was not the will so much as the man that i was so interested in it showed me that he was most liberally disposed to those who had done him a service now it happens that years ago when he was at benares i saved his life from a tiger and got mauled myself in doing so i had not thought of the matter for many years but your mention of his name recalled it to me i had another name in those daysmen often change their names when they knock about in queer places as i have done however i called upon him and he expressed himself most grateful i need not say that i did not mention the billiard room to him he naturally supposed that i had just arrived from abroad and he has offered to introduce me to many of his friends and i think that i have a good chance of being put down in his will for a decent sum i brought money home with me from abroad and have made a goodish sum here so i shall resume my proper name and go west and drop this affair altogether i am not likely to come against any of the crew here and as you see and he removed a false beard and whiskers from his face i have shaved though i got this hair to wear until i had finally cut the court so you see you have unintentionally done me a considerable service and in return i shall say nothing about that fifty pounds you owe me now lad try and keep yourself straight in future you may not get out of another scrape as you have out of this all i ask is that you will not mention what i have told you to anyone else there is no fear of my being recognized with a cleanshaven face and different toggery altogether but at any rate it is as well that everyone but yourself should believe that as i have given out i have gone abroad again i shall keep your i o us but i promise you that you shall hear no more of them as long as you hold your tongue as to what i have just told you possibly i may some day need your assistance and in that case shall know where to write to you  it was not until after a great deal of thought that john simcoe had determined thus far to take dawkins into his confidence but he concluded at last that it was the safest thing to do he was as he knew often sent by the firm with any communications that they might have to make to their clients and should he meet him at the generals he might recognize him and give him some trouble he had made no secret that he had turned his hand to many callings and that his doings in the southern seas would not always bear close investigation and the fact that he had once kept a billiard room could do him no special harm as to the will dawkins certainly would not venture to own that he had repeated outside what had been done in the office the man might be useful to him in the future it was more than probable he would again involve himself in debt and was just the weak and emptyheaded young fellow who might be made a convenient tool should he require one  so elephant court knew mr wilkinson no more and certainly none of the habitués could have recognized him in the smoothshaven and faultlessly dressed man whom they might meet coming out of a west end club dawkins often turned the matter over in his mind after his first relief had passed at finding the debt that had weighed so heavily upon him perfectly wiped out  there ought to be money in it he said to himself but i dont see where it comes in in the first place i could not say he had kept a gambling place without acknowledging that i had often been there and i could not say that it was a conversation of mine about the generals will that put it into his head to call upon him and lastly he has me on the hip with those i o us possibly if the general does leave him money i may manage to get some out of him though i am by no means sure of that he is not a safe man to meddle with and he might certainly do me more harm than i could do him                                       the matter had dropped somewhat from his mind when three months later general mathieson came into the office to have an interview with his principals  after he had left the managing clerk was called in on returning he handed dawkins a sheet of paper  you will prepare a fresh will for general mathieson it is to run exactly as at present but this legacy is to be inserted after that to miss covington it might just as well have been put in a codicil but the general preferred to have it in the body of the will  dawkins looked at the instruction it contained the words to john simcoe at present residing at 132 jermyn street i bequeath the sum of ten thousand pounds as a token of my gratitude for his heroic conduct in saving my life at the cost of great personal injury to himself from the grip of a tiger in the year 1831  by jove he has done well for himself dawkins muttered as he sat down to his desk after the managing clerk had handed him the generals will from the iron box containing papers and documents relating to his affairs ten thousand pounds i wish i could light upon a general in a fix of some sort though i dont know that i should care about a tiger it is wonderful what luck some men have i ought to get something out of this if i could but see my way to it fancy the keeper of a billiard room and gaming house coming in for such a haul as this it is disgusting  he set about preparing a draft of the will but he found it difficult to keep his attention fixed upon his work and when the chief clerk ran his eye over it he looked up in indignant surprise  what on earth is the matter with you mr dawkins the thing is full of the most disgraceful blunders in several cases it is not even sense during all the time that i have been in this office i have never had such a disgraceful piece of work come into my hands before why if the office boy had been told to make a copy of the will he would have done it vastly better what does it mean  i am very sorry sir dawkins said but i dont feel very well today and i have got such a headache that i can scarcely see what i am writing  well well his superior said somewhat mollified that will account for it i thought at first that you must have been drinking you had better take your hat and be off go to the nearest chemist and take a dose and then go home and lie down you are worse than of no use in the state that you are i hope that you will be all right in the morning for we are as you know very busy at present and cannot spare a hand tear up that draft and hand the will and instructions to mr macleod the general will be down here at ten oclock tomorrow to see it he is like most military men sharp and prompt and when he wants a thing done he expects to have it done at once                                       you are feeling better i hope this morning he said when dawkins came into the office at the usual hour next day though i must say that you look far from well do you think that you are capable of work  i think so sir at any rate my head is better  it was true that the clerk did not look well for he had had no sleep all night but had tossed restlessly in bed endeavoring but in vain to hit on some manner of extracting a portion of the legacy from the exproprietor of the gambling house the more he thought the more hopeless seemed the prospect john simcoe was eminently a man whom it would be unsafe to anger the promptness and decision of his methods had gained him at least the respect of all the frequenters of his establishment and just as he had sternly kept order there so he would deal with any individual who crossed his path he held the best cards too and while a disclosure of the past could hardly injure him seriously he had the means of causing the ruin and disgrace of dawkins himself if he ventured to attack him  the clerk was himself shrewd in his own way but he had the sense to feel that he was no match for john simcoe and the conclusion that he finally came to was that he must wait and watch events and that so far as he could see his only chance of obtaining a penny of the legacy was to follow implicitly the instructions simcoe had given him in which case possibly he might receive a present when the money was paid                                       about a fortnight after he knew the will had been signed by general mathieson simcoe went down to a small house on pentonville hill where one of the ablest criminals in london resided passing unsuspected under the eyes of the police in the character of a man engaged in business in the city a peculiar knock brought him to the door  ah is it you simcoe he said why i have not seen you for months i did not know you for the moment for you have taken all the hair off your face  i have made a change harrison i have given up the billiard rooms and am now a swell with lodgings in jermyn street  that is a change i thought you said the billiards and cards paid well but i suppose you have got something better in view  they did pay well but i have a very big thing in hand  that is the right line to take up the other said you were sure to get into trouble with the police about the cardplaying before long and then the place would have been shut up and you might have got three months and when you got out the peelers would have kept their eyes upon you and your chances would have been at an end no i have never had anything to do with small affairs i go in as you know for big things they take time to work out it is true and after all ones trouble something may go wrong at the last moment and the thing has to be given up some girl who has been got at makes a fool of herself and gets discharged a week before it comes off or a lady takes it into her head to send her jewels to a bankers and go on to the continent a week earlier than she intended to do then there is a great loss in getting rid of the stuff those sharps at amsterdam dont give more than a fifth of the value for diamonds it is a heartrending game on the whole but there is such excitement about the life that when one has once taken it up it is seldom indeed that one changes it though one knows that sooner or later one is sure to make a slip and get caught now what will you take champagne or brandy  i know that your brandy is firstrate harrison and i will sample it again  i have often thought went on the other after the glasses had been filled and cigars lighted what a rum thing it was that you should come across my brother bill out among the islands he had not written to me for a long time and i had never expected to hear of him again i thought that he had gone down somehow and had either been eaten by sharks or killed by the natives or shot in some row with his mates he was two years older than i was and as i have told you we were sons of a welltodo auctioneer in the country but he was a hard man and we could not stand it after a time so we made a bolt for it we were decently dressed when we got to london as we had been at a good school at home and were both pretty sharp we thought that we should have no difficulty in getting work of some sort  we had a hard time of it no one would take us without a character so we got lower and lower till we got to know some boys who took us to what was called a thieves kitchena place where boys were trained as pickpockets the old fellow who kept it saw that we were fit for higher game than was usual and instead of being sent out to pick up what we could get in the streets we were dressed as we had been before and sent to picturegalleries and museums and cricket matches and we soon became firstrate hands and did well in a short time we didnt see why we should work for another man and we left him without saying goodby  it was not long before he paid us out he knew that we should go on at the same work and dressed up two or three of his boys and sent them to these places and one day when bill was just pocketing a watch at lords one of these boys shouted out thief thief that boy has stolen your watch sir and bill got three months though the boy could not appear against him for i followed him after they had nabbed bill and pretty nearly killed him  then i went on my travels and was away two or three years from london bill had been out and in again twice he was too rash altogether i took him away with me but i soon found that it would not do and that it would soon end in our both being shut up so i put it fairly to him  we are good friends you know bill i said but it is plain to me that we cant work together with advantage you are twenty and i am eighteen but as you have often said yourself i have got the best head of the two i am tired of this sort of work when we get a gold ticker worth perhaps twenty pounds we cant get above two for it and it is the same with everything else it is not good enough we have been away from london so long that old isaacs must have forgotten all about us i have not been copped yet and as i have got about twenty pounds in my pocket i can take lodgings as a young chap who has come up to walk the hospitals or something of that sort if you like to live with me quiet we will work together if not it is best that we should each go our own wayalways being friends you know  bill said that was fair enough but that he liked a little life and to spend his money freely when he got it so we separated bill got two more convictions and the last time it was a case of transportation we had agreed between ourselves that if either of us got into trouble the other should call once a month at the house of a woman we knew to ask for letters and i did that regularly after he was sent out i got a few letters from him the first was written after he had made his escape he told me that he intended to stay out thereit was a jolly life and a free one i expect pens and paper were not common where he was anyhow he only wrote once a year or so and it was two years since i had heard from him when you wrote and said you had brought me a message from bill  ever since we parted i have gone on the same line only i have worked carefully i was not a badlooking chap and hadnt much difficulty in getting over servant girls and finding out where things were to be had so i gradually got on for years now i have only carried on big affairs working the thing up and always employing other hands to carry the job out none of them know me here i meet them at quiet pubs and arrange things there and i need hardly say that i am so disguised that none of the fellows who follow my orders would know me again if they met me in the street i could retire if i liked and live in a villa and keep my carriage why i made five thousand pounds as my share of that bullion robbery between london and brussels but i know that i should be miserable without anything to do as it is i unite amusement with business i sometimes take a stall at the opera and occasionally i find a diamond necklace in my pocket when i get home i know well enough that it is foolish but when i see a thing that i need only put out my hand to have my old habit is too strong for me then i often walk into swell entertainments you have only to be well got up and to go rather late so that the hostess has given up expecting arrivals and is occupied with her guests and the flunky takes your hat without question and you go upstairs and mix with the people in that way you get to know as to the women who have the finest jewels and have no difficulty in finding out their names i have got hold of some very good things that way but though there would have been no difficulty in taking some of them at the time i never yielded to that temptation in a crowded room one never can say whose eyes may happen to be looking in your direction  i wonder that you never turned your thoughts that way from what you have told me of your doings abroad i know that you are not squeamish in your ideas and with your appearance you ought to be able to go anywhere without suspicion  i am certainly not squeamish simcoe said but i have not had the training one wants a little practice and to begin young as you did to try that game on however just at present i have a matter in hand that will set me up for life if it turns out well but i shall want a little assistance in the first place i want to get hold of a man who could make one up well and who if i gave him a portrait could turn me out so like the original that anyone who had only seen him casually would take me for him  there is a man down in whitechapel who is the best hand in london at that sort of thing he is a downright artist several times when i have had particular jobs in hand inquiries i could not trust anyone else to make i have been to him and when he has done with me and i have looked in the glass there was not the slightest resemblance to my own face in it i suppose the man you want to represent is somewhere about your own height  yes i should say that he is as nearly as may be the same he is an older man than i am  oh that is nothing he could make you look eighty if you wanted it here is the mans address his usual fee is a guinea but as you want to be got up to resemble someone else he might charge you double  the fee is nothing simcoe said then again i may want to get hold of a man who is a good hand at imitating handwriting  that is easy enough here is the address of a man who does little jobs for me sometimes and is i think the best hand at it in england you see sometimes there is in a house where you intend to operate some confoundedly active and officious fellowa butler or a footmanwho might interrupt proceedings his master is in london and he receives a note from him ordering him to come up to town with a dressing case portmanteau guns or something of that kind as may be suitable to the case i got a countess out of the way once by a messenger arriving on horseback with a line from her husband saying that he had met with an accident in the huntingfield and begging her to come to him of course i have always previously managed to get specimens of handwriting and my man imitates them so well that they have never once failed in their action i will give you a line to him saying that you are a friend of mine he knows me under the name of sinclair as a stranger you would hardly get him to act  of course he is thoroughly trustworthy simcoe asked  i should not employ him if he were not the other said he was a writingmaster at one time but took to drink and went altogether to the bad he is always more or less drunk now and you had better go to him before ten oclock in the morning i dont say that he will be quite sober but he will be less drunk than he will be later as soon as he begins to write he pulls himself together he puts a watchmakers glass in his eye and closely examines the writing that he has to imitate writes a few lines to accustom himself to it and then writes what he is told to do as quickly and as easily as if it were his own handwriting he hands it over takes his fee which is two guineas and then goes out to a publichouse and i dont believe that the next day he has the slightest remembrance of what he has written  thank you very much harrison i think that with the assistance of these two men i shall be able to work the matter i have in hand without fear of a hitch  anything else i can do for you you know that you can rely upon me simcoe you were with poor bill for six years and you stood by him to the last when the natives rose and massacred the whites and you got bill off and if he did die afterwards of his wounds anyhow you did your best to save him so if i can help you i will do it whatever it is short of murder and there is my hand on it you know in any case i could not round on you  i will tell you the whole business harrison i have thought the matter pretty well out but i shall be very glad to have your opinion on it and with your head you are like to see the thing in a clearer light than i can and may suggest a way out of some difficulties  he then unfolded the details of his scheme  very good the other said admiringly when he had finished it does credit to you simcoe you risked your life and as you say very nearly lost it to save the generals and have some sort of a right to have his money when he has done with it your plan of impersonating the general and getting another lawyer to draw out a fresh will is a capital one and as you have a list of the bequests he made in his old one you will not only be able to strengthen the last will but will disarm the opposition of those who would have benefited by the first as no one will suffer by the change but how about the boy  the boy must be got out of the way somehow  not by foul play i hope simcoe i could not go with you there  certainly not that idea never entered my mind but surely there can be no difficulty in carrying off a child of that age it only wants two to do that one to engage the nurse in talk the other to entice the child away pop him into a cab waiting hard by and drive off with him  i doubt whether the courts would hand over the property unless they had some absolute proof that the child was dead  they would not do so for some time no doubt but evidence might be manufactured at any rate i could wait they would probably carry out all the other provisions of the will and with the ten thousand pounds and the three or four thousand i have saved i could hold on for a good many years  how about the signature to the will  i can manage that much simcoe said i had some work in that way years ago and i have been for the last three months practicing the generals and i think now that i can defy any expert to detect the difference of course it is a very different thing learning to imitate a signature and writing a long letter  the other agreed and added i should be careful to employ a firm of lawyers of long standing if you were to go to shady people it would in itself cause suspicion  yes i quite feel that and i want if possible to get hold of people who just know the general by sight so as to have a fairly good idea of his face without knowing him too well i think i know of one at the club the other day colonel bulstrode a friend of the generals said to him i wish you would drive round with me to my lawyers their place is in the temple i want someone to sign as a witness to a deed and as it is rather important i would rather have it witnessed by a friend than by one of the clerks it wont take you a minute  i should think that would do very well they would not be likely to notice him very particularly and probably the general would not have spoken at all he would just have seen his friend sign the deed and then have affixed his own signature as a witness well everything seems in your favor and should you need any help you can rely upon me     chapter viii  general mathiesons seizure   three months later john simcoe called for a letter directed to mr jackson care of william scriven tobacconist fetter lane the address was in his own handwriting he carried it home before opening it the writing was rough and the spelling villainous       samoa       my dear jack i was mitely glad when the old brig came in and      captain jephson handed me a letter from you and as you may guess      still more pleased to find with it an order for fifty pounds it      was good and harty of you but you allus was the right sort i have      dun as you asked me i went to the wich man and for twelve bottles      of rum he gave me the packet inclosed of the stuff he uses there      aint much of it but it is mitely strong about as much as will lie      on the end of a knife will make a man foam at the mouth and fall      into convulsions three times as much as that will kill him      outrite he says there aint no taste in it i hope this will suit      your purpus you will be sorry to hear that long peter has been      wiped out he was spered by a native who thort pete wanted to run      away with his wife wich i dont believe he did for she wernt no      way a beuty vigors is in a bad way he has had the shakes bad      twice and i dont think that he can last much longer trade is bad      here but now i have got the rino i shall buy another cocoanut      plantation and two or three more wives to work it and shall be      comfortible i am a pore hand with the pen so no more from your      friend       ben stokes  a week later hilda wrote to her friend       my dear netta i am writing in great distress three days ago      uncle had a terrible fit he was seized with it at the club and i      hear that his struggles were dreadful it was a sort of convulsion      he was sensible when he was brought home but very weak he does      not remember anything about it fortunately dr pearson who      always attends us was one of the party and he sent off cabs for      two others dr pearson came home with him of course i asked him      what it was and he said that it was a very unusual case and that      he and the other doctors had not yet come to any decision upon it      as none of them had ever seen one precisely like it he said that      some of the symptoms were those of an epileptic fit but the      convulsions were so violent that they rather resembled tetanus than      an ordinary fit altogether he seemed greatly puzzled and he would      give no opinion as to whether it was likely to recur uncle is      better today he told me that he mr simcoe and four others had      been dining together he had just drunk his coffee when the room      seemed to swim round and he remembered nothing more until he found      himself in bed at home mr simcoe came home with him and the      doctor said i must acknowledge that no one could have been kinder      than he was he looked quite ill from the shock that he had had      but still i dont like him netta in fact i think i dislike him      more and more every day i often tell myself that i have not a      shadow of reason for doing so but i cant help it you may call it      prejudice i call it instinct       you can well imagine how all this has shocked me uncle seemed so      strong and well that i have always thought he would live to a great      age he is sixtyeight but i am sure he looks ten years      youngerat least he did so at present he might be ninety but i      can only hope that the change is temporary and that he will soon      be his dear self again the three doctors are going to have a      meeting here tomorrow i shall be anxious indeed to hear the      result i hope that they will order him a change and that we can      go down together either to his place or mine then i can always be      with him whereas here he goes his way and i go mine and except at      mealtimes we scarcely meet if he does go i shall try and persuade      him to engage a medical man to go with us of course i do not know      whether a doctor could be of any actual use in case of another      attack but it would be a great comfort to have one always at      hand  the letter stopped here and was continued on the following evening       the consultation is over dr pearson had a long talk with me      afterwards he said that it was without doubt an epileptic fit but      that it differed in many respects from the general type of that      malady and that all of them were to some extent puzzled they had      brought with them a fourth doctor sir henry havercourt who is the      greatest authority on such maladies he had seen uncle and asked      him a few questions and had a talk with dr pearson and had from      him a minute account of the seizure he pronounced it a most      interesting and as far as he knew a unique case and expressed a      wish to come as a friend to see how the general was getting on of      course he inquired about his habits asked what he had had for      dinner and so on       the great point dr pearson i said after the consultation was      over is of course whether there is likely to be any recurrence      of the attack that is more than i can say he answered gravely      at present he can hardly be said to have recovered altogether from      the effects of this one which is in itself an unusual feature in      the case as a rule when a person recovers from an epileptic fit      he recovers altogetherthat is to say he is able to walk and talk      as before and his face shows little or no sign of the struggle      that he has undergone in this case the recovery is not altogether      complete you may have noticed that his voice is not only weak but      there is a certain hesitation in it his face has not altogether      recovered its natural expression and is slightly very slightly      drawn on one side which would seem to point to paralysis while in      other respects the attack was as unlike a paralytic stroke as it      could well have been thus you see it is difficult in the extreme      for us to give any positive opinion concerning a case which is so      entirely an exceptional one we can only hope for the best and      trust to the strength of his constitution at any rate we all      agree that he needs absolute quiet and very simple and plain diet      you see he has been a great dinerout and though an abstemious      man in the way of drinking he thoroughly appreciates a good      dinner all this must be given up at any rate for a time i should      say that as soon as he is a little stronger you had better take      him down into the country let him see as few visitors as possible      and only very intimate friends i do not mean that he should be      lonely or left to himself on the contrary quiet companionship and      talk are desirable       i said that though the country might be best for him there was no      medical man within three miles of his place and it would be      terrible were we to have an attack and not know what to do for it      he said that he doubted if anything could be done when he was in      such a state as he was the other night beyond sprinkling his face      with water and that he himself felt powerless in the case of an      attack that was altogether beyond his experience of course he said      it was out of the question that i should be down there alone with      him but that i must take down an experienced nurse he strongly      recommended that she should not wear hospital uniform as this      would be a constant reminder of his illness       i said that i should very much like to have a medical man in the      house money was no object and it seemed to me from what he said      that it would also be desirable that besides being a skillful      doctor he should be also a pleasant and agreeable man who would      be a cheerful companion to him as well as a medical attendant       he agreed that this would certainly be very desirable and that he      and the others were all anxious that the case should be watched      very carefully he said that he would think the matter over and      that if he could not find just the man that would suit he would      ask sir henry havercourt to recommend us one       he said there were many clever young men to whom such an      engagement for a few months would be a godsend he intended to run      down himself once a fortnight from saturday until monday which he      could do as his practice was to a large extent a consulting one i      could see plainly enough that though he evidently put as good a      face upon it as he could he and the other doctors took by no means      a hopeful view of the case       it is all most dreadful netta and i can hardly realize that only      three days ago everything was bright and happy while now it seems      that everything is uncertain and dark there was one thing the      doctor said that pleased me and that was dont let any of his      town friends in to see him and i think that it would be as well      that none of them should go down to visit him in the country let      him be kept altogether free from anything that would in the      smallest degree excite him or set his brain working i told him      that no one had seen him yet and that i would take good care that      no one should see him and i need hardly tell you that mr simcoe      will be the first person to be informed of the doctors orders  a week later general mathieson came downstairs for the first time the change in him was even greater than it had seemed to be when he was lying on the sofa in his room and tom roberts who had been the generals soldierservant years before and had been in his service since he left the army had difficulty in restraining his tears as he entered with his master leaning heavily on his arm  i am shaky my dear hilda very shaky the general said i feel just as i did when i was laid up with a bad attack of jungle fever in india however no doubt i shall pick up soon just i did then pearson tells me that he and the others agree that i must go down into the country and i suppose i must obey orders where is it we are to go  to your own place uncle  my own place he repeated doubtfully and then after a pause oh yes of course oh yes  there was a troubled look in his face as if he was trying to recall memories that had somehow escaped him and hilda resolutely repressing the impulse to burst into a flood of tears said cheerfully  yes i shall be very glad to be back at holmwood we wont go down by train uncle dr pearson does not think that you are strong enough for that yet he is going to arrange for a comfortable carriage in which you can lie down and rest we shall make an early start he will arrange for horses to be sent down so that we can change every ten or twelve miles and arrive there early in the afternoon it is only seventy miles you know  yes i have driven up from there by the coach many a time when i was a boy and sometimes since have i not tom  yes general the railway was not made till six or seven years ago  no the railway wasnt made hilda at least not all the way  hilda made signs to tom not to leave the room and he stood by his masters shoulder prompting him occasionally when his memory failed him  you must get strong very fast uncle for dr pearson said that you cannot go until you are more fit to bear the fatigue  i shall soon get strong my dear what is today  today is friday uncle  somehow i have lost count of days he said well i should think that i shall be fit to go early next week it is not as if we were going to ride down i was always fond of riding and i hope i shall soon be after the hounds again let me see what month is this  it is early in june uncle and the country will be looking its best  yes yes i shall have plenty of time to get strong before cubhunting begins  so the conversation dragged on for another half hour the generals words coming slower and slower and at the end of that time he dropped asleep hilda made a sign to roberts to stay with him and then ran up to her own room closed the door behind her and burst into a passion of tears presently there was a tap at the door and her maid came in  tom has just slipped out from the dining room miss and told me to tell you that the general was sleeping as peacefully as a child and he thought it was like enough that he would not wake for hours he said that when he woke he and william would get him up to his own room  thank you lucy the door closed again hilda got up from the bed on which she had lain down and buried herself in the depths of a large cushioned chair there she sat thinking for the first time she realized how immense was the change in her uncle she had seen him several times each day but he had spoken but a few words and it only seemed to her that he was drowsy and disinclined to talk now she saw how great was the mental as well as the physical weakness  it is terrible she repeated over and over again to herself what a wreckoh what a dreadful wreck will he ever get over it  she seemed absolutely unable to think sometimes she burst into sobs sometimes she sat with her eyes fixed before her but seeing nothing and her fingers twining restlessly round each other presently the door opened very gently and a voice said may i come in she sprang to her feet as if electrified while a glad cry of netta broke from her lips a moment later the two girls were clasped in a close embrace  oh netta how good of you hilda said after she had sobbed for some time on her friends shoulder oh what a relief it is to me  of course i have come you foolish girl you did not suppose i was going to remain away after your letter aunt is with me she is downstairs tidying herself up we shut up the house and left the gardener in charge and here we are as long as you want us  but your pupils netta  i handed them all over to another of the professors assistants so we need not bother about them i told aunt that i should not be down for an hour mrs brown is looking after her and getting her a cup of tea and i asked her to bring two cups up here i thought that you would prefer for us to have a chat by ourselves now tell me all about it dear that is if there is anything fresh since you wrote  hilda told her the doctors opinion and the plans that had been formed  dr pearson brought a dr leeds here with him this morning he says he is very clever his term as house surgeon at guys or st bartholomews i forget which has just expired and as he had not made any definite plans he was glad to accept the doctors offer to take charge of my uncle he seemed from what little i saw of him a pleasant man and spoke in a cheerful voice which will be a great thing for uncle i should think that he is six or seven and twenty dr pearson said he was likely to become a very distinguished man in his profession some day he is going to begin at once he will not sleep here but will spend most of his time here partly because he wants to study the case and partly because he wants uncle to get accustomed to him he will travel down with us which will be a great comfort to me for there is no saying how uncle may stand the journey i suggested that we should have another carriage as the invalid carriage has room for only one inside besides the patient but he laughed and said that he would ride on the box with tom roberts there will be room for two there as we are going to post down of course you and your aunt will go down by train and be there to meet us it will make it so much brighter and more cheerful having you to receive us than if we had to arrive all alone with no one to say welcome  and is your uncle so very weak  terribly weakweak both mentally and physically and she gave an account of the interview that afternoon  that is bad indeed hilda worse than i had expected but with country air and you and me to amuse him to say nothing of the doctor we may hope that he will soon be a very different man  well i will not stay talking here any longer netta we have left your aunt half an hour alone and if she were not the kindest soul in the world she would feel hurt at being so neglected after coming all this way for my sake you dont know what good your coming has effected before you opened the door i was in the depth of despair everything seemed shaken everything looked hopeless there seemed to have been a sort of moral earthquake that had turned everything in my life topsyturvy but now i feel hopeful again with you by my side i think that i can bear even the worst  they went down to the drawing room where they found mrs brown the housekeeper having a long gossip over what had taken place with miss purcell whom although a stranger she was unaffectedly glad to see as it seemed to take some of her responsibilities off her shoulders and she knew that nettas society would be invaluable to hilda  it was not until a week later that after another consultation the doctors agreed that it was as well that the general should be moved down to his country place dr pearson was opinion that there was some improvement but that it was very slight the others could see no change since they had seen him ten days before however they agreed with their colleague that although there might be a certain amount of danger in moving him to the country it was best to risk that as the change might possibly benefit him materially  have you formed any opinion of the case dr leeds sir henry asked  i can scarcely be said to have any distinct opinion sir henry the symptoms do not tally with those one would expect to find after any ordinary sort of seizure although certainly they would point to paralysis rather than epilepsy i should had the case come before me in the ordinary way in the ward of a hospital have come to the conclusion that the seizure itself and the aftereffects pointed rather to the administration of some drug than to any other cause i admit that i am not acquainted with any drug whose administration would lead to any such results but then i know of no other manner in which they could be brought about save by some lesion of a blood vessel in the brain of so unusual a character that no such case has hitherto been reported in any work with which i am acquainted this i say would be my first theory in the case of a patient of whose previous history i was entirely unaware and who came under my charge in a hospital ward but i admit that in the present case it cannot be entertained for a moment and i must during my attendance upon general mathieson watch closely for symptoms that would aid me in localizing brain lesion or other cause  he spoke modestly and quietly in the presence as he was of some of the leading men of his profession the theory he had enunciated had not occurred to any of them but as he spoke they all recognized that the symptoms might under other circumstances have led them to a similar conclusion they were silent for a minute when he ceased speaking then sir henry said gravely  i admit dr leeds that some of the symptoms indeed the fit itself might in the case of a patient of whose history we were ignorant seem to point to some obscure form of poisoning since they do not accord with what one would expect in ordinary forms of brain seizures of this kind however there is no doubt that we are all somewhat prone when we meet with a case possessing unusual or altogether exceptional features to fall back upon the theory of poisoning in this case fortunately the circumstances are such as to preclude the possibility of entertaining the idea for a moment and as you say you must endeavor to find watching him as you will do some other cause of what i admit is a mysterious and obscure case and knowing you as i do i am sure that you will mention this theory even as a theory to no one  we are all aware that there are many cases which come before us where we may entertain suspicions and strong suspicions that the patient has been poisoned and yet we dare not take any steps because in the first place we have no clew as to how or by whom he or she has been poisoned and because if after death an autopsy should prove that we were mistaken it would be nothing short of professional ruin here as you said the theory is happily irreconcilable with the circumstances of the case and no drug known to european science would produce so strange a seizure or the aftereffects of course as we all know on the west coast of africa and it is believed in india the natives are acquainted with poisons which are wholly unknown and will probably remain unknown since medical men who have endeavored to investigate the matter have almost always fallen victims themselves to poisons administered by the people whose secrets they were endeavoring to discover  however we can happily put that altogether aside dr pearson tells us that he intends to go down once a fortnight and has promised to furnish us with the results of his own observations and his own reports of this very interesting case if general mathieson had in the course of his military career ever been struck in the head by a bullet i should say unhesitatingly that some splinter possibly very minute had obtruded into the brain matter but this has i learn not been the case the only serious injury that he has ever received was when he was terribly torn and nearly killed by a tiger some twenty years ago in india it may be useful to you dr leeds to keep this in your mind there can be no doubt that scratches and bites even of the domestic cat occasionally give rise to violent inflammations and probably indeed i believe it to be the case those of the great cats of india are still more poisonous as is the case with the bite of a mad dog the poison may in some cases remain latent for a considerable time until some circumstance may arouse it into activity i would suggest that should any scars caused at that time remain you should examine them carefully and ascertain whether there is any sign of inflammatory action there i grant the improbability of any consequences arising so many years after the event but at the same time in a case of this kind where we are perfectly at a loss to explain what we see it is as well to look for the cause in every direction however improbable it may appear  thank you sir henry i will certainly do so i was not aware before of the general having suffered such an injury and i will go this afternoon and spend a few hours in looking through the medical works at the library of the india office to see if there are any records of serious disturbance caused in the system by wounds inflicted by tigers a considerable time after they have apparently healed  the meeting then broke up and two days later general mathieson was taken down to his seat in warwickshire post horses were in readiness all along the road and the journey was accomplished quickly and without fatigue to the patient who slept the greater part of the distance at each change dr leeds got down and had two or three minutes talk with hilda and when the general was awake gave him a spoonful of restorative medicine his presence close at hand was a great comfort to hilda upon whom the strain of watching her uncle was very great and she was thankful indeed when they arrived at the end of the journey and found netta and her aunt who had gone down by that mornings train together with the housekeeper and her own maid waiting on the steps to receive them     chapter ix  a strange illness   for three months general mathieson remained in the country his improvement was very gradualso gradual indeed that from week to week it was scarce noticeable and it was only by looking back that it was perceptible at the end of that time he could walk unaided there was less hesitation in his speech and his memory was distinctly clearer he passed much of his time on a sofa placed in the shade in the garden with hilda and netta sitting by him working and talking  netta had always been a favorite of his from the time that he first met her in hanover and he had when she was staying with his niece the year before offered her a very handsome salary if she would remain with her as her companion the girl however was reluctant to give up her occupation of which she was very fond still less would she leave her aunt and although the general would willingly have engaged the latter also as an inmate of the house to act as a sort of chaperon to hilda when she drove out alone shopping netta refused in both their names  you would not have left the army general whatever temptations might have been held out to you i am happy in thinking that i am doing good and useful work and i dont think that any offer even one so kind and liberal as yours would induce me to relinquish it  her presence now was not only an inestimable comfort to hilda but of great advantage to the general himself alone hilda would have found it next to impossible to keep the invalid interested and amused he liked to talk and be talked to but it was like the work of entertaining a child netta however had an inexhaustible fund of good spirits after her long intercourse with children who needed entertainment with instruction and whose attention it was absolutely necessary to keep fixed she had no difficulty in keeping the conversation going and her anecdotes connected with her life in germany and the children she had taught were just suited to the generals mental condition  little walter was of great assistance to her he had come down with his nurse as soon as they were fairly settled at holmwood and his prattle and play were a great amusement to his grandfather whenever the conversation flagged netta offered to tell him a story which not only kept him quiet but was listened to with as much interest by the general as by the child dr leeds was often a member of the party and his cheery talk always had its effect in soothing the general when as was sometimes the case he was inclined to be petulant and irritable  they had been a fortnight at holmwood before the doctor discovered nettas infirmity she happened to be standing at a window with her back to him when he asked her a question receiving no reply he repeated it in a louder tone but he was still unanswered somewhat surprised he went up to her and touched her she faced round immediately  were you speaking to me dr leeds  yes i spoke to you twice miss purcell but you did not hear me  i have been perfectly deaf from childhood she said i cannot hear any sound whatever i never talk about it people ask questions and wonder and then forgetting that i do not hear they persist in addressing me in loud tones  is it possible that you are deaf  it is a melancholy fact she said with a smile and then added more seriously it came on after measles when i was eight years old my good aunt who had taken me to some of the best aurists in london happened to hear that a professor menzel had opened an establishment in hanover for teaching deaf mutes to speak by a new system of watching peoples lips she took me over there and as you see the result was an undoubted success and i now earn my living by acting as one of the professors assistants and by teaching two or three little girls who board at my aunts  the system must be an admirable one indeed the doctor said i have of course heard of it but could not have believed that the results were so excellent it never entered my mind for a moment that you were in any way deficient in hearing still less that you were perfectly deaf i have noticed that more than is common you always kept your eyes fixed on my face when i was speaking to you  you would have noticed it earlier had we been often alone together she said for unless i had kept my eyes always upon you i should not have known when you were speaking but when as here there are always several of us together my eyes are at once directed to your face when you speak by seeing the others look at you  is it necessary to be quite close to you when one speaks  oh not at all of course i must be near enough to be able to see distinctly the motion of the lips say at twenty yards it is a great amusement to me as i walk about for i can see what is being said by people on the other side of the road or passing by in a vehicle of course one only gets scraps of conversations but sometimes they are very funny  you must be quite a dangerous person miss purcell  i am she laughed and you must be careful not to say things that you dont want to be overheard when you are within reach of my eyes yesterday for instance you said to hilda that my aunt seemed a wonderfully kind and intelligent old lady and you were good enough to add some complimentary remarks about myself  dr leeds flushed  well i should not have said them in your hearing miss purcell but as they were complimentary no harm was done i think i said that you were invaluable here which is certainly the case for i really do not know how we should be able to amuse our patient if it were not for your assistance  hilda and i had a laugh about it netta said and she said too that it was not fair your being kept in the dark as to our accomplishment  our accomplishment he repeated in surprise do you mean to say that miss covington is deaf also but no that is impossible for i called to her yesterday when her back was turned and the general wanted her and she answered immediately  my tongue has run too fast the girl said but i dont suppose she would mind your knowing what she never speaks of herself she was as you know living with us in hanover for more than four years she temporarily lost her hearing after an attack of scarlet fever and the doctors who were consulted here feared that it might be permanent her father and mother hearing of dr hartwig as having the reputation of being the first aurist in europe took her out to him he held out hopes that she could be cured and recommended that she should be placed in professor menzels institution as soon as she could understand german so that in case a cure was not effected she might be able to hear with her eyes by great good fortune he recommended that she should live with my aunt partly because she spoke english and partly because as i was already able to talk i could act as her companion and instructor both in the system and in german  in three years she could get on as well as i could but the need for it happily passed away as her hearing was gradually restored still she continued to live with us while her education went on at the best school in the town but of course she always talked with me as i talked with her and so she kept up the accomplishment and has done so ever since but her mother advised her very strongly to keep the knowledge of her ability to read peoples words from their lips a profound secret as it might tend to her disadvantage for people might be afraid of a girl possessed of the faculty of overhearing their conversation at a distance  that explains what rather puzzled me the other day the doctor said when i came out into the garden you were sitting together and were laughing and talking you did not notice me and it struck me as strange that while i heard the laughing i did not hear the sound of your voices until i was within a few paces of you when miss covington noticed me i at once heard your voices  yes you gave us both quite a start and hilda said we must either give up talking silently or let you into our secret so i dont think that she will be vexed when i tell her that i have let it out  i am glad to have the matter explained he said for really i asked myself whether i must not have been temporarily deaf and should have thought it was so had i not heard the laughing as distinctly as usual i came to the conclusion that you must for some reason or other have dropped your voices to a whisper and that one or the other was telling some important secret that you did not wish even the winds to hear  i think that this is the only secret that we have netta laughed  seriously this is most interesting to me as a doctor and it is a thousand pities that a system that acts so admirably should not be introduced into this country you should set up a similar institution here miss purcell  i have been thinking of doing so some day hilda is always urging me to it but i feel that i am too young yet to take the head of an establishment but in another four or five years time i shall think seriously about it  i can introduce you to all the aurists in london miss purcell and i am sure that you will soon get as many inmates as you may choose to take in cases where their own skill fails altogether they would be delighted to comfort parents by telling them how their children may learn to dispense altogether with the sense of hearing  not quite altogether she said it has happened very often as it did just now that i have been addressed by someone at whom i did not happen to be looking and then i have to explain my apparent rudeness by owning myself to be entirely deaf unfortunately i have not always been able to make people believe it and i have several times been soundly rated by strangers for endeavoring to excuse my rudeness by a palpable falsehood  really i am hardly surprised dr leeds said for i should myself have found it difficult to believe that one altogether deaf could have been taught to join in conversation as you do well i must be very careful what i say in future while in the society of two young ladies possessed of such dangerous and exceptional powers  you need not be afraid doctor i feel sure that there is no one here to whom you would venture to give us a bad character  i think he went on more seriously that miss covingtons mother was very wise in warning her against her letting anyone know that she could read conversations at a distance people would certainly be afraid of her for gossipmongers would be convinced that she was overhearing if i may use the word what was said if she happened to look at them only casually                                       at the end of three months the general became restless and was constantly expressing a wish to be brought back to london  what do you think yourself dr leeds dr pearson said when he paid one of his usual visits  he is of course a great deal better than he was when he first came down the former replied but there is still that curious hesitation in his speech as if he was suffering from partial paralysis i am not surprised at his wanting to get up to town again as he improves in health he naturally feels more and more the loss of his usual course of life i should certainly have advised his remaining here until he had made a good deal further advancement but as he has set his mind upon it i believe that more harm would be done by refusing than by his going in fact i think that he has if anything gone back in the last fortnight and above all things it is necessary to avoid any course that might cause irritation and so set up fresh brain disturbances  i am quite of your opinion leeds i have noticed myself that he hesitates more than he did a short time since and sometimes instead of joining in the conversation he sits moody and silent and he is beginning to resent being looked after and checked  yes he said to me the other day quite angrily i dont want to be treated as a child or a helpless invalid doctor i took a mile walk yesterday i am beginning to feel quite myself again it will do me a world of good to be back in london and to drive down to the club and to have a chat with my old friends again  well i think it best that he should not be thwarted you have looked at the scars from time to time i suppose  yes there has been no change in them they are very red but he tells meand what is more to the point his man tells methat they have always been so  what do you think leeds will he ever be himself again watching the case from day to day as you have done your opinion is worth a good deal more than mine  i have not the slightest hope of it the young doctor replied quietly i have seen as complete wrecks as he is gradually pull themselves round again but they have been cases where they have been the victims of drink or of some malady from which they had been restored by a successful operation in his case we have failed altogether to determine the cause of his attack or the nature of it we have been feeling in the dark and hitherto have failed to discover a clew that we could follow up so far there has been no recurrence of his first seizure but with returning strength and returning brain work it is in my opinion more than likely that we shall have another recurrence of it the shock has been a tremendous one to the system were he a younger man he might have rallied from it but i doubt whether at his age he will ever get over it actually he is i believe under seventy physically and mentally he is ninety  that is so and between ourselves i cannot but think that a long continuance of his life is not to be desired i believe with you that he will be a confirmed invalid requiring nursing and humoring like a child and for the sake of miss covington and all around him one cannot wish that his life should be prolonged  i trust that when the end comes dr pearson it will be gradual and painless and that there will be no recurrence of that dreadful seizure  i hope so indeed i have seen many men in bad fits but i never saw anything to equal that i can assure you that several of the men who were presentmen who had gone through a dozen battleswere completely prostrated by it at least half a dozen of them men whom i had never attended before knowing that i had been present called upon me within the next two or three days for advice and were so evidently completely unstrung that i ordered them an entire change of scene at once and recommended them to go to homburg take the waters and play at the tables to do anything in fact that would distract their minds from dwelling upon the painful scene that they had witnessed had it not been for that one would have had no hesitation in assigning his illness to some obscure form of paralysis as it is it is unaccountable except he added with a smile by your theory of poison  the younger doctor did not smile in return it is the only cause that i can assign for it he said gravely the more i study the case the more i investigate the writings of medical men in india and on the east and west coast of africa the more it seems to me that the attack was the work of a drug altogether unknown to european science but known to obi women fetich men and others of that class in africa in some of the accounts of people accused of crime by fetich men and given liquor to drink which they are told will not affect them if innocent but will kill them if guilty i find reports of their being seized with instant and violent convulsions similar to those that you witnessed these convulsions often end in death sometimes where i suppose the dose was larger than usual the man drops dead in his tracks while drinking it sometimes he dies in convulsions at other times he recovers partially and lingers on a mere wreck for some months in other cases where i suppose the dose was a light one and the mans relatives were ready to pay the fetich man handsomely the recovery was speedy and complete that is to say if as is usually the case the man was not put to death at once upon the supposed proof of his guilt by what possible means such poison could have found its way to england for there is no instance of its nature being divulged to europeans i know not nor how it could have been administered but i own that it is still the only theory by which i can account for the generals state i need not say that i should never think of giving the slightest hint to anyone but yourself as to my opinion in the matter and trust most sincerely that i am mistaken but although i have tried my utmost i cannot overcome the conviction that the theory is a correct one and i think dr pearson that if you were to look into the accounts of the various ways in which the poisons are sold by old negro women to those anxious to get rid of enemies or persons whose existence is inconvenient to them and by the fetich men in these ordeals you will admit at least that had you been practicing on the west coast and any white man there had such an attack as that through which the general has passed you would without hesitation have put it down to poison by some negro who had a grudge against him  no doubt no doubt the other doctor admitted but you see we are not on the west coast these poisons are as you admit absolutely unobtainable by white men from the men and women who prepare them if obtainable when would they have been brought here and by whom and lastly by whom administered and from what motive i admit all that you say about the african poisons i lately had a long talk about them with a medical man who had been on the coast for four or five years but until these other questions can be answered i must refuse to believe that this similarity is more than accidental and in any possible way due to the same cause  that is what i have told myself scores of times and it would be a relief to me indeed could i find some other explanation of the matter then you think that he had better come up to london  i leave the matter in your hands dr leeds i would give him a few days longer and try the effect of a slight sedative possibly his desire to get up to town may die out if so he is without doubt better here if however you see that his irritation increases and he becomes more and more set upon it by all means take him up how would you do so by rail or road  certainly by rail i have been trying to make him feel that he is a free agent and encouraged him in the belief that he is stronger and better if then i say to him my dear general you are of course free to do as you like and it may be that the change will be beneficial to you if the ladies can be ready tomorrow let us start without further delay i consider it quite possible that this ready and cheerful acquiescence may result in his no longer desiring it one knows that in this respect sick people are very like fractious children they set their minds on some special article of food as a child does on a toy and when it comes they will refuse to touch it as the child will throw the coveted toy down  it turned out so in this case the moment the general found that the doctor was willing that he should go up to town and the ladies quite ready to accompany him at once he himself began to raise objections  perhaps it would be as well that we should wait another month he replied a little pretended opposition strengthened this view and the return was postponed at the end of the month he had made so much progress that when the longing for london was again expressed dr leeds offered no opposition and two days later the whole party went up     chapter x  two heavy blows   during the four months that general mathieson had remained at holmwood no one had been more constant in his inquiries as to his health than mr simcoe he had seen hilda before she started and had begged her to let him have a line once a week saying how her uncle was going on  i will get dr leeds to write she said my own opinion will be worth nothing but his will be valuable i am afraid that he will find time hang heavily on his hands and he will not mind writing i do not like writing letters at the best of times but in the trouble we are in now i am sure that i shall not be equal to it  dr leeds willingly undertook the duty of sending a short weekly bulletin not only to mr simcoe but to a dozen other intimate friends  it is not half an hours work he said when netta offered to relieve him by addressing the envelopes or copying out his report very few words will be sufficient the general has made some slight progress this week or the general remains in very much the same state or i am glad to be able to record some slight improvement that with my signature will be quite sufficient and when i said that half an hour would be enough i exaggerated i fancy that it will be all done in five minutes  mr simcoe occasionally wrote a few lines of thanks but scarcely a day passed that he did not send some little present for the invalida bunch of the finest grapes a few choice peaches and other fruit from abroad of flowers they had plenty in their own conservatories at holmwood while game was abundant for both from neighbors and from club friends they received so large a quantity that a considerable proportion was sent back in hampers to the london hospitals  some of mr simcoes presents were of a different description among them was a machine that would hold a book at any angle desired while at the same time there was a shelf upon which a cup or tumbler a spare book or newspaper could be placed  at any rate hilda this mr simcoe of yours is very thoughtful and kind towards your uncle netta said  yes hilda admitted reluctantly he certainly is very thoughtful but i would much rather he did not send things we can get anything we want from warwick or leamington or indeed from london merely by sending a line or a telegram one hates being under obligations to a man one does not like  it seems to me at present that you are unjust hilda and i certainly look forward to seeing him in london and drawing my own conclusions  yes no doubt you will see him and often enough too hilda said pettishly of course if uncle means to go to his club it will be impossible to say that he is unfit to see his friends at home  netta however did not see mr simcoe on their return for dr leeds on the suggestion of hilda stated in his last report that the general would be going up to town in a day or two but that he strongly deprecated any visits until he could see how the invalid stood the journey  there was no doubt that he stood it badly just at first the excitement seemed to inspire him with strength but this soon died away and he had to be helped from the railway carriage to the brougham and lifted out when he arrived at home dr leeds saw to his being carried upstairs undressed and put to bed  he is weaker than i thought he said in reply to hildas anxious look when he joined the party downstairs i cannot say that it is want of physical strength for he has walked over a mile several times without apparent fatigue it seems to me that it is rather failure of will power or brain power if you like i noticed that he very frequently sat looking out of the window and it is possible that the succession of objects passing rapidly before the eye has had the same effect of inducing giddiness that waltzing has to one unaccustomed to it i trust that tomorrow the effect will have passed off i had as you know intended to sleep at a friends chambers tonight but i should not think of doing so now but will sit up with him i will get roberts to take watch and watch with me i can lie down on the sofa and he can wake me should there be any change i sent him off in a cab as soon as we got your uncle into bed to fetch dr pearson if he is at home he will be here in a few minutes  it was however half an hour before dr pearson came as he was out when the cab arrived he had on the way learned from tom roberts the state in which the general had arrived and he hurried upstairs at once to his room  so he has broken down badly leeds  very badly  i did not expect it when i saw him last sunday he seemed to have made so much progress that i thought there could be no harm in his being brought up to london though as i said to you i thought it would be better to dissuade him from going to his club he might see a few of his friends and have a quiet chat with them here his pulse is still much fuller than i should have expected from the account his man gave of him there is a good deal of irregularity but that has been the case ever since the attack  i think that it is mental rather than bodily collapse the younger man said a sudden failure of brain power he was absolutely unable to make any effort to walk or indeed to move his limbs at all it was a sort of mental paralysis  and to some slight extent bodily also dr pearson said leaning over the bed and examining the patient closely do you see there is a slight but distinct contortion of the face just as there was after that fit  i see there is he has not spoken since we lifted him from the railway carriage and i am afraid that tomorrow we shall find that he has lost partially or entirely the power of speech i fear that this is the beginning of the end  dr pearson nodded  there can be little doubt of it nor could we wish it to be otherwise still he may linger for weeks or even months  hilda read the doctors opinion in his face when he went downstairs  oh doctor dont say he is going to die she cried  i do not say that he is going to die at once my dear he may live for some time yet but it is of no use concealing from you that neither dr leeds nor myself have the slightest hope of his ultimate recovery there can be no doubt that paralysis is creeping over him and that it is most unlikely that he will ever leave his bed again  yes i know it is hard dear he said soothingly as she burst into tears but much as you will regret his loss you cannot but feel that it is best so he could never have been himself again never have enjoyed his life there would have been an everpresent anxiety and a dread of a recurrence of that fit you will see in time that it is better for him and for you that it should be as it is although of course you can hardly see that just at present and now i must leave you to your kind friends here  miss purcell knew well enough that just at present words of consolation would be thrown away and that it was a time only for silent sympathy and her gentle words and the warm pressure of nettas hand did more to restore hildas composure than any repetition of the doctors wellmeant assurance that all was for the best could do  would you like me to write a line in your name to colonel bulstrode she asked  no no hilda cried it would look as if we had made up your minds that uncle was going to die if he were conscious it would be different for i know that colonel bulstrode is his greatest friend and is named one of his trustees and uncle might want to talk to him oh how one wishes at a time like this that one had a brother or that he had a son alive or that there was someone who would naturally step in and take everything into his hands  there are his lawyers miss purcell suggested  yes i did not think of them mr pettigrew is the other trustee and is i know joint guardian with me of walter i am sorry now that we did not leave the dear little fellow down at holmwood it will be so sad and dull for him here and he would have been very happy in the country but perhaps it is best as it is if my uncle recovers consciousness he is sure to ask for him he had come to be very fond of him and walter has been so much with him lately  yes his eyes always used to follow the child about in his play miss purcell said i think it is best that he should be here and as the nursery is at the top of the house he will not be in anyones way  there was but little change in general mathiesons condition next morning although a slight movement when hilda spoke to him showed that he was dimly conscious of her presence and when she brought the child down and he laid his hand on that of the general and said goodmorning grandfather according to his custom he opened his eyes for a moment and there was a slight movement of the lips as if he were trying to speak  thank you miss covington dr leeds said the experiment was worth making and it proves that his state of unconsciousness is not complete  walter always took his dinner with the others when they lunched  where is the child hilda asked the footman have you sent him up to tell nurse that lunch is ready  i have not sent up miss because nurse has not come back with him from his walk  no doubt she will be back in a few minutes hilda said she is very punctual i never knew her late before  illustration the nurse was sitting on a chair sobbing bitterly page 117  lunch was half over when tom roberts came in with a scared expression on his usually somewhat stolid face  if you please miss nurse wishes to speak to you  what is the matter roberts hilda exclaimed starting up has walter met with an accident  well no miss not as i know of but nurse has come home and she is just like a wild thing somehow or other master walter has got lost  hilda followed by netta and miss purcell ran out into the hall the nurse a woman of two or three and thirty the daughter of one of the generals tenants and who had been in charge of the child since he arrived a baby from india was sitting on a chair sobbing bitterly her bonnet hung down at the back of her head her hair was unloosed and she had evidently been running wildly to and fro her appearance at once disarmed hilda who said soothingly  how has it happened nurse stop crying and tell us i am sure that it could not have been your fault for you are always so careful with him there is no occasion to be so terribly upset of course he will soon be found the first policeman who sees him will be sure to take him to the station now how did it happen  i was walking along queens road miss the woman said between her sobs and master walter was close beside me i know that special because we had just passed a crossing and i took hold of his hand as we went overwhen a manhe looked like a respectable workingmancame up to me and said i see you are a mother maam not at all said i how dare you say such a thing i am a nurse i am in charge of this young gentleman well said he i can see that you have a kind heart anyhow that is what made me speak to you i am a carpenter i am and i have been out of work for months and i have a child at home just about this ones age he is starving and i havent a bit to put in his mouth the parish buried my wife three weeks ago and i am wellnigh mad would you give me the money to buy him a loaf of bread the man was in such distress miss that i took out my purse and gave him a shilling and thankful he was he was all but crying and could not say enough to thank me then i turned to take hold of walters hand and found that the child had gone i could not have been more than two or three minutes talking though it always does take me a long time to take my purse out of my pocket still i know that it could not have been three minutes altogether  first of all i went back to the crossing and looked up and down the street but he wasnt there then i thought that perhaps he had walked on and was hiding for fun in a shop doorway when i could not see him up or down i got regular frighted and ran up and down like a mad thing once i came back as far as the house but there were no signs of him and i knew that he could not have got as far as this even if he had run all the way then i thought of the mews and i ran back there master walter was very fond of horses and he generally stopped when we got to the entrance of the mews and stood looking for a minute or two at the grooms cleaning the horses and i thought that he might have gone in there there were two or three men about but none had seen the child still i ran on and looked into several stables acalling for him all the time when he wasnt there i went wellnigh stark mad and i ran up and down the streets asking everyone i met had they seen a child then i came back here to tell you  we shall soon hear of him nurse roberts do you and william start out at once go first to the police station and give notice that the child is missinghe cannot have wandered farand then do you and james go all round the neighborhood and tell every policeman that you meet what has happened you can ask in all the shops in queens road and the streets near he may have wandered into one of them and as he was alone they may have kept him until someone came to inquire after him now netta will you put on your bonnet and come out with me  shall i come with you too hilda  no thank you miss purcell in the first place we shall walk too fast for you and in the second it would be as well for you to be here to comfort him if he is brought back while we are out we will come every halfhour to hear if there is news of him you had better go upstairs and make yourself tidy nurse and then you can come out and join in the hunt but you look so utterly worn out and exhausted that i think perhaps you had better sit quiet for a time you may be sure that it will not be long before some of us bring him back  i could not sit still miss covington the woman said i will just run upstairs and put myself straight and then go out again  try and calm yourself nurse or you will be taken for a madwoman you certainly looked like one when you came in  two minutes later hilda and her friend started  let us go first into kensington gardens netta he often went there to play and if he came down into the main road he would very likely wander in it is probable that nurse may have been longer speaking to that man than she thinks and that he had time to get a good way before she missed him  the gardens were thoroughly searched and the parkkeepers questioned but there were no signs of walter then they called at the house to see whether there was any news of him finding that there was not they again went out they had no real hopes of finding him now for hilda was convinced that he was not in any of the streets near had he been either the nurse or the men would have found him  he has no doubt been either taken by some kindhearted person who has found him lost she said and who has either given notice to the police or he has been taken by them to the police station still it relieves one to walk about it would be impossible to sit quiet doing nothing the others will have searched all the streets near and we had better go up the edgware road search in that direction and give notice to any policemen we find  but the afternoon went on and no news was received of the missing child it was a relief to them when dr leeds who had gone off watch for a few hours at twelve oclock returned he looked grave for a moment when he heard the news but said cheerfully it is very annoying miss covington but you need not alarm yourself walter is bound to turn up  but he ought to have been sent to the police station long before this hilda said tearfully  of course he ought if all people possessed commonsense unfortunately they dont i expect that at the present moment he is eating bread and jam or something of that sort in the house of some kindhearted old lady who has taken him in and the idea of informing the police has never occurred to her for a moment and unfortunately may not occur for some little time however if you will give me the details of his dress i will go at once with it to the printers and get two or three hundred notices struck off and sent round to be placed in tradesmens windows and stuck up on walls saying that whoever will bring the child here will be handsomely rewarded this is sure to fetch him before long  there was but little sleep that night at general mathiesons the master of the house still lay unconscious and from time to time dr leeds came down to say a few cheering words to the anxious girls tom roberts walked the streets all night with the faint idea of finding the child asleep on a doorstep and went three times to the police station to ask if there was any news the first thing in the morning hilda went with dr leeds to scotland yard and the description of the child was at once sent to every station in london then she drove by herself to the office of messrs farmer  pettigrew and waited there until the latter gentleman arrived mr pettigrew who was a very old friend of the family looked very grave over the news  i will not conceal from you miss covington he said when she had finished her story that the affair looks to me somewhat serious and i am afraid that you will have to make up your mind that you may not see the little fellow as soon as you expect had he been merely lost you should certainly have heard of him in a few hours after the various and i may say judicious steps that you have taken a child who loses himself in the streets of london is morally certain to come into the hands of the police in a very few hours  then what can have become of him mr pettigrew  it may be that as not unfrequently happens the child has been stolen for the sake of his clothes in that case he will probably be heard of before very long or it may be a case of blackmail someone possibly an acquaintance of one of the servants may have known that the child as the grandson and heir of general mathieson would be a valuable prize and that if he could be carried off his friends might finally be forced to pay a considerable sum to recover him i must say that it looks to me like a planned thing one of the confederates engages the silly woman his nurse in a long rambling talk the other picks the child quietly up or entices him away to the next corner where he has a cab in waiting and drives off with him at once however in neither case need you fear that the child will come to serious harm if he has been stolen for the sake of his clothes the woman will very speedily turn him adrift and he will be brought home to you by the police in rags if on the other hand he has been taken for the purpose of blackmail you may be sure that he will be well cared for for he will in the eyes of those who have taken him be a most valuable possession in that case you may not hear from the abductors for some little time they will know that as the search continues and no news is obtained his friends will grow more and more anxious and more ready to pay handsomely for his return of course it is a most annoying and unfortunate business but i really do not think that you have any occasion to feel anxious about his safety and it is morally certain that in time you will have him back safe and sound now how is your uncle i hope that he shows signs of rallying  i am sorry to say there was no sign whatever of his doing so up to eight oclock this morning and indeed dr pearson told me that he has but little hope of his doing so he thinks that there has been a slight shock of paralysis dr leeds speaks a little more hopefully than dr pearson but that is his way and i think that he too considers that the end is not far off  your friends miss purcell and her niece are still with you i hope  yes they will not leave me as long as i am in trouble i dont know what i should do without them especially now this new blow has fallen upon me  well my dear if you receive any communication respecting this boy send it straight to me i do not know whether you are aware that you and i have been appointed his guardians  yes uncle told me so months ago but i never thought then that he would not live till walter came of age and i thought that it was a mere form  doubtless it seemed so at the time mr pettigrew agreed your uncles was apparently an excellent life and he was as likely as anyone i know to have attained a great age  there is nothing you can advise me to do at present  nothing whatever besides what you have done the police all over london will be on the lookout for a lost child they will probably assume at once that he has been stolen for his clothes and will expect to see the child they are in search of in rags they will know too the quarter in which he is most likely to be found if it is for this purpose that he has been stolen you can confidently expect to have him back by tomorrow at latest the woman would be anxious to get rid of him without loss of time if the other hypothesis is correct you may not hear for a fortnight or three weeks the fellows in that case will be content to bide their time  hilda drove back with a heavy heart netta herself opened the door and her swollen eyes at once told the truth  uncle is dead hilda exclaimed  yes dear he passed away half an hour ago a few minutes after dr leeds returned the doctor ran down himself for a moment almost directly he had gone up and said that the general was sinking fast and that the end might come at any moment ten minutes later he came down and told us that all was over     chapter xi  a startling will   mr pettigrew at once took the management of affairs at the house in hyde park gardens into his hands as one of the trustees as joint guardian of the heir and as family solicitor hilda was completely prostrated by the two blows that had so suddenly fallen and was glad indeed that all necessity for attending to business was taken off her hands  we need not talk about the future at present mr pettigrew said to her that is a matter that can be considered afterwards you are most fortunate in having the lady with whom you so long lived here with you and i trust that some permanent arrangement may be made in any case you could not of course well remain here alone  i have not thought anything about it yet she said wearily oh i wish i were a man mr pettigrew then i could do something myself towards searching for walter instead of being obliged to sit here uselessly  if you were a man miss covington you could do nothing more at present than is being done the police are keeping up a most vigilant search i have offered a reward of five hundred pounds for any news that may lead to the childs discovery and notices have even been sent to the constabularies of all the home counties requesting them to make inquiries if any tramp or tramps accompanied by a child of about the age of our young ward have been seen passing along the roads but as i told you when you called upon me i have little doubt but that it is a case of blackmail and that it will not be long before we hear of him it is probable that the generals death has somewhat disconcerted them and it is likely that they may wait to see how matters go and who is the person with whom they had best open negotiations i have no doubt that they are in some way or other keeping themselves well informed of what is taking place here                                       the funeral was over the general being followed to the grave by a number of his military friends and comrades and the blinds at the house in hyde park gardens were drawn up again on the following morning mr pettigrew came to the house early he was a man who was methodical in all his doings and very rarely ruffled as soon as he entered however hilda saw that something unusual had happened  have you heard of walter she exclaimed  no my dear but i have some strange and unpleasant news to give you yesterday afternoon i received an intimation from messrs halstead  james saying that they had in their possession the will of the late general mathieson bearing date the 16th of may of the present year i need not say that i was almost stupefied at the news the firm is one of high standing and it is impossible to suppose that any mistake has arisen at the same time it seemed incredible that the general should thus have gone behind our backs especially as it was only three months before that we had at his request drawn out a fresh will for him still i am bound to say that such cases are by no means rare a man wants to make a fresh disposition of his property in a direction of which he feels that his own solicitors especially when they are old family solicitors will not approve and therefore he gets it done by some other firm with the result that at his death it comes like a bombshell to all concerned i can hardly doubt that it is so in this case although what dispositions the general may have made of his property other than those contained in the last will we drew up i am unable to say at any rate one of the firm will come round to our office at twelve oclock with this precious document and i think that it is right that you should be present when it is opened you will be punctual will you not  you can rely upon my being there a few minutes before twelve mr pettigrew it all seems very strange i knew what was the general purport of my uncles last will for he spoke of it to me it was he said the same as the one before it with the exception that he had left a handsome legacy to the man who had saved his life from a tiger i was not surprised at this at all he had taken a very great fancy to this mr simcoe who was constantly here and it seemed to me only natural that he should leave some of his money to a man who had done him so great a service and who as he told me had nearly lost his own life in doing it  quite so the lawyer agreed it seemed natural to us all his property was large enough to permit of his doing so without making any material difference to his grandchild who will come into a fine estate with large accumulations during his long minority now i must be off  there was a little council held after the lawyer had left  they say troubles never comes singly hilda remarked and certainly the adage is verified in my case  but we must hope that this will not be so my dear miss purcell said  it cannot be any personal trouble aunt for hilda had fallen back into her old habit of so addressing her because uncle told me that as i was so well off he had only put me down for a small sum in his will just to show that he had not forgotten me i feel sure that he will have made no change in that respect and that whatever alteration he may have made cannot affect me in the least except of course he may have come to the conclusion that it would be better to appoint two men as guardians to walter but i hardly think that he would have done that however there must be something strange about it or he would not have gone to another firm of solicitors no i feel convinced that there is some fresh trouble at hand  the carriage drew up at the office in lincolns inn at five minutes to twelve mr pettigrew had not included miss purcell and netta in the invitation but hilda insisted upon their coming with her they were shown at once into his private room where some extra chairs had been placed colonel bulstrode was already there and mr farmer joined his partner as soon as they were seated  this is a most singular affair miss covington he said and i need hardly say that it is a matter of great annoyance as well as surprise to pettigrew and myself of course general mathieson was perfectly free to go to any other firm of solicitors but as we have made the wills for his family and yours for the last hundred years as well as conducted all their legal business it is an unpleasant shock to find that he has gone elsewhere and i must say that i am awaiting the reading of this will with great curiosity as its contents will doubtless furnish us with the reason why he had it thus prepared  just at the stroke of twelve mr halstead and mr james were announced  we thought it as well the former said for us both to come mr farmer for we can understand your surprise at finding that a later will than that which is doubtless in your possession is in existence and we are ready to explain the whole circumstances under which it was drawn out by us general mathieson came one day to our office he brought with him the card of colonel bulstrode but this was unnecessary for some months ago the general was at our office with the colonel he was only there for the purpose of fixing his name as a witness to the colonels signature as our client like many others preferred having a personal friend to witness his signature instead of this being done by one of our clerks  that was so the colonel interjected  general mathieson mr halstead went on was only in our office a minute or two on that occasion but of course that was sufficient for us to recognize him when he called again he told us that he desired us to draw out a will and that as he had determined to appoint mr pettigrew one of his trustees and guardian to his heir he thought it as well to employ another firm to draw up the will  we pointed out that such a precaution was altogether needless when dealing with a firm like yours and he then said i have another reason i am making a change in one of the provisions of the will and i fancy that farmer  pettigrew might raise an argument upon it here are the instructions i said you will permit me to read them through general before giving you a decided answer had the will contained any provision that we considered unjust we should have declined to have had anything to do with the matter but as it in no way diverted the property from the natural heir and was as far as we could see a just and reasonable one we saw no cause for refusing to carry out his instructions for we have known as doubtless you have known many similar instances in which men for some reason or other have chosen to go outside their family solicitors in matters which they desired should remain entirely a secret until after their death had general mathieson come to us as an altogether unknown person we should have pointblank refused to have had anything to do with the business but as an intimate friend of our client colonel bulstrode and as being known to us to some extent personally we decided to follow the instructions given us in writing i will now with your permission read the will  first let me introduce miss covington to you mr farmer said she is the generals nearest relative with the exception of his grandson these ladies are here with her as her friends  mr halstead bowed then broke the seals on a large envelope drew out a parchment and proceeded to read it messrs farmer  pettigrew listened with increasing surprise as he went on the legacies were absolutely identical with those in the will that they had last prepared the same trustees and guardians for the child were appointed and they were unable to understand what had induced general mathieson to have what was almost a duplicate of his previous will prepared so secretly the last paragraph however enlightened them instead of hilda covington john simcoe was named as heir to the bulk of the property in the event of the decease of walter rivington his grandson before coming of age  hilda gave an involuntary start as the change was announced and the two lawyers looked at each other in dismay mr halstead to whom the general had explained his reasons for gratitude to john simcoe saw nothing unusual in the provision which indeed was heralded with the words as my only near relative hilda covington is well endowed i hereby appoint my dear friend john simcoe my sole heir in the event of the decease of my grandson walter rivington before coming of age in token of my appreciation of his heroic rescue of myself from the jaws of a tiger in the course of which rescue he was most seriously wounded  when he had finished he laid down the will and looked round  i hope he said that this will be satisfactory to all parties  by gad sir colonel bulstrode said hotly i should call this last part as unsatisfactory as possible  the will is identical mr farmer said without heeding the colonels interjection with the one that general mathieson last executed the persons benefited and the amounts left to them are in every case the same but you will understand the dismay with which we have heard the concluding paragraph when i tell you that general mathiesons heir walter rivington now a child of six or seven years old disappearedi think i may say was kidnapedon the day preceding general mathiesons death and that all efforts to discover his whereabouts have so far been unsuccessful  mr halstead and his partner looked at each other with dismay even greater than that exhibited by the other lawyers  god bless me mr halstead exclaimed this is a bad business indeedand a very strange one do you think that this mr simcoe can have been aware of this provision in his favor  it is likely enough that he was aware of it mr pettigrew said he was constantly in the company of general mathieson and the latter who was one of the frankest of men may very well have informed him but whether he actually did do so or not of course i cannot say would you have any objection to my looking at the written instructions  certainly not i brought them with me in order that they may be referred to as to any question that might arise  it is certainly in the generals own handwriting mr pettigrew said after looking at the paper but indeed the identity of the legacies given to some twenty or thirty persons and of all the other provisions of the will including the appointment of trustees and guardians with those of the will in our possession would seem in itself to set the matter at rest were you present yourself when the general signed it  certainly both mr james and myself were present i can now only express my deep regret that we acceded to the generals request to draw up the will  it is unfortunate certainly mr farmer said i do not see that under the circumstances of his introduction by an old client and the fact that you had seen him before anyone could blame you for undertaking the matter such cases are as you said by no means unusual and i am quite sure that you would not have undertaken it had you considered for a moment that any injustice was being done by its provisions  may i ask to whom the property was to go to by the first will  it was to go to miss covington i am sure that i can say in her name that under other circumstances she would not feel in any way aggrieved at the loss of a property she can well dispense with especially as the chances of that provision coming into effect were but small as the child was a healthy little fellow and in all respects likely to live to come of age  i do not care in the least for myself hilda said impetuously on the contrary i would much rather that it had gone to someone else i should not have at all liked the thought that i might benefit by walters death but i would rather that it had been left to anyone but this man whom i have always disliked and whom walter also disliked i cannot give any reason why i suppose it was an instinct and now the instinct is justified for i feel sure that he is at the bottom of walters disappearance  hush hush my dear young lady mr farmer said holding up his hand in dismay you must not say such things they are libelous in the extreme whatever suspicions you may haveand i own that at present things look awkwardyou must not mention those suspicions until you obtain some evidence in their support the disappearance of the child at this moment may be a mere coincidencea singular one if you likeand we shall of course examine the matter to the utmost and sift it to the bottom but nothing must be said until we have something to go on  hilda sat silent with her lips pressed tightly together and an expression of determination upon her face the other solicitors speedily left after more expressions of regret  what are we going to do next mr pettigrew hilda asked abruptly as the door closed behind them  that is too difficult a matter to decide offhand but after going into the whole matter with my cotrustee colonel bulstrode with the assistance of my partner we shall come to some agreement as to the best course to take of course we could oppose the probate of this new will but it does not seem to me that we have a leg to stand upon in that respect i have no doubt that halstead  james will retire altogether from the matter and refuse to act further in that case it will be my duty of course to acquaint simcoe with the provisions of the will and to inform him that we as trustees shall not proceed to take any further steps in the matter until the fate of walter rivington is ascertained but shall until then administer the estate in his behalf it will then be for him to take the next step and he certainly will not move for some months after a time he will of course apply to the court to have it declared that walter rivington having disappeared for a long time there is reasonable presumption of his death i shall then in your name and mine as the childs guardians be heard in opposition and i feel sure that the court will refuse to grant the petition especially under the serious and most suspicious circumstances of the case in time simcoe will repeat the application and we shall of course oppose it in fact i think it likely that it will be a good many years before the court will take the step asked and all that time we shall be quietly making inquiries about this man and his antecedents and we shall of course keep up a search for the child it may be that his disappearance is only a coincidence and that he has as we at first supposed been stolen for the purpose of making a heavy claim for his return  you may be sure that i shall not rest until i find him mr pettigrew hilda said i shall devote my life to it i love the child dearly but even were he a perfect stranger to me i would do everything in my power if only to prevent this man from obtaining the proceeds of his villainy  mr farmer again interposed  my dear miss covington he said you really must not speak like this of course with us it is perfectly safe i admit that you have good reason for your indignation but you must really moderate your expressions which might cause infinite mischief were you to use them before other people in the eye of the law a man is innocent until he is proved guilty and we have not a shadow of proof that this man has anything to do with the childs abduction moreover it might do harm in other ways to begin with it might render the discovery of the child more difficult for if his abductors were aware or even suspected that you were searching in all directions for him they would take all the greater pains to conceal his hidingplace  i will be careful mr farmer but i shall proceed to have a search made at every workhouse and night refuge and place of that sort in london and within twenty miles round and issue more placards of your offer of a reward of five hundred pounds for information there is no harm in that  certainly not those are the measures that one would naturally take in any case indeed i should already have pushed my inquiries in that direction but i have hitherto felt sure that had he been merely taken for his clothes the police would have traced him before now but as they have not been able to do so that it was a case of blackmail and that we should hear very shortly from the people that had stolen him i sincerely trust that this may the case and that it will turn out that this man simcoe has nothing whatever to do with it i will come down and let you know what steps we are taking from time to time and learn the directions in which you are pushing your inquiries  neither miss purcell nor netta had spoken from the time they had entered the room but as soon as they took their places in the carriage waiting for them they burst out  what an extraordinary thing hilda and yet miss purcell added the search for walter may do good in one way it will prevent you from turning your thoughts constantly to the past and to the loss that you have suffered  if it had not been for walter being missing aunt i should have thought nothing of uncles appointing mr simcoe as heir to his property if anything should happen to him this man had obtained an extraordinary influence over him and there can be no doubt from uncles statement to me that he owed his life solely to him and that simcoe indeed was seriously injured in saving him he knew that i had no occasion for the money and have already more than is good for a girl to have at her absolute disposal therefore i am in no way surprised that he should have left him his estate in the event of walters death all that is quite right and i have nothing to say against it except that i have always disliked the man it is only the extraordinary disappearance of walter just at this moment that seems to me to render it certain that simcoe is at the bottom of it no one else could have had any motive for stealing walter more than any other rich mans child his interest in his disappearance is immense i have no doubt uncle had told him what he had done and the man must have seen that his chance of getting the estate was very small unless the child could be put out of the way  you dont think netta began that any harm can have happened to him  no i dont think that whether this man would have shrunk from it if there were no other way i need not ask myself but there could have been no occasion for it walter is so young that he will very soon forget the past he might be handed over to a gypsy and grow up a little vagrant and as there is no mark on him by which he might be identified he would be lost to us forever you see the man can afford to wait he has doubtless means of his ownhow large i do not know but i have heard my uncle say that he had handsome chambers and certainly he lived in good style now he will have this legacy of ten thousand pounds and if the court keeps him waiting ten or fifteen years before pronouncing walter dead he can afford to wait anyhow i shall have plenty of time in which to act and it will require a lot of thinking over before i decide what i had best do  she lost no time however in beginning to work posters offering the reward of five hundred pounds for information of the missing boy were at once issued and stuck up not only in london but in every town and village within thirty miles then she obtained from mr pettigrew the name of a firm of trustworthy private detectives and set them to make inquiries in the first place at all the institutions where a lost child would be likely to be taken if found or where it might have been left by a tramp two days after the reading of the will she received the following letter from john simcoe       dear miss covington i have learned from messrs farmer       pettigrew the liberal and i may say extraordinary generosity shown      towards myself by the late general mathieson whose loss i most      deeply deplore my feelings of gratitude are at the present moment      overwhelmed by the very painful position in which i find myself i      had of course heard upon calling at your door to make inquiries      that little walter was missing and was deeply grieved at the news      though not at the time dreaming that it could affect me personally      now however the circumstances of the case are completely changed      for by the provisions of the will i should benefit pecuniarily by      the poor childs death i will not for a moment permit myself to      believe that he is not alive and well and do not doubt that you      will speedily recover him but until this occurs i feel that some      sort of suspicion must attach to me who am the only person having      an interest in his disappearance the thought that this may be so      is distressing to me in the extreme since i heard of his      disappearance i have spent the greater part of my time in      traversing the slums of london in hopes of lighting upon him i      shall now undertake wider researches and shall today insert      advertisements in all the daily papers offering one thousand      pounds for his recovery i feel sure that you at least will not for      a moment entertain unjust suspicions concerning me but those who      do not know me well may do so and although at present none of the      facts have been made public i feel as if i were already under a      cloud and that men in the club look askance at me and unless the      child is found my position will speedily become intolerable my      only support in this trial is my consciousness of innocence you      will excuse me for intruding upon your sorrow at the present      moment but i felt compelled to write as i have done and to assure      you that i will use every effort in my power to discover the child      not only for his own sake and yours but because i feel that until      he is discovered i must continue to rest under the terrible if      unspoken suspicion of being concerned in his disappearance       believe me yours very truly      john simcoe     chapter xii  dr leeds speaks   after reading john simcoes letter hilda threw it down with an exclamation of contempt  read it she said to netta who was alone with her  the letter is good enough as it stands netta remarked as she finished it  good enough if coming from anyone else hilda said scornfully perhaps better than most men would write but i think that a rogue can generally express himself better than an honest man  now you are getting cynicala new and unpleasant phase in your character hilda i have heard you say that you do not like this man but you have never given me any particular reason for it beyond in one of your letters saying that it was an instinct now do try to give me a more palpable reason than that at present it seems to be only a case of dr fell you dont like him because you dont  i dont like him because from the first i distrusted him personally i had no reason to complain on the contrary he has been extremely civil and indeed willing to put himself out in any way to do me small services then as i told you walter disliked him too although he was always bringing chocolates and toys for him so that the childs dislike must have been also a sort of instinct he felt as i did that the man was not true and honest he always gave me the impression of acting a part and i have never been able to understand how a man of his class could have performed so noble and heroic an act as rushing in almost unarmed to save another who was almost a stranger to him from the grip of a tiger so absolutely did i feel this that i have at times even doubted whether he could be the john simcoe who had performed this gallant action  my dear hilda you are getting fanciful do you think that your uncle was likely to be deceived in such a matter and that he would not have a vivid remembrance of his preserver even after twenty years  that depends on how much he saw of him my uncle told me that mr simcoe brought some good introductions from a friend of his at calcutta who came out in the same ship with him no doubt he dined at my uncles two or three timeshe may even have stayed a few days in the housepossibly more but as commanding the district my uncle must have been fully occupied during the day and can have seen little of him until i suppose a week or so after his arrival when he invited him to join in the hunt for a tiger although much hurt on that occasion simcoe was much less injured than my uncle who lay between life and death for some time and simcoe had left before he was well enough to see him if he had dined with my uncle a few times after this affair undoubtedly his features would have been so impressed on him that he would have recognized him even after twenty years but as it was he could have no particular interest in this gentleman and can have entertained but a hazy recollection of his features in fact the general did not recognize him when he first called upon him until he had related certain details of the affair it had always been a sore point with my uncle that he had never had an opportunity of thanking his preserver who had as he believed lost his life at sea before he himself was off his sick bed and when he heard the mans story he was naturally anxious to welcome him with open arms and to do all in his power for him i admit that this man must either have been in benares then or shortly afterwards for he remembered various officers who were there and little incidents of cantonment life that could one would think be only known to one who had been there at the time  but you say he was only there a week hilda  only a week before this tiger business but it was a month before he was able to travel no doubt all the officers there would make a good deal of a man who had performed such a deed and would go and sit with him and chat to while away the hours so that he would in that time pick up a great deal of the gossip of the station  well then what is your theory hilda the real man as you say no doubt made a great many acquaintances there this man seems to have been behind the scenes also  he unquestionably knew many of the officers for uncle told me that he recognized several men who had been out there when he met them at the club and went up and addressed them by name  did they know him also  no at first none of them had any idea who he was but that is not surprising for they had seen him principally when he was greatly pulled down and believing him to be drowned it would have been strange indeed if they had recalled his face until he had mentioned who he was  well it seems to me that you are arguing against yourself hilda everything you say points to the fact that this man is the john simcoe he claims to be if he is not simcoe who can he be  ah there you ask a question that i cannot answer  in fact hilda you have nothing beyond the fact that you do not like the man and believe that he is not the sort of man to perform an heroic and selfsacrificing action on behalf of this curious theory of yours  that is all at present but i mean to set myself to work to find out more about him if i can find out that this man is an impostor we shall recover walter if not i doubt whether we shall ever hear of him again  netta lifted her eyebrows  well at any rate you have plenty of time before you hilda  the next morning dr leeds who had not called for the last three or four days came in to say that he was arranging a partnership with a doctor of considerable eminence but who was beginning to find the pressure of work too much for him and wanted the aid of a younger and more active man  it is a chance in a thousand he said i owe it largely to the kind manner in which both sir henry havercourt and dr pearson spoke to him as to my ability you will excuse me he went on after hilda had warmly congratulated him for talking of myself before i have asked any questions but i know that had you obtained any news of walter you would have let me know at once  certainly i should but i have some news and really important news to give you and she related the production of the new will and gave him the details of its provisions  he looked very serious  it is certainly an ugly outlook he said i have never seen this simcoe but i know from the tone in which you have spoken of him at least two or three times that he is by no means a favorite of yours can you tell me anything about him  not beyond the fact that he saved the generals life from a tiger a great many years ago shortly after that he was supposed to be lost at sea certainly the vessel in which he sailed went down in a hurricane with as was reported all hands he says that he was picked up clinging to a spar of his life for the twenty years following he has never given a very connected account at least as far as i know but some of the stories that i have heard him tell show that he led a very wild sort of life sometimes he was working in a small trader among the islands of the pacific and i believe he had a share in some of these enterprises then he claims to have been in the service of a native prince somewhere up beyond burmah and according to his account took quite an active part in many sanguinary wars and adventures of all sorts  the doctors face grew more and more serious as she proceeded  do i gather miss covington that you do not believe that this man is what he claims to be  frankly that is my opinion doctor i own that i have no ground whatever for my disbelief except that i have naturally studied the man closely i have watched his lips as he spoke when he has been talking about these adventures with savages he spoke without effort and i have no doubt whatever that he did take part in such adventures but when he was speaking of india and especially when at some of the bachelor dinners uncle gave there were officers who had known him out there it was clear to me that he did not speak with the same freedom he weighed his words as if afraid of making a mistake i believe that the man was playing a part his tone was genial and sometimes a little boisterous as it might well be on the part of a man who had been years away from civilization but i always thought from his manner that all this was false i am convinced that he is a doublefaced man when he spoke i observed that he watched in a furtive sort of way the person to whom he was speaking to see the effect of his words but above all i formed my opinion upon the fact that i am absolutely convinced that this man could never have performed the splendid action of facing a wounded tiger unarmed for the sake of one who was in fact but a casual acquaintance  you will excuse me if i make no comment on what you have told me miss covington it is a matter far too serious for any man to form a hasty opinion upon i myself have never seen this man but i am content to take your estimate of his character one trained as you were for years in the habit of closely watching faces cannot but be a far better judge of character than those who have not had such training i will take two or three days to think the matter over and now will you tell me what steps you are taking at present to discover walter  she told him of what was being done  can you suggest anything else dr leeds  nothing it seems to me that the key to the mystery is in the hands of this man and that it is there it must be sought though at present i can see no way in which the matter can be set about when one enters into a struggle with a man like this one must be armed at all points prepared to meet craft with craft and above all to have a wellmarkedout plan of campaign now i will say goodmorning i suppose miss purcell and her niece will stay on with you at any rate for a time  for a long time i hope she said  may i ask if you have stated the view that you have given me to miss netta purcell  yes i have told her she is disposed to treat it as an absurd fancy on my part but if i can get anything to go upon which will convince her that there is even a faint possibility of my being right she will go through fire and water to assist me  i can well believe that the doctor said i am sure that she has a strong character although so lively and full of fun of course having been thrown with her for four months i am able to form a very fair opinion of her disposition  after dr leeds had left hilda began to build castles for her friend  it would be a splendid thing for her she said he is certainly not a man to speak in the way he did unless he thoroughly meant it i should think that they were just suited to each other though it would be really a pity that the scheme i had set my mind upon for getting her over here as head of an institution for teaching deaf and dumb children on professor menzels plan should come to nothing perhaps though he might be willing that she should act as the head of such an establishment getting trained assistants from those she knows in hanover and giving a few hours a day herself to the general supervision if only for the sake of the good that such an institution would do among perhaps the most unfortunate of all beings i am quite sure that so far she has no thought of such a thing however perhaps i am running on too fast and that he only means what he said that he admired her character i suppose there is no reason that because a man admires a girls character he should fall in love with her and yet netta is so bright and cheerful and at the same time so kind and thoughtful i can hardly imagine that any man thrown with her as he has been could help falling in love with her  netta was surprised when hilda told her that dr leeds had been inclined to view her theory seriously  really hilda certainly he is not the sort of man to be carried away by your enthusiasm so please consider all that i have said upon the subject as unspoken and i will stand neutral until i hear further what he says  he did not say very much i admit netta but he said that he would take the matter seriously into consideration and let me know what he thinks in two or three days  i am afraid that he wants to let you down gently netta said well well dont looked vexed i will say no more about it until this solemn judgment is delivered  netta was in the room when dr leeds called two days later  netta is in all my counsels dr leeds hilda said and she is as a rule a capital hand at keeping a secret though she did let mine slip out to you  there was no smile on the doctors face and both girls felt at once that the interview was to be a serious one  i am well aware that i can speak before miss purcell he said although there are very few people before whom i would repeat what i am going to say i have two questions to ask you miss covington what is the date of this last will of your uncles  it is dated the 16th of may  about a fortnight before the generals alarming seizure  hilda bowed her head in assent the next question took her quite by surprise  do you know whether this man simcoe was one of the party when the seizure took place  he was doctor my uncle told me that he was going to dine with him and dr pearson mentioned to me that he was next to the general and caught him as he fell from his chair  dr leeds got up and walked up and down the room two or three minutes  i think that now things have come to the present pass you ought to know what was the opinion that i originally formed of general mathiesons illness dr pearson and sir henry havercourt both differed from me and treated my theory as a fanciful one and without foundation and of course i yielded to such superior authority and henceforth kept my ideas to myself nevertheless during the time the general was under my charge i failed altogether to find any theory or explanation for his strange attack and subsequent state except that which i had first formed it was a theory that a medical man is always most reluctant to declare unless he is in a position to prove it or at least to give some very strong reason in its favor for a mistake would not only cost him his reputation but might involve him in litigation and ruin his career altogether but i think that i ought to tell you what my opinion is miss covington you must not take it for more than it is worth namely as a theory but it may possibly set you on a new track and aid you in your endeavor to discover the missing child  the surprise of the two girls increased as he continued after a pause  ever since the day when i was first requested to act as the generals resident medical man i have devoted a considerable time to the study of books in which here and there could be found accounts of the action of the herbs in use among the obi women fetich men and socalled wizards on the west coast of africa also in india and among the savage tribes of the malay archipelago and the pacific islands what drugs they use has never been discovered although many efforts have been made to obtain a knowledge of them both in india and on the west coast but doctors have found it necessary to abandon the attempt several of them having fallen victims of the jealousy of these people because of the researches they were making but at the least the effects of the administration of these drugs have been frequently described and in some respects these correspond so closely to those noticeable in the generals case that i say now as i said at first i believe the generals illness was caused by the administration of some drug absolutely unknown to european science  you think that my uncle was poisoned hilda exclaimed in a tone of horror while netta started to her feet with clenched hands and flushed face  i have not used the word poisoned miss covington though in fact it comes to that it may not have been administered with the intention of killing it may have been intended only to bring on a fit which in due time might have been attended by others but the dose may have been stronger than its administrator intended  and you think dr leedsyou think that it was administered by  no miss covington i accuse no one i have no shadow of proof against anyone but taking this illness with the abduction of the child it cannot be denied that ones suspicions must in the first case fall upon the man who has profited by the crime if crime it was on may 16 this will was drawn up bequeathing the property to a certain person the circumstances of the will were curious but from what i learned from you of the explanation given by the lawyers who drew it up it seems fair and aboveboard enough the general was certainly greatly under the influence of this man who had rendered him the greatest service one man can render another and that at the risk of his own life therefore i do not consider that this will which was so to speak sprung upon you is in itself an important link in the chain but when we find that twelve or fourteen days afterwards the general was when at table seized with a terrible fit of an extraordinary and mysterious nature and that the man who had an interest in his death was sitting next to him the coincidence is at least a strange one when however the generals heir is abducted when the general is at the point of death the matter for the first time assumes a position of the most extreme gravity  at first like you i thought that walter had either been stolen by some woman for the sake of his clothes or that he had been carried off by someone aware that he was the generals heir with a view to obtaining a large sum of money as his ransom such things have been done before and will no doubt be done again the first hypothesis appears to have failed altogether no woman who had robbed a child of his clothes would desire to detain him for an hour longer than was necessary the inquiries of the police have failed altogether the people you have employed have ascertained that neither at the workhouses of london nor in the adjacent counties has any child at all answering to walters description been left by a tramp or brought in by the police or by someone who had found him wandering about it cannot be said that the second hypothesis is also proved to be a mistaken one the men who took him away would be obliged to exercise the greatest caution when opening negotiations for his release and it might be a month or more before you heard from them  therefore it would be unfair to this man simcoe to assume that he is the author of the plot until so long a period has passed that it is morally certain that the boy was not stolen for the purpose of blackmail however we have the following suspicious circumstances first that as i believe the general was drugged by some poison of whose nature we are ignorant beyond that we read of very similar cases occurring among natives races in africa and elsewhere then we have the point that no one would have had any interest in the generals death with the exception of the man he had named as his heir in the event of the childs death we know by the mans statement that he was for many years living among tribes where poisons of this kind are used by the wizards and fetich men to support their authority and to remove persons against whom they have a grudge lastly we have the crowning fact of the abduction of the child who stood between this man and the estates all this is at best mere circumstantial evidence we do not know for certain what caused the generals fit we have no proof that simcoe had any hand in the abduction and whatever our opinion may be it is absolutely necessary that we do not breathe a hint to anyone  hilda did not speak the shock and the horror of the matter were too much for her she sat with open lips and blanched face looking at dr leeds netta however leaped to her feet again  it must be so dr leeds it does not seem to me that there can be a shadow of doubt in the matter and anything that i can do to bring the truth to light i will do however long a time it takes me  thank you netta hilda said holding out her hand to her friend as for me i will devote my life to clearing up this mystery  i am afraid miss covington that my engagements henceforth will prevent my joining actively in your search but my advice will always be at your service and it may be that i shall be able to point out methods that have not occurred to you  but oh dr leeds hilda exclaimed suddenly if this villain poisoned my uncle surely he will not hesitate to put walter out of his path  i have been thinking of that dr leeds exclaimed but i have come to the conclusion that it is very unlikely that he will do so in the first place he must have had accomplices the man who spoke to the nurse and the cabman who drove the child away must both have been employed by him and i have no doubt whatever that the child has been placed with some persons who are probably altogether ignorant of his identity walter was a lovable child and as soon as he got over his first grief he would no doubt become attached to the people he was with and although these might be willing to take a child who they were told had lost its parents and was homeless and friendless without inquiring too closely into the circumstances it is unlikely in the extreme that they would connive at any acts of violence it is by no means easy to murder and then to dispose of the body of a child of seven and i should doubt whether this man would attempt such a thing he would be perfectly content that the boy would be out of his way that all traces of him should be lost and that it would be beyond the range of probability that he could ever be identified and lastly even the most hardened villains do not like putting their necks in a noose moreover if in the last extremity his confederates believing that he had made away with the child tried to blackmail him or some unforeseen circumstance brought home to him the guilt of this abduction he would be in a position to produce the child and even to make good terms for himself for doing so you yourself whatever your feelings might be as to the man whom you believe to be the murderer of your uncle would still be willing to pay a considerable sum and allow him to leave the country on condition of his restoring walter therefore i think that you may make your mind easy on that score and believe that whatever has happened to him or wherever he may be there is no risk of actual harm befalling him  thank you very much doctor that is indeed a relief and now have you thought of any plan upon which we had best set to work  not at present beyond the fact that i see that the power you both possess of reading what men say when as they believe out of earshot ought to be of material advantage to you as miss purcell has promised to associate herself with you in the search i should say that she would be of more use in this direction than you would you have told me that he must be perfectly aware of your dislike for him and would certainly be most careful were you in his presence although he might not dream of this power that you possess but he has never seen your friend and would not be on his guard with her i have at present not thought over any plan by which she could watch himthat must be for after considerationbut it seems to me that this offers some chance of obtaining a clew  i am ready to do anything dr leeds netta said firmly you only have to find out a way and i will follow out your instructions to the letter first we must find out whether hildas theory about this man which i scoffed at when she first spoke of it to me is correct  you mean the theory that this man is not john simcoe at all but someone who knowing the facts of the rescue from the tiger and being also well acquainted with people and things in benares has personated him i will not discuss that now i have an appointment to meet a colleague for consultation in a difficult case and have already run the time very close you shall see me again shortly when i have had time to think the whole matter over quietly     chapter xiii  netta visits stowmarket   well netta hilda said after dr leeds had left them i suppose you will not in future laugh at my instincts i only wish that they had been stronger i wish i had told my dear uncle that i disliked the man so thoroughly that i was sure there was something wrong with him and implored him not to become very intimate with him if i had told him how strongly i felt on the subject although of course he could have left or given him any sum that he chose i do think it would have had some influence with him no doubt he would have laughed at what he would have called my suspicious nature but i think he would not have become so friendly with the man but of course i never thought of this oh netta my heart seems broken at the thought that my dear uncle the kindest of men should have been murdered by a man towards whom his thoughts were so kindly that he appointed him his heir in the event of walters death if he had left him double the sum he did and had directed that in case of walters death the property should go to hospitals the child might now have been safe in the house it is heartbreaking to think of  well dear netta said we have our work before us i say we because although he was no relation to me i loved him from the first when he came over with the news of your fathers death had i been his niece as well as you he could not have treated me more kindly than he did when i was staying with you last year and during the last four months that i have been with you one could see even in the state he was in how kind his nature was and his very helplessness added to ones affection for him i quite meant what i said for until this matter is cleared up and until this crime if crime it really is is brought to light i will stay here and be your helper however the long the time may be there are two of us and i do not think that either of us are fools and we ought to be a match for one man there is one thing we have that is a man on whom we can rely i do not mean dr leeds i regard him as our director i mean tom roberts he would have given his life i am sure for his master and i feel confident that he will carry out any instructions we may give him to the letter  i am sure he will netta do you think we ought to tell him our suspicions  i should do so unhesitatingly hilda i am sure he will be ready to go through fire and water to avenge his masters death as aunt is out i think it will be as well to take him into our confidence at once  hilda said nothing but got up and rang the bell when the footman entered she said tell roberts that i want to speak to him when the man came up she went on we are quite sure tom that you were most thoroughly devoted to your master and that you would do anything in your power to get to the bottom of the events that have brought about his death and the carrying off of his grandson  that i would miss there is not anything that i would not do if you would only set me about it  well roberts i am about to take you into our confidence relying implicitly upon your silence and on your aid  you can do that miss safely enough there is nothing now that i can do for my master but as for master walter i would walk to china if i thought that there was a chance of finding him there  in the first place you must remember roberts that we are acting only upon suspicion we have only that to go upon and our object must be to find some proofs to justify those suspicions  i understand miss you have got an idea and you want to see if it is right  we ourselves have little doubt of it roberts now please sit down and listen to me and dont interrupt me till i have finished  then she related the grounds that she had for suspicion that the generals death and walters abduction were both the work of john simcoe and also her own theory that this man was not the person who had saved the generals life in spite of her warning not to interrupt tom roberts exclamations of fury were frequent and strongly worded  well miss he exclaimed when she had finished and his tongue was untied i did not think that there was such a villain upon the face of the earth why if i had suspected this i would have killed him if i had been hung for it a week after and to think that he regular took me in he had always a cheerful word for me if i happened to open the door for him how are you tom he would say hearty as usual and he would slip a crown into my hand to drink his health i always keep an account of tips that i receive and the first thing i do will be to add them up and see how much i have had from him and i will hand it over to a charity one dont like setting out to help to bring a man to the gallus when you have got his money in your pocket i must have been a fool miss not to have kept a better watch but i never thought ill of the man it seemed to me that he had been a soldier sometimes when he was talking with me he would come out with barrackroom sayings and though he never said that he had served nor the general neither i thought that he must have done so he had a sort of way of carrying his shoulders which you dont often see among men who have not learned the goosestep i will wait miss with your permission until i have got rid of that money and then if you say to me go to that mans rooms and take him by the throat and squeeze the truth out of him i am ready to do it  we shall not require such prompt measures as that tom we must go about our work carefully and quietly and i fear that it will be a very long time before we are able to collect facts that we can act upon we have not decided yet how to begin i may tell you that the only other person who shares our suspicions is dr leeds we think it best that even miss purcell should know nothing about them it would only cause her great anxiety and the matter will therefore be kept a close secret among our four selves in a few days our plans will probably be complete and i think that your share in the business will be to watch every movement of this man and to ascertain who are his associates many of them no doubt are club men who of course will be above suspicion but it is certain that he must have had accomplices in the abduction of the child whether he visits them or they visit him is a point to find out there is little chance of their calling during daylight and it is in the evening that you will have to keep a close eye on him and ascertain who his visitors are  all right miss i wish he did not know me by sight but i expect that i can get some sort of a disguise so that he wont recognize me  i dont think that there will be any difficulty about that of course we are not going to rely only upon you miss purcell and myself are both going to devote ourselves to the search  we will run him down between us miss never fear it cannot be meant that such a fellow as this should not be found out in his villainy i wish that there was something more for me to do i know several old soldiers like myself who would join me willingly enough and we might between us carry him off and keep him shut up somewhere just as he is doing master walter until he makes a clean breast of it it is wonderful what the cells and bread and water will do to take a fellows spirit down it is bad enough when one knows how long one has got to bear it but to know that there is no end to it until you choose to speak would get the truth out of old nick begging your pardon for naming him  well we shall see roberts that would certainly be a last resource and i fear that it would not be so effectual as you think if he told us that if he did not pay his usual visit to the boy it would be absolutely certain we should never see him alive again we should not dare retain him  well miss whatever you decide on i will do i have lost as a good master as ever a man had and there is nothing that i would not do to bring that fellow to justice  the girls waited impatiently for the next visit of dr leeds it was four days before he came  i hoped to have been here before he said but i have been so busy that it has not been possible for me to manage it of course this business has always been in my mind and it seems to me that the first step to be taken is to endeavor to ascertain whether this fellow is really as you believe miss covington an impostor have you ever heard him say in what part of the country he formerly resided  yes he lived at stowmarket i know that some months ago he introduced to uncle a gentleman who was manager at a bank there and had known him from boyhood he was up for a few days staying with him  that is certainly rather against your surmise miss covington however it is as well to clear that matter up before we attempt anything else  i will go down and make inquiries doctor netta said quietly i am half a head shorter than hilda and altogether different in face therefore if he learns that any inquiries have been made he will be sure that whoever made them was not hilda  we might send down a detective miss purcell  no i want to be useful she said and i flatter myself that i shall be able to do quite as well as a detective we could hardly take a detective into our confidence in a matter of this kind and not knowing everything he might miss points that would give us a clew to the truth i will start tomorrow i shall tell my aunt that i am going away for a day or two to follow up some clew we have obtained that may lead to walters discovery in a week you shall know whether this man is really what he claims to be  very well miss purcell then we will leave this matter in your hands  by the way doctor hilda covington said we have taken roberts into our confidence we know that we can rely upon his discretion implicitly and it seemed to us that we must have somebody we can trust absolutely to watch this man  i dont think that you could have done better he said i was going to suggest that it would be well to obtain his assistance from what i have heard very few of these private detectives can be absolutely relied upon i do not mean that they are necessarily rogues who would take money from both sides but that if after trying for some time they consider the matter hopeless they will go on running up expenses and making charges when they have in reality given up the search what do you propose that he shall do  i should say that in the first place he should watch every evening the house where simcoe lives and follow up everyone who comes out and ascertain who they are no doubt the great majority of them will be clubmen but it is likely that he will be occasionally visited by some of his confederates  i think that is an excellent plan he will of course also follow him when he goes out for it is much more likely that he will visit these fellows than that they should come to him in a case like this he would assuredly use every precaution and would scarcely let them know who he is and where he resides  no doubt that is so doctor and it would make roberts work all the easier for even if they came to the mans lodgings he might be away following up the track of someone who had called before him  netta returned at the end of four days  i have not succeeded she said in answer to hildas inquiring look as she came in the man is certainly well known at stowmarket as john simcoe but that does not prove that he is the man and just as he deceived your uncle he may have deceived the people down there now i will go upstairs and take off my things and then give you a full account of my proceedings  my first step she began on her return was of course to find out what members of the simcoe family lived there after engaging a room at the hotel which i can assure you was the most unpleasant part of the business for they seemed to be altogether unaccustomed to the arrival of young ladies unattended i went into the town it is not much of a place and after making some little purchases and inquiring at several places i heard of a maiden lady of that name the woman who told me of her was communicative she has just had a great piece of luck she said about ten months back a nephew whom everyone had supposed to have been lost at sea came home with a great fortune and they say that he has behaved most handsomely to her she has always bought her berlin wool and such things here and she has spent three or four times as much since he came home as she did before and i know from a neighbor of whom she is a customer that the yards and yards of flannel that she buys for making up into petticoats for poor children is wonderful do you know her miss i said that i did not know her personally but that some friends of mine knowing that i was going to stowmarket had asked me to inquire if miss simcoe was still alive i said casually that i might call and see her and so got her address  i then went to call upon her she lives in a little place called myrtle cottage i had been a good deal puzzled as to what story i should tell her i thought at first of giving myself out as the sister of the young lady to whom her nephew was paying his addresses and as we knew nothing of him except that he was wealthy and as he had mentioned that he had an aunt at stowmarket and as i was coming down there i had been asked to make inquiries about him but i thought this might render her so indignant that i should get nothing from her i thought therefore i had better get all she knew voluntarily so i went to the house knocked and asked whether miss simcoe was in i was shown by a little maid into the parlor a funny little oldfashioned room presently miss simcoe herself came in she was just the sort of woman i had pictureda kindlylooking little old maid  i do not know whether i have done wrong miss simcoe i said but i am a stranger here and having overworked myself at a picture from which i hope great things i have been recommended country air and a friend told me that stowmarket was a pretty quiet country town just the place for an overworked londoner to gain health in so i came down and made some inquiries for a single lady who would perhaps take me in and give me a comfortable home for two or three months your name has been mentioned to me as being just the lady i am seeking  you have been misinformed she said a little primly i do not say that a few months back i might not have been willing to have entertained such an offer but my circumstances have changed since then and now i should not think for a moment of doing so  rising from my seat with a tired air i said that i was much obliged to her but i was very sorry she could not take me in as i was sure that i should be very comfortable however as she could not of course there was an end of it  sit down my dear the old lady said i see that you are tired and worn out my servant shall get you a cup of tea you see she went on as i murmured my thanks and sat down i cannot very well do what you ask as i said a few months ago i should certainly have been very glad to have had a young lady like yourself to stay with me for a time i think that when a lady gets to my age a little youthful companionship does her good besides i do not mind saying that my means were somewhat straitened and that a little additional money would have been a great help to me but everything was changed by the arrival of a nephew of mine perhaps you may have heard his name he is a rich man and i believe goes out a great deal and belongs to clubs and so on  i said that i had not heard of him for i knew nothing about society nor the sort of men who frequented clubs  no of course not my dear she said well he had been away for twenty years and everyone thought he was dead he sailed away in some ship that was never heard of again and you may guess my surprise when he walked in here and called me aunt  you must have been indeed surprised miss simcoe i said it must have been quite a shock to you and did you know him at once  oh dear no he had been traveling about the world you see for a very long time and naturally in twenty years he was very much changed but of course i soon knew him when he began to talk  you recognized his voice i suppose i suggested  no my dear no of course his voice had changed just as his appearance had done he had been what he called knocking about among all sorts of horrible savages eating and drinking all kinds of queer things it made my blood run cold to listen to him but i never asked any questions about these things i was afraid he might say that when he was among the cannibals he used to eat human flesh and i dont think that i could like a man who had done that even though he was my nephew  did he go out quite as a boy miss simcoe i asked  oh no he was twentyfour i think when he went abroad he had a situation in the bank here i know that the manager thought very highly of him and indeed he was everywhere well spoken of my brother joshuahis father you knowdied and he came in for two or three thousand pounds he had always had a great fancy for travel and so instead of looking out for some nice girl and settling down he threw up his situation and started on his travels  had his memory been affected by the hot suns and the hardships that he had gone through i asked  oh dear not at all he recognized everyone almost whom he had known of course he was a good deal more changed than they were  they did not recognize him any more than you did  not at first she said when a man is believed to have been dead for twenty years his face does not occur to old friends when they meet an apparent stranger  that is quite natural i agreed what a pleasure it must have been to him to talk over old times and old friends  indeed it was my dear he enjoyed it so much that for three days he would not move out of the house dear me what pleasant talks we had  and you say miss simcoe that his coming has quite altered your position  yes indeed the very first thing he said after coming into the house was that he had come home resolved to make me and my sister maria thoroughly comfortable poor maria died some years ago but of course he did not know it then he said that he should allow me fifty pounds a year for life  that was very kind and nice indeed miss simcoe i said  by this time seeing that my sympathy was with her her heart opened altogether to me and she said that she felt sure that her nephew would not like it were she to take in a lodger and might indeed consider it a hint that he might have been more liberal than he was but she invited me to stay three days with her while i was looking about for suitable lodgings i found that her house was a regular rendezvous for the tabbies of the neighborhood every afternoon there were some four or five of them there some brought work others came in undisguisedly to gossip many of these had known john simcoe in his younger days and by careless questioning i elicited the fact that no one would have recognized him had it not been for miss simcoe having told them of his arrival  the manager of the bank i rather shrank from an encounter with but i managed to obtain from miss simcoe a letter her nephew had written to her when he was away from home a short time before he left england and also one written by him since his return so far as i could see there was not the slightest resemblance between them  i thought that i might possibly get at someone less likely to be on his guard than the bank manager and she happened to mention as an interesting fact that one of the clerks who had entered the bank a lad of seventeen only a month or two before her nephew left was now married to the daughter of one of her gossips i said that her story had so deeply interested me that i should be glad to make his acquaintance  he came with his wife the evening before i left he was very chatty and pleasant and while there was a general conversation going on among the others i said to him that i was a great student of handwriting and i flattered myself that i could tell a mans character from his handwriting but i owned that i had been quite disconcerted by two letters which miss simcoe was kind enough to show me from her nephew one written before he left the bank the other dated three or four months ago  i cannot see the slightest resemblance between the two i said and do not remember any instance which has come under my knowledge of the handwriting of any man or woman changing so completely in the course of twenty years the one is a methodical business sort of writing showing marks of steady purpose regularity of habits and a kindly disposition i wont give you my opinion of the other but the impression that was left upon my mind was far from favorable  yes there has been an extraordinary change he agreed i can recollect the former one perfectly for i saw him sign scores of letters and documents and if he had had an account standing at the bank now i should without question honor a check so signed no doubt the great difference is accounted for by the life that mr simcoe has led he told me himself that for years at one time he had never taken a pen in hand and that he had almost forgotten how to write and that his fingers had grown so clumsy pulling at ropes rowing an oar digging for gold and opening oysters for pearls that they had become all thumbs and he wrote no better than a schoolboy  but that is not the case mr askill i said the writing is still clerkly in character and does not at all answer to his own description  i noticed that myself and so did our chief he showed me a letter that he had received from simcoe asking him to run up for a few days to stay with him in london he showed it to me with the remark that in all his experience he had never seen so great and complete a change in the handwriting of any man as in that of mr simcoe since he left the bank he considered it striking proof how completely a mans handwriting depends upon his surroundings he turned up an old ledger containing many entries in simcoes handwriting and we both agreed that we could not see a single point of resemblance  thank you i said i am glad to find that my failure to recognize the two handwritings as being those of the same man has been shared by two gentlemen who are like myself in a humble way experts at handwriting  the next morning i got your letter written after i had sent you the address and told miss simcoe that i was unexpectedly called back to town but that it was quite probable that i should ere long be down again when i would arrange with one or other of the people of whom she had kindly spoken to me that is all i have been able to learn hilda  but it seems to me that you have learned an immense deal netta you have managed it most admirably  at any rate i have got as much as i expected if not more i have learned that no one recognized this man simcoe on his first arrival in his native town and it was only when this old lady had spread the news abroad and had told the tale of his generosity to her and so prepared the way for him that he was more or less recognized she having no shadow of doubt but that he was her longlost nephew in the three days that he stopped with her he had no doubt learned from the dear old gossip almost every fact connected with his boyhood the men he was most intimate with the positions they held and i doubt not some of the escapades in which they might have taken part together so that he was thoroughly well primed before he met them besides no doubt they were more anxious to hear tales of adventure than to talk of the past and his course must have been a very easy one  miss simcoe said that he spent money like a prince and gave a dinner to all his old friends at which every dainty appeared and the champagne flowed like water we may take it as certain that none of his guests ever entertained the slightest doubt that their host was the man he pretended to be there could seem to them no conceivable reason why a stranger should come down settle an income upon miss simcoe and spend his money liberally among all his former acquaintances if he were any other man than john simcoe  lastly we have the handwriting the man seems to have laid his plans marvelously well and to have provided against every unforeseen contingency yet undoubtedly he must have altogether overlooked the question of handwriting although his declaration that he had almost forgotten how to use his pen was an ingenious one and i might have accepted it myself if he had written in the rough scrambling character you would expect under the circumstances but his handwriting although in some places he had evidently tried to write roughly on the whole is certainly that of a man accustomed at one time of his life to clerkly work and yet differing as widely as the poles from the handwriting of simcoe both in the bank ledger and in the letter to his aunt  i think hilda that although the matter cannot be decided it certainly points to your theory that this man is not the john simcoe who left stowmarket twenty years ago he attempted and i think very cleverly to establish his identity by a visit to stowmarket and no doubt did so to everyones perfect satisfaction but when we come to go into the thing step by step we see that everything he did might have been done by anyone who happened to have a close resemblance to john simcoe in figure and some slight resemblance in face after listening for three days to miss simcoes gossip     chapter xiv  an advertisement   i cannot wait for dr leeds to come round hilda said the next morning at breakfast you and i will pay him a visit in harley street i am sure that he will not grudge a quarter of an hour to hear what you have done  what mystery are you two girls engaged in miss purcell asked as she placidly poured out the tea  it is a little plot of our own aunt netta said we are trying to get on walters track in our own way and to be for a time amateur detectives so far we have not found any decisive clew but i think that we are searching in the right direction please trust us entirely and we hope some day we shall have the triumph of bringing walter back safe and sound  i pray god that it may be so my dear i know that you are both sensible girls and not likely to get yourselves into any silly scrape  i dont think we are aunt but i am afraid that neither of us would consider any scrape a foolish one that brought us even a little bit nearer to the object of our search at any rate aunt it will reassure you to know that we are acting in concert with dr leeds of whom i know that you entertain the highest opinion  certainly i do of course i am no judge whatever as to whether he is a good doctor but i should think from what dr pearson says that he must in the opinion of other medical men be considered an exceptionally clever man for his age and having seen him for four months and lived in close contact with him i would rather be attended by him than by anyone else i have ever met his kindness to the general was unceasing had he been his son he could not have been more patient and more attentive he showed wonderful skill in managing him and was at once sympathetic and cheerful but more than that i admired his tact in filling the somewhat difficult position in which he was placed although he was completely one of the family and any stranger would have supposed that he was a brother or at least a cousin there was always something in his manner that even while laughing and chatting with us all placed a little barrier between us and himself and one felt that although most essentially a friend he was still there as the generals medical attendant  it was a difficult position for a man of his age to be placed in had he been like most of the doctors we knew in germany a man filled with the idea that he must always be a professor of medicine and impressing people with his learning and gravity it might have been easy enough but there is nothing of that sort about him at all he is just as highspirited and is as bright and cheerful as other young men of about the same age and it was only when he was with the general that his gentleness of manner recalled the fact that he was a doctor as i say it was a difficult position with only an old woman like myself and two girls who looked to him for comfort and hope who treated him as if he had been an old friend and were constantly appealing to him for his opinion on all sorts of subjects  i confess that when he first came here with dr pearson i thought that it was a very rash experiment to introduce a young and evidently pleasant man to us under such circumstances especially as you hilda are a rich heiress and your own mistress and feeling as i did that i was in the position of your chaperon i must say that at first i felt very anxious about you and it was a great relief to me when after a time i saw no signs either on his part or yours of any feeling stronger than friendship springing up  hilda laughed merrily  the idea never entered into my mind aunt it is funny to me that so many people should think that a young man and a young woman cannot be thrown together without falling in love with each other at present fortunately i dont quite understand what falling in love means i like dr leeds better i think than any young man i ever met but i dont think that it can be in the least like what people feel when they fall in love certainly it was always as uncles doctor rather than as a possible suitor for my handthat is the proper expression isnt itthat i thought of him  so i was glad to perceive hilda and i was very thankful that it was so against him personally i had nothing to say quite the contrary but i saw that he was greatly attached to a profession in which he seems likely to make himself a fine position and nothing could be more uncomfortable than that such a man should marry a girl with a fine country estate either he would have to give up his profession or she would have to settle down in london as the wife of a physician and practically forfeit all her advantages  hilda again laughed  it is wonderful that all these things should never have occurred to me aunt i see now how fortunate it was that i did not fall in love with him and now netta as we have finished breakfast we will put on our things at once and go and consult our physician in ordinary we have a fair chance of being the first to arrive if we start immediately i told roberts to have the carriage at the door at halfpast nine and he does not begin to see patients until ten  bravo miss purcell dr leeds exclaimed when she had given him an account of her mission of course there is nothing absolutely proved but at least it shows that his identity is open to doubt since none of the people he had known recognized him at first sight and of course all his knowledge of them may have been picked up from the gossiping old lady his aunt something has been gained but the evidence is rather negative than positive it is possible that he is not the man that he pretends to be though at present putting aside the question of handwriting we must admit that the balance of probability is very much the other way to begin with how could this man supposing him to be an impostor know that john simcoe was born in stowmarket and had relatives living there  i forgot to mention that dr leeds an advertisement was inserted in the county paper saying that if any relatives of john simcoe who left england about 1830 would communicate with someone or other in town they would hear something to their advantage i was told this by one of miss simcoes friends who saw it in the paper and brought it in to her she was very proud of having made the discovery and regarded herself quite in the light of a benefactor to miss simcoe i remarked when she told me that it was curious he should have advertised instead of coming down himself to inquire miss simcoe said that she had expressed surprise to him and that he had said he did so because he should have shrunk from coming down had he not learned there was someone to welcome him  curious dr leeds said thoughtfully we may quite put it out of our minds that the reason he gave was the real one a man of this kind would not have suffered any very severe shock had he found that stowmarket and all it contained had been swallowed up by an earthquake no certainly that could not have been the reason we must think of some other and now ladies as this is the third card i have had brought in since you arrived i must leave the matter as it stands i think that we are getting on much better than we could have expected  that advertisement is very curious netta hilda said as they drove back why should he have put it in it would have been so much more natural that he should have gone straight down  i cannot think hilda it did not strike me particularly when i heard of it and i did not give it a thought afterwards you see i did not mention it either to you or dr leeds until it flashed across my mind when we were talking of course i did not see the advertisement itself but miss simcoe told me that there had been a good deal of discussion before she answered it as some of them had thought that it might be a trick  when was it he went down  it was in august last year and it was in the first week in september that he came here  he went down to get or manufacture proof of his identity hilda said as it turned out uncle accepted his statement at once and never had the smallest doubt as to his being john simcoe the precaution therefore was unnecessary but at the same time it certainly helps him now that a doubt has arisen it would have been very strange if a man possessing sufficient means to travel in india should have had no friends or connections in england i was present when he told my uncle that he had been down to see his aunt at stowmarket and in the spring he brought a gentleman who he said was manager of the stowmarket bank in which he had himself been at one time a clerk so you see he did strengthen his position by going down there  it strengthens it in one way hilda but in the other it weakens it as long as no close inquiries were made it was doubtless an advantage to him to have an aunt of the same name in stowmarket and to be able to prove by means of a gentleman in the position of manager of the bank that he john simcoe had worked under him three or four and twenty years ago on the other hand it was useful to us as a startingpoint if we had been utterly in the dark as to simcoes birthplace or past career we should have had to start entirely in the dark now at any rate we have located the birthplace of the real man and learned something of his position his family and how he became possessed of money that enabled him to start on a tour round the world i adhere as firmly as before to the belief that this is not the real man and the next step is to discover how he learned that john simcoe had lived at stowmarket at any rate it would be as well that we should find the advertisement it might tell us nothing but at the least we should learn the place to which answers were to be sent how should we set about that  i can get a readers ticket for the british museum because the chief librarian was a friend of uncles and dined with him several times hilda replied if i write to him and say that i want to examine some files of newspapers to determine a question of importance i am sure that he will send me a ticket at once i may as well ask for one for you also we may want to go there again to decide some other point  hilda at once wrote a note and sent tom roberts with it to the museum and he returned two hours later with the tickets  there are three suffolk papers the chief assistant in the newspaper department said courteously on their sending up the usual slip of paper which do you want  i do not know i should like to see them all three please the numbers for the first two weeks in august last  in a few minutes three great volumes were placed on the table these contained a years issue and on turning to the first week in august they found that the advertisement had appeared in all of the papers they carefully copied it out and were about to leave the library when netta said  let us talk this over for a minute or two before we go it seems to me that there is a curious omission in the advertisement  what is that  dont you see that he does not mention stowmarket he simply inquires for relations of john simcoe who was supposed to have been lost at sea it would certainly seem to be more natural that he should put it only in the paper that was likely to be read in stowmarket and surely he would have said relatives of john simcoe who left stowmarket in the year 1830 it looks very much as if while he knew that simcoe was a suffolk man he had no idea in what part of the county he had lived  it is very curious certainly netta and as you say it does seem that if he had known that it had been stowmarket he would have said so in the advertisement possibly hilda exclaimed so sharply that a gentleman at an adjoining table murmured hush he did did not know that it was in suffolk let us look in the london papers let us ask for the files of the times and standard  the papers were brought and the advertisement was found in both of them  there you see netta said triumphantly he still says nothing about suffolk  she beckoned to the attendant  i am sorry to give you so much trouble but will you please get us the files of three or four country papers of the same date i should like them in different parts of the countryyorkshire for instance and hereford and devonshire  it is no trouble miss he replied that is what we are here for  in a few minutes the three papers were brought and nettas triumph was great when she found the advertisement in each of them  that settles it conclusively she said the man did not know what part of the country john simcoe came from and he advertised in the london papers and in the provincial papers all over the country  that was a splendid idea of yours netta i think that it settles the question as to the fact that the theory you all laughed at was correct and that this man is not the real john simcoe  when they got back hilda wrote a line to dr leeds       dear doctor i do think that we have discovered beyond doubt that      the man is an impostor and that whoever he may be he is not john      simcoe when you can spare time please come round it is too long      to explain  at nine oclock that evening dr leeds arrived and heard of the steps that they had taken  really young ladies he said i must retire at once from my post of director of searches it was an excellent thought to ascertain the exact wording of the advertisement and the fact that the word stowmarket did not appear in it and that it was inserted in other county papers was very significant as to the advertisers ignorance of john simcoes birthplace but the quickness with which you saw how this could be proved up to the hilt shows that you are born detectives and i shall be happy to sit at your feet in future  then you think that it is quite conclusive  perfectly so the real john simcoe would of course have put the advertisement into the county paper published nearest to stowmarket and he would naturally have used the word stowmarket that omission might however have been accidental but the appearance of the advertisement in the london papers and as you have seen in provincial papers all over england appears to me ample evidence that he did not know from what county simcoe came and was ready to spend a pretty heavy amount to discover it now i think that you should at once communicate with mr pettigrew and inform him of your suspicion and the discovery that you have made it is for him to decide whether any steps should be taken in the matter and if so what steps as one of the trustees he is responsible for the proper division of the estates of general mathieson and the matter is of considerable importance to him  i think now too that our other suspicions should also be laid before him of course these are greatly strengthened by his discovery john simcoe who saved your uncles life at the risk of his own was scarcely the sort of man who would be guilty of murder and abduction but an unknown adventurer who had passed himself off as being simcoe with the object of obtaining a large legacy from the general may fairly be assumed capable of taking any steps that would enable him to obtain it if youd like to write to mr pettigrew and make an appointment to meet him at his office at three oclock tomorrow afternoon i will be here half an hour before and accompany you  the lawyer was somewhat surprised when dr leeds entered the office with the two ladies but that astonishment became stupefaction when they told their story  in the whole of my professional career i have never heard a more astonishing story i own that the abduction of the child at that critical moment did arouse suspicions in my mind that this mr simcoe the only person that could be benefited by his disappearance might be at the bottom of it and i was quite prepared to resist until the last any demand that might be made on his part for walter to be declared to be dead and the property handed over to him but that the man could have had any connection whatever with the illness of the general or that he was an impostor never entered my mind with regard to the first it is still a matter of suspicion only and we have not a shadow of proof to go upon you say yourself dr leeds that dr pearson the generals own medical attendant and the other eminent physicians called in refused absolutely to accept your suggestion because exceptional as the seizure and its effects were there was nothing that absolutely pointed to poison unless we can obtain some distinct evidence on that point the matter must not be touched upon for even you would hardly be prepared to swear in court that the general was a victim to poison  no i could not take my oath to it but i certainly could declare that the symptoms to my mind could be attributed to poison only  in the case of the abduction of the boy the lawyer went on the only absolute ground for our suspicion is that this man and no one else would have benefited by it and this theory certainly appears to be after the discoveries you have made a very tenable one it all comes so suddenly on me that i cannot think of giving any opinion as to the best course to be adopted i shall in the first place consult mr farmer and in the next place shall feel it my duty to take my cotrustee colonel bulstrode into my confidence because any action that we may take must of course be in our joint names he called here the other day and stated to me that he regarded the whole matter of walters abduction to be suspicious in the extreme he said he was convinced that john simcoe was at the bottom of it his interest in getting the boy out of the way being unquestionable and that we must move heaven and earth to find the child he agreed that we can do nothing about carrying out the will until we have found him i told him of the steps that we have been taking and their want of success by gad sir he said he must be found if we examine every child in the country i ventured to suggest that this would be a very difficult undertaking to which he only made some remark about the coldbloodedness of lawyers and said that if there were no other way he would dress himself up as a costermonger and go into every slum of london whether you would find him a judicious assistant in your searches i should scarcely be inclined to say but you would certainly find him ready to give every assistance in his power  the next day at three oclock colonel bulstrode was announced he was a short man of full habit of body at the present moment his face was even redder than usual  my dear miss covington he burst out as he came into the room i have just heard of all this rascality and what you and your friend miss purcell have discovered by gad young ladies i feel ashamed of myself here am i harry bulstrode a man of the world and as such considered that this affair of the man simcoe being made heir in case of the childs death and the simultaneous disappearance of the boy to have been suspicious in the extreme and yet i have seen no way of doing anything and have been so upset that my temper has as that rascal andrew my old servant had the impudence to tell this morning become absolutely unbearable and now i find that you two girls and a doctor fellow have been quietly working the whole thing out and that not improbably my dear old friend was poisoned and that the man who did it is not the man he pretended to be but an infernal impostor who had of course carried the child away and may for anything we know have murdered him it has made me feel that i ought to go to school again for i must be getting into my second childhood still young ladies if as is evident i have no sense to plan i can at least do all in my power to assist you in your search and you have only to say to me colonel bulstrode we want an inquiry made in india and i am off by the first p and o  thank you very much colonel hilda said trying to repress a smile i was quite sure that from your friendship for my dear uncle you would be ready to give us your assistance but so far there has been no way in which you could have aided us in the inquiries that we have made indeed as dr leeds has impressed upon us the fewer there are engaged in the matter the better for if this man knew that we were making all sorts of inquiries about him he might think it necessary for his safety either to put walter out of the way altogether or to send him to some place so distant that there would be practically no hope whatever of our ever discovering him at present i think that we have fairly satisfied ourselves that this man is an impostor and that the real john simcoe was drowned as supposed in the ship in which he sailed from india who this man is and how he became acquainted with the fact that john simcoe saved my uncles life in india are mysteries that so far we have no clew to but these matters are at present of minor importance to us before anything else we want to find where walter is hidden and to do this we are going to have this man watched he cannot have carried off walter by himself and no doubt he meets occasionally the people who helped him and who are now hiding walter it is scarcely probable that they come to his lodgings he is not likely to put himself into anyones power and no doubt goes by night in some disguise to meet them as of course he knows you perfectly well it would be worse than useless for you to try to follow him that is going to be done by tom roberts  well my man andrew might help him the colonel said simcoe has often dined with me at the club but he never came to my chambers one man cannot be always on the watch and andrew can take turns with roberts he is an impudent rascal but he has got a fair share of sense so when you are ready if you will drop me a line he shall come here and take his instructions from you  thank you very much colonel that certainly would be of assistance it is only of an evening that he would be wanted for we are quite agreed that these meetings are sure to take place after dark     chapter xv  very bad news   a month passed tom roberts and andrew watched together in jermyn street the former with a cap pulled well down over his face and very tattered clothes the latter dressed as a groom but making no attempt to disguise his face during that time everyone who called at the house in jermyn street was followed and their names and addresses ascertained one always remaining in jermyn street while the other was away the man they were watching had gone out every evening but it was either to one or the other of the clubs to which he belonged or to the theater or opera  you will trace him to the right place presently roberts hilda said cheerfully when she saw that he was beginning to be disheartened at the nonsuccess of his search you may be sure that he will not go to see these men oftener than he can help does he generally wear evening clothes  always miss  i dont think there is any occasion to follow him in future when he goes out in that dress i think it certain that when he goes to meet these men he will be in disguise when you see him come out dressed altogether differently to usual follow him closely even if we only find where he goes it will be a very important step                                       on the seventh week after the disappearance of walter mr pettigrew came in one morning at eleven oclock his air was very grave  have you heard news mr pettigrew hilda asked  i have very bad news mr comfrey a lawyer of not the highest standing who is i have learnt acting for this fellow called upon me he said i am sorry to say that i have some painful news to give you mr pettigrew yesterday the body of a child a boy some six or seven years old was found in the canal at paddington it was taken to the lockhouse the features were entirely unrecognizable and the police surgeon who examined it said that it had been in the water over a month most of its clothing was gone partly torn off by barges passing over the body but there still remained a portion of its underclothing and this bore the letters w r the police recognized them as those of the child who has been so largely advertised for and as my client mr simcoe had offered a thousand pounds reward and as all information was to be sent to me a policeman came down just as i was closing the office to inform me of the fact  i at once communicated with my client who was greatly distressed he went to paddington the first thing this morning and he tells me that he has no doubt whatever that the remains are those of walter rivington although he could not swear to his identity as the features are altogether unrecognizable as i understand sir that you and miss covington were the guardians of this unfortunate child i have driven here at once in order that you may go up and satisfy yourselves on the subject i understand that an inquest will be held tomorrow  hilda had not spoken while mr pettigrew was telling his story but sat speechless with horror  it cannot be surely it cannot be she murmured oh mr pettigrew say that you cannot believe it  i can hardly say that my dear the whole affair is such a terrible one that i can place no bounds whatever to the villainy of which this man may be capable this may be the missing child but on the other hand it may be only a part of the whole plot  but who else can it be if it has walters clothes on  as to that i can say nothing but you must remember that this man is an extraordinarily adroit plotter and would hesitate at nothing to secure this inheritance there would be no very great difficulty in obtaining from some rascally undertaker the body of a child of the right age dressing him up in some of our wards clothes and dropping the body into the canal which may have been done seven weeks ago or may have been done but a month of course i do not mean to say that this was so i only mean to say that it is possible no i expressed my opinion when we talked it over before that no sensible man would put his neck in a noose if he could carry out his object without doing so and murder could hardly be perpetrated without running a very great risk for the people with whom the child was placed would upon missing it suddenly be very likely to suspect that it had been made away with and would either denounce the crime or extort money by holding a threat over his head for years  yes that may be so hilda exclaimed rising to her feet let us go and see at once i will take netta with me she knows him as well as i do  she ran upstairs and in a few words told netta the news and in five minutes they came down ready to start  i have told walters nurse to come with us hilda said if anyone can recognize the child she ought to be able to do so fortunately she is still in the house  now young ladies the lawyer said before they started let me caution you unless you feel a moderate certainty that this child is walter rivington make no admission whatever that you see any resemblance if the matter comes to a trial your evidence and mine cannot but weigh with the court as against that of this man who is interested in proving its identity with walter of course if there is any sign or mark on the body that you recognize you will acknowledge it as the body of our ward we shall then have to fight the case on other grounds but unless you detect some unmistakable mark and it is extremely unlikely that you will do so in the state the body must be in confine yourself to simply stating that you fail to recognize it in any way  there never was any mark on the poor childs body hilda said i have regretted it so much because in the absence of any descriptive marks the chance of his ever being found was of course much lessened  the lawyer had come in a fourwheeled cab and in this the party all took their places not a word was spoken on the way except that hilda repeated what mr pettigrew had said to the nurse it was with very white faces that they entered the lockhouse the little body was lying on a board supported by two trestles it was covered by a piece of sailcloth and the tattered garments that it had had on were placed on a chair beside it prepared as she was for something dreadful the room swam round and had hilda not been leaning on mr pettigrews arm she would have fallen there was scarce a semblance of humanity in the little figure the features of the face had been entirely obliterated possibly by the passage of barges possibly by the work of simple decay  courage my dear mr pettigrew said it is a painful duty but it must be performed  the three women stood silent beside the little corpse netta was the first to speak  i cannot identify the body as that of walter rivington she said i dont think that it would be possible for anyone to do so  is the hair of the same color the policeman who was in charge of the room asked  the hair is rather darker than his netta said but being so long in the water and in such dirty water it might have darkened  that was never master walters hair the nurse exclaimed the darling had long soft hair and unless those who murdered him cut it short it would not be like this besides this hair is stiffer it is more like the hair of a workhouse child than master walters  that is so hilda said i declare that i not only do not recognize the body as that of my ward but that i am convinced it is not his  judging only by the hair mr pettigrew said i am entirely of your opinion miss covington i have stroked the childs head many times and his hair was like silk i have nothing else to go by and am convinced that the body is not walter rivingtons  they then looked at the fragments of clothes in two places they were marked w r  that is my marking miss the nurse said after closely examining the initials i could not swear to the bits of clothes but i can to the letters you see miss i always work a line above the letters and another below them i was taught to do it so when i was a girl in our village school and i have always done it since but i never saw anyone else mark them so you see the letters are worked in red silk and the two lines in white the old woman who taught us said that it made a proper finish to the work yes miss covington i can swear to these things being master walters  you could not swear to their being those in which he went out the morning he was lost nurse  i can sir because there is nothing missing except what he had on i have all his things properly counted and everything is there  at this moment there was a little stir outside and hilda glanced down and whispered to netta  let down your fall i do not want this man to recognize you  just as she did so john simcoe entered he bowed to hilda  i am sorry indeed to meet you under such painful circumstances  i beg you not to address me sir she said haughtily i wish to have no communication with or from you your coming here reminds me of the thirtyseventh verse of the nineteenth chapter of st john you can look it out sir if you happen to have a bible at home fortunately it is not wholly applicable for we are all absolutely convinced that this poor little body is not that of general mathiesons grandson  so saying she stepped out of the little house followed by the others leaving john simcoe white with passion  you should not have shown your hand so plainly miss covington  i could not help it the girl said he has called a dozen times at the house and has always received the message not at home and he must know that i suspect him of being walters abductor  what is the verse you referred him to hilda netta said i confess that i do not know any verse in st john that seems to be at all applicable to him  the quotation is they shall look on him whom they pierced  netta could not help smiling mr pettigrew shook his head  you are really too outspoken miss covington and you will get yourself into trouble as it is you have clearly laid yourself open to an action for libel for having practically called the man a murderer we may think what we like but we are in no position to prove it  i am not afraid of that she said i wish that he would do it then we should have all the facts brought out in court and even if we could not as you say prove everything we could at least let the world know what we think no there is no chance of his doing that mr pettigrew  it is fortunate for us miss covington that our clients are for the most part men your sex are so impetuous and so headstrong that we should have a hard time of it indeed if we had to take our instructions from them  mr pettigrew you will please remember that there are three of my sex in this cab and if you malign us in this way we will at once get out and walk  the old lawyer smiled indulgently  it is quite true my dear women are always passionately certain that they are right and neither counsel nor entreaty can get them to believe that there can be any other side to a case than that which they take talk about men ruining themselves by litigation the number that do so is as nothing to that of the women who would do so were they to get as often involved in lawsuits when dickens drew the man who haunted the courts he would have been much nearer the mark had he drawn the woman who did so you can persuade a man that when he has been beaten in every court his case is a lost one but a woman simply regards a hostile decision as the effect either of great partiality or of incompetence on the part of the judge and even after being beaten in the house of lords will attend the courts and pester the judges with applications for the hearing of some new points it becomes a perfect mania with some of them  very well mr pettigrew i would certainly carry my case up to the highest court and if i were beaten i would not admit that i was in the wrong still i do not think that i should pester the poor old judges after that i suppose we shall all have to come up again tomorrow to the inquest  certainly nurse has recognized the clothes and i suppose you all recognize the marks miss covington  yes i have no doubt whatever that the clothes are walters  of course we shall be represented by counsel mr pettigrew went on we must not let the jury find that this is walters body if we can possibly prevent it  you think that they will do so  i am afraid of it they will know nothing of the real circumstances of the case they will only know that the child has been missing for nearly two months and that in spite of large rewards no news has been obtained of him they will see that this child is about the same age that the clothes in which it was found are those worn by the missing boy they will themselves have viewed the body and have seen that identification is almost impossible this man will give his evidence to the effect that he believes it to be walter rivingtons body we shall give it as our opinion that it is not that opinion being founded upon the fact that the few patches of hair left on the head are shorter and coarser than this was to us this may appear decisive but the counsel who will no doubt appear for simcoe will very legitimately say this fact has no weight and will point out that no real judgment can be formed upon this the child was missingprobably stolen for the sake of its clothes seeing the description in the handbills and placards the first step would be to cut off its hair which disposes of the question of length and as he will point out hair which when very long seems soft and silky will stand up and appear almost bristly when cropped close to the head i am afraid that in the face of all that we can say the coroners jury will find that the body is walters as to the cause of death they will probably give an open verdict for even if the surgeon has found any signs of violence upon the body these may have been inflicted by passing barges long after death  will you have it brought forward that simcoe has an interest in proving the body to be walters  i think not there would be no use in beginning the fight in the coroners court it will all have to be gone into when he applies to the higher courts for an order on the trustees of the will to proceed to carry out its provisions then our case will be fully gone into we shall plead that in the first place the will was made under undue influence we shall point to the singularity of the generals mysterious attack an attack which one of the doctors who attended him at once put down to poison and that at the moment of the attack simcoe was sitting next to him at dinner we shall point to the extraordinary coincidence that the child who stood between simcoe and the inheritance disappeared on the evening when the general was in extremis and lastly we shall fire our last shot by declaring that the man is not the john simcoe named in the will but is an impostor who assumed his name and traded upon his brave action on the generals behalf  but i do not want the fight to begin until we are in a better position than at present to prove what we say as yet however satisfactory to us we have not got beyond the point of conjecture and probabilities and i trust that before we have to fight the case we shall obtain some absolute facts in support of our theory the man would be able at present to put into court a number of highly respectable witnesses from stowmarket and of officers he has met here who would all testify to his being john simcoe and as against their evidence our conjectures would literally go for nothing no doubt you will all receive notices to attend this evening the policeman took your names and addresses and will have told the officer in charge of the case the nature of the evidence you will probably give and please remember that in giving evidence you must carefully abstain from saying anything that would lead the jury to perceive that you have any personal feeling against simcoe for they would be likely to put down your declaration of inability to recognize the body as a result of a bias against him do not let it be seen that there is any personal feeling in the matter at all  the summonses arrived that evening and the next morning they drove to the coroners court miss purcell accompanying them they found mr pettigrew awaiting them at the door  there is another case on before ours he said and i should advise you to take a drive for half an hour and when you come back to sit in the carriage until i come for you the waiting room is a stuffy little place and is at present full of witnesses in the case now on and as that case is one of a man killed in a drunken row they are not of a class whom it is pleasant to mix with  when they returned he again came out i have just spoken to the coroner and told him who you are and he has kindly given permission for you to go up to his own room the case he has now before him may last another half hour  it was just about that time when mr pettigrew came up and said that their case was about to commence and that they must go down and take their places in court this was now almost empty a few minutes before it had been crowded by those interested in the proceedings which had terminated in the finding of manslaughter against four of those concerned in the fray the discovery of a childs body in the canal was far too common an event to afford any attraction and with the exception of the witnesses two counsel seated in the front line facing the coroner and two or three officials there was no one in court as soon as the little stir caused by the return of the jury from viewing the body had ceased the coroner addressed them  we shall now gentlemen of the jury proceed to the case of the body of the child said to be that of walter rivington which was found under very strange and suspicious circumstances near this end of the canal you will hear that the child was missing from his home in hyde park gardens on the 23d of october and for his discovery as some of you are doubtless aware large sums have been offered the day before yesterday the drags were used for the purpose of discovering whether another child who was lost and who had been seen going near the bank had been drowned in the course of that search this body was brought up you have already viewed it gentlemen dr macilvaine will tell you that it has certainly been a month in the water perhaps two or three weeks longer unfortunately the state of the body is such that it is impossible now to ascertain the cause of death or whether it was alive when it fell in or was placed in the water fortunately some of its clothes still remain on the body and one of the witnesses the nurse of the missing boy will tell you that the marks upon them were worked by herself and that she can swear to them whether any other matters will come before you in reference to the case which from the fact that the child was grandson of the late general mathieson and heir to his property has attracted much attention i cannot say the first witness you will hear is the lockkeeper who was present at the finding of the body  before the witness was called however one of the counsel rose and said  i am instructed sir to appear to watch the proceedings on behalf of mr john simcoe who by the death of walter rivington inherits under the will of the late general mathieson  the coroner bowed the other counsel then rose  and i sir have been instructed by mr pettigrew and colonel bulstrode the trustees under the will the former gentleman being also joint guardian with miss hilda covington of the missing child to watch the case on their behalf  there was again an exchange of bows and the lockkeeper then entered the box his evidence was given in few words he simply deposed to assisting in dragging the canal and to the finding of the body  have you any questions to ask the witness the coroner said turning to the barristers  the counsel employed by mr pettigrew rose  yes sir i have a few questions to ask now mr cousins you say that you took part in dragging the canal you are in charge of the drags are you not  yes sir they are always kept in readiness at the lockhouse  how came you to use the drags i suppose you dont take them down and spend a day or two in dragging the canal unless you have reason for supposing that a body is there  no sir the afternoon before a woman came up crying and said that her child had fallen into the water he had gone out in the morning to play and when dinnertime came and he didnt return she searched everywhere for him and two children had just told her that they were playing with him on the bank of the canal and that he had fallen in they tried to get him out but he sank and they were so frightened that they ran home without saying anything but they thought now that they had better tell i said that she had better go to the police station and repeat her statement and they would send a constable to help me she did that and came back with the policeman it was getting late then but we took a boat and dragged the canal for two or three hours the next morning she came again and said that the boys had shown her just where her child fell in and we dragged there and found this body we brought it ashore and after we had carried it to the lockhouse we set to work again but could not find any other body  what became of the woman  she was with us till we fetched up this body when she saw it she ran away crying and did not come back again  you have not seen her since mr cousins  no sir i have not seen her since i believe the constable made inquiries about her  thank you i have nothing more to ask  the policeman then entered the box and gave his evidence shortly as to assisting in the operation of dragging and to finding the body  about this woman who gave the alarm the barrister asked have you seen her constable  no sir not since the body was found thinking it strange that she did not come back i reported it at the station she had given the name of mary smith and an address in old park i was told to go round there but no such person was known and no one had heard of a child being lost on my reporting this inquiries were made all round the neighborhood but no one had heard of such a woman nor of a missing child  this is a very strange circumstance sir and it looks as if the whole story of the drowning child was a fabrication the fact that the body of the child whose death we are considering was found close to the spot would certainly seem to point to the fact that some person or persons who were cognizant of the fact that this body was there were for some reasons anxious that it should be found and so employed this woman to get the drags used at that point in order that the body might be brought to light  it is certainly a very strange business the coroner said and i hope that the police will spare no efforts to discover this woman however as she is not before us we must proceed with the case  then the officer of the court called out the name of mary summerford and the nurse went into the witness box  i understand mary sommerford that you were nurse to walter rivington  i was sir  will you tell the jury when you last saw him and how it was that he was lost  she told the story as she had told it to hilda on the day that he was missing  you have seen the clothes found on the body do you recognize them as those that he was wearing when you last saw him  yes sir  how do you recognize them  because his initials are worked in two places i worked them myself and can swear to them  you cannot recognize the body nurse  i do not believe it is the body of my young master she said his hair was lovelylong and silky what hair remains on the body is very short and what i should call stubbly  but the hair might have been cut short by the people who stole him the coroner said it is the first precaution they would take to evade the search that would at once be set on foot  yes sir but i dont think that it would have grown up so stiff  my experience of workhouse children the coroner remarked is that whatever the hair they may have had when they entered the house it is stiff enough to stand upright when cut close to the head there is nothing else is there which leads you to doubt the identity of the child  no sir i cannot say that there is but i dont believe that it is master walters body  hilda netta and mr pettigrew all gave their evidence the two former stated that they identified the clothes but upon the same ground as the nurse they failed to recognize the body as that of walter rivington all were asked if they could in any way account for the finding of the childs body there the question had been foreseen and they said that although they had used every means of discovering the child they had obtained no clew whatever as to his whereabouts from the time that he was stolen to the time they were summoned to identify the body  you quite assume that he was stolen and not that he wandered away as children will do when their nurses are gossiping  we are convinced that he was stolen sir because the search was begun so momentarily after he was missed that he could hardly have got out of sight had he merely wandered away on foot notice was given to the police an hour after he disappeared and every street in this part of london was scoured immediately  children of that age miss covington have often a fancy for hiding themselves and this child may have hidden somewhere close until he saw his nurse pass by and then made off in the opposite direction the spot where the childs body was found is little more than a quarter of a mile from the corner where he was missed he might have wandered up there found himself on the canal bank and childlike have begun to play and so slipped into the water  john simcoe was the last witness called he gave his evidence to the effect that he had seen the body and that personally he saw no reason to doubt that it was that of walter rivington  his counsel then rose  you are i believe mr simcoe owing to the death of this poor child the principal legatee under the will of general mathieson  i am sorry to say that i am the whole business has caused me immense distress i have felt that being the only person that would benefit by the childs death those who did not know me would have a suspicion that i might have had a hand in his mysterious disappearance  you have taken an active part in the search for him  i offered a reward of one thousand pounds for any information that would lead to his discovery and i believe that i have traveled up and down every obscure slum in london in hopes of lighting upon him  even without the provision in the will which made you next heir you benefited by it did you not  i did most munificently general mathieson had himself informed me that i should find by his will that he had not been ungrateful for a service that i rendered him many years ago but i was not aware of the sum that he had left me as to the distant contingency of inheriting in case of the childs death i was altogether ignorant of it but had i known it it would in no way have affected me the little fellow was a fine healthy child and therefore the thought that he might not live to come of age would never have entered my mind  as the other counsel had no question to ask the evidence was now concluded  well gentlemen you have heard the evidence the coroner said dr macilvaine has told you as indeed you might judge for yourselves on viewing the body that it is impossible in its advanced state of decomposition to say whether the child was alive or dead at the time he fell or was placed in the canal as to who were the guilty persons who beguiled the child away if he was beguiled we have no shadow of evidence and it may well be that he was stolen for the sake of his clothes the cutting short of his hair certainly points to the truth of this theory as does also the fact that no vestige has been found of his upper clothing it is probable that some woman enticed him away and kept him for some time with her and then when she became alarmed by the search made for him carried him in his sleep from the house and perhaps laid him down by the canal thinking that he would be found there in the morning and that the poor child awoke in the dark wandered about and fell into the canal  however this is only theory but it is at least supported by the mysterious incident of the unknown woman who by means of a tale which appears beyond doubt to have been wholly fictitious caused the water at that spot to be dragged the fact that on the second day she pointed out almost the exact point where the body was found would seem to show that the child could scarcely have fallen in the water as she suggested for in that case she could not have known the precise spot it would seem then more likely that either the child died a natural death perhaps from confinement or bad treatment or possibly that terribly alarmed at the search that was being maintained he was put out of the way and then thrown into the canal at this spot in that case we may admit that it is certainly strange that she should risk discovery by the course she took and i can only account for it on the ground that she had been ever since his death suffering from remorse and possibly she may have thought that she might in some sort of way atone for her conduct were she to point out where the child was and so secure for him christian burial that however is not before us at present and i see no advantage in an adjournment for an indefinite time until this mystery is solved the police have taken the matter in hand and will spare no pains to discover the woman if they do so undoubtedly proceedings will be taken in another court the point that we have to consider is who this child was and how he came to his death unfortunately we are absolutely without any evidence of what became of him from the time he got lost up to the discovery of his body and i think that you cannot do otherwise than find an open verdict  as to the question of identity there can i think be no shadow of doubt the clothes in which he was found prove him beyond question to have been walter rivington although the body itself is absolutely beyond identification i do not think that you need give any weight to the nurses failure to recognize him or to her opinion about the hair she is naturally reluctant to acknowledge even to herself that the child which was lost by her inadvertence is dead and the ladies would be equally reluctant to admit that all hope was over  the jury put their heads together and there was evidently no difference of opinion for in two or three minutes they sat down again and the foreman stood up  you have decided on your verdict the coroner asked  we have sir we find that the body is that of walter rivington and that he was found dead in the canal but how he came there and by what means he came by his death there is no evidence to show  thank you gentlemen that is precisely the verdict that i should myself have given     chapter xvi  a fresh clew   just the verdict that i expected mr pettigrew said as he and the ladies issued from the courthouse  i suppose that it is for the best mr pettigrew but it seems hard when we could have said so much to be obliged to hold our tongues altogether  no doubt you will have an opportunity later on miss covington our tongues are tied until we can obtain some sort of proof to go upon we cannot go into court with merely suspicions we must get facts all we have done at present is to obtain some sort of foundation on which to work but facts we shall i hope get ere long from what we may discover of this fellows movements he is likely to be less careful now that it has been decided that walter is dead he is doubtless well aware of the fact that trustees have a year given them before proceeding to carry out the provisions of a will and therefore for that time he will keep quiet at the end of the year his solicitor will write us a courteous letter asking when we shall be in a position to distribute the estate in accordance with the provisions of the will we shall reply that we are not in a position to do so then after a time will come letters of a more and more peremptory character and at last a notice that they are about to apply to the courts for an order for us to act upon the provisions of the will about two years after the generals death the matter will probably come on i may say that i have already sent checks to all the small legatees  thank you i was aware of that because tom roberts came to me yesterday with his check for two hundred pounds and said look here miss covington you said you meant to keep me on just the same as in the generals time so this wont be of any use to me and i should like to spend it in any way that you think best to find out what has become of master walter of course i told him that the money could not be spent in that way and that the work that he was doing was of far greater use than ten times that sum would be  i will send you your check tomorrow miss covington the sum we have paid to the people who have been searching and all other expenses that may be incurred will of course come out of the estate you have not as yet settled i suppose as to your future plans  no except that i shall certainly keep on the house in hyde park gardens for the present it is of course ridiculously large for me but i dont want the trouble of making a move until i make one permanently and shall therefore stay here until this matter is finally cleared up miss purcell has most kindly consented to remain as my chaperon and her plans and those of her niece will depend upon mine  they had sent away their carriage when they entered the court and they walked quietly home mr pettigrew returning at once to his office the next morning tom roberts accosted hilda as she entered the breakfast room with a face that showed he had news  we have traced him down to one of his places at last miss i said to andrew we must keep a special sharp look out tonight for like enough now that the inquest is over he will be going to talk over the matter with his pals well miss last night at halfpast nine out he comes he wasnt in evening dress for although as usual he had a topcoat on he had light trousers and walking boots he did not turn the usual way but went up into piccadilly we followed him i kept close behind him and andrew at a distance so that he should not notice us together at the circus he hailed a cab and as he got in i heard him say to the driver kings cross station as soon as he had gone off andrew and i jumped into another cab and told the man to drive to the same place and that we would give him a shilling extra if he drove sharp  he did drive sharp and i felt sure that we had got there before our man i stopped outside the entrance andrew went inside in five minutes he arrived paid the driver his fare and went in i had agreed to wait two or three minutes outside while andrew was to be at the ticket office to see where he booked for i was just going in when to my surprise out the man came again and walked briskly away i ran in and fetched andrew and off we went after him he hadnt more than a minutes start and we were nearly up to him by the time he had got down to the main road we kept behind him until we saw him go up pentonville hill then andrew went on ahead of him and i followed we agreed that if he looked back suspicious i should drop behind andrew when he once got ahead was to keep about the same distance in front of him so as to be able to drop behind and take it up instead of me while i was to cross over the road if i thought that he had discovered i was following him  however it did not seem to strike him that anyone was watching him and he walked on briskly until he came to a small house standing by itself and as he turned in we were in time to see that the door was opened to him by a man andrew and i consulted i went in at the gate took my shoes off and went round the house there was only a light in one room which looked as if there were no servants the curtains were pulled together inside and i could see nothing of what was going on he stopped there for an hour and a half then came out again hailed a cab halfway down the hill and drove off andrew and i had compared watches and he had gone back to jermyn street so that we should be able to know by the time the chap arrived whether he had gone anywhere else on his way back when i joined him i found that the man must have driven straight to the circus and then got out for he walked in just twenty minutes after i had seen him start  that is good news indeed roberts we will go and see mr pettigrew directly after breakfast please order the carriage to be round at a quarter to ten  netta was as pleased as her friend when she heard that a step had been made at last  i am sick of this inaction she said and want to be doing something towards getting to the bottom of the affair i do hope that we shall find some way in which i can be useful  i have no doubt at all that you will be very useful when we get fairly on the track i expect that this will lead to something  after tom roberts had repeated his story to mr pettigrew hilda said  i brought roberts with me mr pettigrew that he might tell the story in his own way it seems to me that the best thing now would be to employ a private detective to find out who the man is who lives in rose cottage this would be out of the line of tom roberts and colonel bulstrodes servant altogether they would not know how to set about making inquiries whereas a detective would be at home at such work  i quite agree with you the lawyer said to make inquiries without exciting suspicion requires training and practice an injudicious question might lead to this man being warned that inquiries were being made about him and might ruin the matter altogether of course your two men will still keep up their watch it may be that we shall find it is of more use to follow the track of this man than the other but you must not be too sanguine the man at rose cottage may be an old acquaintance of simcoe well my dear he went on in answer to a decided shake of the head on hildas part you must call the man by the only name that he is known by although it may not belong to him i grant that the manner in which he drove into kings cross station and then walked out on foot would seem to show that he was anxious to throw anyone who might be watching him off the scent and that the visit was so to speak a clandestine one but it may relate to an entirely different matter for this man may be for aught we know an adept in crime and may be in league with many other doubtful characters  it may be so mr pettigrew but we will hope not  very well my dear the lawyer said i will send for a trustworthy man at once and set him to work collecting information regarding the occupant of the cottage and now i have a point upon which i wish to ask your opinion i have this morning received a letter from this mans solicitor asking if we intend to undertake the funeral of the body which the coroners jury have found to be that of walter rivington and announcing that if we do not his client will himself have it carried out  what do you think mr pettigrew hilda said hesitatingly we may be wrong you know and it may be walters body  i have been thinking it over the lawyer replied and i must say it is my opinion that as we have all stated our conviction that it is not we should only stultify ourselves if we now undertook the funeral and put a stone with his name on over the grave if we should at any time become convinced that we have been wrong we can apply for a faculty to remove the coffin to the family vault down in warwickshire  if we could do that i should not mind hilda said but even the possibility of walter being buried by the man who we firmly believe was the cause of his death is terrible  yes i can quite understand your feelings but i think that it is necessary that the family should make a protest against its being supposed that they recognize the child by declining to undertake the funeral no protest could well be stronger  if you think that mr pettigrew we certainly had best stand aside and let that poor child be buried by this man  two days later they were driving in the row it was hildas first appearance there since the generals death and after talking it over with netta she now appeared there in order to show that she was perfectly convinced that the child which had been found in the canal was not her little cousin the details of the proceedings of the coroners court had of course been read by all her friends and her appearance in the park would be the best proof that she could give that the family were absolutely convinced that the body was not that of walter  miss purcell and netta were with her the latter had on as usual a thick veil this she always wore when driving through any locality where she might meet john simcoe  that is the man hilda said to her in a sharp tone the farther of those two leaning on the rail the other side of the road  as hilda fixed her eyes on the man she saw him give a sudden movement then he said to the man next to him  do you see that girl in deep mourning it is that little vixen hilda covington confound her she is at the bottom of all this trouble and i believe she would give ten thousand out of her own pocket to checkmate me  the carriage was opposite to them now hilda looked straight in front of her while netta who was sitting with her back to the horses took up the watch  she would have to be sharp indeed to do that the other man said so far everything has gone without a hitch and i dont see a single weak point in your case the most troublesome part has been got over  and now some carriages going the other way cut off the view and netta could read no further she drew a long breath as hildas eyes turned towards her  what did you read the latter asked  netta repeated what she had caught and then hilda took up the conversation  it is quite evident that this man whoever he is is an accomplice he is a gentlemanlylooking man and i fancy that he sat in the stalls near to us one evening this spring however it is quite clear that he is a confederate of simcoe just repeat his words over again they were in answer to his remark that i would give ten thousand pounds to be able to checkmate him  netta repeated the answer of simcoes companion  you see netta there is something to find out that would checkmate him that is quite evident he thinks that i cannot find it out it must be i should think that walter is kept in hiding somewhere it could not mean that he had killed my uncle for he would hardly tell that to anyone and so put himself in their power  it may mean that you cannot find out that he is not john simcoe netta suggested  possibly but he cannot know we suspect that  it might be about the last will hilda  the latter shook her head  we have never thought that there could be anything wrong about it the will was drawn up by colonel bulstrodes lawyers and they knew my uncle by sight besides all the legacies were exactly the same as in the other will the signature and the written instructions were in his handwriting and he signed it in the solicitors office in the presence of two of their clerks no i dont think he can possibly mean that it must be either walters abduction or that he is not john simcoe and i should say that the former is much the more likely you see he had no need of an accomplice in the matter of getting evidence as to identity whereas he did need an accomplice in the carrying off of walter i should say that he is far too clever a man to let anyone into any of his secrets unless he needed his assistance i wonder who the man with him can be he is dressed in good style and i have certainly met him somewhere i believe as i said it was at the opera i should have thought that a man of that class is the last simcoe would choose as a confederate  miss purcell looked from one to the other as they talked she had by this time been taken completely into their confidence but had refused absolutely to believe that a man could be guilty of such wickedness as that which they suspected on their return home they found a letter awaiting them from mr pettigrew       my dear miss covington it ran my detective has not yet finished      his inquiries but has at least discovered that the proprietor of      rose cottage for they say that the place belongs to him is      somewhat of a mystery to his neighbors he lives there entirely      alone he goes out regularly in a morning it is supposed to some      occupation in the city no tradesmen ever call at the door it is      supposed that he brings home something for his breakfast and cooks      it for himself and that he dines in the city and makes himself a      cup of tea in the evening or else that he goes out after dark      sometimes of summer evenings he has been seen to go out just at      twilight dressed in full evening costumethat is to say it is      supposed so for he wore a light overcoatbut certainly a white      necktie black trousers and patent leather boots of course in      all this there is nothing in itself absolutely suspicious a man      engaged in the city would naturally enough take his meals there      and may prefer to do everything for himself to having the bother of      servants also if his means permit it he may like to go to      theaters or places of amusement or may go out to visit business      friends i have of course directed the detective to follow him to      town and find out what is his business and where employed i will      let you know result tomorrow  the next day brought the letter       the mans name is william barens he has a small office on the      third floor of a house of business in great st helens and on the      doorway below his name is the word accountant the housekeeper      knows nothing about him except that he has occupied the room for      the last twelve years and that he is a gentleman who gives no      trouble he always puts his papers away at night in his safe so      that his table can be properly dusted she knows that he has      clients as several times when he has been away for his dinner      hour she has been asked when he would return he is a wellspoken      gentleman though not as particular about his dress as some but      liberal with his money and gives her as handsome a tip at      christmas as some people who have three or four rooms and no      doubt think themselves much finer people this certainly does not      amount to much by the way the old woman said that she knew he was      employed by several tradesmen in the neighborhood to keep their      books for them  two days later there was another communication       my dear miss covington my man has taken a step which i should      certainly have forbidden had he told me beforehand of his      intention he watched the man go out and then having previously      provided himself with instruments for picking locks he opened the      door and went in on the table were several heavy ledgers and      account books all bearing the names of tradesmen in the      neighborhood with several files of accounts bills and invoices      these fully bore out what the woman had told him besides the      chairs table and safe the only other articles of furniture in      the room were an office washing stand and a large closet in the      latter were a dress suit and boots and a suit of fashionable      walking clothes so that it is evident that he often changed there      instead of going home i am sorry to say that all this throws no      further light upon the mans pursuits and had it not been for      simcoes visit to him it would be safe to say that he is a      hardworking accountant in a somewhat humble but perhaps      wellpaying line that he is a trifle eccentric in his habits and      prefers living a cheap solitary life at home while spending his      money freely in the character of a man about town in the evening i      cannot say that the prospect in this direction seems hopeful i      have told my man that for the present we shall not require his      services further  it does not seem very satisfactory certainly hilda said with a sigh i am afraid that we shall have to keep on watching simcoe i wish i could peep into his room as this detective did into that of the pentonville man  i dont suppose that you would find anything there hilda he is not the sort of man to keep a memorandum book jotting down all his own doings  no hilda said with a laugh still one always thinks that one can find something  had hilda covington had her wish and looked into john simcoes room that morning she would certainly have derived some satisfaction from the sight he had finished his breakfast before opening a letter that lay beside him  what a plague the old woman is with her letters i told her that i hated correspondence but she persists in writing every month or so though she never gets any reply except my dear aunt thanks for your letter i am glad to hear that you are wellyour affectionate nephew well i suppose i must read it through  he glanced over the first page but on turning to the second his eye became arrested and he read carefully frowning deeply as he did so then he turned back and read it again the passage was as follows       i had quite an interesting little episode a day or two after i      last wrote a young ladyshe said her name was barcum and that      she was an artistcame in and asked if i would take her in as a      lodger she was a total stranger to the place and had come down      for her health and said that some tradesman had recommended her to      come here saying that as a single lady i might be glad to      accommodate her of course i told her that i did not take lodgers      she got up to go when she nearly fainted and i could not do less      than offer her a cup of tea then we got very chatty and as i saw      that she was really too weak to go about town looking for lodgings      i invited her to stay a day or two with me she being quite a lady      and a very pleasantspoken one she accepted and a pleasanter      companion i never had naturally i mentioned your name and told      her what adventures you had gone through and how kind you were      she was greatly interested and often asked questions about you      and i do think that she almost fell in love with you from my      description she left suddenly on receipt of a letter that called      her up to town saying that she would return but i have not heard      from her since and i am greatly afraid that the poor child must be      seriously ill she was a pretty and intelligentlooking girl with      dark eyes and hair and i should say that when in good health she      must be very bright of course she may have changed her mind about      coming down i am sure she would have written if she had been      well  confound the old gossip john simcoe said angrily as he threw the letter down i wonder what this means and who this girl can be it is clear enough that whoever she is she was sent down there to make inquiries about me it is that girl covingtons doing i have no doubt though it was not the minx herself for the description does not tally at all she has light brown hair and grayish sort of eyes there is one comfort she would learn nothing to my disadvantage from the old woman nor i believe from anyone at stowmarket in fact she would only get more and more confirmation of my story i have no fear upon that score but the thing shows how that girl is working on my track as for the lawyer he is an old fool and if it hadnt been for her i would bet a hundred to one that he would never have entertained any suspicion that all was not right it is her doing all through and this is a piece of it of course she could have no suspicion that i was not john simcoe but i suppose she wanted to learn if there was any dark spot in my historywhether i had ever been suspected of robbing a bank or had been expelled from school for thieving or something of that sort i begin to be downright afraid of her she had a way of looking through me when i was telling my best stories to the general that always put me out she disliked me from the first though i am sure i tried in every way to be pleasant to her i felt from the day i first saw her that she was an enemy and that if any trouble ever did come it would be through her i have no doubt she is moving heaven and earth to find walter but that she will never do for harrison is as true as steel and he is the only man who could put them on the right track moreover i have as much pull over him as he has over me he has never had a doubt about my being john simcoe he doesnt know about the other affair but only that walter stood between me and the estate and he was quite ready to lend me a hand to manage to get him out of the way so in that business he is in it as deep as i am while i know of a score of schemes he has been engaged in any one of which would send him abroad for life i expect those inquiries were made at stowmarket to endeavor to find out whether any child had been sent down there if so miss covington is not so sharp as i took her to be stowmarket would be the very last place where a man having relations and friends there would send a child whom he wished to keep concealed still it is annoying confoundedly annoying and it shows that these people that is to say hilda covington are pushing their inquiries in every direction likely or unlikely  the only comfort is the more closely they search the sooner they will come to the conclusion that the boy is not to be found i believe that though they declared they did not recognize the body they had no real doubt about it and they only said so because if they had admitted it the trustees would have had no excuse for not carrying out the provisions of the will that text the girl had the impudence to quote to me looked as if she believed the body was walters and that i had killed him though it may be that she only said it to drive me to bringing the whole business into court by bringing an action against her for libel but i am not such a fool as to do that just at present there is a lot of public feeling excited by the circumstances of the childs loss and the finding of the body and even if i got a verdict i fancy that the jury would be all on the girls side and give me such trifling damages that the verdict would do me more harm than good no our game clearly is to let the matter rest until it has died out of the public mind then we shall apply formally for the trustees to be called upon to act no doubt they will give us a great deal of trouble but comfrey says that he thinks that the order must be granted at last though possibly it may be withheld as far as the estate is concerned for some years at any rate i ought to get the ten thousand at once as the question whether the boy is alive or dead cannot affect that in the slightest     chapter xvii  netta acts independently   it seems to me hilda that somehow or other we are wasting our time netta said one morning suddenly as they were sitting together  how do you mean netta  well you see we relied a great deal on being able to overhear conversation from a distance and except those few words we gathered in the park we have absolutely done nothing that way  but how can we do more than we are doing  i dont know that is what is troubling me you know dear that i am quite content to give up my own work to help you at first of course aunt and i would have stayed here at any rate for a time to keep you company but your uncle has been dead now for more than eight months and time is going on if i were really helping you i would stop if it were five years but in fact i am not helping you in the way we intended  you are helping me netta hilda exclaimed with tears in her eyes how should i have got on through all this sad time if you had not been here to comfort and cheer me  yes but the necessity for that is over you have your friends and though you dont go out yet you often go to lady moultons and some of your other friends and they come to see you  yes and you will never go with me netta nor see them when they come  no dear i have nothing in common with them i do not know the people of whom you talk and should simply sit there uncomfortably so i prefer to be out of it altogether then i really miss my work ever since you came to us some eight years ago i have been teaching eight or ten hours a day i like the work it is immensely interesting and i am happy in seeing my pupils improve  and all this means hilda said sorrowfully you are going to say that it is time for you to go back  no it does not necessarily mean thatthere is an alternative i must either be doing something or go back  but as i said before netta what can we do more than we have done  that is what i have been thinking hilda anyhow i mean to try to do something before i give it up and go to germany again  i warn you netta that i shall be furious if you do that i am my own mistress now for mr pettigrew will let me do as i like now i am nineteen and am quite determined that our old plan shall be carried out and that you shall start an institution like that of professor menzel somewhere near london you have been twelve months away your pupils have already taken to other teachers and there cannot be the least occasion for your assistance in an institution that is now well stocked with teachers while here you could do enormous good anyhow whether you stay or not i shall as soon as all this is settled take a large house standing in its own grounds in some healthy place near london and obtain teachers  well we need not talk of that just yet netta said quietly it will be time enough when i have failed in carrying out my plans  but what are your plans  i have not quite settled myself and when i do i mean to work entirely in my own way and shall say nothing about it until i come to you and say i have succeeded or i have failed  hilda opened her eyes in surprise  but why should i be kept in the dark  because dear you might not approve of my plans netta replied coolly  you are not thinking of doing anything foolish i hope hilda exclaimed  if it were foolish it would be excusable where the counsels of wisdom have failed netta laughed and then more seriously nothing would be foolish if it could possibly lead to the discovery of walters hiding place  that afternoon when hilda drove out with miss purcell to make some calls netta rang the bell and when tom roberts came in she said  i want to have a long talk with you roberts but mind what i say is to be kept a perfect secret between ourselves  yes miss he said in surprise  now sit down she went on we can talk more comfortably so now roberts there is no doubt that we are not making much headway with our search  that we are not miss netta he agreed i did think that we had gained something when we traced him to that house on pentonville hill but it does not seem that anything has come of it after all  then it is quite time that we took some other steps she said decisively  i am ready miss he replied eagerly you tell me what to do and i am game to do it  well there are two or three things i have in my mind first of all i want to be able to watch john simcoe and this pentonville man when they are talking together  yes i understand he said but how is it to be done  that is what i want to find out now in the first place about this house which way did the window look of the room where there was a light  that window was at the side of the house miss a little way round the corner we noticed the light there but there was another window looking out on the front we did not see any light there as the shutters were closed  and you say that the curtains of the other window were pulled very close  yes they crossed each other most of the way down  now the question in my mind roberts is which would be easierto cut a slit in the curtain or to bore a hole in the shutter or to take a brick out carefully from the side wall and then to deepen the hole until we got to the wallpaper and then make a slight hole there  roberts looked at her with astonishment do you really mean it miss  certainly i mean it it seems to me that our only chance of ever finding walter is to overhear those mens talk  then miss i should say that the simplest way would be to cut a window pane out  yes but you see it is pretty certain that that curtain will not be drawn until they come in and they would notice it at once if we took out a pane in the front window the shutter would prevent our seeing or hearing and the man would be sure to notice the pane was missing as he walked up from the gate to the house  i should say miss that the best plan would be for me to manage to get into the house some time during the day and to hide in that room under the table or sofa or somewhere and listen to them  she shook her head  in the first place roberts you would certainly be murdered if they found you there  i would take my chance of that miss and you may be sure that i would take a brace of the generals pistols with me and they would not find it such easy work to get rid of me  that may be so netta said but if in the struggle you shot them both our last chance of ever hearing of walter would be gone you yourself might be tried for murder and it would be assumed of course that you were a burglar for the explanation that you had broken into the house only to hear a conversation would scarcely be believed moreover you must remember that we dont know how often these men meet simcoe has not been there since you tracked him there six months ago and the only thing we have since found out is that the man i saw him with in the park is the man who lives in that house it would never do for you to make an entrance into the house night after night and week after week to run the risk of being detected there or seized as you entered or caught by the police as a burglar no as far as i can see the only safe plan is to get out a brick very carefully in the side wall and to make a hole behind it through the paper it might be necessary to make an entry into the house before this was done so as to decide which was the best spot for an opening a great deal would depend upon the paper in the room if it is a light paper with only a small amount of pattern upon it any hole large enough to see through might be noticed if it is a dark paper well covered a hole might be made without any fear of its catching the eye you see it must be a rather large hole for supposing the wall is only nine inches thick a person standing outside could not see what was passing inside unless the hole were a good size  but i doubt much if you would be able to hear them miss netta  no i dont think that i should especially as people talking of things of that sort even if they had no great fear of being overheard would speak in a low voice but that would not matter if i could see their faces i should know what they were saying  roberts did not think it right to offer any remark on what appeared to him to be impossible and he confined himself to saying in a respectful voice indeed miss netta  i am stonedeaf she said but have learned to read what people are saying from the movement of their lips  although the indeed miss was as respectful as before netta saw that he did not in the slightest degree believe her  just go to the other end of the room roberts and make some remark to yourself move your lips in the same way as if you were talking but do not make any sound  roberts with military obedience marched to the other end of the room placed himself in a corner and turned round facing her his lips moved and confident that she could not know what he was saying he expressed his natural sentiments  the girl at once repeated the words well im jiggered this is a rum start miss netta has gone clean off her head  roberts jaw dropped and he flushed up to the hair  i am sure he began but he was stopped by the girls merry laugh  do not apologize roberts it was natural enough that you should be surprised well you see i can do as i say we will now go on with our talk  greatly abashed tom roberts returned to the chair murmuring to himself as he sat down well im blowed when he was roughly recalled to the necessity of keeping his mouth shut by her quiet remark never mind about being blowed at present roberts let us talk over another plan who are the keepers of the house in jermyn street  it is kept by a man and his wife miss he has been a butler i believe and his wife was a cook he waits upon the gentlemen who lodge there and she cooks they have a girl who sweeps and does the bedrooms and the scrubbing and that sort of thing  what sort of a girl is she roberts  she seems a nice sort of young woman miss andrew has spoken to her more than i have because you see my getup aint likely to take much with a young girl  i suppose she is not very much attached to her place  lor no miss she told andrew that she was only six months up from the country and they dont pay her but eight pounds a year and pretty hard work she has to do for it  well roberts i want to take her place  you want and roberts voice failed him in his astonishment  yes i want to take her place roberts i should think that if you or andrew were to tell her that you have a friend up from the country who wants just such a place and is ready to pay five pounds to get one she might be ready to take the offer especially as you might say that you knew of a lady who is in want of an underhousemaid and you thought that you could get her the place  as to that miss i have no doubt that she would leave tomorrow if she could get five pounds she told andrew that she hated london and should go down home and take a country place as soon as she had saved up money to do so  all the better roberts then all she would have to do would be to say that she had heard of a place near home and wanted to leave at once she did not wish to inconvenience them but that she had a cousin who was just coming up to london and wanted a place and that she would jump at it she could say that her cousin had not been in service before but that she was a thorough good cleaner and hard worker  and do you mean that you would go as a servant miss netta why it would not be right for you to do so  anything would be right that led to the discovery of walters hiding place roberts i have been accustomed to teaching and i have helped my aunt to look after the house for years and i do not in the slightest degree mind playing the part of a servant for a short time in order to try and get at the bottom of this matter you think that it can be managed  i am sure it can be managed right enough miss but what miss covington would say if she knew that i had a hand in bringing it about i cant say  well you wont be drawn into the matter i shall say enough to my aunt to satisfy her that i am acting for the best and shall simply when i go leave a note for your mistress telling her that i have gone to work out an idea that i have had in my mind and that it would be no use for her to inquire into the matter until she hears of me again  what am i to tell andrew miss  simply tell him that a young woman has been engaged to watch simcoe in his lodgings then tell him the story he has to tell the girl i shall want three or four days to get my things ready i shall have to go to a dressmakers and tell her that i want three or four print gowns for a young servant about my own figure and as soon as they are ready i shall be ready too  well miss i will do as you tell me but i would say quite respectful i hope that you will bear in mind if things goes wrong that i was dead against it and that it was only because you said that it was our only chance of finding master walter that i agreed to lend a hand  i will certainly bear that in mind netta said with a smile talk it over with andrew tonight but remember he is only to know that a young woman has been engaged to keep a watch on simcoe  he will be glad enough to hear miss that someone else is going to do something he says the colonel is so irritable because he has found out so little that there is no bearing with him  the colonel is trying netta laughed as you know he comes here two or three times a week and puts himself into such rages that as he stamps up and down the room i expect to hear a crash and to find that the diningroom ceiling has fallen down he is a thoroughly kindhearted man but is a dreadful specimen of what an english gentleman may come to after he has had the command of an indian regiment for some years and been accustomed to have his will obeyed in everything it is very bad for a man  it is a good deal worse for his servant miss tom roberts said in a tone of deep sympathy for his comrade i doubt whether i could have stood it myself but though andrew expresses his feelings strong sometimes i know that if you offered him a good place even in buckingham palace he would not leave the colonel  two days later netta heard that the girl in jermyn street had joyfully accepted the offer and had that morning told her master that she had heard that she was wanted badly at home and that a cousin of hers would be up in a day or two and would she was sure be very glad to take her place the master agreed to give her a trial if she looked a clean and tidy girl  i shall be clean and tidy roberts and i am sure i shall do no injustice to her recommendation  roberts shook his head the matter was to his mind far too serious to be joked about and he almost felt as if he were acting in a treasonable sort of way in aiding to carry out such a project  on the following monday hilda on coming down to breakfast found a note on the table she opened it in haste seeing that it was in nettas handwriting and her eyes opened in surprise and almost dismay as she read       my darling hilda i told you that i had a plan well i am off to      carry it out it is of no use your asking what it is or where i am      going you will hear nothing of me until i return to tell you      whether i have failed or succeeded aunt knows what i am going to      do  hilda at once ran upstairs to miss purcells room  where has netta gone she exclaimed her letter has given me quite a turn she says that you know but i feel sure that it is something very foolish and rash  i thought that you had a better opinion of nettas common sense miss purcell said placidly smiling a little at hildas excitement it is her arrangement dear and not mine and i am certainly not at liberty to give you any information about it i do not say that i should not have opposed it in the first instance had i known of it but i certainly cannot say that there is anything foolish in it and i admit that it seems to me to offer a better chance of success than any plan that has yet been tried i dont think there is any occasion for anxiety about her netta has thought over her plans very carefully and has gone to work in a methodical way she may fail but if so i dont think that it will be her fault  but why could she not tell me as well as you hilda asked rather indignantly  possibly because she did not wish to raise hopes that might not be fulfilled but principally i own because she thought you would raise objections to it and she was bent upon having her own way she has seconded you well my dear all through this business  yes i know aunt she has been most kind in every respect  well my dear then dont grudge her having a little plan of her own  i dont grudge her a bit hilda said impetuously and as you are quite satisfied i will try to be quite satisfied too but you see it took me by surprise and i was so afraid that she might do something rash and get into trouble somehow you know really i am quite afraid of this man and would certainly far rather run a risk myself than let her do so  of that i have no doubt hilda but i am quite sure that if the case had been reversed you would have undertaken this little plan that she has hit upon to endeavor to relieve her of a terrible anxiety just as she is doing for you  well i will be patient aunt how long do you think that she will be away  that is more than i can tell you but at any rate she has promised to write me a line at least twice a week and should i think it right i can recall her  that is something aunt you cannot guess whether it is likely to be a week or a month  miss purcell shook her head  it will all depend upon whether she succeeds in hitting upon a clew as to where walter is if she finds that she has no chance of so doing she will return if on the other hand she thinks that there is a probability that with patience she will succeed she will continue to watch and wait  miss netta is not ill i hope miss roberts said when he came in to clear the breakfast things away  no she has gone away on a short visit hilda replied had she been watching the old soldiers face she might have caught a slight contortion that would have enlightened her as to the fact that he knew more than she did about the matter but she had avoided looking at him lest he should read in her face that she was in ignorance as to nettas whereabouts she would have liked to have asked when she went whether she took a box with her and whether she had gone early that morning or late the evening before but she felt that any questions of the sort would show that she was totally in the dark as to her friends movements in fact netta had walked out early that morning having sent off a box by the carrier on the previous saturday when hilda was out roberts having himself carried it to the receiving house  it was four or five days before dr leeds called again  is miss purcell out he asked carelessly when some little time had elapsed without her making her appearance  is that asked innocently dr leeds hilda said quickly  the doctor looked at her in genuine surprise  innocently miss covington i dont think that i quite understand you  i see doctor that i have been in error i suspected you of being an accomplice of nettas in a little scheme in which she is engaged on her own account and she then told him about her disappearance of the letter that she had received and of the conversation with her aunt dr leeds was seriously disturbed  i need hardly say that this comes as a perfect surprise to me miss covington and i say frankly a very unpleasant one but the only satisfactory feature is that the young ladys aunt does not absolutely disapprove of the scheme whatever it is although it is evident that her approval is by no means a warm one this is a very serious matter i have the highest opinion of your friends judgment and sense but i own that i feel extremely uneasy at the thought that she has so to speak pitted herself against one of the most unscrupulous villains i have ever met whose past conduct shows that he would stop at nothing and who is playing for a very big stake it would be as dangerous to interfere between a tiger and his prey as to endeavor to discover the secret on which so much depends  i feel that myself doctor and i own that im exceedingly anxious aunt has had two short letters from her both are written in pencil but the envelope is in ink and in her usual handwriting i should think it probable that she took with her several directed envelopes the letters are very short the first was i am getting on all right aunt and am comfortable too early to say whether i am likely to discover anything pray do not fidget about me nor let hilda do so there is nothing to be uneasy about the second was as nearly as possible in the same words except that she said you and hilda must be patient rome was not built in a day and after so many clever people have failed you cannot expect that i can succeed all at once  that is good as far as it goes the doctor said but you see it does not go very far it is not until success is nearly reached that the danger will really begin i do not mind saying to you that miss purcell is very dear to me i have not spoken to her on the subject as i wished to see how my present partnership was likely to turn out i am wholly dependent upon my profession and until i felt my ground thoroughly i determined to remain silent you can imagine therefore how troubled i am at your news were it not that i have such implicit confidence in her judgment i should feel it still more but even as it is when i think how unscrupulous and how desperate is the man against whom she has singlehanded entered the lists i cannot but be alarmed  i am very glad at what you have told me doctor i had a little hope that it might be so it seemed to me impossible that you could be living for four months with such a dear girl without being greatly attracted by her of course i know nothing of her feelings the subject is one that has never been alluded to between us but i am sure that no girl living is more fitted than she is to be the wife of a medical man i would give much to have netta back again but miss purcell is obdurate she says that knowing as she does what netta is doing she does not think that she is running any riskat any rate none proportionate to the importance of finding a clew to walters hiding place  will you ask her if she will write to her niece and urge her to return saying how anxious you are about her or if she will not do that whether she will release her from her promise of secrecy so that she may let us know what she is doing  i will go and ask her now i will bring her down so that you can add your entreaties to mine doctor  but miss purcell refused to interfere  i consider nettas scheme to be a possible one she said though i am certainly doubtful of its success but she has set her heart upon it and i will do nothing to balk her i do not say that i am free from anxiety myself but my confidence in nettas cleverness and i may say prudence is such that i believe that the risk she is running is very slight it would be cruel and i think wrong at the present moment when above all things it is necessary that her brain should be clear to distress and trouble her by interfering with her actions  perhaps you are right miss purcell the doctor said thoughtfully being totally in the dark in the matter i am not justified in giving a decisive opinion but i will admit that it would not conduce either to her comfort or to the success of her undertaking were we to harass her by interfering in any way with her plan which i have no doubt has been thoroughly thought out before she undertook it no one but a madman would shout instructions or warnings to a person performing a dangerous feat requiring coolness and presence of mind such i take it is the scheme whatever it is in which she is engaged and as you are the only one who knows what that scheme is i must however reluctantly abide by your decision when miss covington tells you the conversation that we have had together you will recognize how deeply i am interested in the matter     chapter xviii  down in the marshes   comparatively few of those who nowadays run down to southend for a breath of fresh air give a thought to the fact that the wide stretch of low country lying between the railroad and the thames from pitsea to leigh was at one time and that not so many centuries back a mud flat a continuation of the great line of sand that still with but a short break here and there stretches down beyond yarmouth still less that were it not for the watchfulness of those who dwell upon it it would in a short time revert to its original condition the country lying below the level of higher water  along the whole face of the river run banksthe work doubtless of engineers brought over by dutch williamstrong massive and stonefaced as they need be to withstand the rush and fret of the tide and the action of the waves when as is often the case the east wind knocks up ridges of short angry water in sea reach similarly the winding creeks are all embanked but here dams of earth are sufficient to retain within its bounds the sluggish water as it rises and falls standing on any of these the farmhouses and little homesteads lie below their eaves for the most part level with the top of the bank though there are a few knolls which rise above the level of the tidal water  the most conspicuous objects are the brown sails of the barges which seem to stand up in the midst of the brownishgreen fields the hulls being invisible this cannot be called marsh land for the ground is intersected by ditches having sluices through which they discharge their water at low tide very fertile is the land in some spots notably in canvey island where there are great stretches of wheat and broad meadows deep with rich waving grass but there are other places where the grass is brown and coarse showing that though the surface may be hard and dry water lies not far below here a few cattle gather a scanty living and the little homesteads are few and far between most of the houses are placed near the banks of the creeks the barges serve as their wagons and carry their hay up to london and bring down manure and other things required or carry coal and lime to the wharves of pitsea  a rare place was this in the old smuggling days and indeed until quite lately the trade was carried on though upon a reduced scale vessels drifting slowly up the river would show a light as they passed a barge at anchor or a bawley hanging to its trawl a light would be shown in answer and a moment later a boat would row off to the ship and a score of tubs or a dozen bales of tobacco be quickly transferred and before morning the contents would be stowed in underground cellars in some of the little farmhouses on the creeks or be hidden away in the leigh marshes  will bill be in tonight with the barge a child asked a woman as he came down from the bank to a not uncomfortablelooking homestead ten yards from its foot  i told you that you are to call him uncle the woman said sharply but not unkindly i have told you so over and over again child  i generally do now but one forgets sometimes  there is never any sayingthe woman went on in reply to his questionthere is never any saying it all depends on tide and wind sometimes they have to anchor and lose a tide or maybe two sometimes they get a cargo directly they get into the pool or at rochester sometimes they wait two or three days they have been away four days now they might have been here yesterday but may not come till tomorrow one thing is certain whenever he do come he will want something to eat and i hope that they will bring it with them for there is nothing here but bread and bacon  and do you think that i shall soon go home again aunt  there is no saying the woman said evasively you are very comfortable here aint you  oh yes there are the dogs and the ducks and the chickens and uncle says that he will take me sometimes for a sail with him in the barge  yes i expect it wont be long first you know i used to go with him regular till as i have told you my little billy fell overboard one night and we knew nothing of it until he was gone and i have never liked the barge since besides i have plenty to do here but i am going across to rochester very soon its a good place for shopping and i want groceries and little things for myself and more things for you i will take you with me but you will have to promise to be very good and careful  i will be careful the child said confidently and you know that uncle said that when spring comes he will teach me to swim and i shall like that and if i tumble overboard it wont matter he says that when i get a few years older i shall go with him regularly and learn to steer and to manage the sails i shall like that but i should like to go back sometimes to see hilda and netta and my grandpapa  well well my dear we will see about it they cant take you at present i think that they have gone away traveling and may not be back for a long time and mind you know you are not to talk about them just when you are here with me i dont care but you know uncle does not like it and if anyone asks you must say just what he told you that your father and mother are dead and that uncle bill has took you  i shant forget the boy said i never do talk about it before him it makes him angry i dont know why but it does  but he is always kind to you jack  oh yes he is very kind and he often brings me things when he comes back he brought me my dear little kitten pussy where have you hidden yourself puss puss and in answer a little ball of white fur bounded out from behind a chair and the child was soon engaged in a game of romps with it  it is a shame the woman said as she watched them i dont mind the other things but i never liked this i wonder who the poor little chap is by the way he talked when he first came about his home and his nurse and horses and carriages his friends must be rich people bill has never understood why they wanted to get rid of him but i suppose that he was in somebodys way and as he never speaks of his father and mother but only of those two girls and his grandfather who seems to have been an invalid i expect that he must have lost his father and mother before he can remember well he will be right enough here i should miss him dreadful if he were to go away he seems to have taken the place of my little billy and bill takes to him too wonderfully he said the other day that when the boy grew up he would buy a barge a new one of the best kind and that some day it should be the boys own so he wont do so bad after all  a stranger would have wondered at the comfort in the interior of the little farmhouse the land round it was very poor three horseswhich seemed as if they had nothing to do but to nibble the coarse grassand a couple of cows wandered about on a few acres of land inclosed by deep water ditches a score or two of ducks and geese paddled in the mud in the bottom of the creek at low tide or swam about in the water when it was up and a patch of garden ground attended to chiefly by the woman surrounded the cottage but all this would have afforded a scanty living indeed were it not that the master bill nibson was the owner of the mary ann barge an old craft with a somewhat dilapidated sail which journeyed up and down the river with more or less regularity laden for the most part with manure hay lime bricks or coal this he navigated with the aid of a lad of fourteen a waif whose mother a tramp had died by the roadside one bitter cold night four years before bill had been summoned on the coroners jury and had offered to take the boy  i can do with him on board the barge he said he is only a little nipper now but in a year or two he will be useful the boy i have got wants to go to sea and i shant be sorry to get rid of him he is getting too knowing for me altogether  as no one else wanted the boy he was handed over to bill and was now a sharp lad who never having been instructed in the niceties of right and wrong and being especially ignorant that there was any harm in cheating her majestys customs was in all things a useful assistant to his master he had indeed very soon imbibed the spirit not uncommon among the dwellers on the marshes that if managed without detection the smuggling of tobacco and spirits was a meritorious action advantageous to the community at large and hurting no one except that mysterious and unknown entity the queens revenue he was greatly attached to bill and took an occasional thrashing as a matter of course regarding him as having saved him from the workhouse and having put him in a fair way of making a man of himself  the next day at twelve oclock the child playing on the bank ran in and reported that joshua was coming along the bank and in a few minutes the boy appeared  morning missis he said master sent me on to say that the barge got into the haven this morning and that she will come on with the evening tide he sent me on with this lump of meat and these rokers he got from a bawley which came in just as we were getting up sail off grain spit he says he has got a barrel of beer on board that he will land as he passes he will be along about nine oclock well jack how are you  i am all right the child said and so is kitty i am glad that you are back how long are you going to stay  i suppose that it will take us a couple of days to unload master is going as usual to hire a couple of men to get the line out so i shall be over here by breakfast he says that i may as well do a job of digging in the garden as he wants to get some things in before we get frosty nights have you any message for him missis  you can tell him he may as well get a dish of eels from one of the dutchmen there i suppose there is one in the haven  two of them missis he will be able to get them for one of them is the marden and the skipper has always let master have some though he wont sell an eel to anyone else  is there any business to be done the woman asked significantly  the boy nodded  all right tell him that i will get the horses in  the child was put to bed upstairs at seven oclock although he in vain petitioned to be allowed to stop up until the barge came along he already knew however by experience that his request was not likely to be granted as when the barge came along after dark he was always put to bed the woman telling him that bill didnt like him to be up when he came in as he wanted to have a talk with her in quiet and to eat his supper in peace  an hour after dark the woman went out onto the bank and listened in a quarter of an hour she heard the rattle of a block in the distance she went down stirred up the fire and put on the kettle and in twenty minutes the barge came along the boat instead of towing behind as usual was alongside  you take her on joshua its owner said as he quietly got into the boat run in where the water is deep alongside a quarter of a mile this side pitsea i will come along and get on board there as soon as i have finished this job keep a sharp lookout on the banks some of the coastguardsmen may be about if they hail you and ask if i am on board say i landed as we passed here to have a cup of tea and that i shall not be five minutes  then he pushed the boat to shore well betsy how are you i have got twenty kegs here and five or six hundredweight of tobacco i will get it up the bank and you had better stow it away at once i will lend you a hand as soon as it is all up  as fast as he could carry the kegs up the banks she slipped slings round them two at a time hooked them to a milkmaids yoke and went off with them to a shed which served as a stable and cowhouse in the winter against this was a rick of hay putting the kegs down she returned for more and by the time that they were all in the stable her husband had finished his share of the work and had carried the heavy bales of tobacco to the shed the three horses were already there  are you going to take them out at once  no not until i come back i must get on board the barge as soon as possible we will bundle them all in in case any of those fellows should come along  three planks were removed from the side of the shed next to the stack and an opening was seen some turf was taken up and a trapdoor exposed the kegs and tobacco were speedily carried down into a large cellar the trapdoor was closed and the boards placed securely in position and fastened by six long screws then they returned to the house the teapot and cups were on the table the kettle was boiling and in two or three minutes they were taking tea scarcely had they begun their meal when there was a knock at the door bill got up and opened it and two coastguards entered  we saw there was a light burning and thought that you might be here bill the wind is bitter cold  come in and have a cup of tea or a glass of rum whichever you like best as you say the wind is bitter cold and i thought that i would land and have a cup of tea i shall catch the barge up before she gets to pitsea  the coastguardsmen accepted the offer of a cup of tea glancing furtively round the room as they drank it  it is good tea  tis that bill said and it has never paid duty i got it from an indiaman that was on the nore three weeks ago she transshipped part of her cargo on my barge and floated next tide it was one of the best jobs ive had for some time and stood me in fifty pounds and a pound or two of tea  perhaps a chest of it one of the men said with a laugh  well well i am not sure that it was not a chest i like my cup of tea and so does betsy and there is no getting tea like this at stanford  they chatted for about ten minutes when bill remarked i must be going and they went out together and taking his place in his boat he rowed up the creek while the coastguards continued their walk along the bank  he is not a bad un tom one of them said i guess he is like a good many of the others runs a keg occasionally however his place has been searched half a dozen times and nothing has been found we have drunk many a glass of ale with him at the lobster smack at hole haven and i am sure i dont want to catch him unless there is some information to go on the barge passed us half an hour ago and i knew that it was no use looking in her but of course when the boatswain said this afternoon just follow that barge when she gets under way and see if she goes on to pitsea we had to do it but the boat was late for us where the creek branches off round the island and before we were across he must have got more than half an hours start of us and i am not sorry tom we have got to do our duty but we dont want to be at war with every good fellow on the marshes  right you are dick besides they are as slippery as eels who can tell what they have got under their lime or manure short of unloading it to the bottom there would be no finding it if they had anything and it is a job that i should not care for besides there aint no place to empty it on and we could not go and chuck a cargo overboard unless we were quite certain that we should find something underneath as you say i dare say bill runs a keg or two now and then but i dont suppose that he is worse than his neighbors i have always suspected that it was he who left a keg of whisky at our door last christmas  in the meantime bill had overtaken his barge and they soon had her alongside of the little wharf at pitsea  tide is just turning she will be aground in half an hour he said as soon as you have got these mooring ropes fastened you had better fry that steak and have your supper i shall be over by seven oclock in the morning if harvey and wilson come alongside before that tell them they can have the job at the usual price and can set to work without waiting for me it will be pretty late before i am in bed tonight  it was over a mile walk back to his cottage as soon as he arrived he sat down to a hearty supper which his wife had prepared for him he then got three packsaddles out of the cellar put them on the horses and fastened four kegs on each horse tying one behind the other he started and in an hour the kegs were stowed in the cellars of four farmers near stanford it was midnight before he returned home at halfpast six he was down to breakfast  well uncle how are you he asked the child who was already up  i am not your uncle the boy replied you are my uncle  ah well its a way of speaking down here it does not mean that anyone is ones uncle it is just a way of speaking  the child nodded he was learning many things  then it is a way of speaking when i call you uncle  no no that is different a child like you would not call anyone uncle unless he was uncle while a man my age calls anyone uncle  that is funny isnt it  well i suppose when you think of it it is but as i said it is a way we have in this part of the country well mother have you got that fish nearly fried  it will be ready in five minutes this roker is a very thick one i put it on as soon as i heard you stirring and it is not quite ready yet that was a pretty near escape last night bill  yes but you see they can hardly catch us unless they send men down in the afternoon they cannot get along from the station without passing two or three creeks and coming along with the tide especially when there is a breath of wind to help her we can do it in half the time you see i always get the things out from under the cargo and into the boat as we come along so that the barge shall not be stopped  but they might send down a boat from the thames haven station bill  yes but then they dont know when the barge is in or when it is going to start so we get the best of them in that way besides they have a good bit to go along the river face and they have to cross a dozen deep cuts to get there no i have no fear of them nor of the others either as far as that goes i have more than once had a word dropped meant to put me on my guard and instead of landing the things here have dropped them in a deep hole in the creek where i could pick them up the next night i came in things have changed with us for the better lass five years ago we had pretty hard work with the farm and the old boat to live at all comfortable but since i have got into the swim things have changed with us and i can tell you that i am making money hand over fist i allow that there is a certain risk in it but after all one likes it all the better for that if the worst came to the worst they could but confiscate the old barge if they gave me a heavy fine i could pay it and if they gave me six months i could work it out and buy a new barge and half a dozen farms like this on the day i came out  but the other would be more serious bill  well yes but i dont see any chance of that being found out a gent comes to me at a spot we have settled on say on the road halfway between pitsea and stanford he hands me a box sometimes two i puts them on one of the horses and rides over here with them then i stows them away in that secret place off the store where there aint a shadow of a chance of the sharpesteyed coastguardsman ever finding them they would be too delighted to light on the spirits and bacca to think of digging up the floor underneath there they lie till i take them down to the marden they put them into the eel tank and next morning off she sails  but you have had heavy cases brought once or twice  only onceheavy enough to be troublesome ten cases there was then each as heavy as a man could lift it took me three journeys with three horses and i had to dig a big hole in the garden to bury them till the marden had got rid of her eels and was ready to sail again yes that was a heavy job and i got a couple of hundred pounds for my share of the business i should not mind having such a job twice a week a few months of that and i could buy the biggest farm on this side of essexthat is to say if i could make up my mind to cut it and settle down as a farmer  you will never do that bill but you might settle down in rochester and buy half a dozen barges with a tiptop one you would sail yourself you might have a couple of men and a cabin forward and a nice roomy place for yourself and me aft and you could just steer when you liked or sit down and smoke your pipe and watch her going through the fleet as we worked through the swatchway that would be more your sort bill and mine too i know you have money enough laid by to get such a barge  that is so betsy i allow that i could do that i have been thinking of it for some time but somehow or other one never works ones self up to the right point to give it all up of a sudden and cut the old place well i suppose one of these days i shall do it if it is only to please you  it would please me you know bill i dont see no harm in running the kegs or the baccaits what the people about here have been doing for hundreds of yearsbut i dont like this other business you dont know what is in the cases and you dont ask but there aint much difficulty in guessing and i dont much like this business of the child i did not like it at all at first but when i found that he had no father nor mother as he knew of and so it was certain that no one was breaking their heart about him i did not mind it and i have taken to him and he has pretty nearly forgotten about his home and is as contented as if he had been here all his life i have nothing more to say about him though it is as certain as eggs is eggs that it has been a bad business the boy has been cheated out of his money and if his friends ever find him it is a nice row that we shall get into  you need not bother yourself about that the man said he aint more likely to be found here than if he was across the seas in ameriky we have had him near nine months now and in another three months if you were to put him down in front of his own house he would not know it everyone about here believes as he is my nevvy the son of a brother of yours who died down in the midlands and left him motherless no one asks any questions about him now no more than they does about joshua no no we are all right there missis and the hundred pounds that we had down with him and fifty pounds a year till he gets big enough to earn his own grub on the barge all helps anyhow if something should happen to me before i have made up my mind to quit this you know where the pot of money is hidden you can settle in rochester and get him some schooling and then apprentice him to a bargeowner and start him with a barge of his own as soon as he is out of his time you bear it in mind that is what i should like done  i will mind she said quietly but i am as likely to be carried to the churchyard as you are and you remember what i should like and try bill if you give up the water yourself to see that he is with a man as doesnt drink most of the things we hears ofof barges being run down and of men falling overboard on a dark nightare just drink and nothing else you are not a man as drinks yourself you take your glass when the barge is in the creek but i have never seen you the worse for liquor since you courted me fifteen years ago and i tell you there is not a night when you are out on the barge as i dont thank god that it is so i says to myself when the wind is blowing on a dark night he is anchored somewheres under a weather shore and he is snug asleep in his cabin there is no fear of his driving along through it and carrying on sail there is no fear of his stumbling as he goes forward and pitching over and no one but myself knows what a comfort it is to me you bring him up in the same way bill you teach him as it is always a good thing to keep from liquor though a pint with an old mate aint neither here nor there but that he might almost as well take poison as to drink down in the cabin  i will mind missis i like the child and have got it in my mind to bring him up straight so let us have no more words about it     chapter xix  a partial success   netta had been away three weeks when one morning just as they were sitting down to breakfast she suddenly came into the room with a cry of joy hilda ran into her arms  you wicked wicked girl she exclaimed i know that i ought not to speak to you you dont deserve that i should even look at you but i cannot help it  miss purcell embraced her niece more soberly but hilda saw by the expression of her face that her nieces return relieved her of a burden of anxiety which at times she had had difficulty in concealing  in the first place netta before i even give you a cup of tea tell me if this is a final return or whether you are going to disappear again  that we will decide after you have heard my story netta said quietly  and have you got any news of walter  i am not sure i think so so you have kept my secret aunt  i promised that i would dear and of course i have kept my word though it was very difficult to resist hildas pleading dr leeds too has been terribly anxious about you and not a day has passed that he has not run in for a few minutes to learn if there was any news  i dont see why he should have known that i have been away  why my dear hilda said coming here as often as he does he naturally inquired where you were and as i was uncertain how long you would be away and as he had always been in our counsels i could hardly keep him in the dark even had i wished to do so now my dear let us know all about it there can be no possible reason for keeping silent any longer  well hilda the whole affair has been very simple and there was not the least occasion for being anxious i simply wanted to keep it quiet because i felt that you would raise all sorts of objections to the plan we had as you know thought over a great many methods by which we might overhear a conversation between john simcoe and the man on pentonville hill but it seemed next to be impossible that it could be managed there suddenly the idea came into my brain that as a servant at simcoes lodgings in jermyn street i might have an excellent chance  hilda gave an exclamation of horror  my dear netta you never can really have thought of carrying this out  i not only thought of it but did it with a little management the girl there was got hold of and as it fortunately happened that she did not like london and wanted to take a country situation there was very little difficulty and she agreed to introduce me as a friend who was willing to take her place of course it took a few days to make all the arrangements and to get suitable clothes for the place and these i sent by parcel delivery and on the morning of the day that the girl was to leave presented myself at the house the man and his wife were good enough to approve of my appearance they had it seemed three sets of lodgers one on each floor the man himself waited upon them and my work was to do their rooms and keep the house tidy generally  again hilda gave a gasp  there was nothing much in that netta went on without heeding her i used to do most of the house work when we were in germany and i think that i gave every satisfaction of course the chief difficulty was about my deafness i was obliged to explain to them that i was very hard of hearing unless i was directly spoken to mr johnstone always answered the bells himself when he was at home of course when he was out it was my duty to do so when i was downstairs it was simple enough for i only had to go to the door of the room of which i saw the bell in motion at first they seemed to think that the difficulty was insuperable but i believe that in other respects i suited them so well that they decided to make the best of it and when her husband was out and i was upstairs mrs johnstone took to answering the door bells or if a lodger rang which was not very often for her husband seldom went out unless they were all three away she would come upstairs and tell me johnstone himself said to me one day that i was the best girl he had ever had and that instead of having to go most carefully over the sitting rooms before the gentlemen came in for breakfast he found that everything was so perfectly dusted and tidied up that there was really nothing for him to do  but oh hilda i never had the slightest idea before how untidy men are the way they spill their tobacco ash all over the room and put the ends of their cigars upon mantelpieces tables and everywhere else you would hardly believe it the ground floor and the second floor were the worst for they very often had men in of an evening and the state of the rooms in the morning was something awful our man was on the first floor and did not give anything like so much trouble for he almost always went out in the evening and never had more than one or two friends in with him one of these friends was the man we saw with him in the row and who we had no doubt was an accomplice of his he came oftener than anyone else very often coming in to fetch him as he was always in evening dress i suppose they went to some club or to the theater together i am bound to say that his appearance is distinctly that of a gentleman  i had taken with me two or three things that i foresaw i should want among them was an auger and some corks of a size that would exactly fit the hole that it would make simcoes bedroom communicated with the sitting room and he always used this door in going from one room to the other and it was evident that it was only through that that i could get a view of what was going on i did not see how i could possibly make a hole through the door itself it was on one side next to that where the fireplace was and there was a window directly opposite and of course a hole would have been noticed immediately the only place that i could see to make it was through the door frame its position was a matter of much calculation i can assure you the auger was half an inch bore i dared not get it larger and it would have been hopeless to try and see anything with a smaller one especially as the hole would have to be four or five inches long as i sometimes went into the room when they were together either with hot water or grilled bones or something of that sort i was able to notice exactly where the chairs were generally placed simcoe sat with his back to the bedroom door and the other man on the other side of the hearthrug facing him i therefore decided to make the hole on the side nearest to the wall so that i could see the other man past simcoe of course i wanted the hole to be as low as possible as it would not be so likely to be noticed as it would were it higher up i chose a point therefore that would come level with my eye when i was kneeling down  at about four oclock in the afternoon they always went out and from then till six johnstone also took his airing and i went upstairs to turn down the beds and tidy up generally it was very seldom that any of them dined at home i therefore had that two hours to myself i got the line the hole should go by leaving the door open fastening a stick to the back of a chair till it was as nearly as i could judge the height of the mans face tying a piece of string to it and bringing it tight to the point where i settled the hole should start and then marking the line the string made across the frame then there was a good deal more calculation as to the sideslant but ten days ago i boldly set to work and bored the hole everything was perfectly right i could see the head of the stick and the circle was large enough for me to get all the mans face in view of course i had put a duster on the ground to prevent any chips falling onto the carpet  i was a little nervous when i set to work to drill that hole it was the only time that i felt nervous at all i had beforehand drilled several holes in the shelves of cupboards so as to accustom myself to use the auger and it did not take me many minutes before it came through on the other side the corks were of two sizes one fitted tightly into the hole the other could be drawn in or out with very little difficulty i had gone out one day and bought some tubes of paint of the colors that i thought would match the graining of the door frame i also bought a corkscrew that was about an inch and a half shorter than the depth of the hole it was meant to be used by a crosspiece that went through a hole at the top i had got this crosspiece out with some trouble and tied a short loop of string through the hole it had gone through i put the corkscrew into one of the smaller corks and pushed it through until it was level with the frame on the sittingroom side and found that by aid of the loop of string i could draw it out easily then i put one of the larger corks in at the bedroom side of the hole and pushed it in until it was level with that side then i painted the ends of the corks to resemble the graining and when it was done they could hardly be noticed a couple of feet away  i had now nothing to do but to wait until the right moment came it came last night the man arrived about seven oclock johnstone was out and i showed him upstairs simcoe was already dressed and was in the sitting room i lost no time but went into the bedroom where the gas was burning turned down the bed on the side nearest to the door and then went round and with another corkscrew i had ready in my pocket took out the inner cork got hold of the loop and pulled the other one out also even had i had my hearing i could have heard nothing of what was said inside for the doors were of mahogany and very well fitted and johnstone had said one day that even if a man shouted in one room he would hardly be heard in the next or on the landing i pushed a wedge under the door so as to prevent its being opened suddenly that was the thing that i was most afraid of i thought that simcoe could hardly move without coming within my line of sight and that i should have time to jump up and be busy at the bed before he could open the door but i was not sure of this so i used the wedge if he tried the door and could not open it he would only suppose that the door had stuck and i could snatch out the wedge and kick it under the bed by the time he made a second effort  kneeling down i saw to my delight that my calculations had been perfectly right i could see the mans face well for the light of the candles fell full upon it they talked for a time about the club and the men they were going to dine with and i began to be afraid that there was going to be nothing more when the man said by the way simcoe i went down to tilbury yesterday what simcoe said of course i could not hear but the other answered oh yes he is all right getting quite at home the man said and has almost ceased to talk about his friends then i saw him rise and at once jumped up and went on turning down the bed lest simcoe should have forgotten something and come in for it however he did not and two or three minutes later i peeped in again the room was all dark and i knew that they had gone then i put my corks in again saw that the paint was all right and went downstairs i told mrs johnstone that if i could be spared i should like to go out for two or three hours this morning to see a friend in service it was the time that i could best be spared i should have finished the sitting rooms by eight oclock and as none of the men have breakfast until about eleven there was plenty of time for me to make the beds after i got back  hilda was crying now her relief that hearing that walter was alive and well was unbounded she had absolutely refused to recognize the body found in the canal but she could not but admit that the probabilities were all against her it was certain that the clothes were his the childs age was about the same the body must have been in the water the right length of time the only shadow of evidence to support her was the hair she had taken the trouble to go to two or three workhouses and found that the coroners assertion that soft hair when cut quite close will in a very short time stand upright was a correct one she kept on hoping against hope but her faith had been yielding especially since nettas absence had deprived her of the support that she obtained from her when inclined to look at matters from a dark point of view  oh netta she cried how can i thank you enough how happy the news has made me and to think that i have been blaming you while you have been doing all this you cannot tell what a relief it is to me i have thought so much of that poor little body and the dread that it was walters after all has been growing upon me i have scarcely slept for a long time  i know dear it was because i saw that though you still kept up an appearance of hope you were really in despair and could tell from your heavy eyes when you came down of a morning that you had hardly slept that i made up my mind something must be done there was no hardship whatever in my acting as a servant for a month or two i can assure you that i regarded it rather as fun and was quite proud of the credit that my master gave me now the question is shall i go back again  certainly not netta you might be months there without having such a piece of luck again at any moment you might be caught listening or they might notice the hole that you made so cleverly besides we have gained a clew now to walters hiding place but even that is as nothing to me in comparison with having learned that he is alive and well and that he has ceased to fret and is becoming contented in his new home we can afford to wait now sooner or later we are sure to find him before i pictured him if still alive as shut up in some horrible cellar now i can be patient i think that we are sure to find him before long  well i think dear miss purcell said quietly that we had better ring the bell and have some fresh tea made everything is perfectly cold for it is threequarters of an hour since it came up  hilda rang the bell and gave the necessary orders  let janet bring the things up roberts and come back yourself when you have given the order i want to send a line to dr leeds you will be delighted to hear that miss purcell has learned at least that walter is alive and well but mind she went on as the old soldier was about to burst out into exclamations of delight you must keep this altogether to yourself it is quite possible that we have been watched as closely as we have been watching this man and that he may in some way learn everything that passes here therefore it must not be whispered outside this room that we have obtained any news  i understand miss i wont say a word about it downstairs  hilda scribbled a line in pencil to the doctor saying that netta was back and that she had obtained some news of a favorable description and that as she knew that at this hour he could not get away she would come over with netta at once to tell him what they had learned and would be in harley street within half an hour of his getting the message  as soon as they had finished breakfast they drove to the doctors they were shown up into the drawing room where dr leeds joined them almost immediately  we are not going to detain you more than two or three minutes hilda said while he shook hands warmly with netta you must come over this evening and then you shall hear the whole story but i thought that it was only fair that netta should have the satisfaction of telling you herself what she had learned  it is very little but so far as it goes it is quite satisfactory dr leeds i heard or rather i saw the man we suspected of being simcoes accomplice say by the way i ran down to tilbury yesterday simcoe then said something but what i could not tell as his face was hidden from me and the man in reply said oh yes he is all right and has almost ceased to talk about his friends now you must be content with that until this evening  i will be content with it the doctor said if you will assure me that you are not going away again if you will not i will stop here and hear the whole story even at the risk of a riot down in my waiting room  no she is not going away doctor she had not quite settled about it when she got back this morning but i settled it for her i will take care that she does not slip out of my sight till after you have seen her and talked it all over  then the matter is finally settled netta said for unless i go in half an hours time i cannot go at all  then i will be patient until this evening  will you come to dinner doctor hilda said i have sent notes off to mr pettigrew and colonel bulstrode to ask them to come as i have news of importance to give them  what will they do netta when they find that you do not come back hilda asked as they drove away  that has puzzled me a good deal i quite saw that if i disappeared suddenly they might take it into their heads that something had happened to me and might go to the police office and say i was missing but that would not be the worst simcoe might guess when he heard that i had gone without notice and left my things behind me that i had been put there to watch him he certainly would not suspect that he could have been overheard for he must know that it would be quite impossible for any words to be heard through the doors still he would be uneasy and might even have the child moved to some other locality so i have written a note which we can talk over when we get in of course they may think that i have behaved very badly in throwing them over like this but it is better that they should do that than they should think there was anything suspicious about it my wages are due tomorrow like the girl i succeeded i was to have eight pounds a year i have left my box open so that the mistress can see for herself that there is none of the lodgers property in it there are two or three print dressesi put on my sunday gown when i came outand the underclothes are all duly marked jane clotworthy  what a name to take netta  yes i do not know how i came to choose it i was thinking what name i would take when clotworthy flashed across my mind i dont think that i ever heard the name before and how i came to think of it i cannot imagine it seemed to me a sort of inspiration so i settled on it at once  now let me see the letter hilda asked as soon as they returned home  i hardly liked to write it netta said it is such a wicked story but i dont see how a person can act as detective without telling stories and at any rate it is perfectly harmless  oh yes it is quite certain netta that you could not write and tell her that you have been in her house in disguise and that having found out what you wanted you have now left her of course you must make up a story of some sort or as you say simcoe would at once suspect that you had been sent there to watch him he might feel perfectly sure that no conversation could have been heard outside the room but he could not be sure that you might not have been hidden under the table or sofa or behind a curtain when so much depends upon his thinking that he is absolutely safe one must use what weapons one can if you have any scruples about it i will write the letter for you  no i do not think the scruples will trouble me netta laughed of course i have had to tell stories and one more or less will not weigh on my mind here is the letter if you can think of any better reason for running away so suddenly by all means let me have it  the letter was written in a sprawling hand and with many of the words misspelt it began       dear mrs johnstone i am afraid you will think very badly of me      for leaving you so sudding after you and mr johnstone have been      so kind to me but who should i meet at my friends but my young      man we were ingaged to be married but we had a quarrel and that      is why i came up to town so sudding we has made it up he only      come up yesterday and is going down this morning and nothing      would do but that i must go down with him and that we should get      married directly he says that as the banns has been published      there aint any occasion to wait and we might be married at the end      of the week as he has got everything ready and is in good      employment so the long and the short of it is mam that i am      going down with him home this afternoon as to the wages that was      due tomorrow of course i forfeit them and sorry i am to give you      troubil by leaving you without a girl my box is not locked plese      look in it and you will see that there aint nothing there that      isnt my own in one corner you will find half a crown wrapped up      in paper plese take that to pay for the carriage of the box the      key is in the lock and i send a labil to tie on  what do you think of that hilda  i think it will do capitally i dont think any better excuse could be made but where will you have the box sent  that is what we must settle together it would not do to send it down to some little village for if the address was unknown it might be sent back again  yes and if john simcoe had any suspicions that the story was a false one he might go down there to make inquiries about jane clotworthy and finding no such name known there and the box still lying at the station his suspicion that he had been watched would become almost a certainty  i should think that reading would be a good place to send to it jane clotworthy luggage office reading then i could go down myself and ask for it and could bring it up by the next train  tom roberts could do that netta there is no reason why you should trouble about it  i think that i had better go myself it is most unlikely that simcoe would send down anyone to watch who took the box away but if he should be very uneasy he might do so he would be sure to describe me to anyone that he sent so that it would be better that i should go myself  i think that your story is so plausible netta that there is no risk whatever of his having any doubts about it but still one cannot be too careful  then i will wind up the letter       begging your pardon for having left you in the lurch so sudding      i remain your obedient servant       jane clotworthy       psi am very sorry       psplese give my respects to mr johnstone and excuse      blots  hilda burst into a fit of laughter as she glanced at the postscript  that will do admirably netta she said now how had we better send it  i should think that your maid had better take it you might tell her to ring at the bell hand it to the woman and come away at once without talking except saying i was told to give you this then she would be well away before mrs johnstone had mastered the contents of the note it had better be sent off at once for by this time they will be getting in a way  i think that i had better send roberts no doubt johnstone himself will be in and will answer the door and he might ask lucy where she came from and i dont want to tell her anything roberts could say that a young woman of his acquaintance down chelsea way asked him to get on a bus and leave it for her he can be trusted if the man does detain him and ask him questions to give sensible answers  the letter was sealed and roberts called up  take a cab and go down with this to jermyn street hilda said i want it left at that house if the man who opens the door asks you who you have brought it from say from a young woman a friend of yours in a place down chelsea way i dont suppose that he will ask any other questions and you had best say goodmorning and saunter off carelessly as if having done your errand you had nothing else on hand of course you wont drive up to the door leave the cab round the corner and come straight back here in it  all right miss he answered  there was a little look of amusement in the mans face as he glanced at netta that did not this time pass unnoticed by his mistress she waited until the door had closed behind him and then turned sharply on her friend  i believe netta you have had roberts in your confidence all the time and while we have all been working ourselves into a fever as to where you could be he has known it all along  one cannot work without accomplices netta laughed it was necessary that someone should make arrangements with the servant there for me to take her place and who could i trust better than roberts i think colonel bulstrodes servant helped in the matter at any rate they managed it capitally between them of course it was roberts who carried my box out that morning you must not be angry with him hilda for keeping it from you i made him promise most faithfully that nothing should induce him to confess  i shant be angry with him netta but you may be sure that i shall give him a little lecture and say that i will have no more meddling on his part except by my express orders it is really annoying you know to think that all this time we were fretting about you there was roberts going about laughing in his sleeve  well you know hilda he has the discovery of walter as much at heart as we have and he has certainly not spared himself in the search for him  no that he has not he is a faithful fellow and i promise you that i wont be too hard on him     chapter xx  a dinner party   it was the first time that anyone had dined at the house in hyde park gardens since general mathiesons death and it seemed strange to hilda when mr pettigrew at her request faced her at the table the gentlemen had all arrived within a minute or two of each other and no word had been said by hilda as to the subject about which she had specially asked them there the table was well lighted and bright with flowers and the lawyer and colonel bulstrode were both somewhat surprised at the cheerful tone in which hilda began to talk as soon as they sat down it was however eight months since the house was first shut up and though all had sincerely regretted the generals death it was an old story now and they were relieved to find that it was evidently not hildas intention to recall the past  during dinner the talk went on as usual and it was not until the servants had left the room that hilda said  now mr pettigrew i have no doubt that both you and colonel bulstrode are wondering what the matter of importance about which i asked you to come here can be it is rather a long story so instead of going upstairs we will stop here my news is great news we have discoveredat least my friend miss purcell has discoveredthat without doubt walter is alive and well  an exclamation of surprise broke from mr pettigrew and the colonel  by gad that is great news indeed the latter exclaimed and i congratulate you most heartily i had quite given up all hope myself and although i would have fought that fellow to the last i never had any real doubt in my mind that the child they fished out of the canal was generals mathiesons grandson  you astonish me indeed mr pettigrew said i own that while i was able to swear that i did not recognize him yet as a reasonable man i felt that the evidence was overpowering the other way though i would not dash your hopes by saying so it appeared to me certain that sooner or later the courts would decide that the provisions of the will must be carried out and so you discovered this miss netta may we ask how you did it  netta wanted her share in the matter to remain a secret mr pettigrew but i told her that was out of the question and that it was quite necessary that you and colonel bulstrode should know the precise facts for that as a lawyer you could not take any action or decide upon any course to be pursued unless you knew the exact circumstances of the case however she asked me as she has given me the whole particulars to tell the story for her when i have done she will answer any questions you may like to ask  hilda then repeated almost word for word the story netta had told her mr pettigrew and the colonel several times broke in with exclamations of surprise as she went on dr leeds sat grave and thoughtful  splendidly done colonel bulstrode exclaimed when she brought her story to an end it was a magnificent idea and it must have needed no end of pluck to carry it out as you did but how by looking at a fellows mouth through a hole you knew what he said beats me altogether  that part was very simple colonel bulstrode netta said quietly i learned it by a new system that they have in germany and was myself a teacher in the institution you may not know perhaps that i am stonedeaf  you are not joking miss purcell are you the colonel said looking at her earnestly why i have talked to you a dozen times and it never struck me that you were in the slightest degree deaf  i am absolutely so as miss covington will tell you and mr pettigrew knows it also fortunately i did not lose my hearing until i was six years old and i had not altogether lost the habit of speaking when i went out to germany three years later had i been born deaf and dumb i could have learned to understand what was said perfectly but should never have spoken in a natural voice  well it is wonderful altogether and i should not have believed it if a stranger had told me however the great thing at present is that you have found out that the child is alive we ought not to be long in laying hands on him now pettigrew eh  i hope not colonel but you must not be too sanguine about that we have evidently very crafty scoundrels to deal with still now that we feel sure that the child is alive and well the matter is a comparatively straightforward one and we can afford to work and wait patiently tilbury is only a bit of a village but beyond that stretch great marshesin fact all south essex as far as the mouths of the rivers crouch blackwater and coln he would say i went down to tilbury because tilbury is the terminus of the railway possibly he may have crossed to gravesend possibly he may have gone inland to upminster or some other village lying in that district or he may have driven down as far as foulness which so far as anybody knows anything about it might be the end of the world therefore there is a wide area to be searched  but he can be followed when he goes down again mr pettigrew  of course my dear that is what must be done though there is no reason why we should not set about inquiries at once but you see it is not so easy to follow a man about country roads as it is in the streets of london no doubt he must drive or ride unless indeed walter is within two or three miles of the station and you may be sure that if he sees a trap coming after him he will not go near the place where the child is possibly again he may not go near the place at all but may meet someone who takes the money for the childs keep it may be a bargeman who sails round to harwich or somewhere along the south coast it may be the steward of a steamer that goes regularly backwards and forwards to france  i dont want to dishearten you my dear he broke off as he saw how hildas face fell as he went on but you see we have not common rogues to deal with their whole proceedings have shown an exceptional amount of coolness and determination although i own that i can see nothing absolutely suspicious in the way that last will was drawn up and signed still i have never been able to divest my mind of an idea that there is something radically wrong about it but putting aside the strange death of your uncle we have the cunning way in which the boy was stolen the complete success with which our search was baffled the daring attempt to prove his death by what we now know must have been the substitution of the body of some other child of the same age dressed in his clothes all this shows how carefully every detail must have been thought out and we must assume that equal care will be shown to prevent our recovering the boy were they to suspect that they had been traced to tilbury and were watched there or that any inquiries were being made in the neighborhood you may be sure that walter would be at once removed some distance away or possibly sent abroad perhaps to australia or the states there could be no difficulty about that there are hundreds of emigrants going out every week with their families who would jump at the offer of a hundred pounds for adopting a child and once away it would be next to impossible ever to come upon his traces so you see we shall need to exercise the most extreme caution in our searches  i see mr pettigrew hilda said quietly that the difficulties are far greater than i ever dreamt of it seemed to me that when we had found out that walter was alive and well and that tilbury was so to speak the starting place of our search it would be an easy matter to find him now i see that except for the knowledge that he is alive we are nearly as far off as ever  i think mr pettigrew is rather making the worst of things miss covington dr leeds said speaking for the first time no doubt the difficulties are considerable but i think we have good heads on our side too as miss purcell has proved and i feel confident that now that we have learned as much as we have done we shall be successful in the end  my opinion colonel bulstrode said is that we ought to give these two fellows in custody as rogues vagabonds and kidnapers then the police will set to work to find out their antecedents and at least while they are shut up they can do no harm gad sir we should make short work of them in india  i am afraid that that would hardly do colonel bulstrode mr pettigrew said mildly we have practically nothing to go upon we have no evidence that a magistrate would entertain for a moment the men would be discharged at once and we should no doubt be served the next morning with a writ for at least ten thousand pounds damages and what is more they would get them and you may be very sure that you would never find the child  then it is shameful that it should be so the colonel said warmly why i served three years as a police officer in india and when i got news that a dacoit for instance was hiding in a jungle near a village down i would go with a couple of dozen of men surround the place and make every man and woman a prisoner then the police would examine them and let me tell you that they have pretty rough ways of finding out a secret of course i knew nothing about it and asked no questions but you may be sure that it was not long before they made someone open his mouth hanging up a man by his thumbs for instance freshens his memory wonderfully you may say that this thorough way of getting at things is not according to modern ideas i dont care a fig for modern ideas and as far as that goes neither do the natives of india my object is to find out the author of certain crimes the villagers object is to shield him if they are obstinate they bring it on themselves the criminal is caught and justice is satisfied what is the use of police if they are not to catch criminals i have no patience with the maudlin nonsense that prevails in this country that a criminal should have every chance of escape he is warned not to say anything that would incriminate himself material evidence is not admitted his wife maynt be questioned why it is downright sickening sir the socalled spirit of fairness is all on the side of the criminal and it seems to me that our whole procedure instead of being directed to punish criminals is calculated to enable them to escape from punishment the whole thing is wrong sirradically wrong and colonel bulstrode wiped his heated forehead with a huge indian silk handkerchief hilda laughed netta smiled and mr pettigrews eyes twinkled  there is a good deal in what you say colonel bulstrode though i cannot go with you in the matter of hanging men up by their thumbs  why sir broke in colonel what is it their own native princes would have stretched them over a charcoal fire until they got the truth out of them  so possibly would our own forefathers colonel  humph they had a lot more common sense in those days than they have now mr pettigrew there was no sentimentality about them they were short and sharp in their measures they were men sirmen they drank like men and they fought like men there was sterling stuff in them they didnt weaken their bodies by drinking slops or their minds by reading newspapers  well colonel bulstrode hilda said smiling if it is not contrary to your convictions we will go upstairs and have a cup of tea no doubt there is something to be said for the old days but there is a good deal to be said on the other side of the question too  when they went upstairs dr leeds sat down by netta  i am afraid that you blame me for what i did dr leeds she said timidly  no i do not blame you at all for doing it but i do think that you ought to have consulted us all before undertaking it your intention was a noble one but the risk that you ran was so great that certainly i should not have felt justified in allowing you to undertake it had i had any voice in the matter  but i cannot see that it was dangerous the girl said he could not have knocked me down and beaten me even if he had caught me with my eye at the peephole he could only have called up johnstone and denounced me as an eavesdropper and at the worst i should only have been turned straight out of the house  i do not think that that would have been at all his course of action i believe on the contrary that although he would have spoken angrily to you he would have said nothing to the lodginghouse keeper he would have at once guessed that you had not taken all this trouble merely to gratify a silly curiosity but would have been sure that you had been employed as a spy what he would have done i do not know but he would certainly have had you watched as you watched him and he would in his conversation with his confederates have dropped clews that would have sent us all off on wildgoose chases i dont think that he would have ventured on getting you removed for he would have known that he would have been suspected of foul play at once by those who had employed you i hope you will give me a promise that you will never undertake any plan without consulting miss covington and myself you can hardly realize what anxiety i have suffered while you have been away  i will promise willingly dr leeds i did not think anything of the danger and do not believe even now there was any but i do think that hilda would not have heard of my going as a servant and that you would not have approved of it still as i saw no harm in it myself i thought that for once i would act upon my own ideas  there are circumstances under which no one need disapprove of a lady acting as a servant he said quietly if a family misfortune has happened and she has to earn her own living i think that there are many who would be far happier in the position of a servant in a good family than as an illpaid and overworked governess the one is at least her own mistress to a large extent as long as she does her work properly the other can never call her time her own in your case certainly the kind object with which you undertook the task was a full justification of it had you not been matching yourself against an unscrupulous villain who had he detected your disguise would have practically hesitated at nothing to rid himself of you it happened too in this case you were one of the few persons who could have succeeded for as you say it would have been next to impossible for anyone unpossessed of your peculiar faculty to have overheard a conversation doubtless conducted in a somewhat low voice through such a hole as you made  then you dont think any worse of me for it  you need not be afraid of that he said quietly my opinion is already so fixed on that subject that i doubt if anything you could do would shake it  then he got up and walked across to where the others were chatting together  now are we to have another council hilda asked  i think not dr leeds said it seems to me that the matter requires a great deal of thinking over before we decide and fortunately as the man went down to tilbury only two days ago he is not likely to repeat his visit for another month at least possibly for another three months men like that do not give away chances and he would probably pay for three months board for the child at a time so as to avoid having to make the journey oftener however confident he might be that he was not watched  i agree with you dr leeds mr pettigrew said it would never do to make a false step  still hilda urged surely there cannot be any need to wait for his going down again a sharp detective might find out a good deal he could inquire whether there was anyone at tilbury who let out traps probably nothing beyond a gig or a ponycart could be obtained there he would of course hire it for a drive to some place within three or four miles and while it was got ready would casually ask if it was often let he might possibly hear of someone who came down from towna bagman perhaps who hired it occasionally for calling upon his customers in the villages round  i think that that is a capital suggestion mr pettigrew said i dont see why while we are thinking over the best way to proceed we should not get these inquiries made they might be of some assistance to us i will send a man down tomorrow or next day as you say it may give us something to go upon  netta went down two days later to reading she had the box labeled to oxford and took a thirdclass ticket for herself she had a suspicion that a man who was lolling on a seat on the platform looked closely at her and she saw him afterwards saunter away towards the luggage office when the train came in her box was put into the van and she got out at the next station and returned by the first train to london feeling satisfied that she would never hear anything more of the box  the next day a detective called who had been engaged earlier in the search for walter and had frequently seen hilda  mr pettigrew said miss covington that i had better come to you and tell you exactly what i have done i went down to tilbury yesterday i took with me one or two cases made up like a travelers samples and i presently found that the man at the public house by the water had a ponytrap which he let i went over to him and said that i wanted it for the day  how far are you going he asked  i am going to stanford i said then by a crossroad by laindon to hornchurch and back  it is rather a long round for one day he said  tis a long round i said well maybe i might sleep at hornchurch and go on to upminster  you will have to pay a deposit of a couple of pounds he said unless you like to take a boy  i said i preferred driving myself and that it was less weight for the pony i suppose you often let it out i remarked  pretty often he said you see there is no way of getting about beyond this it would pay me to keep a better trap if it wasnt that commercials generally work this country in their own vehicles and take the road from barking through dagenham or else from brentwood or chelmsford or one of the other great eastern stations there is one in your line comes occasionally he goes by the same route you are taking and always has the trap to himself he travels for some spirit firm i think he always brings down a couple of cases of bottles  that is my line too i said he hasnt been here lately i hope  well yes he was here three or four days ago he is a pretty liberal chap with his samples i should say for he always comes back with his cases empty of course i hired the pony and trap i drove through new tilbury low street and stanford i put up there for three or four hours at each place i went to all the public houses and as i marked the liquors cheap i got several orders i asked at every place had anyone in my line been round lately and they all said no and nobody had noticed the pony cart but of course that did not prove that he might not have driven through there  you did not make any inquiries about a missing child  no miss covington mr pettigrew particularly told me that i was not to make any inquiries whatever  yes that is what we agreed upon bassett we dont want to run the slightest risk of their suspecting that we are inquiring in that direction my own idea is that you could do no harm if you went round several times just as you did yesterday and perhaps it would be better for you not to start from the same place but to hire a vehicle and drive round the country stopping at all the villages and apparently trying to get orders for spirits or tobacco that idea of yours is an excellent one because your inquiry whether another man had been along in the same trade would seem natural you might say everywhere that you had heard of his going round there but that it did not look much like business driving a rickety little trap with a pony not worth fifty shillings at any village public houses at which he stopped they could hardly help noticing it and if you heard that he had put up there for an hour or two it would certainly be something to go upon and a search round there might lead to a result however do not go until you hear again from me i will talk it over with mr pettigrew and see what he thinks of it  it certainly seems to me that we might light upon a clew that way miss covington and if he were to happen to hear that another man in the same line had been there asking questions about him it would seem natural enough because of course a commercial would like to know what line another in the same branch was following and how he was doing then i will wait your further orders there would be sure to be traps to be hired at barking or rainham and if there are not i could get one at bromley indeed as i should want it for a day or two it would be just as well to get it there as farther east and i should be likely to get a betterlooking turnout in little places a man with a good turnout is more likely to do business than one who looks secondrate altogether it seems a sort of credit to the place and they would give him orders where they would not to a man who made no sort of show i should say miss that as i shall be going over the ground more than once it would be best to send on the goods i get orders for they dont amount to very much and i should get about the same price that i gave for them i know a clerk in the firm whose liquors i took down i told him that i was going down in that part of essex and asked if they would give me a commission on anything that i could sell they said yes willingly enough and the clerk said i was a respectable man who could be trusted and so it will cost nothing and will open the way for my making another call of course when i am known there i can ask questions more freely sit in the barparlor smoke a cigar with the landlord and so on  i think that is an excellent idea well at any rate you shall hear in the course of a day or two  miss purcell had gone on quietly with her knitting and uttered no remarks while the man was present immediately he had left she said i think netta that we shall gradually get at it  yes i think so that man seems really a sharp fellow i had quite lost all faith in detectives but i see that when they have really got something to go upon they know how to follow it up  hilda wrote a long letter to mr pettigrew and received three words in answer by all means so bassett was written to and told to continue his career as a commercial traveler but to abstain altogether for the present from any questions about the boy  ten days later mr pettigrew forwarded a letter that he had received from bassett which was as follows       sir i have to report that i have for the last fortnight been      engaged in driving about the country in accordance with miss      covingtons instructions the only place where i can ascertain that      the pony and cart from tilbury was noticed about that time was at      stanford my inquiries there before had failed but after dining at      the inn i went out into the yard behind and asked the helper      whether the same trap that i drove over in from tilbury had been      there since       not since you were here last he said at least if it was you      as drove the pony over somewhere about three weeks ago i did not      see you then i was doing a job over at the cowhouse that pony      aint been here since then though he was here two days before the      man put him up for three or four hours and hired a horse from the      landlord to ride over to billericay he must have gone cross      country i should say by the mud on its legs however he tipped      me a bob so i cleaned it up and said nothing to master but the      horse was all in a lather and must have been taken along at a      hunting pace all the way waiting further orders       i remain      yours respectfully      h bassett  mr pettigrew came down himself in the evening  well miss covington i think that the scent is getting warm now is the time that you must be very cautious i think we may take it that the child is somewhere within ten or twelve miles of stanford north or east of it the man was away for over three hours and he rode fast its not likely that the horse was anything out of the way however allowing for half an hours stay somewhere i think we may take twelve miles as the limit still a circle of twelve miles radius covers a very large area i have been looking up the map since that man set about inquiring down there twelve miles would include the whole of the marshes as far as leigh it goes up to brentwood billericay downham and touches rayleigh and in that semicircle would be some sixty or seventy villages large and small  i have been looking at the map too mr pettigrew and it does not seem to me at all likely that he would go near the places that you first mentioned they are quite close to the great eastern railway by which he would have traveled instead of going round such an enormous detour by tilbury and stanford  one would think so my dear certainly but you see a man having the least idea that he was watched which i admit we have no reason for believing that this fellow has would naturally choose a very circuitous route however i think that we need hardly try so far to the north to begin with i should say that the area of our search need go no farther north than downham and that between a line running west from that place and the river the child is most likely to be hidden  i should say mr pettigrew that the detective might engage four or five fellows who could act separately in villages on each of the roads running from stanford east or northeast the villages should be at least two miles away from stanford because he might start by one road and then turn off by another but in two miles he would probably settle down on the road he was going to follow and we should therefore get the general direction of walters hiding place then as soon as he passed the watcher should follow him on foot till he met him coming back if he did meet him he would know that at any rate he had been farther if he did not meet him he would know that he had turned off somewhere between him and the village that he had passed netta and i have been talking the matter over and it seems to us that this would be the best plan and that it would be as well also to have a man to watch at tilbury station because he may possibly choose some entirely different route the next time he comes and the men in the villages not knowing that he had come down at all might be kept there for a month waiting for his next visit  you and your friend have certainly put your heads together to good purpose the old lawyer said and i do not see any better plan than you suggest you had better have bassett down here and give him your instructions yourself  yes mr pettigrew and i shall be glad if you will write a line to him tonight for in three days it will be a month since this man last went down or at any rate since we know that he went down of course it may be three months before he goes again and if he does not come in four or five days the men must be recalled for although each of them could stop in a village for a day or two under the pretense of finding work in the neighborhood they certainly could not stop for a month  very well i leave you a free hand in the matter altogether miss covington for frankly i acknowledge that you are vastly more likely to ferret the thing out than i am     chapter xxi  a box at the opera   i tell you what it is simcoe harrison said two months later this affair of yours is getting to be a good deal more troublesome than i bargained for it all looked simple enough one only had to pick up a child drive him in a cab across london then down in a trap to pitsea hand him over to a man i knew would take good care of him and take the payments for him when they became due which would be no trouble as i had to see the man occasionally on my own business of course i expected that there would be a big hue and cry for him but i had no fear whatever of his being found then i managed through another man to get that body from the workhouse undertaker and you managed the rest easily enough but i tell you that the matter is getting a good deal hotter than i ever thought it would  i told you that i had been followed several times after leaving your place and one morning when i went out early i saw footmarks showing that someone had been walking round my house and trying to look in at the windows i have a strong suspicion that i have been followed to my office and i know that someone got in there one day at my dinner hour i know because i always fasten a piece of thread so that if the door is opened it breaks it there is nothing there that anyone could make anything of but it is just as well to know if anyone has been prying about the woman of the house was sure that she had not been in there nor had she let anyone in so the lock must have been picked of course anyone is liable to have his office robbed when he is out and it is empty but nothing was taken and if a common thief had found nothing else he would probably have made off with my dress suit which would have brought him a sov in a secondhand clothes shop  you know i have an excessive objection to being watched i have had nothing on hand lately at any rate nothing that has come off but i might have had you know well yesterday i was going down to see my man in the marshes and to tell him that likely enough i should bring something down to him next week i got out of the train at tilbury and as you know there are not a dozen houses anywhere near the station now i have a habit of keeping my eyes open and i saw a man sitting on an old boat what called my attention particularly to him was that he was turned half round watching the entrance to the station as i came out you can always tell whether a man is watching for someone or whether he is merely looking generally in that direction and this man was certainly watching for someone the instant his eye fell upon me he turned round and stared at the river the path to the public house lay just behind him now it would be natural that hearing a footstep a man doing nothing would look round and perhaps say a wordask the time or something of that sort well he didnt turn round now it is my habit and a very useful one always to carry a glass of about the size of a folded letter in my pocket instead of going on to the public house i turned off from the path and walked away from the river when i had got some little distance i took out my glass and still walking along i held it up so that i could see in it what was going on behind the man was standing up watching me i put the glass in my pocket and dropped my handkerchief i stooped down to pick it up of course partly turning as i did so and saw that he had instantly dropped into a sitting position again with his back to me  that was good enough i turned cut across the fields went straight back to the station and took the next ferryboat to gravesend and came back that way it is quite clear to me that not only is this girl on the track still but the chase is getting to be a very hot one and that not only are they watching you but they are watching me and have in some way or other though how i cannot guess found out that i go down to tilbury and have accordingly sent a man down to follow me now i tell you frankly i will have no more to do with the matterthat is to say as far as going down on your business as i have told you i have always managed my own affairs so well that the police and i have no acquaintance whatever and i am not going to be spied upon and followed and have the tecs upon my track about an affair in which i have no interest at all except that you having stood by my brother i was glad to do you any service i could but this is getting serious i dont like it i have told you i have business with the man and get things off abroad through him that i should have great trouble in getting rid of in any other way but unless in quite exceptional cases these things are so small that they could be hidden away for months without much risk of their being found however sharp the hunt after them might be as i am in no way pressed for money i can afford to wait though i own that i like to get the things off my hands as soon as i can and as i considered that i ran practically no risk in going down with them into essex i never kept them at my house however for a time i must do so i must tell you that when i am going down i always write beforehand and make an appointment for him to have his barge at the wharf at pitsea and i send my letter addressed to him mr william nibson barge mary ann care of mr scholey spotted horse pitsea you had better write to him in future you need not put anything inside the envelope except notes for twentyfive pounds and the words for the childs keep for six months i need not say that you had better disguise your writing both on the envelope and on the inside and it is best that you should get your notes from some bookmaker on a racecourse you tell me you often go to races now and do a little betting they are not the sort of men who take the numbers of the notes they pay out and it would be next to impossible for them to be traced to you  thank you harrison you have behaved like a true pal to me and i am ever so much obliged to you i quite see what you mean and indeed it is as much for my interest as yours that you should not go down there any more confound that girl covington i am sure she is the moving spirit of it all i always felt uneasy about her from the first and was sure that if there was any trouble it would come from her i wonder how the deuce she ever found out that you went down to tilbury  that beats me too simcoe as you may guess i am always most cautious about it and always take a very roundabout way of going to the station  i have been uneasy ever since that girl at our place left so suddenly a fortnight afterwards we found that there was a hole bored through the doorpost of course it might have been bored before i went there but in that case it is curious that it was never noticed before i cannot help thinking that she did it  yes you told me but you said that you tried the experiment and found that when your man and his wife were talking there in a loud voice and you had your ear at the hole you could not catch a single word  yes that was certainly so i could hear them talking but i could not make out a word of their conversation still it is evident that somebody has been trying to hear i cannot help thinking that it was that girl though both johnstone and his wife spoke very highly of her certainly the story she told them was true to a certain extent for when they sent the box down to reading i sent a man down there to watch and she called to fetch it and my man found out that she labeled it oxford and took it away with her on the down train as he had no directions to follow her farther he came back after we found the hole i sent him down again but he never came upon her traces though he inquired at every village near oxford  she may have been put there as a spy the other said but as it is evident that she couldnt hear through that hole it is clear that she could not have done them any good that is i suppose why they called her off so the puzzle still remains how they got on my track at tilbury i should like to have a good look at this covington girl i can admire a clever wench even when she is working against me  there is the huguenots at her majestys tonight the first time this season she very often goes in lady moultons box and it is likely enough that she will go tonight its the third box from the stage on the first tier i will go down to bond street and see if i can get hold of a box opposite on the second or third tier the money will be well laid out for i should very much like you to study her face and i won enough at pool at the club this afternoon to pay for it  very well then i will come round to your place i really am curious to see the girl i only caught a passing glimpse of her in the park that day  simcoe was not wrong in his conjecture for hilda dined at lady moultons and they took their places in the latters box just as the first bar of the overture sounded she was in half mourning now and in black lace with white camellias in her hair and breast was as netta had told her before starting looking her best  that is the girl simcoe exclaimed as she went forward to the front of the box  well there is no denying that she is goodlooking the other said as he turned his glasses upon her there is not a betterlooking woman in the house plenty of selfpossession too he added as hilda took her seat and at once in apparent ignorance that any glasses were upon her took her own lorgnettes from their case and proceeded calmly to scan the stalls and boxes to see who among her numerous acquaintances were there as her eyes fell upon the two men sitting nearly opposite to her her glasses steadied then after a minute she lowered them  lady moulton i regard it as a providence that you brought me here this evening do you see those two men there in the box nearly opposite in the second tier well one of the men is simcoe to whom my uncle left all his property if walter should not live to come of age and who i am absolutely convinced carried the child away  i see them my dear they are staring at you i suppose they are as much interested in you as you in them  hilda again put her glasses to her eyes  she has just told lady moulton who i am simcoe said  she has a clever face simcoebroad across the chinany amount of determination i should say ah there she is getting up to make room for somebody else  stay where you are my dear lady moulton said putting her hand on hildas arm there is plenty of room for three  plenty she replied but i want to watch those two men and i cannot keep my glasses fixed on them while i am sitting in the front row  hardly my dear lady moulton said with a smile well have your own way  a fourth lady came in almost immediately she took the third chair in the front and hilda sitting half in the shade was able to devote herself to her purpose free from general observation she had already heard that simcoes companion had apparently suspected that he was watched and had returned to town at once without speaking to anyone at tilbury she felt that he would probably henceforth choose some other route and the chances of following him would be greatly diminished the opportunity was a fortunate one indeed for months she had been hoping that some day or other she could watch these men talking and now as it seemed by accident just at the moment when her hopes had fallen the chance had come to her  she has changed her place in order to have a better look at us john simcoe said as she moved she has got her glasses on us  we came to stare at her it seems to me that she is staring at us harrison said  well i should think that she knows my face pretty well by this time simcoe laughed i told you she has a way of looking through one that has often made me uncomfortable  i can quite understand that i noticed myself that when she looked at us without her glasses there was a curious intentness in her expression as if she was taking stock of every point about us she cannot be the girl who has been to your lodging  certainly not the other said i know her a great deal too well for her to try that on besides beyond the fact that the other was a goodlooking girl tooand by the way that she had the same trick of looking full in your face when you spokethere was no resemblance whatever between them  the curtain now drew up and silence fell upon the house and the men did not speak again until the end of the first act they then continued their conversation where they had left it off  she has moved and has been attending to the opera simcoe said but she has gone into the shade again and is taking another look at us  i am not given to nervousness but upon my word those glasses fixed upon me make me quite fidgety  pooh man she is not looking at you she is looking at me i dont know whether she thinks that she can read my thoughts and find out where the child is hidden by the way i know nothing about this place pitsea where is it and which is the best way to get there  you can drive straight down by road through upminster and laindon the place lies about three miles this side of benfleet there are only about half a dozen houses at the end of a creek that comes up from hole haven but i should not think of going near the house the latter directed as i told you is sure to find the man  oh i am not thinking of going but i shall get a man to watch the fellows they sent down to watch you and if i find that they seem to be getting on the right track i shall run down at all hazards and take him away  your best plan by far will be to go with him on board nibsons barge up to rochester no doubt he can find some bargeman there who will take the boy in or what would perhaps be better hire a trap there and drive him down to margate or ramsgate there are plenty of schools there and you might get up a yarn about his being a nephew of yours and leave him there for a term or two that would give you time to decide by this time he will have but a very faint remembrance of his life in town and anything that he may say about it will certainly meet with no attention  would it be as well to do it at once do you think simcoe asked  no we have no idea how many people they may have on the watch and it would be only running unnecessary risks stick to the plan that we have already agreed on of communicating only by writing but i think your idea of sending two or three sharp fellows down there to find out what the party are doing is really a good one  hilda lowered her glasses as the curtain rose again oh lady moulton she whispered i have found out all that i have been so long wanting to know i believe now that in three days i shall have the child home again  lady moulton turned half round  how on earth have you found that out hilda are you a wizard indeed who can read mens thoughts in their faces i always thought that there was something uncanny about you ever since that day of my fête  to harrisons relief miss covington did not turn her glass towards him again during the evening when the curtain fell on the next act a gentleman to whom lady moulton had nodded in the stalls came in after shaking hands with her and her friends he seated himself by the side of hilda  miss covington he said i have never had an opportunity of speaking to you since that fête at lady moultons i have understood that the gypsy on that occasion was engaged by you and that there was if you will excuse me saying so some little mystery about it i dont wish to pry into that but if you should ever see the woman again you will oblige me very greatly by telling her that i consider i owe her a deep debt of gratitude she said something to me then that made a tremendous impression upon me and i do not mind telling you it brought me up with a round turn i had been going ahead a great deal too fast and i see now that had i continued on the same course i should have brought absolute ruin upon myself and blighted my life in every way the shock she gave me by warning me what would come if i did not give up cards and racing showed me my utter folly and on that day i swore never to touch a card or lay a penny upon a horse for the rest of my life when i tell you that i have completely pulled myself round and that by the aid of an old uncle to whom i went and made a clean breast of all i am now straight in every way and as you may have heard am going to be married to miss fortescue in a fortnight you may guess what deep reason i have to be grateful to this gypsy woman of yours and how i hope that should you come across her again you will tell her so and should there be any possible way in which i can prove my gratitude by money or otherwise i shall be delighted to do so  i will tell her captain desmond the girl said in a low voice i am sure that it will make her happy to know that she did some good that evening i do not think that she is in need of money or assistance of any kind but should she be so i will let you know  and do you really mean that you have discovered where general mathiesons grandson is living lady moulton asked as they rose to leave their seats when the curtain fell  i think so i am almost sure of it  lady moulton had heard a good deal from hilda as to the situation mr pettigrew had strongly impressed upon both hilda and colonel bulstrode that it was very important that the contents of the will should not be talked about we dont want our private affairs discussed in the press and made the subject of general talk he had said and it was only to lady moulton that hilda had spoken freely of the matter so far as the discovery of the new will the change that had been made and the singularity of walter being missing she had also mentioned her belief that simcoe was at the bottom of this but had breathed no words of her suspicion that the general had come to his death by foul play or of her own conviction that simcoe was an impostor although there had been some talk in the clubs over the matter for colonel bulstrode was by no means so discreet as hilda and among his intimate friends spoke his mind with great vehemence and strength of language as to general mathieson having made so singular a disposition of his property and he made no secret of his suspicion that simcoe was at the bottom of walters disappearance thus the matter had gradually gone the round of the clubs but it was not until simcoes own counsel had drawn from him the fact that walters death would put him into possession of the estate that the public in general learned the facts  it was a clever move mr pettigrew had said talking it over with his partner no doubt he was afraid that the question would be asked by our counsel and he thought that it was better that the fact should come voluntarily from himself his best plan by far was to brazen it out no doubt nine men out of ten will consider that the affair is a very suspicious one and some of them will give him the cold shoulder but whatever their opinions they dare not express them without laying themselves open to an action for libel while on the other hand the fact that a man is heir to a good estate will always cause a good many to rally round him not the best of men you know but enough to prevent his being a lonely figure in a club  yes i think he was certainly well advised to declare his heirship voluntarily instead of having it drawn from him he must have known of course that sooner or later the matter would be made public and it is better for him to get the talk and gossip over now instead of the matter being known for the first time when he begins to take legal steps to compel us to put him into possession of the estate  what on earth did you mean hilda lady moulton said as the door of the carriage was closed and they drove off from her majestys by saying that you had discovered a clew by which you might in a few days find your little cousin  i cannot tell you exactly how i discovered it at present it is a secret that both my mother and uncle charged me to keep but when these troubles are over i will explain it all to you though i should certainly do so to no one else  well i suppose i must be content with that hilda but it certainly does seem extraordinary to me that by merely seeing two men in a box on the other side of the house you should have obtained a clew to what you have for a year now been trying to get at  it does seem extraordinary lady moulton but it really is not so and i hope to convince you that i am right by producing walter in a week from the present time  i hope you will hilda i sincerely hope so both for the childs sake yours and my own of course when he is found there will be no possible reason for your keeping yourself shut up as you have done i have missed you very much and shall be very glad to have you under my wing again  thank you for saying so lady moulton but so far as i have formed my plans they are that walters trustees shall either let or sell the house in hyde park gardens and that i shall go down for a time with him into the country i have had a great deal of anxiety this last year and i shall be very glad of complete rest for a time  that is reasonable enough my dear but i do hope that you are not thinking of burying yourself in the country for good there i am at home goodnight hilda thanks for the lift it is not often my horses or my coachmen have a night off during the season     chapter xxii  nearing the goal   i suppose miss netta is in bed hilda asked as she entered the house  yes miss she and miss purcell went to their rooms soon after ten oclock  hilda ran upstairs to nettas room  are you awake netta she asked as she opened the door  well i think i was asleep hilda i didnt intend to go off for i made sure that you would come in for a chat as usual when you got back but i think i must have dozed off  well if you had been so sound asleep that i had had to violently wake you up i should have done so i have had my chance netta simcoe and his friend were in a box opposite to ours and i have learned where walter is  that is news indeed netta exclaimed leaping up that is worth being awakened a hundred times for please hand me my dressinggown now let us sit down and talk it over comfortably  hilda then repeated the whole conversation that she had overheard  splendid netta exclaimed clapping her hands and that man was right dear in feeling uncomfortable when your glasses were fixed on his face though he little guessed what reason he had for the feeling well it is worth all the four years you spent with us to have learned to read peoples words from their lips i always said that you were my best pupil and you have proved it so now what is to be done next  we shall need a general council for that hilda laughed we must do nothing rash now that success seems so close a false move might spoil everything  yes we shall have to be very careful this bargeman may not live near there at all though no doubt he goes there pretty often as letters are sent there for him besides simcoe may have someone stationed there to find out whether any inquiries have been made for a missing child  yes i see that we shall have to be very careful netta and we must not spoil our chances by being over hasty  they talked for upwards of an hour and then went to their beds the next morning roberts took a note to dr leeds it contained only a few lines from hilda       my dear dr leeds we have found a most important clew and are      going to have a consultation at which of course we want you to      be present could you manage to be at mr pettigrews office at      three oclock if so on hearing from you i will send to him to      make an appointment  the answer came back       i congratulate you heartily and will meet you at three oclock at      pettigrews office  a note was at once sent off to the lawyers to make the appointment and the girls arrived with miss purcell two or three minutes before the hour and were at once shown into mr pettigrews room where mr farmer immediately joined them  i will wait a minute or two before i begin hilda said i have asked dr leeds to join us here he has been so very kind throughout the whole matter that we thought it was only fair that he should be here  certainly i thoroughly agree with you i never thought that terrible suspicion of his well founded but he certainly took immense pains in collecting information of all sorts about these native poisons and since then has shown the greatest desire to assist in any way  a minute later dr leeds was shown in  now miss covington mr farmer said we are ready to hear your communication  hilda then related what she had learned at the opera  really miss covington mr farmer continued it is a thousand pities that you and your friend cannot utilize your singular accomplishment in the detective line you ought to make a fortune by it i have of course heard from my partner of the education that you had in germany and of your having acquired some new system by which you can understand what people are saying by watching their lips but i certainly had no conception that it could be carried to such an extent as you have just proved it can it is like gaining a new sense now i suppose you have come to us for advice as to what had best be done next  that is it mr farmer it is quite evident to us that we must be extremely careful for if these people suspect that we are so far on their track they might remove walter at once and we might never be able to light upon a clew again  yes i see that of course if we were absolutely in a position to prove that this child has been kept down near pitsea with their cognizance we could arrest them at once but unfortunately in the words you heard there was no mention of the child and at present we have nothing but a series of small circumstantial facts to adduce you believe mr pettigrew tells me that the man who calls himself john simcoe is an impostor who has no right to the name and that general mathieson was under a complete delusion when he made that extraordinary will you believe that or at any rate you have a suspicion that having got the general to make the will he administered some unknown drug that finally caused his death you believe that as this child alone stood between him and the inheritance he had him carried off with the assistance of the other man you believe that the body the coroners jury decided to be that of walter rivington was not his and that the child himself is being kept out of the way somewhere in essex and you believe that the conversation that you most singularly overheard related to him  but unfortunately all these beliefs are unsupported by a single legal fact and i doubt very much whether any magistrate would issue a warrant for these mens arrest upon your story being laid before him even if they were arrested some confederate might hasten down to pitsea and carry the child off and indeed pitsea may only be the meetingplace of these conspirators and the child may be at limehouse or at chatham or at any other place frequented by barges therefore we must for the present give up all idea of seizing these men any researches at pitsea itself are clearly attended by danger and yet i see no other way of proceeding  it seems dr leeds said that this other man who appears to have acted as simcoes agent throughout the affair took the alarm the other day and instead of taking a trap as usual from tilbury returned to the station took the ferry across to gravesend and then as we suppose came up to town again told simcoe that he found he was watched and that simcoe must himself take the matter up evidently by what miss covington overheard he had instructed him where and how to communicate with this bargeman or in case of necessity to find him i should think that the first step would be to withdraw the men now on watch for it is possible that they may also send down men to places in the locality of pitsea in point of fact your men have been instructed to make no such inquiries but only to endeavor to trace where simcoes agent drives to still i think it would be as well to withdraw them at once as they can do no further good  mr pettigrew nodded  i know nothing of pitsea the doctor went on but i do know hole haven when i was walking the hospital three or four of us had a little sailingboat and used to go out from saturday until monday morning hole haven was generally the limit of our excursions it is a snug little harbor for small boats and there is a comfortable oldfashioned little inn there where we used to sleep the coastguards were all sociable fellows ready to chat with strangers and not averse to a small tip of course the same men will not be there now nor would it be very safe to ask questions of them for no doubt they are on friendly terms with the men on the barges which go up and down the creek i might however learn something from them of the ways of these men and i should think that on giving my card to the petty officer in charge i could safely question him i dont suppose that he would know where this man nibson has his headquarters if he lives at rochester or chatham or at limehouse or shadwell he certainly would not know him but if he lives at pitsea he might know him i fancy they keep a pretty sharp lookout on the barges i know that the coastguard told me that there was still a good deal of smuggling carried on in the marshes between leigh and thames haven i fancy from what he said that the leigh fishermen think it no harm to run a few pounds of tobacco or a keg of spirit from a passing ship and indeed as there are so many vessels that go ashore on the sands below and as they are generally engaged in unloading them or helping them to get off they have considerable facilities that way at any rate as an old frequenter of the place and as knowing the landlordthat is to say if there has been no change thereno suspicion could fall upon me of going down there in reference to your affair today is friday on sunday morning early i will run down to gravesend hire a boat there and will sail down to hole haven it will be an outing for me and a pleasant one and at least i can be doing no harm  thank you very much indeed dr leeds hilda said warmly that is a splendid idea  on sunday evening dr leeds called at hyde park gardens to report his days work  i think that my news is eminently satisfactory i saw the petty officer in command of the coastguard station and he willingly gave me all the information in his power he knew the bargee bill nibson he is up and down the creek he says once and sometimes twice a week he has got a little bit of a farm and a house on the bank of the creek a mile and a half on this side of pitsea they watch him pretty closely as they do all the men who use the creek there is not one of them who does not carry on a bit of smuggling if he gets the chance  i thought that was almost given up i said oh no it is carried on he replied on a much smaller scale than it used to be but there is plenty of it and i should say that there is more done that way on the thames than anywhere else in the first place dutch german and french craft coming up the channels after dark can have no difficulty whatever in transferring tobacco and spirits into barges or fishingboats i need hardly say it is not ships of any size that carry on this sort of business but small vessels such as billyboys and craft of that sort they carry their regular cargoes and probably never bring more than a few hundredweight of tobacco and a dozen or so kegs of spirits it is doubtful whether their owners know anything of what is being done and i should say that it is generally a sort of speculation on the part of the skipper and men on this side the trade is no doubt in the hands of men who either work a single barge or fishingboat of their own or who certainly work it without the least suspicion on the part of the owners  the thing is so easily arranged a man before he starts from ostend or hamburg or the mouth of the seine sends a line to his friends here at rochester or limehouse or leigh shall sail tonight expect to come up the south channel on monday evening the bargeman or fisherman runs down at the time arranged and five or six miles below the nore brings up and shows a light he knows that the craft he expects will not be up before that time for if the wind was extremely favorable and they made the run quicker than they expected they would bring up in margate roads till the time appointed if they didnt arrive that night they would do so the next and the barge would lay there and wait for them or the fishermen would go into sheerness or leigh and come out again the next night  you might wonder how a barge could waste twentyfour or fortyeight hours without being called to account by its owners but there are barges which will anchor up for two or three days under the pretense that the weather is bad but really from sheer laziness  that is one way the stuff comes into the country and so far as i can see there is no way whatever of stopping it the difficulty of course is with the landing and even that is not great when the tide turns to run out there are scores i may say hundreds of barges anchored between chatham and gravesend they generally anchor close in shore and it would require twenty times the number of coastguards there are between chatham and gravesend on one side and foulness and tilbury on the other to watch the whole of them and to see that boats do not come ashore  a few strokes and they are there one man will wait in the boat while the other goes up onto the bank to see that all is clear if it is the things are carried up at once probably the barge has put up some flag that is understood by friends ashore they are there to meet it and in half an hour the kegs are either stowed away in lonely farmhouses or sunk in some of the deep ditches and there they will remain until they can be fished up and sent off in a cart loaded with hay or something of that sort you may take it that among the marshes on the banks of the medway and thames there is a pretty good deal done in the way of smuggling still we keep a very close eye upon all the barges that come up here but it is very seldom that we make any catch one cannot seize a barge like the mary ann that is the boat belonging to nibson with perhaps sixty tons of manure or cement or bricks and unload it without some specific information that would justify our doing so indeed we hardly could unload it unless we took it out into the thames and threw the contents overboard we could not carry it up this steep stonefaced bank and higher up there are very few places where a barge could lie alongside the bank to be unloaded we suspect nibson of doing something that way but we have never been able to catch him at it we have searched his place suddenly three or four times but never found anything suspicious  may i ask what family the man has i said  he shook his head there is his wifei have seen her once or twice on board the barge as it has come in and outand there is a boy who helps him on the bargei dont know whether he is his son or not i have no idea whether he has any family but i have never seen a child on the barge  all this seemed to be fairly satisfactory i told him that we suspected that a stolen child was kept in nibsons house and asked him whether one of his men off duty would at any time go with me in a boat and point out the house he said that there would be no difficulty about that my idea miss covington was that it would be by far the best plan for us to go down with a pretty strong partythat is to say two or three menand to go from gravesend in a boat arriving at hole haven at eleven or twelve oclock at night i should write beforehand to the coastguard officer asking him to have a man in readiness to guide us and then row up to the house in that way we should avoid all chance of a warning being sent on ahead from pitsea or from any other place where they might have men on watch  i mentioned this to the officer and he said well i dont see how you could break into the mans house if the child is not there you might find yourself in a very awkward position and if nibson himself happened to be at home he would be perfectly justified in using firearms i said of course that was a point i must consider it is indeed a point on which we must take mr pettigrews opinion but probably we shall have to lay an information before the nearest magistrate though i think myself that if we were to take the officer into our confidenceand he seemed to me a bluff hearty fellowhe would take a lot of interest in the matter and might stretch a point and send three or four men down after dark to search the place again for smuggled goods you see he has strong suspicions of the man and has searched his place more than once then when they were about it we could enter and seize walter should there be a mistake altogether and the child not be found there we could give the officer a written undertaking to hold him free in the very unlikely event of the fellow making a fuss about his house being entered  the next morning hilda again drove up with netta to see mr pettigrew  we must be careful my dear we must be very careful he said if we obtain a search warrant it can only be executed during the day and even if the coastguards were to make a raid upon the place we as civilians would not have any right to enter the house i dont like the idea of this night businessindeed i do not see why it should not be managed by day apparently from what dr leeds said this hole haven is a place where little sailingboats often go in i dont know much of these matters but probably in some cases gentlemen are accompanied by ladies and no doubt sometimes these boats go up the creeks now there must be goodsized boats that could be hired at gravesend with men accustomed to sailing them and i can see no reason why we should not go down in a party i should certainly wish to be there myself and think colonel bulstrode should be there you might bring your two men and get an information laid before an essex magistrate and obtain a warrant to search this mans place for a child supposed to be hidden there by the way i have a client who is an essex magistrate he lives near billericay i will have an information drawn out and will go myself with it and see him it is only about five miles to drive from brentwood station if i sent a clerk down there might be some difficulty whereas when i personally explain the circumstances to him he will i am sure grant it at the same time i will arrange with him that two of the county constabulary shall be at this place hole haven at the time we arrive there and shall accompany us to execute the warrant let me see and he turned to his engagement book there is no very special matter on for tomorrow and i am sure that mr farmer will see to the little matters that there are in my department by the way it was a year yesterday since the generals death and we have this morning been served with a notice to show cause why we should not proceed at once to distribute the various legacies under his will i dont think that refers to the bequest of the estates though of course it may do so but to the ten thousand pounds to which simcoe is clearly entitled of course we should appear by counsel in any case but with walter in our hands we can bring him to his knees at once and he will have to wait some time before he touches the money we cannot prevent his having that he may get five years for abducting the child but that does not affect his claim to the money  unless mr pettigrew we could prove that he is not john simcoe  certainly my dear the lawyer said with an indulgent smile your other theories have turned out very successful i am bound to admit but for this you have not a shadow of evidence while he could produce a dozen respectable witnesses in his favor however we need not trouble ourselves about that now as to the abduction of the child while our evidence is pretty clear against the other man we have only the fact against simcoe that he was a constant associate of his and had an immense interest in the child being lost the other man seems to have acted as his intermediary all through and so far as we actually know simcoe has never seen the child since he was taken away of course if walter can prove to the contrary the case is clear against him but without this it is only circumstantial though i fancy that the jury would be pretty sure to convict and now how about the boat who will undertake that we are rather busy at present and could scarcely spare a clerk to go down  we will look after that mr pettigrew it is only an hours run to gravesend and it will be an amusement for us we will take roberts down with us what day shall we fix it for  well my dear the sooner the better i shall get the warrant tomorrow and there is no reason why the constable should not be at hole haven the next day at say two in the afternoon so if you go down tomorrow and arrange for a boat the matter may as well be carried out at once especially as i know that you are burning with anxiety to get the child back of course this rascal of a bargeman must be arrested  i should think that would depend partly on how he has treated walter hilda said i dont suppose he knows who he is or anything of the circumstances of the case he is simply paid so much to take charge of him if he has behaved cruelly to him it is of course right that he should be punished but if he has been kind to him i dont see why he should not be let off besides we may want him as a witness against the others  well there is something in that of course we might if he were arrested allow him to turn queens evidence but there is always a certain feeling against this class of witness however we neednt discuss that now i suppose that we ought to allow an hour and a half or two hours to get to this place from gravesend but you can find that out when you hire the boat of course it will depend a good deal on which way the tide is by the way you had better look to that at once for if it is not somewhere near high tide when we get to hole haven there may not be water enough to row up the creek  he called in one of the clerks and told him to go out to get him an almanac with a tidetable  i want to know when it will be high water the day after tomorrow at gravesend he said  i can tell you that at once sir when i came across waterloo bridge this morning at a quarter to nine the tide was running in i should say that it was about halfflood and would be high about twelve oclock so that it will be high about halfpast one oclock on wednesday it is about threequarters of an hour earlier at gravesend i dont know whether that is near enough for you sir  yes that is near enough thank you so you see he went on after the clerk had left the room the tide will be just about high when you get to gravesend and you will get there in about an hour i should say i dont know exactly how far this place is but i should say seven or eight miles and with a sail or if the wind is contrary a couple of oars you will not be much above an hour and i should think that there will be still plenty of water in the creek you had better see colonel bulstrode as joint trustee he should certainly be there  they drove at once to the colonels and found him in he had not heard of the discovery hilda had made and was greatly excited at the prospect of so soon recovering walter and bringing as he said the rascals to book  the next morning they went down with roberts to gravesend to engage a large and roomy boat with two watermen for their trip just as they were entering hyde park gardens on their return a man passed them roberts looked hard at him and then said if you dont want me any more now miss i should like to speak to that man he is an old fellowsoldier  certainly roberts i shall not want you again for some time  roberts hurried after the man sergeant nichol he said as he came up to him it is years since i saw you last  i remember your face if i do not remember your name the man said  i am tom roberts i was in your company you know before you went onto the staff  i remember you now roberts and the two shook hands heartily what are you doing now if i remember right you went as servant to general mathieson when you got your discharge  yes you see i had been his orderly for two or three years before and when i got my discharge with my pension i told him that i should like to stop with him if he would take me i was with him out there for five years after then i came home and was with him until his death and am still in the service of his niece miss covington one of the young ladies i was with just now and what are you doing  i am collector for a firm in the city it is an easy berth and with my pension i am as comfortable as a man can wish to be  so they chatted for half an hour and when they parted roberts received a hearty invitation to look in at the others place at kilburn  both my boys are in the army he said and likely to get on well my eldest girl is married my youngest is at home with her mother and myself they will be pleased to see you too the missus enjoys a gossip about india and is always glad to welcome any old comrade of mine     chapter xxiii  walter   the wind was westerly and the boat ran fast down the river from gravesend roberts and andrew both in civilian clothes were sitting in the bows where there were stowed a large hamper and a small travelingbag with some clothes one waterman sat by the mast in case it should be necessary to lower sail the other was aft at the tiller the men must have thought that they had never had so silent and grave a pleasure party before two elderly gentlemen and two girls none of whom seemed inclined to make merry in any way colonel bulstrode indeed tried hard to keep up a conversation about the ships barges and other craft that they met or which lay at anchor in the stream and recalling reminiscences of trips on indian rivers  netta was the only one of his hearers who apparently took any interest in the talk to her the scene was so new that she regarded everything with attention and pleasure and looked with wonder at the great ships which were dragged along by tiny tugs wondered at the rate at which the clumsylooking barges made their way through the water and enjoyed the rapid and easy motion with which their own boat glided along mr pettigrew was revolving in his mind the problem of what should next be done while hildas thoughts were centered upon walter and the joy that it would be to have him with her again  this is hole haven the boatman in the stern said as a wide sheet of water opened on their left  why dont you turn in then colonel bulstrode asked  there is scarce water enough for us sir they are neap tides at present and in half an hour the sands will begin to show all over there we have to go in onto the farther sidethat is where the channel is you see those craft at anchor there is the landing just in front of the low roof you see over the bank that is the lobster smack and a very comfortable house it is and you can get as good a glass of beer there as anywhere on the river  as they turned into the creek they saw two constables on the top of the bank and at the head of the steps stood a gentleman talking with a coastguard officer  that is my friend mr bostock mr pettigrew said he told me that if he could manage it he would drive over himself with the two constables i am glad that he has been able to do so his presence will strengthen our hands  a coast guard boat with four sailors in it was lying close to the steps and the officer came down with mr bostock followed by the two constables the magistrate greeted mr pettigrew and took his place in the boat beside him after being introduced to the two ladies and the colonel the officer with the two constables stepped into the coastguard boat which rowed on ahead of the other  i could not resist the temptation of coming over to see the end of this singular affair of which i heard from mr pettigrew mr bostock said to hilda the officer of the coastguard is going on partly to show us the way to the house and partly because it will be a good opportunity for him to search the place thoroughly for smuggled goods he tells me that the barge is up the creek now it went up yesterday evening so we may find the fellow at home  now my men colonel bulstrode said to the boatmen we have got to follow that boat you will have plenty of time for beer when you get there and a good lunch besides so pull your hardest we have not got very far to go can either of you men row  illustration i am a magistrate of the county of essexpage 289  i can pull a bit roberts said and aided by the sail and the three oars the boat went along at a fair rate through the water the coastguard boat keeping a short distance ahead of them after a quarter of an hours rowing the bargemans house came in view the revenue officer pointed to it  now row your hardest men colonel bulstrode said we have but a hundred yards further to go  the two boats rowed up to the bank together mr bostock sprang out as did the constables and sailors and ran up the bank the others following at once as they appeared on the bank a boy working in the garden gave a shrill whistle a man immediately appeared at the door and looked surprised at the appearance of the party he stepped back a foot and then as if changing his mind came out and closed the door after him  i am a magistrate of the county of essex mr bostock said and i have come to see a warrant executed for the search of your house for a child named walter rivington who is believed to be concealed here and who has been stolen from the care of his guardians  i know nothing of any child of that name the man replied but i have a child here that i am taking care of for a gentleman in london i have had him here for just a year and no one has made any inquiries about him you are welcome to enter and see if he is the one you are in search of if he is all that i can say is that i know nothing about his being stolen and shall be very sorry to lose him  he stood aside and the two constables entered followed closely by hilda the latter gave a cry of joy for seated on the ground playing with a box of soldiers was walter she would hardly have known him anywhere else his curls had been cut short his face was brown and tanned and his clothes although scrupulously clean were such as would be worn by any bargemans boy at that age the child looked up as they entered hilda ran to him and caught him up in her arms  dont you know me walter dont you remember cousin hilda  yes i remember you the child said now returning her embrace you used to tell me stories and take me out in a carriage for drives where have you been so long and where is grandpapa oh here is netta and as hilda put him down he ran to her for during the four months spent in the country she had been his chief playmate  i have learned to swim netta uncle bill has taught me himself and he is going to take me out in his barge some day  the woman who had come in with her arms covered with lather from the little washhouse adjoining the house now came forward  i hope miss that there is nothing wrong she said to hilda we have done our best for the little boy and i have come to care for him just as if he had been my own and if you are going to take him away i shall miss him dreadful for he is a dear little fellow and she burst into tears  walter struggled from nettas arms and ran to the woman and pulling her by the apron said  dont cry aunt betsy jack is not going away from you jack will stay here he likes going in a barge better than riding in a carriage  well miss covington mr bostock said the recognition appears to be complete on both sides now what is the next step do you give this man into custody for unlawfully concealing this child and aiding and abetting in his abduction  will you wait a minute while i speak to mr pettigrew she said and they went out of the house together  well what do you think mr pettigrew  i have been thinking it over all the way as we came down the lawyer said of course we have no shadow of proof that this man was aware who the child was and in fact if he had seen the placards offering altogether fifteen hundred pounds for his recovery we must certainly assume that he would have given him up for however well he may have been paid for taking charge of him the offer would have been too tempting for a man of that kind to have resisted no doubt he had strong suspicions but you can hardly say that it amounted to guilty knowledge that the child had been abducted if walter had been illtreated i should have said at once give him into custody but this does not seem to have been the case  no they have evidently been very kind to him i am so grateful for that that i should be sorry to do the man any harm  that is not the only point the lawyer went on it is evident that the other people very seldom come down here and from what you heard in future simcoe is going to write if we arrest this man the others will know at once that the game is up now if you will take the child away quietly we can tell the man that he shall not be prosecuted providing that he takes no steps whatever to inform his employers that the child is gone even if one of them came down here to see the child the wife must say that he is away on the barge anyhow we shall have ample time to decide upon what steps to take against simcoe and can lay hands upon him whenever we choose whereas if he got an inkling that we had discovered the child he and his associate would probably disappear at once and we might have lots of trouble to find them  yes i think that would be a very good plan mr pettigrew i will ask him and his wife to come out  that will be the best way my dear we could hardly discuss the matter before bostock  hilda went in as soon as she spoke to the man and his wife mr bostock said if you want a conference miss covington i will go out and leave you to talk matters over  he and the two constables withdrew and mr pettigrew came in  now my man he began you must see that you have placed yourself in a very awkward position you are found taking care of a child that has been stolen and for whose recovery large rewards have been offered all over the country it is like the case of a man found hiding stolen goods he would be called upon to account for their being in his possession now it is hardly possible that you can have been ignorant that this child was stolen you may not have been told so in words but you cannot have helped having suspicions from what the child no doubt said when he first came here you must have been sure that he had been brought up in luxury no doubt he spoke of rides in a carriage of servants his nurse and so on however miss covington is one of the childs guardians and i am the other and we are most reluctant to give you in charge it is evident from the behavior of the child and from the affection that he shows to yourself and your wife that you have treated him very kindly since he has been here and these toys i see about show that you have done your best to make him happy  that we have sir the man said betsy and i took to him from the first we have no children of our own none living at least and we have made as much of him as if he had been one of our ownperhaps more we have often talked it over and both thought that we were not doing the fair thing by him and were perhaps keeping him out of his own i did not like having anything to do with it at first but i had had some business with the man who gave him to me and when he asked me to undertake the job it did not seem to me so serious an affair as it has done since i am heartily sorry that we have had any hand in it not only because we have done the child harm but because it seems that we are going to lose him now that we have come to care for him as if he was our own  of course you played only a minor part in the business nibson we quite understand that and it is the men who have carried out this abduction that we want to catch do you know the name of the man who brought the child to you  i dont sir he knows where to find me but i have no more idea than a child unborn who he is or where he lives when he writes to me which he generally does before he comes down which may be two or three times a month or may be once in six months he signs himself smith i dont suppose that is his right name but i say fairly that if i knew it and where he lived i would not peach upon him he has always been straight with me in the business i have done with him and i would rather take six months for this affair than say anything against him  we are not asking you at present to say anything against him and he is not the principal man in this business i believe he is only acting as agent for another more dangerous rascal than himself we are not prepared at the present moment to arrest the chief scoundrel before we do that we must obtain evidence that will render his conviction a certainty we have reason to believe that this man that you know will not come down for some time and that you will receive the money for the childs keep by post but if we abstain altogether from prosecuting you in this matter you must give us your word that you will not take any steps whatever to let them know that the child is no longer with you he says that you promised to take him out in your barge well if by any chance this mannot your man but the othercomes down here and wants to see the child you or your wife will lead him to believe that he is on board your barge it will also be necessary that if we do arrest them you should enter as a witness to prove that the man handed the child over to you you could let it be seen that you are an unwilling witness but the evidence of the handing over of the child will be an absolute necessity  all right sir i will undertake that there is no fear of my letting him know that the child has gone for i dont know where to write him and if he or the other should come down if i am here i shall have no difficulty in keeping it from him that the child has gone for my man has never set foot in this house he just meets me on the road near pitsea says what he has to say and gives me what he has to give me and then drives off again of course if i am summoned as a witness i know that the law can make me go i remember now that when he gave me the child he said he was doing it to oblige a friend of his and he may be able to prove that he had nothing to do with carrying it off  that is as it may be the lawyer said dryly however we are quite content with your promise  and i thank you most heartily you and your wife hilda covington said warmly for your kindness to the child it would have made me very happy all this time if i could have known that he was in such good hands but i pictured him shut up in some vile den in london ill treated and half starved he has grown very much since he has been with you and looks a great deal more boyish than he did  yes he plays a good deal with my barge boy who has taken to him just as we have  well your kindness will not be forgotten nor unrewarded mr nibson  im sure we dont want any reward miss we have been well paid but even if we hadnt been paid at all after the first month we should have gone on keeping him just the same  now walter hilda said we want you to come home with us we have all been wanting you very badly nurse and tom roberts have been in a terrible way and so has dr leeds you remember him dont you he was very kind to you all the time that you were down in the country  the child nodded i should like to see tom roberts and nurse but i dont want to go away i am going out in the barge soon  well dear i dare say that we shall be able to arrange for you to come down sometimes and to go out in it especially as you have learned to swim we are going away now in a boat  i often go out in the boat walter pouted i go with joshua he is a nice boy joshua is and i like him  well dear we will see what we can do for joshua  you are sure that i shall come back and go out in the barge  quite sure dear and perhaps i will go out with you too  yes you must go like a good boy mrs nibson said you know dear that i shall always love you and shall be very very glad if the ladies can spare you to come down to see me sometimes you wont forget me will you  no aunt betsy i shall never forget you i promise you that the child said and i dont want to go away from you at all only cousin hilda says i must  mr pettigrew went out to tell mr bostock that they should not give nibson into custody  the principal scoundrels would take the alarm instantly he said and above all things we want to keep them in the dark until we are ready to arrest them it will be much better that we should have this man to call as a witness than that he should appear in the dock as an accomplice  i think that you are right there the magistrate agreed and really he and his wife seem to have been very kind to the child i have been talking to this young barge boy it seems he is no relation of these people his mother was a tramp who died one winters night on the road to pitsea he was about ten or eleven years old then and they would have sent him to the workhouse but nibson who was on the coroners jury volunteered to take him and i dare say he finds him very useful on board the barge at any rate he has been well treated and says that nibson is the best master on the river so the fellow must have some good in him though from what the coastguard officer said there are very strong suspicions that he is mixed up in the smuggling business which it seems is still carried on in these marshes well no doubt you have decided wisely and now i suppose we shall be off  at this moment they were joined by the coastguard officer  he has done us again he said we have been investigating these outhouses thoroughly and there is no question that he has had smuggled goods here we found a clever hidingplace in that cattleshed it struck me that it was a curious thing that there should be a stack of hay built up right against the side of it so we took down a plank or two and i was not surprised to find that there was a hollow in the stack one of the men stamped his foot and the sound showed that there was another hollow underneath we dug up the ground and found six inches below it a trapdoor and on lifting it discovered a hole five or six feet deep and six feet square it was lined with bricks roughly cemented together it is lucky for him that the place is empty and i should think that after this he will go out of the business for a time of course we cannot arrest a man merely for having a hidden cellar i fancy that there are not many houses on the marshes that have not some places of the sort indeed i am rather glad that we did not catch him for in other respects nibson is a decent hardworking fellow sometimes he has a glass or two at the lobster smack but never takes too much and is always very quiet and decent in his talk i doubt whether the men would have found that hidingplace if i had not been there they all know him well and would not get him into a scrape if they could help it though there are some fellows on the marshes they would give a months pay to catch with kegs or tobacco  the door of the house opened and the three women and nibson came out with walter who was now dressed in the clothes that they had brought down for him  while the others were getting ready to enter the boat the officer took nibson aside  you have had a close squeak of it nibson we found your hidingplace under the stack and it is lucky for you that it was empty so we have nothing to say to you i should advise you to give it up my man sooner or later you are bound to be caught  the mans brow had darkened as the officer began but it cleared up again  all right he said i have been thinking for the last half hour that i shall drop the business altogether but when a man once gets into it it is not so easy to get out now that you have found that cellar it is a good excuse to cut it i can well say that i dare not risk it again for that after so nearly catching me you would be sure to keep an extra sharp eye on me in the future  you give me your word for that nibson  yes sir i swear off it altogether from the present day  good i will take your word for it and you can go in and come out as you like without being watched and you need not fear that we shall pay you another visit  walter went off in fair spirits the promise that he should come down again and see his friends and have a sail in the barge lessened the pang of leaving and as hildas and nettas faces came more strongly back to him as they talked to him and recalled pleasant things that had almost faded from his memory he went away contentedly while betsy nibson went back to the house and had what she called a good cry she too however cheered up when her husband told her how narrow an escape he had had and how he had given his word that he would drop smuggling altogether  that makes my mind easier than it has been for years bill and will you give up the other thing too there may not be much harm in running kegs and bacca but there is no doubt about its being wrong to have anything to do with stolen goods and to mix yourself up with men who steal them  yes i will give that up too betsy and as soon as i have time to look round i will give an order for a new barge to be built for me i have been ashamed of the old thing for a long time past with her patched sails of course she suited my purpose for when the other barges kept on their course it gave me a good excuse for anchoring but it aint pleasant to have every barge passing you there is old joe hargett he said the other day that if i ever thought of getting a new barge he would give a hundred for her he has got a set of decent sails and he is a pretty handy carpenter and no doubt he will make her look decent again a hundred pounds aint much but it will help i can get a new one complete sails and all for fourteen or fifteen hundred and have a hundred or two left in the bag afterwards i tell you what betsy i will get an extra comfortable cabin made and a place forward for joshua it will be dull for you here now the child is gone and it would be a sight more comfortable for us both to be always together  that it will bill she said joyfully i was always very happy on board till we lost our billy i took a dislike to it then and was glad enough to come here but i have got over it now and this place is very lonely during the long winter nights when you are away  then they talked over the barge and how the cabin should be fitted up and in spite of having lost walter the evening was a pleasant one to them  that was not the only conversation that took place that day with reference to a new barge for bill nibson as they rowed up against the tide hilda said  we must do something for that bargeman colonel bulstrode i am sure we cannot be too grateful to him and his wife for their treatment of walter think how different it might have been had he fallen into bad hands now he looks the picture of health the change in the life and the open air has done wonders you know dr leeds said that the officer of the coastguard had told him that nibsons barge was one of the oldest and rottenest crafts on the river now i propose that we buy him a new one what would it cost colonel bulstrode  i have not the slightest idea the colonel replied it might cost five hundred pounds or it might cost five thousand for all i know  i will ask the waterman hilda said and raising her voice she said how much do barges cost when they are new  from ten or eleven hundred up to fifteen the man said  does that include sails and all  yes miss down to the boat  who is considered the best bargebuilder  well there are a good many of them miss but i should say that gill of rochester is considered as good as any  what do you think mr pettigrew hilda said should we as walters guardians be justified in spending this money mind i dont care a bit whether we are or not because i would buy it myself if it would not be right for us to use his money  i am afraid that it would not be right mr pettigrew said as a trustee of the property i should certainly not feel myself justified in sanctioning such a sum being drawn though i quite admit that this good couple should be rewarded i cannot regard a barge as a necessary anything in reason that the child could require we should be justified in agreeing to of course whatever may be his expenses at a public school we should pay them without hesitation but for a child of that age to give a present of fifteen hundred pounds would be altogether beyond our power to sanction  very well hilda said decidedly then i shall take the matter into my own hands and i shall go down to rochester tomorrow and see if these people have a barge ready built i dont know whether they are the sort of things people keep in stock  that i cant say my dear i should think it probable that in slack times they may build a barge or two on speculation for the purpose of keeping their hands employed but whether that is the case now or not i dont know if these people at rochester have not got one you may hear of one somewhere else i want you all to come up to the office one day next week to talk over this matter of the order simcoe is applying forfor us to carry out the provisions of the willat any rate as far as his legacy is concerned  very well mr pettigrew i will come up any time that you write to me but you know that i have very strong opinions about it  i know your opinions are strong as ladies opinions generally are mr pettigrew said with a smile but unfortunately they are much more influenced by their own view of matters than by the legal bearing of them however we will talk that over when we meet again  the arrival of walter occasioned the most lively joy in hyde park gardens hilda had written to his nurse who had gone home to live with her mother when all hope of finding walter had seemed to be at an end to tell her that he would probably be at home on wednesday evening and that she was to be there to meet him her greeting of him was rapturous it had been a source of bitter grief to her that he had been lost through a momentary act of carelessness on her part and the relief that hildas letter had caused was great indeed the child was scarcely less pleased to see her for he retained a much more vivid recollection of her than he did of the others he had already been told of his grandfathers death but a year had so effaced his memory of him that he was not greatly affected at the news in the course of a few hours he was almost as much at home in the house as if he had never left it     chapter xxiv  a new barge   the next morning hilda went down to rochester with netta tom roberts accompanying them they had no difficulty in discovering the bargebuilders it seemed to the girls a dirtylooking place thickly littered as it was with shavings men were at work on two or three barges which seemed thus seen out of the water an enormous size  which is mr gill hilda asked a man passing  that is him miss and he pointed to a man who was in the act of giving directions to some workmen they waited until he had finished and then went up to him  i want to buy a barge mr gill hilda said  to buy a barge he repeated in surprise for never before had he had a young lady as a customer  hilda nodded i want to give it to a bargeman who has rendered me a great service as if it were an everyday occurrence for a young lady to buy a barge as a present i want it at once please and it is to be a firstclass barge how much would it cost  the builder rubbed his chin well miss it is a little unusual to sell a barge right off in this way as a rule people want barges built for them some want them for speed some want them for their carrying capacity  i want a firstclass barge hilda replied i suppose it will be for traffic on the thames and that he will like it to be fast  well miss the builder said slowly for he could not yet quite persuade himself that this young lady was really prepared to pay such a sum as a new barge would cost i have got such a barge she was launched last week but i had a dispute with the man for whom i built her and i said that i would not hold him to his bargain and that he could get a barge elsewhere he went off in a huff but i expect he will come back before long and ask me to let him have her and i should not be altogether sorry to say that she is gone she is a firstclass barge and i expect that she will be as fast as anything on the river of course i have got everything ready for hermasts sails and gear even down to her dingeyand in twentyfour hours she would be ready to sail the price is fifteen hundred pounds and he looked sharply at hilda to see what effect that communication would have to his great surprise she replied quietly  that is about the sum i expected mr gill can we look at her  certainly miss she is lying alongside and it is nearly high tide  he led the way over piles of balks of timber across sloppy pieces of ground over which at high tide water extended to the edge of the wharf where the barge floated she was indeed all ready for her mast her sides shone with fresh paint her upper works were painted an emerald green a color greatly in favor among bargemen and there was a patch of the same on her bow ready for the name surrounded by gilt scrollwork  there she is miss as handsome a barge as there is afloat  i want to see the cabin what a little place she went on as she and netta went down through a narrow hatchway and how low  it is the usual height in barges miss and the same size unless especially ordered otherwise  i should like the cabin to be made very comfortable for i think the boatman will have his wife on board could it not be made a little larger  there would be no great difficulty about that you see this is a watertight compartment but of course it could be carried six feet farther forward and a permanent hatchway be fixed over it and the lining made good in the new part as to height one might put in a goodsized skylight it would not be usual but of course it could be done  and you could put the bedplace across there could you not and put a curtain to draw across it  yes that could be managed easy enough miss and it would make a very tidy cabin  then how much would that cost extra  forty or fifty pounds at the outside  and when could you get it all finished and everything painted a nice color  i could get it done in a week or ten days if you made a point of it  i do make a point of it hilda said  what do you say to our leaving this bulkhead up as it is miss and making a door through it and putting a small skylight say three feet square over the new part you see it will be fifteen feet wide by six feet so that it will make a tidy little place it would not cost more than the other way not so much perhaps for it would be a lot of trouble to get this bulkhead down and then you see the second hand could have his bunk in here on the lockers and be quite separate  isnt there a cabin at the other end  well there is one miss you can come and look at it that is where the second hand always sleeps when the bargeman has got his wife on board  i think that it would be better to have the second hand sleep there hilda said this is very rough she went on when she inspected the little cabin forward there are all the beams sticking out surely it can be made more comfortable than this  we could matchboard the timbers over if you like but it is not usual  never mind please do it and put some lockers up for his clothes and make it very comfortable has the barge got a name yet  well miss we have always called her the medway but there is no reason that you should stick to that name she has not been registered yet so we can call her any name you like  then we will call her the walter hilda said for the girls had already settled this point between them  and now mr gill i suppose there is nothing to do but to give you a check for fifteen hundred pounds and i can pay for the alterations when i come down next monday week can you get me a couple of men who understand the workbargees dont you call them i want them to take her as far as hole haven and a short way up the creek  i can do that easily enough the builder said and i promise you that everything shall be ready for sailing though i dont guarantee that the paint in the new part of the cabin will be dry all the rest i can promise i will set a strong gang of men on at once  a few days later hilda wrote a line to william nibson saying that she intended to come down with the child on the following monday and hoped that he would be able to make it convenient to be at home on that day  she is not long in coming down again betsy he said when on the friday the barge went up to pitsea again and he received the letter which was carried home and read by his wife he himself being like most of his class at the time unable to read or write i suppose the child pined in his new home and she had to pacify him by saying that he should come down and see us next week that will suit me very well i have a load of manure waiting for me at rotherhithe it is for farmer gilston near pitsea so that i shall just manage it comfortably next week i will go over to rochester and see if i can hear of a good barge for sale  on the following monday morning the girls again went down to rochester this time taking walter with them having the previous week sent off three or four great parcels by luggage train roberts went to look for a cart to bring them to the bargebuilders and the girls went on alone  there she lies miss mr gill said pointing to a barge with new tanned sails lying out in the stream she is a boat any man might be proud of  she looks very nice indeed hilda said though of course i am no judge of such things  you may be sure that she is all right miss covington  is the paint dry down below  yes i saw that you were anxious about it so put plenty of drier in so that though she was only painted on saturday morning she is perfectly dry now but you are rather earlier than i had expected  yes we have sent a lot of things down by rail our man is getting a cart and i dare say they will be here in a quarter of an hour  the things were brought on a large handcart and as soon as these were carried down to the boat they went off with mr gill to the barge  there miss he said as he led the way down into the cabin there is not a barge afloat with such a comfortable cabin as this i put up two or three more cupboards for as they will sleep in the next room there is plenty of space for them  except in point of height the cabin was as comfortable a little room as could be desired it was painted a light slate color with the panels of the closets of a lighter shade of the same the inner cabin was of the same color a broad wooden bedstead extended across one end and at the other were two long cupboards extending from the ceiling to the floor the skylight afforded plenty of light to this room while the large one in the main cabin gave standing height six feet square in the middle  it could not have been better hilda said greatly pleased  well miss i took upon myself to do several things in the way of cupboards and so on that you had not ordered but seeing that you wanted to have things comfortable i took upon myself to do them  you did quite right mr gill this big skylight makes all the difference in height i see that you have painted the name and that you have got a flag flying from the masthead  yes bargemen generally like a bit of a flag that is to say if they take any pride in their boat you cannot trade in the barge until you have had it registered shall i get that done for you  yes i should be very much obliged if you would  and in whose name shall i register it in yours  no in the name of william nibson if you want his address it is creek farm pitsea  well miss he is a lucky fellow i will get it done and he can call here for the register the first time he comes up the medway  roberts was sent ashore again for a number of hooks screws and a few tools  now mr gill we are quite ready to start we shall get things straight on the voyage  you will have plenty of time miss she will anchor off grain spit till the tide begins to run up hard you wont be able to get up the creek till an hour before high tide  that wont matter hilda said it will not be dark till nine  you can get up the anchor now the builder said to two men who had been sitting smoking in the bow  the barges boat was lying bottom upwards on the hatches and another boat lay behind her  this boat does not belong to her mr gill does she hilda asked  no miss that is the mens boat when they have got the barge to where she is to be moored they will row down to hole haven and get a tow up with the first barge that comes down after the tide has turned how will you be coming back miss covington  we have arranged for a gig to be at hole haven at eight oclock to drive us to brentwood where we shall take train to town we shall not be up before halfpast eleven but as we have our man with us that does not matter besides the carriage is to be at the station to meet the train  the girls and walter watched the operation of getting up the anchor and of setting the foresail and jib they remained on deck while the barge beat down the long reach past the dockyards and then with slackened sheets rounded the wooded curve down into gillingham reach then accompanied by roberts they went below here they were soon hard at work the great packages were opened and mattresses and bedclothes brought out  this reminds one of our work when you first came to us netta laughed as they made the bed  yes it is like old times certainly we used to like to work then because we were doing it together we like it still more today because not only are we together but we are looking forward to the delight that we are going to give  carpets were laid down curtains hung to the bed and a washhand stand fixed in its place a hamper of crockery was unpacked and the contents placed on the shelves that had been made for them and cooking utensils arranged on the stove which had been obtained for them by the builder by this time roberts had screwed up the hooks in the long cupboards and in every spot round both cabins where they could be made available then numerous japanned tin boxes filled with tea sugar and other groceries were stowed away and a large one with a label tobacco placed on a shelf for bill nibsons special delectation curtains that could be drawn were fixed to the skylights lookingglasses fastened against the walls and by the time that the barge neared sheerness their labors were finished then the forward cabin was similarly made comfortable walter had assisted to the best of his power in all the arrangements and when he became tired was allowed to go up on deck on his promise to remain quiet by the side of the helmsman  now i think that everything is in its place hilda said at last and really they make two very pretty little rooms i cant say that the one in the bow is pretty but at any rate it is thoroughly comfortable and i have no doubt that joshua will be as pleased with it as the nibsons are with theirs oh dear how dusty one gets and we never thought of getting water on board for the jugs  on going up on deck however they observed two barrels lashed together  are those water hilda asked the man at the tiller  yes maam  how do you get it out i dont see a tap  you put that little pump lying by the side into the bunghole i will do it for you miss  now we will go downstairs and tidy up and then come and sit up here and enjoy ourselves said hilda  when they were below they heard a rattle of the chain and on going up found that the barge had come to anchor in the midst of some thirty or forty others the foresail had been run down and the jib lowered but the great mainsail with its huge brightly painted sprit was still standing roberts now opened a hamper that had been left on deck and produced luncheon cold meat and beer were handed to the two watermen who went up into the bow to eat it an hour later the tide began to slacken and many of the barges got up sail  shall we get up the anchor maam one of the watermen asked  theres plenty of time is there not hilda asked  yes maam but we thought that you would like to see how she goes with the others  yes i should like that hilda said and in a few minutes the barge was under sail again  she is a clipper and no mistake the man at the tiller said as one by one they passed the barges that had started ahead of them and walter clapped his hands in delight  we may as well go down to the lower end of the hope miss we shall have plenty of time to get back again before there is water enough for us in the creek  for three hours they sailed about the girls enjoying it as much as walter  i do think netta that i shall have to buy a barge on my own account it is splendid and after all the cabins are large enough for anything  you had better have a yacht netta laughed you would soon get tired of always going up and down the river  one might do worse hilda said of course now we shall give up that big house in hyde park gardens which is ridiculous for me and the boy we have each got a country house and when we want a thorough change i would infinitely rather have a yacht than a small house in town i dont suppose that it would cost very much more besides you know it is arranged that i am always to have rooms at your house at the institute that is to be the next thing seen after you know that is quite agreed upon  i shall be glad to be at work again netta said now that walter is found there is certainly nothing to keep us any longer in town  i know that it must have been horribly dull for you netta but you see that you are partly to blame yourself for refusing to go out with me  that would have been duller still netta laughed i should have been a long time before i got to know people and there is no good in knowing people when you are going right away from them in a short time and may never meet them again  at last the men said that there would be water enough to get up the creek  we shant be able to sail up miss you see the wind will be right in our teeth but that dont matter we can pole her up the tide will take us along and we shall only have to keep her straight and get her round the corners  are you sure that there will be water enough  yes miss you see she is empty and doesnt draw much more than a foot of water  as they entered the haven the head sails were dropped and the mainsail brailed up the tide was running in strong and as the men had said they had nothing to do but to keep the barge in the deepest part of the channel                                       how do you think they will be coming bill betsy nibson said as she joined her husband who was standing on the bank dressed in his sunday clothes  i cannot say betsy if i had known i should have gone to meet them they cannot drive here from pitsea but must walk and of course i would have been there if i had been sure of their coming that way but i should think most likely that they will drive to the haven and come up by boat  there is a new barge coming up the creek joshua said you can see that she is new by her spars and sails  thats so boy bill agreed she has got a flag i havent seen before at her masthead it is white and i think there are some red letters on ither name i suppose tis not often that a new barge comes up to pitsea she is a finelooking craft he went on as a turning in the creek brought her wholly into view a firstclass barge i should say yes there is no doubt about her being new i should say from the look of her spars she cannot have made many trips up and down the river  she has got a party on board mrs nibson said presently there are two women and a child perhaps its them bill they may have some friend in the barge line and he has offered to bring them down seeing that this is a difficult place to get at  i believe you are right betsy they are too far off to see their faces but they are certainly not barge people  they are waving their handkerchiefs betsy exclaimed it is them sure enough well we have wondered how they would come down but we never thought of a barge  the three hurried along the bank to meet the barge walter danced and waved his hat and shouted loudly to them as they approached  you did not expect to see us arrive in a barge mrs nibson hilda called out as they came abreast of them  no indeed miss we talked it over together as to how you would come but we never thought of a barge  it belongs to a friend of ours and we thought that it would be a pleasant way of coming she is a new boat you must come on board and have a look at her before we land  in a few minutes the barge was alongside the bank opposite the house a plank was run across and walter scampered over it to his friends  bless his little face mrs nibson said as she lifted him up to kiss her what a darling he looks bill and he has not forgotten us a bit  he could not well forget in a week bill said rather gruffly for he too was moved by the warmth of the childs welcome well let us go on board and pay our respects she is a fine barge surely and she has got the same name as the child  why it is not jack his wife said looking up  jack her husband repeated scornfully didnt they call him walter the other day go on wife the lady is waiting at the end of the plank for you  mrs nibson put the child down and followed him across the plank smoothing her apron as she went  my best respects miss she said as hilda shook hands with her warmly  we are glad to see you again mrs nibson and hope that you have not missed walter very much  i cannot say that i have not missed him a good deal miss but luckily we have had other things to think about we are giving up the farm it is lonesome here in the winter and i am going to take to barge life again  well what do you think of this barge mr nibson hilda asked  i allow she is a handsome craft and she ought to be fast  she is fast we have been sailing about until there was enough water in the creek and we have passed every barge that we have come near she is comfortable too come below and look at her cabin  well i never mrs nibson said pausing in astonishment at the foot of the ladder i have been in many barge cabins but never saw one like this her surprise increased when the door of the bulkhead was opened and she saw the sleeping cabin beyond did you ever bill  no i never saw two cabins in a barge before her husband said i suppose miss the owner must have had the cabin specially done up for his own use sometimes and the crew lived forward  there is a place forward for the second hand she replied and i suppose the owner will sleep here  of course it is a loss of space but she will carry a big load too who is the owner miss if i may make so bold as to ask  the registered owner is william nibson hilda said quietly  the bargeman and his wife gazed at each other in astonishment  but he said hesitatingly i have never heard of any owner of that name  except yourself nibson  yes except myself but i am not an owner as i have sold the mary ann  there is no other owner now she said that i know of of that name the barge is yours it is bought as testimony of our gratitude for the kindness that you have shown walter and you see it is named after him  it is too much miss said bill huskily while his wife burst into tears it is too much altogether we only did our duty to the child and we were well paid for it  you did more than your duty hilda said the money might pay for food and shelter and clothes but money cannot buy love and that is what you gave both of you and it is for that that we now pay as well as we can  miss covington should say i netta broke in for it is her present entirely walters trustees could not touch his money for the purpose and so she has done it herself  hush netta you should have said nothing about it hilda said and then turning to nibson went on i am his nearest relativehis only relative in factbesides being his guardian and therefore naturally i am the most interested in his happiness and as fortunately i am myself very well off i can well afford the pleasure of helping those who have been so good to him please do not say anything more about it now we will go on deck for a few minutes and leave you and your wife to look round we will show joshua his cabin  so saying she and netta went on deck joshua led by walter was just crossing the plank he had not received a special invitation and he felt too shy to go on board with these ladies present walter however had run across to him and at last persuaded him to come  well joshua hilda said as she reached him what do you think of the barge  she is as good a one as ever i seed the boy said  well joshua she belongs to mr nibson  to bill joshua exclaimed you dont mean it miss  i do mean it she said this is his barge  well i shouldnt have thought that bill was that artful joshua exclaimed almost indignantly fancy his keeping it from the missis and me that he had been and bought a new barge but she is a fine one there aint no doubt about that  come forward and look at your cabin joshua i think you will say that it is more comfortable than usual  well i am blowed the boy ejaculated as he followed her down the ladder and looked round why it is a palace that is wot it is it is more comfortable than the masters cabin aft in most barges and what a bed why it is soft enough for a hemperor  there are no sheets joshua they told me that the men never use sheets in barges  lor bless you no maam we mostly stretch ourselves on the locker and roll ourselves up in a blanket if we are lucky enough to have one why i dont know as i shant be afraid of getting into that bed though i does take a header in the water every morning there are lockers on both sides too and a basin who ever heard of such a thing as a basin why miss we allus washes in the pail on deck  well i should think that it would be a good deal more comfortable to wash down here in a basin on a cold morning  well i suppose it might miss it be sharp sometimes outside why there is oilcloth all over the floor and a mat to wipe ones feet at the bottom of the ladder and a rug by the side of the bed i never did see such things bill must have gone clean off his chump well i am blessed  it is miss covington who has given bill the barge and seen to its being fitted up netta said and she has done her best to make your cabin as comfortable as possible because you have been so kind to walter  and i hope to do some more for you joshua when i can see my way to do it you will find two or three suits of clothes for your work in those lockers i do not know that they will quite fit but i dare say if they dont mrs nibson can alter them for you and you will find shirts and warm underclothing and so on in that cupboard  joshua sat down suddenly on a locker completely overpowered with what seemed to him the immensity of his possessions  there the girls left him and they went up on deck again  going aft they sat down and talked for a few minutes and were then joined by nibson and his wife the latter still bore traces of tears on her cheeks and there was a suspicious redness about bills eyes  we wont try to say what we would like to say the man began cause we could not say it but we feels it just the same here we are with everything man or woman could wish for ready to hand  as i have said before nibson please do not say anything more about it it has made me quite as happy to get this barge for you and to make it comfortable as it can do you both to receive it and now we will go ashore  in the house they found that tea was ready save pouring the water into the pot a ham and a couple of cold chickens were on the table and jam and honey were specially provided for walter joshua did not make one of the party after recovering from the contemplation of his own cabin he had gone aft and remained in almost awestruck admiration at the comfort and conveniences there until summoned by bill to take his place and help to get the new boat into the water and to row the ladies down to hole haven     chapter xxv  a crushing exposure   the case of the application by john simcoe for an order for the trustees of the will of the late general mathieson to carry its provisions into effect was on the list of cases for the day tom roberts was walking up and down in westminster hall waiting for it to come on when he saw a face he knew  hullo sergeant nichol what brings you here  just curiosity roberts i happened to see in the list of cases one of simcoe against the trustees of general mathieson what i said to himself simcoe that is the name of the chap who saved general mathiesons life i remember their being both brought into cantonment as well as if it were yesterday i was with paymastersergeant sanderson the fellow who bolted a short time afterwards with three hundred pounds from the paychest and never was heard of afterwards we heard that simcoe was drowned at sea and sorry we all were for a braver fellow never stepped in shoe leather and there was not a man there who did not feel that he owed him a debt of gratitude for saving the brigadiers life so when i saw the paper i said to myself either the man was not drowned at all or he must be some relation of his i will go into court and have a look at him  it is the same man but i am sorry to say that though he may be as brave as a lion he is a rogue but you can see him without going into court that is him talking with the man in a wig and gown and that little man in black who is i suppose his lawyer he knows me so i wont go near him but you can walk as close as you like to him and take a good look at him  not content with looking once sergeant nichol passed him backwards and forwards three times when he rejoined roberts the latter saw that he looked flushed and excited  what is it sergeant  i dont believe it is simcoe at all the sergeant said it is that man sanderson i was speaking about just now several of us noticed how like he was to simcoe but the expression of their faces was different simcoe was five or six years younger and had a pleasant expression sanderson had a hard face none of us liked him he was a man one could never get friendly with you might be in the same mess for years and not know more about him at the end than you did at the beginning of course they would both be changed a good deal by this time but i dont believe that simcoe would have grown so as to be like this man and i am sure that sanderson would he had a mark on him that i should know him by one day when he was a recruit his musket went off and the ball went through his left forearm it was only a flesh wound but it left a blackened scar and i will bet all that i am worth that if you turned up that fellows sleeve you would find it there  that is very important sergeant i will go and tell my young lady she is talking with her lawyers and colonel bulstrode at the other end of the hall  hilda clapped her hands  what do you say now mr pettigrew i was right after all bring your friend up roberts and let us hear his story ourselves  sergeant nichol was fetched and repeated the story that he had told to roberts  thank you very much sergeant the barrister said please remain here while we talk it over what do you think of this mr pettigrew  it would seem to explain the whole matter that has puzzled us so i did not tell you because it was not in my opinion at all necessary to the case that miss covington has always maintained that the man was not simcoe and so positive was she that her friend miss purcell went down to stowmarket to make inquiries it was certainly believed by his friends there that he was simcoe and this to my mind was quite conclusive but i am bound to say that it did not satisfy miss covington  may i ask miss covington why you took up that opinion in the first place  because i was convinced that he was not the sort of man who would have risked his life for another after miss purcell came back from stowmarket we found out that just before he called on my uncle he advertised for relatives of the late john simcoe and that the advertisement appeared not in the suffolk papers only but in the london and provincial papers all over the country and it was evident if this man was john simcoe he would not advertise all over england instead of going down to stowmarket where his family lived and where he himself had lived for years he received a reply from an old lady an aunt of john simcoes living there went down and saluted her as his aunt at once offered to settle a pension of fifty pounds a year on her and after remaining for three days in her house no doubt listening to her gossip about all john simcoes friends went and introduced himself to them there was probably some resemblance in height and figure and an absence of twenty years would have effected a change in his face so that when it was found that his aunt unhesitatingly accepted him the people there had no doubt whatever that it was their old acquaintance therefore this in no way shook my belief that he was not the man  it turns out now you see that there was another man at benares at the time who was remarkably like him and that this man was a scoundrel and a thief when he deserted no doubt he would take another name and having doubtless heard that john simcoe was dead and remembering the remarks made as to his likeness to him he was as likely to take that name as any other though probably not with any idea of making any special use of it when in england he may have heard general mathiesons name mentioned and remembering that simcoe had saved the life of the general may have thought that the name and the likeness might enable him to personate the man he first set about establishing his identity by going down to stowmarket and after that it was easy i have thought it all over so many times that although it never struck me that there might have been at benares some man bearing a striking resemblance to john simcoe all the rest is exactly as i had figured it out to my mind now i will leave you gentlemen to decide what use you will make of the discovery while i go and tell my friends of it  the seats allotted to the general public were empty as a case of this sort offered but slight attraction even to the loungers in the hall but a large number of barristers were present it had been whispered about that there were likely to be some unexpected developments in the case the counsel engaged on both sides were the leaders of the profession who could hardly have been expected to be retained in a mere case of a formal application for an order for trustees to act upon a will  the facts of the case my lord the counsel who led for john simcoe commenced are simple and we are at a loss to understand how the trustees of the late general mathieson can offer any opposition to our obtaining the order asked for nothing can be more straightforward than the facts the late general mathieson early in march 1852 made a will which was duly signed and witnessed bequeathing among other legacies the amount of ten thousand pounds to mr john simcoe as a mark of his gratitude for his having saved him from a tiger some twenty years before in india the act was one of heroic bravery and mr simcoe nearly lost his own life in saving that of the general  he then related with dramatic power the incidents of the struggle  there is then no matter of surprise that this large legacy should have been left to mr simcoe by the general who was a man of considerable wealth the bulk of the property was left to his grandson and in the event of his dying before coming of age it was to go to a niece a miss covington to whom only a small legacy was left she being herself mistress of an estate and well provided for two months afterwards the general upon reflection decided to enlarge his gift to mr simcoe and he therefore in another will named him in place of miss covington who was amply provided for his heir in the event of his grandsons death i may say that the second will was not drawn up by the solicitors who had framed the first will probably as often happens the general preferred that the change he had effected should not be known until after his death even to his family solicitors he therefore went to a firm of equal respectability and standing messrs halstead  james who have made an affidavit that he interviewed them personally on the matter and gave them written instructions for drawing up his will and signed it in their presence  i may say that in all other respects including the legacy of ten thousand pounds the wills were absolutely identical the trustees after waiting until the last day permitted by law have to our clients surprise proved the first of these two wills ignoring the second on what ground i am at a loss to understand as my client is entitled to ten thousand pounds under either will it might be thought that the change would make little difference to him but unhappily the circumstances have entirely changed by the fact that the generals grandson was lost or stolen on the day before his death and in spite of the most active efforts of the police and the offer of large rewardsmy client who was deeply affected by the loss of the child himself offering a thousand pounds for news of his whereaboutsnothing was heard of him until two months after his disappearance when his body was found in the canal at paddington and after hearing evidence of identification and examining the clothes which all parties agreed to be those of the missing child the jury returned a verdict that the body was that of walter rivington and that there was no proof of how he came by his end  as the residence of general mathieson was in hyde park gardens no doubt the poor child strolled away from the care of a careless nurse came to the canal and walking near the bank fell in and was drowned no one could have been more grieved than my client at this and although it practically put him into possession of a large property he would i am sure gladly forfeit a large portion of it rather than come into possession of it in so melancholy a manner i have not heard of the slightest reason why the last will of general mathieson should be put aside i believe that no question could arise as to his state of mind at the time that it was made it may be that a plea of undue influence may be raised but this to those who knew the general would appear absurd he was a man of active habits and vigorous both in mind and body here was no case of a man living in the house and influencing an old gentleman approaching his dotage they met only at clubs and at dinners and although the general was rightly and naturally attached to simcoe he was certainly not a man to be influenced against his will i beg therefore to ask my lord that you will pronounce in favor of this second will and issue an order to the trustees to carry out its provisions forthwith  but upon the face of your appeal to the court sir henry there is no question as to the validity of the will you propound set up by the trustees  none my lord in fact at the time the case was put down we were ignorant that there would be any attempt on the part of the trustees to dispute the second will and that they should do so came upon us as a surprise however at a consultation between my learned friend and myself just before we came into court it was agreed that if your lordship would permit it we would take the two matters at once one of the trustees is a member of the firm who are and have been the family lawyers of general mathieson and of his father before him for a long period of years they are gentlemen of wellknown honor who are i am sure as anxious as we are to obtain from your lordship a judicial decision on which they can act  it is irregular the judge said but as both parties seemed agreed upon it it will doubtless save much expense to the estate if the whole matter can be settled at once i will permit the whole matter to be taken now brother herbert we will hear you on the other side  i am sorry to say my lord that it will be impossible for me to imitate my learned brother in the brevity with which he opened the case so far from the facts being extremely simple they are i may say of a very complicated nature we own that we have no explanation to offer with regard to the second will it was strange very strange that general mathieson a man of methodical habits having just drawn up his will should go to another firm of solicitors and draw up a fresh one but the fact that the whole of the minor bequests are the same in the two wills is certainly a very strong proof as also is the fact that the instructions for drafting the will were written by the general himself or at any rate by someone intimately acquainted with the contents of that will which we admit was difficult to believe could be the case as the will from the time it was signed by the general has not been out of messrs farmer  pettigrews hands until it was taken for probate the other day  now my lord i trust that you will allow me a certain amount of license while i go into this somewhat singular story twentythree years ago general mathiesons life was saved in india by mr john simcoe mr simcoe himself was seriously wounded and when he recovered somewhat he was recommended by the surgeon who attended him to go down to calcutta at once and take a sea voyage he did so and embarked upon the ship nepaul which was lost in a terrible gale in the bay of bengal a few days later with as was supposed all hands twenty years passed and then to the surprise and i may say to the delight of the general who had much grieved over the loss of his preserver mr simcoe presented himself for a moment the general did not recognize him but it was not long before he became convinced of his identity for he knew the officers who had been at the station at the time and was well up in the gossip of the place and the general at once hailed him as the man who had saved his life introduced him to many friends got him put up at a good club and became i may say very fond of him mr simcoe brought up a friend or two who had known him at stowmarket where he had an aunt still living and the result of all this was that the general requested messrs farmer  pettigrew to draw up a new will bequeathing to john simcoe the sum of ten thousand pounds  then came the singular episode of the second will a fortnight later when at dinner at his club the general was smitten with a strange kind of fit from which he recovered but only lived for a few months a halfparalyzed invalid he was attended during that time by dr leedsa gentleman with a very high reputation and now practicing in harley street as a consulting physician the general was brought up to town but broke down during the journey and died two days later  now we come to the second strange fact in this strange case a day before his death his grandson walter rivington was missing the efforts of the police aided by a number of private detectives failed to obtain any clew to the child until a body was found in the canal at paddington that the body was dressed in some of the clothes worn by the child when carried off was unquestionable but the three persons who knew walter rivington best namely miss covington a friend of hers named miss purcell who had been all the summer assisting her to nurse general mathieson and the childs own nurse all declared that the body was not that of the generals grandson they were unable to adduce anything in support of this belief beyond the fact that the hair of the child found was short and to some extent bristly whereas that of walter rivington was long and silky the jury however adopted the view of the coroner that hair however soft when cut close to the skull will appear more or less bristly and gave a verdict to the effect that the body was that of walter rivington miss covington and her friends refused to accept the verdict and continued their search for the child  without occupying your attention by going into details my lord i may briefly say that a close watch was set on mr simcoe and it was found that he was exceedingly intimate with a man of whom no one seemed to know anything and before i go further i will ask my lord that you will give orders that mr simcoe shall not leave the court until i have finished  you are not asking without strong reason i trust brother herbert  certainly not my lord  the order was therefore given simcoe grew very white in the face but otherwise maintained an air of stolid indifference  i will now go back for a moment my lord general mathieson was attended by three of the leading physicians in london at the time of his seizure the symptoms were so peculiar that in all their experience they had not met a similar case dr leeds however differed from them but being their junior could not press his opinion but he told them that his opinion was that the fit was due to the administration of some drug unknown to the british pharmacopoeia as the effects were precisely similar to those in cases that he had read of in africa and among other savage people where a poison of this kind was used by the native fetich men or wizards that opinion was confirmed rather than diminished by the subsequent progress of the malady and the final death of his patient the one man who could benefit by the generals death was sitting next to him at dinner at the time of his seizure and that man according to his own statement had been for many years knocking about among the savages of the south sea islands and the islands of the malay archipelago  i do not accuse john simcoe of this crime but i need hardly say that the mere possibility of such a thing heightened the strong feeling entertained by miss covington that simcoe was the author of the abduction of walter rivington she and her devoted friend miss purcell pursued their investigations with unflagging energy they suspected that the man who was very intimate with simcoe had acted as his agent in the matter and a casual remark which was overheard in a singular manner which will be explained when the case goes into another court that this man was going to tilbury gave them a clew then in a manner which many persons might find it very hard to believe miss covington learned from a conversation between the two men when together in a box at her majestys theater that the lad was in charge of a bargeman living near the little village of pitsea in essex from that place my lord he was brought last week and miss covington will produce him in court if your lordship wishes to see him thus then it is immaterial to us whether your lordship pronounces for the first or second will  but my lord i have not finished my story under neither of the wills does that man take a farthing the money was left to john simcoe and john simcoe was drowned over twenty years ago the man standing over there is one william sanderson a sergeant on the paymasters staff at benares when the real john simcoe was there there happened to be a resemblance between this man and him so strong that it was generally remarked upon by his comrades this man sanderson deserted soon after simcoe was drowned taking with him three hundred pounds of the paymasters money there was a sharp hue and cry after him but he managed to make his escape all this is a certainty but we may assume without much difficulty that the man changed his name as soon as he got to calcutta and nothing was more likely than that he should take the name of john simcoe whom he had been told that he so strongly resembled  for twenty years we hear nothing further of william sanderson nor do we hear when he returned to london probably he in some way or other came across the name of general mathieson and remembering what john simcoe had done for the general he on the strength of his personal likeness and the fact that he had for twenty years gone by that name determined to introduce himself to him with the result you know he was clever enough to know that he must answer questions as to his history before he left england and it was desirable to obtain witnesses who would if necessary certify to him but he knew nothing of simcoes birthplace or history so he inserted advertisements in a great number of london and provincial newspapers saying that the relations of the john simcoe who was supposed to have been drowned in the bay of bengal in the year 1832 would hear of something to their advantage at the address given a maiden aunt living at stowmarket did reply he went down there at once rushed into her arms and called her aunt and told her that it was his intention to make her comfortable for life by allowing her fifty pounds per annum he stayed with her for three days and during that time obtained from her gossip full details of his boyhood and youth his friends and their occupation and he then went out and called upon john simcoes old companions all of whom took him on his own word and his knowledge of the past and his recognition by his aunt  so things might have remained this man after undergoing what punishment might be awarded to him for his abduction of walter rivington could have claimed the ten thousand pounds left him by general mathieson had it not been that by what i cannot but consider a dispensation of providence an old comrade of his staffsergeant nichol was attracted to the hall this morning by seeing the name of simcoe and that of general mathieson coupled in the cause list this man was in the hall talking to his professional advisers and nichol walking close to him to see if he could recognize the man whom he had last seen carried wounded into benares at once recognized in the supposed john simcoe the deserter and thief sergeant sanderson he passed him two or three times to assure himself that he was not mistaken happily the deserter had a mark that was ineffaceable he had as a recruit let off his rifle and the ball had passed through the fleshy part of the forearm leaving there as sergeant nichol has informed me an ineffaceable scar blackened by powder if this man is not sergeant sanderson and is the longlost john simcoe he has but to pull up the sleeve of his left arm and show that it is without scar  the man did not move he was half stunned by the sudden and terrible exposure of the whole of his plans as he did not rise the counsel said  my lord i must ask that you give an order for the arrest of this man william sanderson as a deserter and a thief also upon the charge of conspiring with others the abduction of walter rivington  certainly brother herbert the judge said as he saw that the accused made no motion to answer the challenge of the counsel tipstaff take that man into custody on the charge of aiding in the abduction of walter rivington as to the other charge i shall communicate with the authorities of the india office and leave it to them to prosecute if they choose to do so after this lapse of years they may not think it worth while to do so especially as the man is in custody on a still graver charge  the tipstaff moved toward the man who roused himself with a great effort snatched a small glass ball from a pocket inside his waistcoat thrust it between his teeth and bit it into fragments and as the officer laid his hand upon him fell down in a fit dr leeds who had come in just as the trial began rose to his feet  i am a doctor my lord my name is leeds and the opinion i held of the cause of general mathiesons death is now proved to be correct the symptoms of this fit are precisely similar to those of general mathiesons seizure and this man has taken some of the very poison with which he murdered the general  for a minute sanderson struggled in violent convulsions then as dr leeds bent over him his head fell back suddenly dr leeds felt his pulse and then rose to his feet  my lord he said the case is finally closed he has gone to a higher judgment seat     chapter xxvi  a letter from abroad   three days later when hilda returned from a drive she found that dr leeds was in the drawing room with miss purcell and netta whose face at once told what had happened  i have asked the question at last miss covington dr leeds said coming forward to shake hands and netta has consented to be my wife  i am heartily glad that you would ask her i knew from what you told me and although i knew nothing of her thoughts in the matter i felt sure that she would hardly say no netta darling i am glad long ago i thought and hoped that this would come about it seemed to me that it would be such a happy thing  auntie said just the same thing netta said smiling through her tears as hilda embraced her as you both knew you ought to have given me some little hint then i should not have been taken quite by surprise i might have pretended that i did not quite know my own mind and ask for time to think it over instead of surrendering at once  but you did make a condition netta dr leeds laughed  not a conditiona request if you like but certainly not a condition  netta said that her heart was greatly set on the work she had always looked forward to and she hoped that i should let her do something in that way still of course i have heard you both talk over that institute a score of times and i was as much impressed as yourselves with the enormous boon that it would be i should be sorry indeed that the plan should be given up i need hardly say that in the half hour we have had together we did not go deeply into it but we will have a general council about it as soon as we can get down to plain matter of fact netta can talk it over with you and i can talk it over with her and then we can hold a meeting with miss purcell as president of the committee  but matters were not finally settled until the ladies were established at holmwood with walter and dr leeds came down for a short holiday of two or three days then the arrangements were made to the satisfaction of all parties a large house standing in grounds of considerable extent was to be taken in the suburbs of london netta was to be lady superintendent her aunt assisting in the domestic arrangements miss purcell insisted that her savings should be used for furnishing the house hilda was to put in as a loan for the others would receive it in no other way five thousand pounds for working capital she determined to take a house near the institute so that she could run in and out and assist netta in teaching dr leeds was to drive up every morning to harley street where his work was over by two oclock except when he had to attend consultations no arrangements would be necessary about the house as this was the residence of his partner and he only had his own set of rooms there he was steadily making his way and to his surprise already found that the report in the papers of his successful diagnosis of the cause of general mathiesons death had resulted in a considerable addition to his practice as a number of people consulted him on obscure and in many cases fanciful maladies in which they had come to entertain the idea that they were suffering from the effects of poison  now that she was going to assist at the institution and had no intention of entering society again in london hilda had no longer any objection to the power she had acquired being known and when questioned on the subject of the trial made no secret of the manner in which she had made the discovery at the opera and mentioned that she was going to assist in an institution that was about to be established for teaching the system by which she had benefited to deaf children  the matter excited considerable interest in medical circles and by the time that the institution was ready the number of applicants was greater than could be entertained by this time dr leeds and netta were married the engagement was a short one and the wedding took place within two months of their going down into the country with hilda being anxious that as many as possible should participate in the benefits of the system the doors of the institute were at once opened to outdoor pupils who were boarded in the neighborhood six of nettas pupils in hanover were brought over as teachers and a few weeks from its being opened the institution was in full swing as dr leeds wished that no profit whatever be made by the undertaking in which desire he was cordially joined by his wife and hilda the charges were extremely low except in the case of children of wealthy parents the surplus in their case being devoted to taking in free of payment children of the poor  before nettas marriage the interest in the mathieson case was revived by the appearance of a letter in the principal london papers all search for the man who had assisted sanderson in the abduction of the child had been fruitless he had probably taken steps to receive information of how matters were going on in court and long before an officer arrived at rose cottage with a warrant for his arrest he had left and the police had failed to find any trace of his subsequent movements the letter bore the simple heading united states and ran as follows       to the editor       sir i scarcely know why i write this letter but i suppose even      an habitual criminal does not care to remain under an unjust      suspicion i acknowledge that i come under that category and that      my life has been spent in crime although never once has suspicion      attached to me until i became mixed up in the simcoemathieson      affair i wish to state solemnly that i was absolutely ignorant      that the name john simcoe was an assumed one that was the name he      gave me when i first knew him and i believed that he was as he      represented the man who had saved general mathiesons life from a      tiger that he had subsequently lived a rough life in the south      seas i was aware for he came to me with a message sent by a      brother of mine when at the point of death the man had been a chum      of his out there and had gallantly carried him off when he had      received the wound from which he subsequently died in a fight with      a large body of natives i have absolute assurance that this was      true for my brother would never have sent anyone to me except      under altogether extraordinary circumstances the man called on me      when he first returned to england but i saw little of him for the      first two years and then he came to me and said that he had looked      up general mathieson and that the general had taken to him and      put him down in his will for ten thousand pounds he said that      general mathieson was worth a hundred thousand and that he had      planned to get the whole not being in any way squeamish i agreed      at once to help him in any way in my power       his plan briefly was that he should obtain a fresh will      appointing him sole heir to the generals estate in the event of a      boy of six or seven years old dying before he came of age he had      somehow obtained a copy of the generals will and had notes in the      generals handwriting there were two things to be done first that      he should get instructions for the draft of the will drawn up in      precise imitation of the generals handwriting containing all the      provisions of the former will except that he was made heir in      place of miss covington in the event of his grandsons death there      are a dozen men in london who can imitate handwriting so as to      defy detection and i introduced him to one of them who drew up      the instructions then i introduced him to a man who is the      cleverest i knowand i know most of themat getting up disguises       he had already ascertained that the general had on one occasion      been for a minute or two in the offices of messrs halstead       james they would therefore have a vague and only a vague      remembrance of him he had obtained a photograph of the general      who was about his own height and figure and although there was no      facial resemblance the man by the aid of this photograph      converted him into a likeness of the general that would pass with      anyone who had seen him but once casually so disguised he went to      the offices of these solicitors told a plausible story and gave      them the written instructions in the meantime he had been      practicing the generals signature and being a good penman had got      to imitate it so accurately that i doubt if any expert would have      suspected the forgery the lawyers were completely deceived and he      had only to go there again three days later in the same disguise      and sign the will       so much for that then came the generals seizure i most solemnly      declare that i had no shadow of suspicion that it was not a natural      fit and that if i had had such a suspicion i should have chucked      the whole thing over at once for though as i have said an      habitual criminal that is to say one who plans and directs what      may be called sensational robberies i have always insisted that      the men who have worked under me should go unprovided with arms of      any kind and in no case in which i have been concerned has a drop      of blood been shed as to the carrying off of the boy it was      entirely managed by me i had agents men on whom i could rely as      a word of mine would have sent them to penal servitude for life we      knew that suspicion would fall upon simcoe and that it was      important that he should be able to account for every hour of his      time therefore on the day the child was carried away he went down      to stowmarket while i managed the affair and took the child down      to the place where he was hidden in the essex marshes it was i      also who made the arrangements by which the body of the child about      the same age who had died in the workhouse was placed in the      canal in some of the clothes the missing heir had worn when taken      away i owe it to myself to say that in all this there was no      question of payment between this man and myself i am well off and      i acted simply to oblige a man who had stood by the side of my      brother to death whether his name was simcoe or sanderson mattered      nothing to me i should have aided him just the same but i did      believe that it was simcoe and that having risked his life to      save that of general mathieson he had as good a right as another      to his inheritance he never hinted to me that it would be a good      thing if the child was got rid of altogether he knew well enough      that if he had done so i would not only have had nothing to do with      it but that i would have taken steps to have put a stop to his      game altogether now i have only to add that having fairly stated      the part that i bore in this affair i have nothing more to say      except that i have now retired from business altogether and that      this is the last that the world will hear of william sandersons      accomplice  for four or five years hilda covington devoted much of her time to assisting netta leeds in her work but at the end of that time she married her husband was a widower whose wife had died in her first confinement his name was desmond he sold out of the army and hilda never had reason to regret that she had played the part of a gypsy woman at lady moultons fête  walter grew up strong and healthy and is one of the most popular men of his county his early love for the water developed and he served his time as a midshipman in one of her majestys ships and passed as a lieutenant he then retired from the service and bought a fine yacht which he himself commanded his friends were never able to understand why he allowed his nominal skipper william nibson to take his wife on board and gave up two cabins for their accommodation the barge walter passed into the hands of joshua who for many years sailed her most successfully he is
