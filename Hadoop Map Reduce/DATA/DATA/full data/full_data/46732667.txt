46732667	the romantic adventures of a milkmaid  by thomas hardy     chapter i    it was halfpast four oclock by the testimony of the landsurveyor my authority for the particulars of this story a gentleman with the faintest curve of humour on his lips it was halfpast four oclock on a may morning in the eighteen forties  a dense white fog hung over the valley of the exe ending against the hills on either side  but though nothing in the vale could be seen from higher ground notes of differing kinds gave pretty clear indications that bustling life was going on there  this audible presence and visual absence of an active scene had a peculiar effect above the fog level  nature had laid a white hand over the creatures ensconced within the vale as a hand might be laid over a nest of chirping birds  the noises that ascended through the pallid coverlid were perturbed lowings mingled with human voices in sharps and flats and the bark of a dog  these followed by the slamming of a gate explained as well as eyesight could have done to any inhabitant of the district that dairyman tuckers undermilker was driving the cows from the meads into the stalls  when a rougher accent joined in the vociferations of man and beast it would have been realized that the dairyfarmer himself had come out to meet the cows pail in hand and white pinafore on and when moreover some womens voices joined in the chorus that the cows were stalled and proceedings about to commence  a hush followed the atmosphere being so stagnant that the milk could be heard buzzing into the pails together with occasional words of the milkmaids and men  dont ye bide about long upon the road margery  you can be back again by skimmingtime  the rough voice of dairyman tucker was the vehicle of this remark the bartongate slammed again and in two or three minutes a something became visible rising out of the fog in that quarter  the shape revealed itself as that of a woman having a young and agile gait  the colours and other details of her dress were then discloseda bright pink cotton frock because winter was over a small woollen shawl of shepherds plaid because summer was not come a white handkerchief tied over her headgear because it was so foggy so damp and so early and a straw bonnet and ribbons peeping from under the handkerchief because it was likely to be a sunny may day  her face was of the hereditary type among families down in these parts  sweet in expression perfect in hue and somewhat irregular in feature  her eyes were of a liquid brown  on her arm she carried a withy basket in which lay several butterrolls in a nest of wet cabbageleaves  she was the margery who had been told not to bide about long upon the road  she went on her way across the fields sometimes above the fog sometimes below it not much perplexed by its presence except when the track was so indefinite that it ceased to be a guide to the next stile  the dampness was such that innumerable earthworms lay in couples across the path till startled even by her light tread they withdrew suddenly into their holes  she kept clear of all trees why was that  there was no danger of lightning on such a morning as this  but though the roads were dry the fog had gathered in the boughs causing them to set up such a dripping as would go clean through the protecting handkerchief like bullets and spoil the ribbons beneath  the beech and ash were particularly shunned for they dripped more maliciously than any  it was an instance of womans keen appreciativeness of natures moods and peculiarities  a man crossing those fields might hardly have perceived that the trees dripped at all  in less than an hour she had traversed a distance of four miles and arrived at a latticed cottage in a secluded spot  an elderly woman scarce awake answered her knocking  margery delivered up the butter and said how is granny this morning  i cant stay to go up to her but tell her i have returned what we owed her  her grandmother was no worse than usual  and receiving back the empty basket the girl proceeded to carry out some intention which had not been included in her orders  instead of returning to the light labours of skimmingtime she hastened on her direction being towards a little neighbouring town  before however margery had proceeded far she met the postman laden to the neck with letter bags of which he had not yet deposited one  are the shops open yet samuel she said  o no replied that stooping pedestrian not waiting to stand upright  they wont be open yet this hour except the saddler and ironmonger and little tackerhaired machineman for the farm folk they downs their shutters at halfpast six then the bakers at half past seven then the drapers at eight  o the drapers at eight  it was plain that margery had wanted the drapers  the postman turned up a sidepath and the young girl as though deciding within herself that if she could not go shopping at once she might as well get back for the skimming retraced her steps  the public road home from this point was easy but devious  by far the nearest way was by getting over a fence and crossing the private grounds of a picturesque old countryhouse whose chimneys were just visible through the trees  as the house had been shut up for many months the girl decided to take the straight cut  she pushed her way through the laurel bushes sheltering her bonnet with the shawl as an additional safeguard scrambled over an inner boundary went along through more shrubberies and stood ready to emerge upon the open lawn  before doing so she looked around in the wary manner of a poacher  it was not the first time that she had broken fence in her life but somehow and all of a sudden she had felt herself too near womanhood to indulge in such practices with freedom  however she moved forth and the housefront stared her in the face at this higher level unobscured by fog  it was a building of the medium size and unpretending the facade being of stone and of the italian elevation made familiar by inigo jones and his school  there was a doorway to the lawn standing at the head of a flight of steps  the shutters of the house were closed and the blinds of the bedrooms drawn down  her perception of the fact that no crusty caretaker could see her from the windows led her at once to slacken her pace and stroll through the flowerbeds coolly  a house unblinded is a possible spy and must be treated accordingly a house with the shutters together is an insensate heap of stone and mortar to be faced with indifference  on the other side of the house the greensward rose to an eminence whereon stood one of those curious summer shelters sometimes erected on exposed points of view called an alltheyearround  in the present case it consisted of four walls radiating from a centre like the arms of a turnstile with seats in each angle so that whencesoever the wind came it was always possible to find a screened corner from which to observe the landscape  the milkmaids trackless course led her up the hill and past this erection  at ease as to being watched and scolded as an intruder her mind flew to other matters till at the moment when she was not a yard from the shelter she heard a foot or feet scraping on the gravel behind it  some one was in the alltheyearround apparently occupying the seat on the other side as was proved when on turning she saw an elbow a mans elbow projecting over the edge  now the young woman did not much like the idea of going down the hill under the eyes of this person which she would have to do if she went on for as an intruder she was liable to be called back and questioned upon her business there  accordingly she crept softly up and sat in the seat behind intending to remain there until her companion should leave  this he by no means seemed in a hurry to do  what could possibly have brought him there what could detain him there at six oclock on a morning of mist when there was nothing to be seen or enjoyed of the vale beneath puzzled her not a little  but he remained quite still and margery grew impatient  she discerned the track of his feet in the dewy grass forming a line from the house steps which announced that he was an inhabitant and not a chance passerby  at last she peeped round    chapter ii    a fineframed darkmustachioed gentleman in dressinggown and slippers was sitting there in the damp without a hat on  with one hand he was tightly grasping his forehead the other hung over his knee  the attitude bespoke with sufficient clearness a mental condition of anguish  he was quite a different being from any of the men to whom her eyes were accustomed  she had never seen mustachios before for they were not worn by civilians in lower wessex at this date  his hands and his face were whiteto her view deadly white and he heeded nothing outside his own existence  there he remained as motionless as the bushes around him indeed he scarcely seemed to breathe  having imprudently advanced thus far margerys wish was to get back again in the same unseen manner but in moving her foot for the purpose it grated on the gravel  he started up with an air of bewilderment and slipped something into the pocket of his dressing gown  she was almost certain that it was a pistol  the pair stood looking blankly at each other  my gott who are you he asked sternly and with not altogether an english articulation  what do you do here  margery had already begun to be frightened at her boldness in invading the lawn and pleasureseat  the house had a master and she had not known of it  my name is margaret tucker sir she said meekly  my father is dairyman tucker  we live at silverthorn dairyhouse  what were you doing here at this hour of the morning  she told him even to the fact that she had climbed over the fence  and what made you peep round at me  i saw your elbow sir and i wondered what you were doing  and what was i doing  nothing  you had one hand on your forehead and the other on your knee  i do hope you are not ill sir or in deep trouble  margery had sufficient tact to say nothing about the pistol  what difference would it make to you if i were ill or in trouble you dont know me  she returned no answer feeling that she might have taken a liberty in expressing sympathy  but looking furtively up at him she discerned to her surprise that he seemed affected by her humane wish simply as it had been expressed  she had scarcely conceived that such a tall dark man could know what gentle feelings were  well i am much obliged to you for caring how i am said he with a faint smile and an affected lightness of manner which even to her only rendered more apparent the gloom beneath  i have not slept this past night  i suffer from sleeplessness  probably you do not  margery laughed a little and he glanced with interest at the comely picture she presented her fresh face brown hair candid eyes unpractised manner country dress pink hands empty wickerbasket and the handkerchief over her bonnet  well he said after his scrutiny i need hardly have asked such a question of one who is natures own image    ah but my good little friend he added recurring to his bitter tone and sitting wearily down you dont know what great clouds can hang over some peoples lives and what cowards some men are in face of them  to escape themselves they travel take picturesque houses and engage in country sports  but here it is so dreary and the fog was horrible this morning  why this is only the pride of the morning said margery  byand by it will be a beautiful day  she was going on her way forthwith but he detained herdetained her with words talking on every innocent little subject he could think of  he had an object in keeping her there more serious than his words would imply  it was as if he feared to be left alone  while they still stood the misty figure of the postman whom margery had left a quarter of an hour earlier to follow his sinuous course crossed the grounds below them on his way to the house  signifying to margery by a wave of his hand that she was to step back out of sight in the hinder angle of the shelter the gentleman beckoned to the postman to bring the bag to where he stood  the man did so and again resumed his journey  the stranger unlocked the bag and threw it on the seat having taken one letter from within  this he read attentively and his countenance changed  the change was almost phantasmagorial as if the sun had burst through the fog upon that face  it became clear bright almost radiant  yet it was but a change that may take place in the commonest human being provided his countenance be not too wooden or his artifice have not grown to second nature  he turned to margery who was again edging off and seizing her hand appeared as though he were about to embrace her  checking his impulse he said my guardian childmy good friendyou have saved me  what from she ventured to ask  that you may never know  she thought of the weapon and guessed that the letter he had just received had effected this change in his mood but made no observation till he went on to say what did you tell me was your name dear girl  she repeated her name  margaret tucker  he stooped and pressed her hand  sit down for a momentone moment he said pointing to the end of the seat and taking the extremest further end for himself not to discompose her she sat down  it is to ask a question he went on and there must be confidence between us  you have saved me from an act of madness  what can i do for you  nothing sir  nothing  father is very well off and we dont want anything  but there must be some service i can render some kindness some votive offering which i could make and so imprint on your memory as long as you live that i am not an ungrateful man  why should you be grateful to me sir  he shook his head  some things are best left unspoken  now think what would you like to have best in the world  margery made a pretence of reflectingthen fell to reflecting seriously but the negative was ultimately as undisturbed as ever she could not decide on anything she would like best in the world it was too difficult too sudden  very welldont hurry yourself  think it over all day  i ride this afternoon  you livewhere  silverthorn dairyhouse  i will ride that way homeward this evening  do you consider by eight oclock what little article what little treat you would most like of any  i will sir said margery now warming up to the idea  where shall i meet you  or will you call at the house sir  ahno  i should not wish the circumstances known out of which our acquaintance rose  it would be more properbut no  margery too seemed rather anxious that he should not call  i could come out sir she said  my father is oddtempered and perhaps  it was agreed that she should look over a stile at the top of her fathers garden and that he should ride along a bridlepath outside to receive her answer  margery said the gentleman in conclusion now that you have discovered me under ghastly conditions are you going to reveal them and make me an object for the gossip of the curious  no no sir she replied earnestly  why should i do that  you will never tell  never never will i tell what has happened here this morning  neither to your father nor to your friends nor to any one  to no one at all she said  it is sufficient he answered  you mean what you say my dear maiden  now you want to leave me  goodbye  she descended the hill walking with some awkwardness for she felt the strangers eyes were upon her till the fog had enveloped her from his gaze  she took no notice now of the dripping from the trees she was lost in thought on other things  had she saved this handsome melancholy sleepless foreign gentleman who had had a trouble on his mind till the letter came  what had he been going to do  margery could guess that he had meditated death at his own hand  strange as the incident had been in itself to her it had seemed stranger even than it was  contrasting colours heighten each other by being juxtaposed it is the same with contrasting lives  reaching the opposite side of the park there appeared before her for the third time that little old man the footpost  as the turnpike road ran the postmans beat was twelve miles a day six miles out from the town and six miles back at night  but what with zigzags devious ways offsets to country seats curves to farms looped courses and triangles to outlying hamlets the ground actually covered by him was nearer oneandtwenty miles  hence it was that margery who had come straight was still abreast of him despite her long pause  the weighty sense that she was mixed up in a tragical secret with an unknown and handsome stranger prevented her joining very readily in chat with the postman for some time  but a keen interest in her adventure caused her to respond at once when the bowed man of mails said you hit athwart the grounds of mount lodge miss margery or you wouldnt ha met me here  well somebody hey took the old place at last  in acknowledging her route margery brought herself to ask who the new gentleman might be  guide the girls heart  what dont she know  and yet how should yehes only just acomewell nominal hes a fishing gentleman come for the summer only  but more to the subject hes a foreign noble thats lived in england so long as to be without any true country  some of his letters call him baron some squire so that a must be born to something that cant be earned by elbowgrease and christian conduct  he was out this morning awatching the fog postman a said goodmorning  give me the bag  o yes as a civil genteel nobleman enough  took the house for fishing did he  thats what they say and as it can be for nothing else i suppose its true  but in final his healths not good a blieve hes been living too rithe  the london smoke got into his wyndpipe till a couldnt eat  however i shouldnt mind having the run of his kitchen  and what is his name  ahthere you have me  tis a name no mans tongue can tell or even womans except by penandink and good scholarship  it begins with x and who without the machinery of a clock ins inside can speak that  but here tisfrom his letters  the postman with his walkingstick wrote upon the ground  baron von xanten    chapter iii    the day as she had prognosticated turned out fine for weather wisdom was imbibed with their milksops by the children of the exe vale  the impending meeting excited margery and she performed her duties in her fathers house with mechanical unconsciousness  milking skimming cheesemaking were done  her father was asleep in the settle the milkmen and maids were gone home to their cottages and the clock showed a quarter to eight  she dressed herself with care went to the top of the garden and looked over the stile  the view was eastward and a great moon hung before her in a sky which had not a cloud  nothing was moving except on the minutest scale and she remained leaning over the nighthawk sounding his croud from the bough of an isolated tree on the open hill side  here margery waited till the appointed time had passed by three quarters of an hour but no baron came  she had been full of an idea and her heart sank with disappointment  then at last the pacing of a horse became audible on the soft path without leading up from the watermeads simultaneously with which she beheld the form of the stranger riding home as he had said  the moonlight so flooded her face as to make her very conspicuous in the gardengap  ah my maidenwhat is your namemargery he said how came you here  but of course i rememberwe were to meet  and it was to be at eightproh pudori have kept you waiting  it doesnt matter sir  ive thought of something  thought of something  yes sir  you said this morning that i was to think what i would like best in the world and i have made up my mind  i did say soto be sure i did he replied collecting his thoughts  i remember to have had good reason for gratitude to you he placed his hand to his brow and in a minute alighted and came up to her with the bridle in his hand  i was to give you a treat or present and you could not think of one  now you have done so  let me hear what it is and ill be as good as my word  to go to the yeomanry ball thats to be given this month  the yeomanry ballyeomanry ball he murmured as if of all requests in the world this was what he had least expected  where is what you call the yeomanry ball  at exonbury  have you ever been to it before  no sir  or to any ball  no  but did i not say a gifta present  or a treat  ah yes or a treat he echoed with the air of one who finds himself in a slight fix  but with whom would you propose to go  i dont know  i have not thought of that yet  you have no friend who could take you even if i got you an invitation  margery looked at the moon  no one who can dance she said adding with hesitation i was thinking that perhaps  but my dear margery he said stopping her as if he halfdivined what her simple dream of a cavalier had been it is very odd that you can think of nothing else than going to a yeomanry ball  think again  you are sure there is nothing else  quite sure sir she decisively answered  at first nobody would have noticed in that pretty young face any sign of decision yet it was discoverable  the mouth though soft was firm in line the eyebrows were distinct and extended near to each other  i have thought of it all day she continued sadly  still sir if you are sorry you offered me anything i can let you off  sorrycertainly not margery be said rather nettled  ill show you that whatever hopes i have raised in your breast i am honourable enough to gratify  if it lies in my power he added with sudden firmness you shall go to the yeomanry ball  in what building is it to be held  in the assembly rooms  and would you be likely to be recognized there  do you know many people  not many sir  none i may say  i know nobody who goes to balls  ah well you must go since you wish it and if there is no other way of getting over the difficulty of having nobody to take you ill take you myself  would you like me to do so  i can dance  o yes sir i know that and i thought you might offer to do it but would you bring me back again  of course ill bring you back  but bythebye can you dance  yes  what  reels and jigs and countrydances like the newriggedship and followmylover and hastetothewedding and the college hornpipe and the favourite quickstep and captain whites dance  a very good lista very good but unluckily i fear they dont dance any of those now  but if you have the instinct we may soon cure your ignorance  let me see you dance a moment  she stood out into the gardenpath the stile being still between them and seizing a side of her skirt with each hand performed the movements which are even yet far from uncommon in the dances of the villagers of merry england  but her motions though graceful were not precisely those which appear in the figures of a modern ball room  well my good friend it is a very pretty sight he said warming up to the proceedings  but you dance too wellyou dance all over your personand thats too thorough a way for the present day  i should say it was exactly how they danced in the time of your poet chaucer but as people dont dance like it now we must consider first i must inquire more about this ball and then i must see you again  if it is a great trouble to you sir i  o no no  i will think it over  so far so good  the baron mentioned an evening and an hour when he would be passing that way again then mounted his horse and rode away  on the next occasion which was just when the sun was changing places with the moon as an illuminator of silverthorn dairy she found him at the spot before her and unencumbered by a horse  the melancholy that had so weighed him down at their first interview and had been perceptible at their second had quite disappeared  he pressed her right hand between both his own across the stile  my good maiden gott bless you said he warmly  i cannot help thinking of that morning  i was too much overshadowed at first to take in the whole force of it  you do not know all but your presence was a miraculous intervention  now to more cheerful matters   i have a great deal to tellthat is if your wish about the ball be still the same  o yes sirif you dont object  never think of my objecting  what i have found out is something which simplifies matters amazingly  in addition to your yeomanry ball at exonbury there is also to be one in the next county about the same time  this ball is not to be held at the town hall of the countytown as usual but at lord toneboroughs who is colonel of the regiment and who i suppose wishes to please the yeomen because his brother is going to stand for the county  now i find i could take you there very well and the great advantage of that ball over the yeomanry ball in this county is that there you would be absolutely unknown and i also  but do you prefer your own neighbourhood  o no sir  it is a ball i long to seei dont know what it is like it does not matter where  good  then i shall be able to make much more of you there where there is no possibility of recognition  that being settled the next thing is the dancing  now reels and such things do not do  for think of thisthere is a new dance at almacks and everywhere else over which the world has gone crazy  how dreadful  ahbut that is a mere expressiongone mad  it is really an ancient scythian dance but such is the power of fashion that having once been adopted by society this dance has made the tour of the continent in one season  what is its name sir  the polka  young people who always dance are ecstatic about it and old people who have not danced for years have begun to dance again on its account  all share the excitement  it arrived in london only some few months agoit is now all over the country  now this is your opportunity my good margery  to learn this one dance will be enough  they will dance scarce anything else at that ball while to crown all it is the easiest dance in the world and as i know it quite well i can practise you in the step  suppose we try  margery showed some hesitation before crossing the stile  it was a rubicon in more ways than one  but the curious reverence which was stealing over her for all that this stranger said and did was too much for prudence  she crossed the stile  withdrawing with her to a nook where two high hedges met and where the grass was elastic and dry he lightly rested his arm on her waist and practised with her the new step of fascination  instead of music he whispered numbers and she as may be supposed showed no slight aptness in following his instructions  thus they moved round together the moonshadows from the twigs racing over their forms as they turned  the interview lasted about half an hour  then he somewhat abruptly handed her over the stile and stood looking at her from the other side  well he murmured what has come to pass is strange  my whole business after this will be to recover my right mind  margery always declared that there seemed to be some power in the stranger that was more than human something magical and compulsory when he seized her and gently trotted her round  but lingering emotions may have led her memory to play pranks with the scene and her vivid imagination at that youthful age must be taken into account in believing her  however there is no doubt that the stranger whoever he might be and whatever his powers taught her the elements of modern dancing at a certain interview by moonlight at the top of her fathers garden as was proved by her possession of knowledge on the subject that could have been acquired in no other way  his was of the first rank of commanding figures she was one of the most agile of milkmaids and to casual view it would have seemed all of a piece with natures doings that things should go on thus  but there was another side to the case and whether the strange gentleman were a wild olive tree or not it was questionable if the acquaintance would lead to happiness  a fleeting romance and a possible calamity thus it might have been summed up by the practical  margery was in paradise and yet she was not at this date distinctly in love with the stranger  what she felt was something more mysterious more of the nature of veneration  as he looked at her across the stile she spoke timidly on a subject which had apparently occupied her long  i ought to have a balldress ought i not sir  certainly  and you shall have a balldress  really  no doubt of it  i wont do things by halves for my best friend  i have thought of the balldress and of other things also  and is my dancing good enough  quitequite  he paused lapsed into thought and looked at her margery he said do you trust yourself unreservedly to me  o yes sir she replied brightly if i am not too much trouble if i am good enough to be seen in your society  the baron laughed in a peculiar way  really i think you may assume as much as thathowever to business  the ball is on the twenty fifth that is next thursday week and the only difficulty about the dress is the size  suppose you lend me this  and he touched her on the shoulder to signify a tight little jacket she wore  margery was all obedience  she took it off and handed it to him the baron rolled and compressed it with all his force till it was about as large as an appledumpling and put it into his pocket  the next thing he said is about getting the consent of your friends to your going  have you thought of this  there is only my father  i can tell him i am invited to a party and i dont think hell mind  though i would rather not tell him  but it strikes me that you must inform him something of what you intend  i would strongly advise you to do so  he spoke as if rather perplexed as to the probable custom of the english peasantry in such matters and added however it is for you to decide  i know nothing of the circumstances  as to getting to the ball the plan i have arranged is this  the direction to lord toneboroughs being the other way from my house you must meet me at threewalks endin chillington wood two miles or more from here  you know the place  good  by meeting there we shall save five or six miles of journeya consideration as it is a long way  now for the last time  are you still firm in your wish for this particular treat and no other  it is not too late to give it up  cannot you think of something elsesomething bettersome useful household articles you require  margerys countenance which before had been beaming with expectation lost its brightness  her lips became close and her voice broken  you have offered to take me and now  no no no he said patting her cheek  we will not think of anything else  you shall go    chapter iv    but whether the baron in naming such a distant spot for the rendezvous was in hope she might fail him and so relieve him after all of his undertaking cannot be said though it might have been strongly suspected from his manner that he had no great zest for the responsibility of escorting her  but he little knew the firmness of the young woman he had to deal with  she was one of those soft natures whose power of adhesiveness to an acquired idea seems to be one of the special attributes of that softness  to go to a ball with this mysterious personage of romance was her ardent desire and aim and none the less in that she trembled with fear and excitement at her position in so aiming  she felt the deepest awe tenderness and humility towards the baron of the strange name and yet she was prepared to stick to her point  thus it was that the afternoon of the eventful day found margery trudging her way up the slopes from the vale to the place of appointment  she walked to the music of innumerable birds which increased as she drew away from the open meads towards the groves  she had overcome all difficulties  after thinking out the question of telling or not telling her father she had decided that to tell him was to be forbidden to go  her contrivance therefore was this to leave home this evening on a visit to her invalid grandmother who lived not far from the barons house but not to arrive at her grandmothers till breakfasttime next morning  who would suspect an intercalated experience of twelve hours with the baron at a ball that this piece of deception was indefensible she afterwards owned readily enough but she did not stop to think of it then  it was sunset within chillington wood by the time she reached three walksendthe converging point of radiating trackways now floored with a carpet of matted grass which had never known other scythes than the teeth of rabbits and hares  the twitter overhead had ceased except from a few braver and larger birds including the cuckoo who did not fear night at this pleasant time of year  nobody seemed to be on the spot when she first drew near but no sooner did margery stand at the intersection of the roads than a slight crashing became audible and her patron appeared  he was so transfigured in dress that she scarcely knew him  under a light greatcoat which was flung open instead of his ordinary clothes he wore a suit of thin black cloth an open waistcoat with a frill all down his shirt front a white tie shining boots no thicker than a glove a coat that made him look like a bird and a hat that seemed as if it would open and shut like an accordion  i am dressed for the ballnothing worse he said drily smiling so will you be soon  why did you choose this place for our meeting sir she asked looking around and acquiring confidence  why did i choose it  well because in riding past one day i observed a large hollow tree close by here and it occurred to me when i was last with you that this would be useful for our purpose have you told your father  i have not yet told him sir  thats very bad of you margery  how have you arranged it then  she briefly related her plan on which he made no comment but taking her by the hand as if she were a little child he led her through the undergrowth to a spot where the trees were older and standing at wider distances  among them was the tree he had spoken ofan elm huge hollow distorted and headless with a rift in its side  now go inside he said before it gets any darker  you will find there everything you want  at any rate if you do not you must do without it  ill keep watch and dont be longer than you can help to be  what am i to do sir asked the puzzled maiden  go inside and you will see  when you are ready wave your handkerchief at that hole  she stooped into the opening  the cavity within the tree formed a lofty circular apartment four or five feet in diameter to which daylight entered at the top and also through a round hole about six feet from the ground marking the spot at which a limb had been amputated in the trees prime  the decayed wood of cinnamonbrown forming the inner surface of the tree and the warm evening glow reflected in at the top suffused the cavity with a faint mellow radiance  but margery had hardly given herself time to heed these things  her eye had been caught by objects of quite another quality  a large white oblong paper box lay against the inside of the tree over it on a splinter hung a small oval lookingglass  margery seized the idea in a moment  she pressed through the rift into the tree lifted the cover of the box and behold there was disclosed within a lovely white apparition in a somewhat flattened state  it was the balldress  this marvel of art was briefly a sort of heavenly cobweb  it was a gossamer texture of precious manufacture artistically festooned in a dozen flounces or more  margery lifted it and could hardly refrain from kissing it  had any one told her before this moment that such a dress could exist she would have said no its impossible  she drew back went forward flushed laughed raised her hands  to say that the maker of that dress had been an individual of talent was simply understatement  he was a genius and she sunned herself in the rays of his creation  she then remembered that her friend without had told her to make haste and she spasmodically proceeded to array herself  in removing the dress she found satin slippers gloves a handkerchief nearly all lace a fan and even flowers for the hair  o how could he think of it she said clasping her hands and almost crying with agitation  and the glasshow good of him  everything was so well prepared that to clothe herself in these garments was a matter of ease  in a quarter of an hour she was ready even to shoes and gloves  but what led her more than anything else into admiration of the barons foresight was the discovery that there were halfadozen pairs each of shoes and gloves of varying sizes out of which she selected a fit  margery glanced at herself in the mirror or at as much as she could see of herself  the image presented was superb  then she hastily rolled up her old dress put it in the box and thrust the latter on a ledge as high as she could reach  standing on tiptoe she waved the handkerchief through the upper aperture and bent to the rift to go out  but what a trouble stared her in the face  the dress was so airy so fantastical and so extensive that to get out in her new clothes by the rift which had admitted her in her old ones was an impossibility she heard the barons steps crackling over the dead sticks and leaves  o sir she began in despair  whatcant you dress yourself he inquired from the back of the trunk  yes but i cant get out of this dreadful tree  he came round to the opening stooped and looked in  it is obvious that you cannot he said taking in her compass at a glance and adding to himself charming who would have thought that clothes could do so muchwait a minute my little maid  i have it he said more loudly  with all his might he kicked at the sides of the rift and by that means broke away several pieces of the rotten touchwood  but being thinly armed about the feet he abandoned that process and went for a fallen branch which lay near  by using the large end as a lever he tore away pieces of the wooden shell which enshrouded margery and all her loveliness till the aperture was large enough for her to pass without tearing her dress  she breathed her relief  the silly girl had begun to fear that she would not get to the ball after all  he carefully wrapped round her a cloak he had brought with him  it was hooded and of a length which covered her to the heels  the carriage is waiting down the other path he said and gave her his arm  a short trudge over the soft dry leaves brought them to the place indicated  there stood the brougham the horses the coachman all as still as if they were growing on the spot like the trees  margerys eyes rose with some timidity to the coachmans figure  you need not mind him said the baron  he is a foreigner and heeds nothing  in the space of a short minute she was handed inside the baron buttoned up his overcoat and surprised her by mounting with the coachman  the carriage moved off silently over the long grass of the vista the shadows deepening to black as they proceeded  darker and darker grew the night as they rolled on the neighbourhood familiar to margery was soon left behind and she had not the remotest idea of the direction they were taking  the stars blinked out the coachman lit his lamps and they bowled on again  in the course of an hour and a half they arrived at a small town where they pulled up at the chief inn and changed horses all being done so readily that their advent had plainly been expected  the journey was resumed immediately  her companion never descended to speak to her whenever she looked out there he sat upright on his perch with the mien of a person who had a difficult duty to perform and who meant to perform it properly at all costs  but margery could not help feeling a certain dread at her situationalmost indeed a wish that she had not come  once or twice she thought suppose he is a wicked man who is taking me off to a foreign country and will never bring me home again  but her characteristic persistence in an original idea sustained her against these misgivings except at odd moments  one incident in particular had given her confidence in her escort  she had seen a tear in his eye when she expressed her sorrow for his troubles  he may have divined that her thoughts would take an uneasy turn for when they stopped for a moment in ascending a hill he came to the window  are you tired margery he asked kindly  no sir  are you afraid  nno sir  but it is a long way  we are almost there he answered  and now margery he said in a lower tone i must tell you a secret  i have obtained this invitation in a peculiar way  i thought it best for your sake not to come in my own name and this is how i have managed  a man in this county for whom i have lately done a service one whom i can trust and who is personally as unknown here as you and i has privately transferred his card of invitation to me  so that we go under his name  i explain this that you may not say anything imprudent by accident  keep your ears open and be cautious  having said this the baron retreated again to his place  then he is a wicked man after all she said to herself for he is going under a false name  but she soon had the temerity not to mind it  wickedness of that sort was the one ingredient required just now to finish him off as a hero in her eyes  they descended a hill passed a lodge then up an avenue and presently there beamed upon them the light from other carriages drawn up in a file which moved on by degrees and at last they halted before a large arched doorway round which a group of people stood  we are among the latest arrivals on account of the distance said the baron reappearing  but never mind there are three hours at least for your enjoyment  the steps were promptly flung down and they alighted  the steam from the flanks of their swarthy steeds as they seemed to her ascended to the parapet of the porch and from their nostrils the hot breath jetted forth like smoke out of volcanoes attracting the attention of all    chapter v    the bewildered margery was led by the baron up the steps to the interior of the house whence the sounds of music and dancing were already proceeding  the tones were strange  at every fourth beat a deep and mighty note throbbed through the air reaching margerys soul with all the force of a blow  what is that powerful tune siri have never heard anything like it she said  the drum polka answered the baron  the strange dance i spoke of and that we practisedintroduced from my country and other parts of the continent  her surprise was not lessened when at the entrance to the ballroom she heard the names of her conductor and herself announced as mr and miss brown  however nobody seemed to take any notice of the announcement the room beyond being in a perfect turmoil of gaiety and margerys consternation at sailing under false colours subsided  at the same moment she observed awaiting them a handsome darkhaired rather petite lady in creamcoloured satin  who is she asked margery of the baron  she is the lady of the mansion he whispered  she is the wife of a peer of the realm the daughter of a marquis has five christian names and hardly ever speaks to commoners except for political purposes  how divinewhat joy to be here murmured margery as she contemplated the diamonds that flashed from the head of her ladyship who was just inside the ballroom door in front of a little gilded chair upon which she sat in the intervals between one arrival and another  she had come down from london at great inconvenience to herself openly to promote this entertainment  as mr and miss brown expressed absolutely no meaning to lady toneborough for there were three browns already present in this rather mixed assembly and as there was possibly a slight awkwardness in poor margerys manner lady toneborough touched their hands lightly with the tips of her long gloves said how dye do and turned round for more comers  ah if she only knew we were a rich baron and his friend and not mr and miss brown at all she wouldnt receive us like that would she whispered margery confidentially  indeed she wouldnt drily said the baron  now let us drop into the dance at once some of the people here you see dance much worse than you  almost before she was aware she had obeyed his mysterious influence by giving him one hand placing the other upon his shoulder and swinging with him round the room to the steps she had learnt on the sward  at the first gaze the apartment had seemed to her to be floored with black ice the figures of the dancers appearing upon it upside down at last she realized that it was highlypolished oak but she was none the less afraid to move  i am afraid of falling down she said  lean on me you will soon get used to it he replied  you have no nails in your shoes now dear  his words like all his words to her were quite true  she found it amazingly easy in a brief space of time  the floor far from hindering her was a positive assistance to one of her natural agility and litheness  moreover her marvellous dress of twelve flounces inspired her as nothing else could have done  externally a new creature she was prompted to new deeds  to feel as welldressed as the other women around her is to set any woman at her ease whencesoever she may have come  to feel much better dressed is to add radiance to that ease  her prophets statement on the popularity of the polka at this juncture was amply borne out  it was among the first seasons of its general adoption in country houses the enthusiasm it excited to night was beyond description and scarcely credible to the youth of the present day  a new motive power had been introduced into the world of poesythe polka as a counterpoise to the new motive power that had been introduced into the world of prosesteam  twenty finished musicians sat in the music gallery at the end with romantic mopheads of raven hair under which their faces and eyes shone like fire under coals  the nature and object of the ball had led to its being very inclusive  every rank was there from the peer to the smallest yeoman and margery got on exceedingly well particularly when the recuperative powers of supper had banished the fatigue of her long drive  sometimes she heard people saying who are theybrother and sisterfather and daughter  and never dancing except with each otherhow odd  but of this she took no notice  when not dancing the watchful baron took her through the drawing rooms and picturegalleries adjoining which tonight were thrown open like the rest of the house and there ensconcing her in some curtained nook he drew her attention to scrapbooks prints and albums and left her to amuse herself with turning them over till the dance in which she was practised should again be called  margery would much have preferred to roam about during these intervals but the words of the baron were law and as he commanded so she acted in such alternations the evening winged away till at last came the gloomy words margery our time is up  one moreonly one she coaxed for the longer they stayed the more freely and gaily moved the dance  this entreaty he granted but on her asking for yet another he was inexorable  no he said  we have a long way to go  then she bade adieu to the wondrous scene looking over her shoulder as they withdrew from the hall and in a few minutes she was cloaked and in the carriage  the baron mounted to his seat on the box where she saw him light a cigar they plunged under the trees and she leant back and gave herself up to contemplate the images that filled her brain  the natural result followed  she fell asleep  she did not awake till they stopped to change horses when she saw against the stars the baron sitting as erect as ever  he watches like the angel gabriel when all the world is asleep she thought  with the resumption of motion she slept again and knew no more till he touched her hand and said our journey is donewe are in chillington wood  it was almost daylight  margery scarcely knew herself to be awake till she was out of the carriage and standing beside the baron who having told the coachman to drive on to a certain point indicated turned to her  now he said smiling run across to the hollow tree you know where it is  ill wait as before while you perform the reverse operation to that you did last night  she took no heed of the path now nor regarded whether her pretty slippers became scratched by the brambles or no  a walk of a few steps brought her to the particular tree which she had left about nine hours earlier  it was still gloomy at this spot the morning not being clear  she entered the trunk dislodged the box containing her old clothing pulled off the satin shoes and gloves dress and in ten minutes emerged in the cotton and shawl of shepherds plaid  baron was not far off  now you look the milkmaid again he said coming towards her  where is the finery  packed in the box sir as i found it  she spoke with more humility now  the difference between them was greater than it had been at the ball  good he said  i must just dispose of it and then away we go  he went back to the tree margery following at a little distance bringing forth the box he pulled out the dress as carelessly as if it had been rags  but this was not all  he gathered a few dry sticks crushed the lovely garment into a loose billowy heap threw the gloves fan and shoes on the top then struck a light and ruthlessly set fire to the whole  margery was agonized  she ran forward she implored and entreated please sirdo spare itdo  my lovely dressmydear dear slippersmy fanit is cruel  dont burn them please  nonsense  we shall have no further use for them if we live a hundred years  but spare a bit of itone little piece sira scrap of the lace one bow of the ribbonthe lovely fanjust something  but he was as immoveable as rhadamanthus  no he said with a stern gaze of his aristocratic eye  it is of no use for you to speak like that  the things are my property  i undertook to gratify you in what you might desire because you had saved my life  to go to a ball you said  you might much more wisely have said anything else but no you said to go to a ball  very welli have taken you to a ball  i have brought you back  the clothes were only the means and i dispose of them my own way  have i not a right to  yes sir she said meekly  he gave the fire a stir and lace and ribbons and the twelve flounces and the embroidery and all the rest crackled and disappeared  he then put in her hands the butter basket she had brought to take on to her grandmothers and accompanied her to the edge of the wood where it merged in the undulating open country in which her granddame dwelt  now margery he said here we part  i have performed my contractat some awkwardness if i was recognized  but never mind that  how do you feelsleepy  not at all sir she said  that long nap refreshed you eh  now you must make me a promise that if i require your presence at any time you will come to me    i am a man of more than one mood he went on with sudden solemnity and i may have desperate need of you again to deliver me from that darkness as of death which sometimes encompasses me promise it margerypromise it that no matter what stands in the way you will come to me if i require you  i would have if you had not burnt my pretty clothes she pouted  ahungrateful  indeed then i will promise sir she said from her heart wherever i am if i have bodily strength i will come to you  he pressed her hand  it is a solemn promise he replied  now i must go for you know your way  i shall hardly believe that it has not been all a dream she said with a childish instinct to cry at his withdrawal  there will be nothing left of last nightnothing of my dress nothing of my pleasure nothing of the place  you shall remember it in this way said he  well cut our initials on this tree as a memorial so that whenever you walk this path you will see them  then with a knife he inscribed on the smooth bark of a beech tree the letters mt and underneath a large x  what have you no christian name sir she said  yes but i dont use it  now goodbye my little friendwhat will you do with yourself today when you are gone from me he lingered to ask  ohi shall go to my grannys she replied with some gloom and have breakfast and dinner and tea with her i suppose and in the evening i shall go home to silverthorn dairy and perhaps jim will come to meet me and all will be the same as usual  who is jim  o hes nobodyonly the young man ive got to marry some day  whatyou engaged to be marriedwhy didnt you tell me this before  ii dont know sir  what is the young mans name  james hayward  what is he  a master limeburner  engaged to a master limeburner and not a word of this to me margery margery when shall a straightforward one of your sex be found  subtle even in your simplicity  what mischief have you caused me to do through not telling me this  i wouldnt have so endangered anybodys happiness for a thousand pounds  wicked girl that you were why didnt you tell me  i thought id better not said margery beginning to be frightened  but dont you see and understand that if you are already the property of a young man and he were to find out this nights excursion he may be angry with you and part from you for ever  with him already in the field i had no right to take you at all he undoubtedly ought to have taken you which really might have been arranged if you had not deceived me by saying you had nobody  margerys face wore that aspect of woe which comes from the repentant consciousness of having been guilty of an enormity  but he wasnt good enough to take me sir she said almost crying and he isnt absolutely my master until i have married him is he  thats a subject i cannot go into  however we must alter our tactics  instead of advising you as i did at first to tell of this experience to your friends i must now impress on you that it will be best to keep a silent tongue on the matterperhaps for ever and ever  it may come right some day and you may be able to say alls well that ends well  now good morning my friend  think of jim and forget me  ah perhaps i cant do that she said with a tear in her eye and a full throat  welldo your best  i can say no more  he turned and retreated into the wood and margery sighing went on her way    chapter vi    between six and seven oclock in the evening of the same day a young man descended the hills into the valley of the exe at a point about midway between silverthorn and the residence of margerys grandmother four miles to the east  he was a thoroughbred son of the country as far removed from what is known as the provincial as the latter is from the outandout gentleman of culture  his trousers and waistcoat were of fustian almost white but he wore a jacket of oldfashioned blue westof england cloth so well preserved that evidently the article was relegated to a box whenever its owner engaged in such active occupations as he usually pursued  his complexion was fair almost florid and he had scarcely any beard  a novel attraction about this young man which a glancing stranger would know nothing of was a rare and curious freshness of atmosphere that appertained to him to his clothes to all his belongings even to the room in which he had been sitting  it might almost have been said that by adding him and his implements to an overcrowded apartment you made it healthful  this resulted from his trade  he was a limeburner he handled lime daily and in return the lime rendered him an incarnation of salubrity  his hair was dry fair and frizzled the latter possibly by the operation of the same caustic agent  he carried as a walkingstick a green sapling whose growth had been contorted to a corkscrew pattern by a twining honeysuckle  as he descended to the level ground of the watermeadows he cast his glance westward with a frequency that revealed him to be in search of some object in the distance  it was rather difficult to do this the low sunlight dazzling his eyes by glancing from the river away there and from the carriers as they were called in his path narrow artificial brooks for conducting the water over the grass his course was something of a zigzag from the necessity of finding points in these carriers convenient for jumping  thus peering and leaping and winding he drew near the exe the central river of the mileslong mead  a moving spot became visible to him in the direction of his scrutiny mixed up with the rays of the same river  the spot got nearer and revealed itself to be a slight thing of pink cotton and shepherds plaid which pursued a path on the brink of the stream  the young man so shaped his trackless course as to impinge on the path a little ahead of this coloured form and when he drew near her he smiled and reddened  the girl smiled back to him but her smile had not the life in it that the young mans had shown  my dear margeryhere i am he said gladly in an undertone as with a last leap he crossed the last intervening carrier and stood at her side  youve come all the way from the kiln on purpose to meet me and you shouldnt have done it she reproachfully returned  we finished there at four so it was no trouble and if it had been why i should ha come  a small sigh was the response  what you are not even so glad to see me as you would be to see your dog or cat he continued  come misess margery this is rather hard  but by george how tired you dew look  why if youd been up all night your eyes couldnt be more like teasaucers  youve walked tew far thats what it is  the weather is getting warm now and the air of these lowlying meads is not strengthening in summer  i wish you lived up on higher ground with me beside the kiln  youd get as strong as a hoss  well there all that will come in time  instead of saying yes the fair maid repressed another sigh  what wont it then he said  i suppose so she answered  if it is to be it is  well saidvery well said my dear  and if it isnt to be it isnt  what  whos been putting that into your head  your grumpy granny i suppose  however how is she  margery i have been thinking to dayin fact i was thinking it yesterday and all the weekthat really we might settle our little business this summer  this summer she repeated with some dismay  but the partnership remember it was not to be till after that was completed  there i have you said he taking the liberty to pat her shoulder and the further liberty of advancing his hand behind it to the other the partnership is settled  tis vine and hayward limeburners now and richard vine no longer  yes cousin richard has settled it so for a time at least and tis to be painted on the carts this weekblue lettersyaller ground  ill boss one of em and drive en round to your door as soon as the paint is dry to show ee how it looks  oh i am sure you neednt take that trouble jim i can see it quite well enough in my mind replied the young girlnot without a flitting accent of superiority  hullo said jim taking her by the shoulders and looking at her hard  what dew that bit of incivility mean  now margery lets sit down here and have this cleared  he rapped with his stick upon the rail of a little bridge they were crossing and seated himself firmly leaving a place for her  but i want to get homealong dear jim she coaxed  fidgets  sit down theres a dear  i want a straightforward answer if you please  in what month and on what day of the month will you marry me  o jim she said sitting gingerly on the edge thats too plain spoken for you yet  before i look at it in that business light i should have toto  but your father has settled it long ago and you said it should be as soon as i became a partner  so dear you must not mind a plain man wanting a plain answer  come name your time  she did not reply at once  what thoughts were passing through her brain during the interval  not images raised by his words but whirling figures of men and women in red and white and blue reflected from a glassy floor in movements timed by the thrilling beats of the drum polka  at last she said slowly jim you dont know the world and what a womans wants can be  but i can make you comfortable  i am in lodgings as yet but i can have a house for the asking and as to furniture you shall choose of the best for yourselfthe very best  the best  far are you from knowing what that is said the little woman  there be ornaments such as you never dream of worktables that would set you in amaze silver candlesticks tea and coffee pots that would dazzle your eyes teacups and saucers gilded all over with guineagold heavy velvet curtains gold clocks pictures and lookingglasses beyond your very dreams  so dont say i shall have the best  hm said jim gloomily and fell into reflection  where did you get those high notions from margery he presently inquired  ill swear you hadnt got em a week ago  she did not answer and he added yew dont expect to have such things i hope deserve them as you may  i was not exactly speaking of what i wanted she said severely  i said things a woman could want  and since you wish to know what i can want to quite satisfy me i assure you i can want those  you are a pinkandwhite conundrum margery he said and i give you up for tonight  anybody would think the devil had showed you all the kingdoms of the world since i saw you last  she reddened  perhaps he has she murmured then arose he following her and they soon reached margerys home approaching it from the lower or meadow sidethe opposite to that of the garden top where she had met the baron  youll come in wont you jim she said with more ceremony than heartiness  noi think not tonight he answered  ill consider what youve said  you are very good jim she returned lightly  goodbye    chapter vii    jim thoughtfully retraced his steps  he was a village character and he had a villagers simplicity  that is the simplicity which comes from the lack of a complicated experience  but simple by nature he certainly was not  among the rank and file of rustics he was quite a talleyrand or rather had been one till he lost a good deal of his selfcommand by falling in love  now however that the charming object of his distraction was out of sight he could deliberate and measure and weigh things with some approach to keenness  the substance of his queries was what change had come over margerywhence these new notions  ponder as he would he could evolve no answer save one which eminently unsatisfactory as it was he felt it would be unreasonable not to accept  that she was simply skittish and ambitious by nature and would not be hunted into matrimony till he had provided a well adorned home  jim retrod the miles to the kiln and looked to the fires  the kiln stood in a peculiar interesting even impressive spot  it was at the end of a short ravine in a limestone formation and all around was an open hilly down  the nearest house was that of jims cousin and partner which stood on the outskirts of the down beside the turnpikeroad  from this house a little lane wound between the steep escarpments of the ravine till it reached the kiln which faced down the miniature valley commanding it as a fort might command a defile  the idea of a fort in this association owed little to imagination for on the nibbled green steep above the kiln stood a byegone worn out specimen of such an erection huge impressive and difficult to scale even now in its decay  it was a british castle or entrenchment with triple rings of defence rising roll behind roll their outlines cutting sharply against the sky and jims kiln nearly undermining their base  when the limekiln flared up in the night which it often did its fires lit up the front of these ramparts to a great majesty  they were old friends of his and while keeping up the heat through the long darkness as it was sometimes his duty to do he would imagine the dancing lights and shades about the stupendous earthwork to be the forms of those giants who he supposed had heaped it up  often he clambered upon it and walked about the summit thinking out the problems connected with his business his partner his future his margery  it was what he did this evening continuing the meditation on the young girls manner that he had begun upon the road and still as then finding no clue to the change  while thus engaged he observed a man coming up the ravine to the kiln  business messages were almost invariably left at the house below and jim watched the man with the interest excited by a belief that he had come on a personal matter  on nearer approach jim recognized him as the gardener at mount lodge some miles away  if this meant business the baron of whose arrival jim had vaguely heard was a new and unexpected customer  it meant nothing else apparently  the mans errand was simply to inform jim that the baron required a load of lime for the garden  you might have saved yourself trouble by leaving word at mr vines said jim  i was to see you personally said the gardener and to say that the baron would like to inquire of you about the different qualities of lime proper for such purposes  couldnt you tell him yourself said jim  he said i was to tell you that replied the gardener and it wasnt for me to interfere  no motive other than the ostensible one could possibly be conjectured by jim hayward at this time and the next morning he started with great pleasure in his best business suit of clothes  by eleven oclock he and his horse and cart had arrived on the barons premises and the lime was deposited where directed an exceptional spot just within view of the windows of the south front  baron von xanten pale and melancholy was sauntering in the sun on the slope between the house and the alltheyearround  he looked across to where jim and the gardener were standing and the identity of hayward being established by what he brought the baron came down and the gardener withdrew  the barons first inquiries were as jim had been led to suppose they would be on the exterminating effects of lime upon slugs and snails in its different conditions of slaked and unslaked ground and in the lump  he appeared to be much interested by jims explanations and eyed the young man closely whenever he had an opportunity  and i hope trade is prosperous with you this year said the baron  very my noble lord replied jim who in his uncertainty on the proper method of address wisely concluded that it was better to err by giving too much honour than by giving too little  in short trade is looking so well that ive become a partner in the firm  indeed i am glad to hear it  so now you are settled in life  well my lord i am hardly settled even now  for ive got to finish iti mean to get married  thats an easy matter compared with the partnership  now a man might think so my baron said jim getting more confidential  but the real truth is tis the hardest part of all for me  your suit prospers i hope  it dont said jim  it dont at all just at present  in short i cant for the life o me think whats come over the young woman lately  and he fell into deep reflection  though jim did not observe it the barons brow became shadowed with selfreproach as he heard those simple words and his eyes had a look of pity  indeedsince when he asked  since yesterday my noble lord  jim spoke meditatively  he was resolving upon a bold stroke  why not make a confidant of this kind gentleman instead of the parson as he had intended  the thought was no sooner conceived than acted on  my lord he resumed i have heard that you are a nobleman of great scope and talent who has seen more strange countries and characters than i have ever heard of and know the insides of men well  therefore i would fain put a question to your noble lordship if i may so trouble you and having nobody else in the world who could inform me so trewly  any advice i can give is at your service hayward  what do you wish to know  it is this my baron  what can i do to bring down a young womans ambition thats got to such a towering height theres no reaching it or compassing it  how get her to be pleased with me and my station as she used to be when i first knew her  truly thats a hard question my man  what does she aspire to  shes got a craze for fine furniture  how long has she had it  only just now  the baron seemed still more to experience regret  what furniture does she specially covet he asked  silver candlesticks worktables lookingglasses gold teathings silver teapots gold clocks curtains pictures and i dont know what allthings i shall never get if i live to be a hundrednot so much that i couldnt raise the money to buy em as that to put it to other uses or save it for a rainy day  you think the possession of those articles would make her happy  i really think they might my lord  good  open your pocketbook and write as i tell you  jim in some astonishment did as commanded and elevating his pocket book against the gardenwall thoroughly moistened his pencil and wrote at the barons dictation  pair of silver candlesticks  inlaid worktable and workbox  one large mirror  two small ditto  one gilt china tea and coffee service  one silver teapot coffeepot sugarbasin jug and dozen spoons  french clock  pair of curtains  six large pictures  now said the baron tear out that leaf and give it to me  keep a close tongue about this go home and dont be surprised at anything that may come to your door  but my noble lord you dont mean that your lordship is going to give  never mind what i am going to do  only keep your own counsel  i perceive that though a plain countryman you are by no means deficient in tact and understanding  if sending these things to you gives me pleasure why should you object  the fact is hayward i occasionally take an interest in people and like to do a little for them  i take an interest in you  now go home and a week hence invite margthe young woman and her father to tea with you  the rest is in your own hands  a question often put to jim in after times was why it had not occurred to him at once that the barons liberal conduct must have been dictated by something more personal than sudden spontaneous generosity to him a stranger  to which jim always answered that admitting the existence of such generosity there had appeared nothing remarkable in the baron selecting himself as its object  the baron had told him that he took an interest in him and selfesteem even with the most modest is usually sufficient to override any little difficulty that might occur to an outsider in accounting for a preference  he moreover considered that foreign noblemen rich and eccentric might have habits of acting which were quite at variance with those of their english compeers  so he drove off homeward with a lighter heart than he had known for several days  to have a foreign gentleman take a fancy to himwhat a triumph to a plain sort of fellow who had scarcely expected the baron to look in his face  it would be a fine story to tell margery when the baron gave him liberty to speak out  jim lodged at the house of his cousin and partner richard vine a widower of fifty odd years  having failed in the development of a household of direct descendants this tradesman had been glad to let his chambers to his much younger relative when the latter entered on the business of lime manufacture and their intimacy had led to a partnership  jim lived upstairs his partner lived down and the furniture of all the rooms was so plain and old fashioned as to excite the special dislike of miss margery tucker and even to prejudice her against jim for tolerating it  not only were the chairs and tables queer but with due regard to the principle that a mans surroundings should bear the impress of that mans life and occupation the chief ornaments of the dwelling were a curious collection of calcinations that had been discovered from time to time in the limekilnmisshapen ingots of strange substance some of them like pompeian remains  the head of the firm was a quietliving narrowminded though friendly man of fifty and he took a serious interest in jims love suit frequently inquiring how it progressed and assuring jim that if he chose to marry he might have all the upper floor at a low rent he mr vine contenting himself entirely with the ground level  it had been so convenient for discussing business matters to have jim in the same house that he did not wish any change to be made in consequence of a change in jims domestic estate  margery knew of this wish and of jims concurrent feeling and did not like the idea at all  about four days after the young mans interview with the baron there drew up in front of jims house at noon a waggon laden with cases and packages large and small  they were all addressed to mr hayward and they had come from the largest furnishing warehouses in that part of england  threequarters of an hour were occupied in getting the cases to jims rooms  the wary jim did not show the amazement he felt at his patrons munificence and presently the senior partner came into the passage and wondered what was lumbering upstairs  ohits only some things of mine said jim coolly  bearing upon the coming eventeh said his partner  exactly replied jim  mr vine with some astonishment at the number of cases shortly after went away to the kiln whereupon jim shut himself into his rooms and there he might have been heard ripping up and opening boxes with a cautious hand afterwards appearing outside the door with them empty and carrying them off to the outhouse  a triumphant look lit up his face when a little later in the afternoon he sent into the vale to the dairy and invited margery and her father to his house to supper  she was not unsociable that day and her father expressing a hard and fast acceptance of the invitation she perforce agreed to go with him  meanwhile at home jim made himself as mysteriously busy as before in those rooms of his and when his partner returned he too was asked to join in the supper  at dusk hayward went to the door where he stood till he heard the voices of his guests from the direction of the low grounds now covered with their frequent fleece of fog  the voices grew more distinct and then on the white surface of the fog there appeared two trunkless heads from which bodies and a horse and cart gradually extended as the approaching pair rose towards the house  when they had entered jim pressed margerys hand and conducted her up to his rooms her father waiting below to say a few words to the senior limeburner  bless me said jim to her on entering the sittingroom i quite forgot to get a light beforehand but ill have one in a jiffy  margery stood in the middle of the dark room while jim struck a match and then the young girls eyes were conscious of a burst of light and the rise into being of a pair of handsome silver candlesticks containing two candles that jim was in the act of lighting  whywhereyou have candlesticks like that said margery  her eyes flew round the room as the growing candleflames showed other articles  pictures tooand lovely chinawhy i knew nothing of this i declare  yesa few things that came to me by accident said jim in quiet tones  and a great gold clock under a glass and a cupid swinging for a pendulum and o what a lovely worktablewoods of every colourand a workbox to match  may i look inside that workbox jimwhose is it  o yes look at it of course  it is a poor enough thing but tis mine and it will belong to the woman i marry whoever she may be as well as all the other things here  and the curtains and the lookingglasses  why i declare i can see myself in a hundred places  that teaset said jim placidly pointing to a gorgeous china service and a large silver teapot on the side table i dont use at present being a bachelorman but says i to myself whoever i marry will want some such things for giving her parties or i can sell embut i havent took steps fort yet  sell emno i should think not said margery with earnest reproach  why i hope you wouldnt be so foolish  why this is exactly the kind of thing i was thinking of when i told you of the things women could wantof course not meaning myself particularly i had no idea that you had such valuable  margery was unable to speak coherently so much was she amazed at the wealth of jims possessions  at this moment her father and the limeburner came upstairs and to appear womanly and proper to mr vine margery repressed the remainder of her surprise  as for the two elderly worthies it was not till they entered the room and sat down that their slower eyes discerned anything brilliant in the appointments  then one of them stole a glance at some article and the other at another but each being unwilling to express his wonder in the presence of his neighbours they received the objects before them with quite an accustomed air the limeburner inwardly trying to conjecture what all this meant and the dairyman musing that if jims business allowed him to accumulate at this rate the sooner margery became his wife the better  margery retreated to the worktable workbox and teaservice which she examined with hushed exclamations  an entertainment thus surprisingly begun could not fail to progress well  whenever margerys crusty old father felt the need of a civil sentence the flash of jims fancy articles inspired him to one while the limeburner having reasoned away his first ominous thought that all this had come out of the firm also felt proud and blithe  jim accompanied his dairy friends part of the way home before they mounted  her father finding that jim wanted to speak to her privately and that she exhibited some elusiveness turned to margery and said come come my lady no more of this nonsense  you just step behind with that young man and i and the cart will wait for you  margery a little scared at her fathers peremptoriness obeyed  it was plain that jim had won the old man by that nights stroke if he had not won her  i know what you are going to say jim she began less ardently now for she was no longer under the novel influence of the shining silver and glass  well as you desire it and as my father desires it and as i suppose it will be the best course for me i will fix the daynot this evening but as soon as i can think it over    chapter viii    notwithstanding a press of business jim went and did his duty in thanking the baron  the latter saw him in his fishingtackle room an apartment littered with every appliance that a votary of the rod could require  and when is the weddingday to be hayward the baron asked after jim had told him that matters were settled  it is not quite certain yet my noble lord said jim cheerfully but i hope twill not be long after the time when god amighty christens the little apples  and when is that  st swithinsthe middle of july  tis to be some time in that month she tells me  when jim was gone the baron seemed meditative  he went out ascended the mount and entered the weatherscreen where he looked at the seats as though reenacting in his fancy the scene of that memorable morning of fog  he turned his eyes to the angle of the shelter round which margery had suddenly appeared like a vision and it was plain that he would not have minded her appearing there then  the juncture had indeed been such an impressive and critical one that she must have seemed rather a heavenly messenger than a passing milkmaid more especially to a man like the baron who despite the mystery of his origin and life revealed himself to be a melancholy emotional characterthe jacques of this forest and stream  behind the mount the ground rose yet higher ascending to a plantation which sheltered the house  the baron strolled up here and bent his gaze over the distance  the valley of the exe lay before him with its shining river the brooks that fed it and the trickling springs that fed the brooks  the situation of margerys house was visible though not the house itself and the baron gazed that way for an infinitely long time till remembering himself he moved on  instead of returning to the house he went along the ridge till he arrived at the verge of chillington wood and in the same desultory manner roamed under the trees not pausing till he had come to three walksend and the hollow elm hard by  he peeped in at the rift  in the soft dry layer of touchwood that floored the hollow margerys tracks were still visible as she had made them there when dressing for the ball  little margery murmured the baron  in a moment he thought better of this mood and turned to go home but behold a form stood behind himthat of the girl whose name had been on his lips  she was in utter confusion  iidid not know you were here sir she began  i was out for a little walk  she could get no further her eyes filled with tears  that spice of wilfulness even hardness which characterized her in jims company magically disappeared in the presence of the baron  never mind never mind said he masking under a severe manner whatever he felt  the meeting is awkward and ought not to have occurred especially if as i suppose you are shortly to be married to james hayward  but it cannot be helped now  you had no idea i was here of course  neither had i of seeing you  remember you cannot be too careful continued the baron in the same grave tone and i strongly request you as a friend to do your utmost to avoid meetings like this  when you saw me before i turned why did you not go away  i did not see you sir  i did not think of seeing you  i was walking this way and i only looked in to see the tree  that shows you have been thinking of things you should not think of returned the baron  good morning  margery could answer nothing  a browbeaten glance almost of misery was all she gave him  he took a slow step away from her then turned suddenly back and stooping impulsively kissed her cheek taking her as much by surprise as ever a woman was taken in her life  immediately after he went off with a flushed face and rapid strides which he did not check till he was within his own boundaries  the haymaking season now set in vigorously and the weirhatches were all drawn in the meads to drain off the water  the streams ran themselves dry and there was no longer any difficulty in walking about among them  the baron could very well witness from the elevations about his house the activity which followed these preliminaries  the white shirtsleeves of the mowers glistened in the sun the scythes flashed voices echoed snatches of song floated about and there were glimpses of red waggonwheels purple gowns and manycoloured handkerchiefs  the baron had been told that the haymaking was to be followed by the wedding and had he gone down the vale to the dairy he would have had evidence to that effect  dairyman tuckers house was in a whirlpool of bustle and among other difficulties was that of turning the cheeseroom into a genteel apartment for the time being and hiding the awkwardness of having to pass through the milkhouse to get to the parlour door  these household contrivances appeared to interest margery much more than the great question of dressing for the ceremony and the ceremony itself  in all relating to that she showed an indescribable backwardness which later on was well remembered  if it were only somebody else and i was one of the bridesmaids i really think i should like it better she murmured one afternoon  away with theethats only your shyness said one of the milkmaids  it is said that about this time the baron seemed to feel the effects of solitude strongly  solitude revives the simple instincts of primitive man and lonely country nooks afford rich soil for wayward emotions  moreover idleness waters those unconsidered impulses which a short season of turmoil would stamp out  it is difficult to speak with any exactness of the bearing of such conditions on the mind of the barona man of whom so little was ever truly knownbut there is no doubt that his mind ran much on margery as an individual without reference to her rank or quality or to the question whether she would marry jim hayward that summer  she was the single lovely human thing within his present horizon for he lived in absolute seclusion and her image unduly affected him  but leaving conjecture let me state what happened  one saturday evening two or three weeks after his accidental meeting with her in the wood he wrote the note following   dear margery   you must not suppose that because i spoke somewhat severely to you at our chance encounter by the hollow tree i have any feeling against you  far from it  now as ever i have the most grateful sense of your considerate kindness to me on a momentous occasion which shall be nameless  you solemnly promised to come and see me whenever i should send for you  can you call for five minutes as soon as possible and disperse those plaguy glooms from which i am so unfortunate as to suffer  if you refuse i will not answer for the consequences  i shall be in the summer shelter of the mount tomorrow morning at halfpast ten  if you come i shall be grateful  i have also something for you  yours  x   in keeping with the tenor of this epistle the desponding self oppressed baron ascended the mount on sunday morning and sat down there was nothing here to signify exactly the hour but before the church bells had begun he heard somebody approaching at the back the light footstep moved timidly first to one recess and then to another then to the third where he sat in the shade  poor margery stood before him  she looked worn and weary and her little shoes and the skirts of her dress were covered with dust  the weather was sultry the sun being already high and powerful and rain had not fallen for weeks  the baron who walked little had thought nothing of the effects of this heat and drought in inducing fatigue  a distance which had been but a reasonable exercise on a foggy morning was a drag for margery now she was out of breath and anxiety even unhappiness was written on her everywhere  he rose to his feet and took her hand  he was vexed with himself at sight of her  my dear little girl he said  you are tiredyou should not have come  you sent for me sir and i was afraid you were ill and my promise to you was sacred  he bent over her looking upon her downcast face and still holding her hand then he dropped it and took a pace or two backwards  it was a whim nothing more he said sadly  i wanted to see my little friend to express good wishesand to present her with this he held forward a small morocco case and showed her how to open it disclosing a pretty locket set with pearls  it is intended as a wedding present he continued  to be returned to me again if you do not marry jim this summerit is to be this summer i think  it was sir she said with agitation  but it is so no longer and therefore i cannot take this  what do you say  it was to have been today but now it cannot be  the wedding todaysunday he cried  we fixed sunday not to hinder much time at this busy season of the year replied she  and have you then put it offsurely not  you sent for me and i have come she answered humbly like an obedient familiar in the employ of some great enchanter  indeed the barons power over this innocent girl was curiously like enchantment or mesmeric influence  it was so masterful that the sexual element was almost eliminated  it was that of prospero over the gentle ariel  and yet it was probably only that of the cosmopolite over the recluse of the experienced man over the simple maid  you have comeon your weddingdayo margery this is a mistake of course you should not have obeyed me since though i thought your wedding would be soon i did not know it was today  i promised you sir and i would rather keep my promise to you than be married to jim  that must not bethe feeling is wrong he murmured looking at the distant hills  there seems to be a fate in all this i get out of the fryingpan into the fire  what a recompense to you for your goodness  the fact is i was out of health and out of spirits so i but no more of that  now instantly to repair this tremendous blunder that we have madethats the question  after a pause he went on hurriedly walk down the hill get into the road  by that time i shall be there with a phaeton  we may get back in time  what time is it now  if not no doubt the wedding can be tomorrow so all will come right again  dont cry my dear girl keep the locket of courseyoull marry jim    chapter ix    he hastened down towards the stables and she went on as directed it seemed as if he must have put in the horse himself so quickly did he reappear with the phaeton on the open road  margery silently took her seat and the baron seemed cut to the quick with selfreproach as he noticed the listless indifference with which she acted  there was no doubt that in her heart she had preferred obeying the apparently important mandate that morning to becoming jims wife but there was no less doubt that had the baron left her alone she would quietly have gone to the altar  he drove along furiously in a cloud of dust  there was much to contemplate in that peaceful sunday morningthe windless trees and fields the shaking sunlight the pause in human stir  yet neither of them heeded and thus they drew near to the dairy  his first expressed intention had been to go indoors with her but this he abandoned as impolitic in the highest degree  you may be soon enough he said springing down and helping her to follow  tell the truth  say you were sent for to receive a wedding presentthat it was a mistake on my parta mistake on yours and i think theyll forgive    and margery my last request to you is this  that if i send for you again you do not come  promise solemnly my dear girl that any such request shall be unheeded  her lips moved but the promise was not articulated  o sir i cannot promise it she said at last  but you must your salvation may depend on it he insisted almost sternly  you dont know what i am  then sir i promise she replied  now leave me to myself please and ill go indoors and manage matters  he turned the horse and drove away but only for a little distance out of sight he pulled rein suddenly  only to go back and propose it to her and shed come he murmured  he stood up in the phaeton and by this means he could see over the hedge  margery still sat listlessly in the same place there was not a lovelier flower in the field  no he said no nonever  he reseated himself and the wheels sped lightly back over the soft dust to mount lodge  meanwhile margery had not moved  if the baron could dissimulate on the side of severity she could dissimulate on the side of calm  he did not know what had been veiled by the quiet promise to manage matters indoors  rising at length she first turned away from the house and byandby having apparently forgotten till then that she carried it in her hand she opened the case and looked at the locket  this seemed to give her courage  she turned set her face towards the dairy in good earnest and though her heart faltered when the gates came in sight she kept on and drew near the door  on the threshold she stood listening  the house was silent decorations were visible in the passage and also the carefully swept and sanded path to the gate which she was to have trodden as a bride but the sparrows hopped over it as if it were abandoned and all appeared to have been checked at its climacteric like a clock stopped on the strike  till this moment of confronting the suspended animation of the scene she had not realized the full shock of the convulsion which her disappearance must have caused  it is quite certainapart from her own repeated assurances to that effect in later yearsthat in hastening off that morning to her sudden engagement margery had not counted the cost of such an enterprise while a dim notion that she might get back again in time for the ceremony if the message meant nothing serious should also be mentioned in her favour  but upon the whole she had obeyed the call with an unreasoning obedience worthy of a disciple in primitive times  a conviction that the barons life might depend upon her presencefor she had by this time divined the tragical event she had interrupted on the foggy morningtook from her all will to judge and consider calmly  the simple affairs of her and hers seemed nothing beside the possibility of harm to him  a wellknown step moved on the sanded floor within and she went forward  that she saw her fathers face before her just within the door can hardly be said  it was rather reproach and rage in a human mask  what ye have dared to come back alive hussy to look upon the dupery you have practised on honest people  youve mortified us all i dont want to see ee i dont want to hear ee i dont want to know anything  he walked up and down the room unable to command himself  nothing but being dead could have excused ee for not meeting and marrying that man this morning and yet you have the brazen impudence to stand there as well as ever  what be you here for  ive come back to marry jim if he wants me to she said faintly and if notperhaps so much the better  i was sent for this morning early  i thought  she halted  to say that she had thought a mans death might happen by his own hand if she did not go to him would never do  i was obliged to go she said  i had given my word  why didnt you tell us then so that the wedding could be put off without making fools o us  because i was afraid you wouldnt let me go and i had made up my mind to go  to go where  she was silent till she said i will tell jim all and why it was and if hes any friend of mine hell excuse me  not jimhes no such fool  jim had put all ready for you jim had called at your house adressed up in his new wedding clothes and a smiling like the sun jim had told the parson had got the ringers in tow and the clerk awaiting and thenyou was gone  then jim turned as pale as rendlewood and busted out if she dont marry me to day a said she dont marry me at all  no let her look elsewhere for a husband  for tew years ive put up with her haughty tricks and her takings a said  ive droudged and ive traipsed ive bought and ive sold all wi an eye to her ive suffered horseflesh he saysyes them was his noble wordsbut ill suffer it no longer  she shall go  jim says i you be a man  if shes alive i commend ee if shes dead pity my old age  she isnt dead says he for ive just heard she was seen walking off across the fields this morning looking all of a scornful triumph he turned round and went and the rest o the neighbours went and here be i left to the reproach ot  he was too hasty murmured margery  for now hes said this i cant marry him tomorrow as i might ha done and perhaps so much the better  you can be so calm about it can ye  be my arrangements nothing then that you should break em up and say off hand what wasnt done today might ha been done tomorrow and such flickflack  out o my sight  i wont hear any more  i wont speak to ee any more  ill go away and then youll be sorry  very well go  sorrynot i  he turned and stamped his way into the cheeseroom  margery went upstairs  she too was excited now and instead of fortifying herself in her bedroom till her fathers rage had blown over as she had often done on lesser occasions she packed up a bundle of articles crept down again and went out of the house  she had a place of refuge in these cases of necessity and her father knew it and was less alarmed at seeing her depart than he might otherwise have been this place was rooks gate the house of her grandmother who always took margerys part when that young woman was particularly in the wrong  the devious way she pursued to avoid the vicinity of mount lodge was tedious and she was already weary  but the cottage was a restful place to arrive at for she was her own mistress thereher grandmother never coming down stairsand edy the woman who lived with and attended her being a cipher except in muscle and voice the approach was by a straight open road bordered by thin lank trees all sloping away from the southwest windquarter and the scene bore a strange resemblance to certain bits of dutch landscape which have been imprinted on the worlds eye by hobbema and his school  having explained to her granny that the wedding was put off and that she had come to stay one of margerys first acts was carefully to pack up the locket and case her wedding present from the baron  the conditions of the gift were unfulfilled and she wished it to go back instantly  perhaps in the intricacies of her bosom there lurked a greater satisfaction with the reason for returning the present than she would have felt just then with a reason for keeping it  to send the article was difficult  in the evening she wrapped herself up searched and found a gauze veil that had been used by her grandmother in past years for hiving swarms of bees buried her face in it and sallied forth with a palpitating heart till she drew near the tabernacle of her demigod the baron  she ventured only to the backdoor where she handed in the parcel addressed to him and quickly came away  now it seems that during the day the baron had been unable to learn the result of his attempt to return margery in time for the event he had interrupted  wishing for obvious reasons to avoid direct inquiry by messenger and being too unwell to go far himself he could learn no particulars  he was sitting in thought after a lonely dinner when the parcel intimating failure as brought in  the footman whose curiosity had been excited by the mode of its arrival peeped through the keyhole after closing the door to learn what the packet meant  directly the baron had opened it he thrust out his feet vehemently from his chair and began cursing his ruinous conduct in bringing about such a disaster for the return of the locket denoted not only no wedding that day but none tomorrow or at any time  i have done that innocent woman a great wrong he murmured deprived her of perhaps her only opportunity of becoming mistress of a happy home    chapter x    a considerable period of inaction followed among all concerned  nothing tended to dissipate the obscurity which veiled the life of the baron  the position he occupied in the minds of the countryfolk around was one which combined the mysteriousness of a legendary character with the unobtrusive deeds of a modern gentleman  to this day whoever takes the trouble to go down to silverthorn in lower wessex and make inquiries will find existing there almost a superstitious feeling for the moody melancholy stranger who resided in the lodge some forty years ago  whence he came whither he was going were alike unknown  it was said that his mother had been an english lady of noble family who had married a foreigner not unheard of in circles where men pile up the cankered heaps of strangeachieved goldthat he had been born and educated in england taken abroad and so on  but the facts of a life in such cases are of little account beside the aspect of a life and hence though doubtless the years of his existence contained their share of trite and homely circumstance the curtain which masked all this was never lifted to gratify such a theatre of spectators as those at silverthorn  therein lay his charm  his life was a vignette of which the central strokes only were drawn with any distinctness the environment shading away to a blank  he might have been said to resemble that solitary bird the heron the still lonely stream was his frequent haunt  on its banks he would stand for hours with his rod looking into the water beholding the tawny inhabitants with the eye of a philosopher and seeming to say bite or dont biteits all the same to me  he was often mistaken for a ghost by children and for a pollard willow by men when on their way home in the dusk they saw him motionless by some rushy bank unobservant of the decline of day  why did he come to fish near silverthorn  that was never explained as far as was known he had no relatives near the fishing there was not exceptionally good the society thereabout was decidedly meagre that he had committed some folly or hasty act that he had been wrongfully accused of some crime thus rendering his seclusion from the world desirable for a while squared very well with his frequent melancholy  but such as he was there he lived well supplied with fishingtackle and tenant of a furnished house just suited to the requirements of such an eccentric being as he   margerys father having privately ascertained that she was living with her grandmother and getting into no harm refrained from communicating with her in the hope of seeing her contrite at his door  it had of course become known about silverthorn that at the last moment margery refused to wed hayward by absenting herself from the house  jim was pitied yet not pitied much for it was said that he ought not to have been so eager for a woman who had shown no anxiety for him  and where was jim himself  it must not be supposed that that tactician had all this while withdrawn from mortal eye to tear his hair in silent indignation and despair  he had in truth merely retired up the lonesome defile between the downs to his smouldering kiln and the ancient ramparts above it and there after his first hours of natural discomposure he quietly waited for overtures from the possibly repentant margery  but no overtures arrived and then he meditated anew on the absorbing problem of her skittishness and how to set about another campaign for her conquest notwithstanding his late disastrous failure  why had he failed  to what was her strange conduct owing  that was the thing which puzzled him  he had made no advance in solving the riddle when one morning a stranger appeared on the down above him looking as if he had lost his way  the man had a good deal of black hair below his felt hat and carried under his arm a case containing a musical instrument descending to where jim stood he asked if there were not a short cut across that way to tivworthy where a fete was to be held  well yes there is said jim  but tis an enormous distance for ee  oh yes replied the musician  i wish to intercept the carrier on the highway  the nearest way was precisely in the direction of rooks gate where margery as jim knew was staying  having some time to spare jim was strongly impelled to make a kind act to the lost musician a pretext for taking observations in that neighbourhood and telling his acquaintance that he was going the same way he started without further ado  they skirted the long length of meads and in due time arrived at the back of rooks gate where the path joined the high road  a hedge divided the public way from the cottage garden  jim drew up at this point and said your road is straight on  i turn back here  but the musician was standing fixed as if in great perplexity thrusting his hand into his forest of black hair he murmured surely it is the samesurely  jim following the direction of his neighbours eyes found them to be fixed on a figure till that moment hidden from himselfmargery tuckerwho was crossing the garden to an opposite gate with a little cheese in her arms her head thrown back and her face quite exposed  what of her said jim  two months ago i formed one of the band at the yeomanry ball given by lord toneborough in the next county  i saw that young lady dancing the polka there in robes of gauze and lace  now i see her carry a cheese  never said jim incredulously  but i do not mistake  i say it is so  jim ridiculed the idea the bandsman protested and was about to lose his temper when jim gave in with the goodnature of a person who can afford to despise opinions and the musician went his way  as he dwindled out of sight jim began to think more carefully over what he had said  the young mans thoughts grew quite to an excitement for there came into his mind the barons extraordinary kindness in regard to furniture hitherto accounted for by the assumption that the nobleman had taken a fancy to him  could it be among all the amazing things of life that the baron was at the bottom of this mischief and that he had amused himself by taking margery to a ball  doubts and suspicions which distract some lovers to imbecility only served to bring out jims great qualities  where he trusted he was the most trusting fellow in the world where he doubted he could be guilty of the slyest strategy  once suspicious he became one of those subtle watchful characters who without integrity make good thieves with a little good jobbers with a little more good diplomatists  jim was honest and he considered what to do  retracing his steps he peeped again  she had gone in but she would soon reappear for it could be seen that she was carrying little new cheeses one by one to a springcart and horse tethered outside the gateher grandmother though not a regular dairywoman still managing a few cows by means of a man and maid  with the lightness of a cat jim crept round to the gate took a piece of chalk from his pocket and wrote upon the boarding the baron  then he retreated to the other side of the garden where he had just watched margery  in due time she emerged with another little cheese came on to the gardendoor and glanced upon the chalked words which confronted her she started the cheese rolled from her arms to the ground and broke into pieces like a pudding  she looked fearfully round her face burning like sunset and seeing nobody stooped to pick up the flaccid lumps  jim with a pale face departed as invisibly as he had come  he had proved the bandsmans tale to be true  on his way back he formed a resolution  it was to beard the lion in his dento call on the baron  meanwhile margery had recovered her equanimity and gathered up the broken cheese  but she could by no means account for the handwriting  jim was just the sort of fellow to play her such a trick at ordinary times but she imagined him to be far too incensed against her to do it now and she suddenly wondered if it were any sort of signal from the baron himself  of him she had lately heard nothing  if ever monotony pervaded a life it pervaded hers at rooks gate and she had begun to despair of any happy change  but it is precisely when the social atmosphere seems stagnant that great events are brewing  margerys quiet was broken first as we have seen by a slight start only sufficient to make her drop a cheese and then by a more serious matter  she was inside the same garden one day when she heard two watermen talking without  the conversation was to the effect that the strange gentleman who had taken mount lodge for the season was seriously ill  how ill cried margery through the hedge which screened her from recognition  bad abed said one of the watermen  inflammation of the lungs said the other  got wet fishing the first chimed in  margery could gather no more  an ideal admiration rather than any positive passion existed in her breast for the baron  she had of late seen too little of him to allow any incipient views of him as a lover to grow to formidable dimensions  it was an extremely romantic feeling delicate as an aroma capable of quickening to an active principle or dying to a painless sympathy as the case might be  this news of his illness coupled with the mysterious chalking on the gate troubled her and revived his image much  she took to walking up and down the gardenpaths looking into the hearts of flowers and not thinking what they were  his last request had been that she was not to go to him if be should send for her and now she asked herself was the name on the gate a hint to enable her to go without infringing the letter of her promise  thus unexpectedly had jims manoeuvre operated  ten days passed  all she could hear of the baron were the same words bad abed till one afternoon after a gallop of the physician to the lodge the tidings spread like lightning that the baron was dying  margery distressed herself with the question whether she might be permitted to visit him and say her prayers at his bedside but she feared to venture and thus eightandforty hours slipped away and the baron still lived  despite her shyness and awe of him she had almost made up her mind to call when just at dusk on that october evening somebody came to the door and asked for her  she could see the messengers head against the low new moon  he was a manservant  he said he had been all the way to her fathers and had been sent thence to her here  he simply brought a note and delivering it into her hands went away   dear margery tucker ran the notethey say i am not likely to live so i want to see you  be here at eight oclock this evening  come quite alone to the sidedoor and tap four times softly  my trusty man will admit you  the occasion is an important one  prepare yourself for a solemn ceremony which i wish to have performed while it lies in my power  von xanten    chapter xi    margerys face flushed up and her neck and arms glowed in sympathy the quickness of youthful imagination and the assumptiveness of womans reason sent her straight as an arrow this thought  he wants to marry me  she had heard of similar strange proceedings in which the orange flower and the sad cypress were intertwined  people sometimes wished on their deathbeds from motives of esteem to form a legal tie which they had not cared to establish as a domestic one during their active life  for a few minutes margery could hardly be called excited she was excitement itself  between surprise and modesty she blushed and trembled by turns  she became grave sat down in the solitary room and looked into the fire  at seven oclock she rose resolved and went quite tranquilly upstairs where she speedily began to dress  in making this hasty toilet ninetenths of her care were given to her hands  the summer had left them slightly brown and she held them up and looked at them with some misgiving the fourth finger of her left hand more especially  hot washings and cold washings certain products from bee and flower known only to country girls everything she could think of were used upon those little sunburnt hands till she persuaded herself that they were really as white as could be wished by a husband with a hundred titles  her dressing completed she left word with edy that she was going for a long walk and set out in the direction of mount lodge  she no longer tripped like a girl but walked like a woman  while crossing the park she murmured baroness von xanten in a pronunciation of her own  the sound of that title caused her such agitation that she was obliged to pause with her hand upon her heart  the house was so closely neighboured by shrubberies on three of its sides that it was not till she had gone nearly round it that she found the little door  the resolution she had been an hour in forming failed her when she stood at the portal  while pausing for courage to tap a carriage drove up to the front entrance a little way off and peeping round the corner she saw alight a clergyman and a gentleman in whom margery fancied that she recognized a wellknown solicitor from the neighbouring town  she had no longer any doubt of the nature of the ceremony proposed  it is sudden but i must obey him she murmured  and tapped four times  the door was opened so quickly that the servant must have been standing immediately inside  she thought him the man who had driven them to the ballthe silent man who could be trusted  without a word he conducted her up the back staircase and through a door at the top into a wide corridor  she was asked to wait in a little dressingroom where there was a fire and an old metalframed lookingglass over the mantelpiece in which she caught sight of herself  a red spot burnt in each of her cheeks the rest of her face was pale and her eyes were like diamonds of the first water  before she had been seated many minutes the man came back noiselessly and she followed him to a door covered by a red and black curtain which he lifted and ushered her into a large chamber a screened light stood on a table before her and on her left the hangings of a tall dark fourpost bedstead obstructed her view of the centre of the room  everything here seemed of such a magnificent type to her eyes that she felt confused diminished to half her height half her strength half her prettiness  the man who had conducted her retired at once and some one came softly round the angle of the bedcurtains  he held out his hand kindlyrather patronisingly  it was the solicitor whom she knew by sight  this gentleman led her forward as if she had been a lamb rather than a woman till the occupant of the bed was revealed  the barons eyes were closed and her entry had been so noiseless that he did not open them  the pallor of his face nearly matched the white bedlinen and his dark hair and heavy black moustache were like dashes of ink on a clean page  near him sat the parson and another gentleman whom she afterwards learnt to be a london physician and on the parson whispering a few words the baron opened his eyes  as soon as he saw her he smiled faintly and held out his hand  margery would have wept for him if she had not been too overawed and palpitating to do anything  she quite forgot what she had come for shook hands with him mechanically and could hardly return an answer to his weak dear margery you see how i amhow are you  in preparing for marriage she had not calculated on such a scene as this  her affection for the baron had too much of the vague in it to afford her trustfulness now  she wished she had not come  on a sign from the baron the lawyer brought her a chair and the oppressive silence was broken by the barons words  i am pulled down to deaths door margery he said and i suppose i soon shall pass through    my peace has been much disturbed in this illness for just before it attacked me i receivedthat present you returned from which and in other ways i learnt that you had lost your chance of marriage    now it was i who did the harm and you can imagine how the news has affected me  it has worried me all the illness through and i cannot dismiss my error from my mind    i want to right the wrong i have done you before i die  margery you have always obeyed me and strange as the request may be will you obey me now  she whispered yes  well then said the baron these three gentlemen are here for a special purpose  one helps the bodyhes called a physician another helps the soulhes a parson the other helps the understandinghes a lawyer  they are here partly on my account and partly on yours  the speaker then made a sign to the lawyer who went out of the door he came back almost instantly but not alone  behind him dressed up in his best clothes with a flower in his buttonhole and a bridegrooms air walkedjim    chapter xii    margery could hardly repress a scream  as for flushing and blushing she had turned hot and turned pale so many times already during the evening that there was really now nothing of that sort left for her to do and she remained in complexion much as before  o the mockery of it  that secret dreamthat sweet word baronesswhich had sustained her all the way along  instead of a baron there stood jim whitewaistcoated demure every hair in place and if she mistook not even a deedy spark in his eye  jims surprising presence on the scene may be briefly accounted for his resolve to seek an explanation with the baron at all risks had proved unexpectedly easy  the interview had at once been granted and then seeing the crisis at which matters stood the baron had generously revealed to jim the whole of his indebtedness to and knowledge of margery  the truth of the barons statement the innocent nature as yet of the acquaintanceship his sorrow for the rupture he had produced was so evident that far from having any further doubts of his patron jim frankly asked his advice on the next step to be pursued  at this stage the baron fell ill and desiring much to see the two young people united before his death he had sent anew hayward and proposed the plan which they were to now about to attempta marriage at the bedside of the sick man by special licence  the influence at lambeth of some friends of the barons and the charitable bequests of his late mother to several deserving church funds were generally supposed to be among the reasons why the application for the licence was not refused  this however is of small consequence  the baron probably knew in proposing this method of celebrating the marriage that his enormous power over her would outweigh any sentimental obstacles which she might set upinward objections that without his presence and firmness might prove too much for her acquiescence  doubtless he foresaw too the advantage of getting her into the house before making the individuality of her husband clear to her mind  now the barons conjectures were right as to the event but wrong as to the motives  margery was a perfect little dissembler on some occasions and one of them was when she wished to hide any sudden mortification that might bring her into ridicule  she had no sooner recovered from her first fit of discomfiture than pride bade her suffer anything rather than reveal her absurd disappointment  hence the scene progressed as follows  come here hayward said the invalid  hayward came near  the baron holding her hand in one of his own and her lovers in the other continued will you in spite of your recent vexation with her marry her now if she does not refuse  i will sir said jim promptly  and margery what do you say  it is merely a setting of things right  you have already promised this young man to be his wife and should of course perform your promise  you dont dislike jim  o no sir she said in a low dry voice  i like him better than i can tell you said the baron  he is an honourable man and will make you a good husband  you must remember that marriage is a life contract in which general compatibility of temper and worldly position is of more importance than fleeting passion which never long survives  now will you at my earnest request and before i go to the south of europe to die agree to make this good man happy  i have expressed your views on the subject havent i hayward  to a t sir said jim emphatically with a motion of raising his hat to his influential ally till he remembered he had no hat on and though i could hardly expect margery to gie in for my asking i feels she ought to gie in for yours  and you accept him my little friend  yes sir she murmured if hell agree to a thing or two  doubtless he willwhat are they  that i shall not be made to live with him till i am in the mind for it and that my having him shall be kept unknown for the present  well what do you think of it hayward  anything that you or she may wish ill do my noble lord said jim  well her request is not unreasonable seeing that the proceedings are on my account a little hurried  so well proceed  you rather expected this from my allusion to a ceremony in my note did you not margery  yes sir said she with an effort  good i thought so you looked so little surprised  we now leave the scene in the bedroom for a spot not many yards off  when the carriage seen by margery at the door was driving up to mount lodge it arrested the attention not only of the young girl but of a man who had for some time been moving slowly about the opposite lawn engaged in some operation while he smoked a short pipe  a short observation of his doings would have shown that he was sheltering some delicate plants from an expected frost and that he was the gardener  when the light at the door fell upon the entering forms of parson and lawyerthe former a stranger the latter known to him the gardener walked thoughtfully round the house  reaching the small sideentrance he was further surprised to see it noiselessly open to a young woman in whose momentarily illumined features he discerned those of margery tucker  altogether there was something curious in this  the man returned to the lawn front and perfunctorily went on putting shelters over certain plants though his thoughts were plainly otherwise engaged on the grass his footsteps were noiseless and the night moreover being still he could presently hear a murmuring from the bedroom window over his head  the gardener took from a tree a ladder that he had used in nailing that day set it under the window and ascended halfway hoodwinking his conscience by seizing a nail or two with his hand and testing their twigsupporting powers  he soon heard enough to satisfy him the words of a churchservice in the strange parsons voice were audible in snatches through the blind  they were words he knew to be part of the solemnization of matrimony such as wedded wife richer for poorer and so on the less familiar parts being a more or less confused sound  satisfied that a wedding was in progress there the gardener did not for a moment dream that one of the contracting parties could be other than the sick baron  he descended the ladder and again walked round the house waiting only till he saw margery emerge from the same little door when fearing that he might be discovered he withdrew in the direction of his own cottage  this building stood at the lower corner of the garden and as soon as the gardener entered he was accosted by a handsome woman in a widows cap who called him father and said that supper had been ready for a long time  they sat down but during the meal the gardener was so abstracted and silent that his daughter put her head winningly to one side and said what is it father dear  ahwhat is it cried the gardener  something that makes very little difference to me but may be of great account to you if you play your cards well  theres been a wedding at the lodge tonight he related to her with a caution to secrecy all that he had heard and seen  we are folk that have got to get their living he said and such ones mustnt tell tales about their betterslord forgive the mockery of the wordbut theres something to be made of it  shes a nice maid so harriet do you take the first chance you get for honouring her before others know what has happened  since this is done so privately it will be kept private for some timetill after his death no questionwhen i expect shell take this house for herself and blaze out as a widowlady ten thousand pound strong you being a widow she may make you her companykeeper and so youll have a home by a little contriving  while this conversation progressed at the gardeners margery was on her way out of the barons house  she was indeed married  but as we know she was not married to the baron  the ceremony over she seemed but little discomposed and expressed a wish to return alone as she had come  to this of course no objection could be offered under the terms of the agreement and wishing jim a frigid goodbye and the baron a very quiet farewell she went out by the door which had admitted her  once safe and alone in the darkness of the park she burst into tears which dropped upon the grass as she passed along  in the barons room she had seemed scared and helpless now her reason and emotions returned  the further she got away from the glamour of that room and the influence of its occupant the more she became of opinion that she had acted foolishly  she had disobediently left her fathers house to obey him here  she had pleased everybody but herself  however thinking was now too late  how she got into her grandmothers house she hardly knew but without a supper and without confronting either her relative or edy she went to bed    chapter xiii    on going out into the garden next morning with a strange sense of being another person than herself she beheld jim leaning mutely over the gate  he nodded  good morning margery he said civilly  good morning said margery in the same tone  i beg your pardon he continued  but which way was you going this morning  i am not going anywhere just now thank you  but i shall go to my fathers byandby with edy  she went on with a sigh i have done what he has all along wished that is married you and theres no longer reason for enmity atween him and me  trewtrew  well as i am going the same way i can give you a lift in the trap for the distance is long  no thank youi am used to walking she said  they remained in silence the gate between them till jims convictions would apparently allow him to hold his peace no longer this is a bad job he murmured  it is she said as one whose thoughts have only too readily been identified  how i came to agree to it is more than i can tell and tears began rolling down her cheeks  the blame is more mine than yours i suppose he returned  i ought to have said no and not backed up the gentleman in carrying out this scheme  twas his own notion entirely as perhaps you know i should never have thought of such a plan but he said youd be willing and that it would be all right and i was too ready to believe him  the thing is how to remedy it said she bitterly  i believe of course in your promise to keep this private and not to trouble me by calling  certainly said jim  i dont want to trouble you  as for that why my dear mrs hayward  dont mrs hayward me said margery sharply  i wont be mrs hayward  jim paused  well you are she by law and that was all i meant he said mildly  i said i would acknowledge no such thing and i wont  a thing cant be legal when its against the wishes of the persons the laws are made to protect  so i beg you not to call me that anymore  very well miss tucker said jim deferentially  we can live on exactly as before  we cant marry anybody else thats true but beyond that theres no difference and no harm done  your father ought to be told i suppose even if nobody else is  it will partly reconcile him to you and make your life smoother  instead of directly replying margery exclaimed in a low voice  o it is a mistakei didnt see it all owing to not having time to reflect  i agreed thinking that at least i should get reconciled to father by the step  but perhaps he would as soon have me not married at all as married and parted  i must ha been enchantedbewitched when i gave my consent to this  i only did it to please that dear good dying noblemanthough why he should have wished it so much i cant tell  nor i neither said jim  yes weve been fooled into it margery he said with extraordinary gravity  hes had his way wi us and now weve got to suffer for it  being a gentleman of patronage and having bought several loads of lime o me and having given me all that splendid furniture i could hardly refuse  what did he give you that  ay sureto help me win ye  margery covered her face with her hands whereupon jim stood up from the gate and looked critically at her  tis a footy plot between you two men tosnare me she exclaimed  why should you have done itwhy should he have done itwhen ive not deserved to be treated so  he bought the furnituredid he  o ive been taken inive been wronged  the grief and vexation of finding that long ago when fondly believing the baron to have loverlike feelings himself for her he was still conspiring to favour jims suit was more than she could endure  jim with distant courtesy waited nibbling a straw till her paroxysm was over  one word miss tuckmrsmargery he then recommenced gravely  youll find me man enough to respect your wish and to leave you to yourselffor ever and ever if thats all  but ive just one word of advice to render ee  that is that before you go to silverthorn dairy yourself you let me drive ahead and call on your father  hes friends with me and hes not friends with you  i can break the news a little at a time and i think i can gain his good will for you now even though the wedding be no natural wedding at all  at any count i can hear what hes got to say about ee and come back here and tell ee  she nodded a cool assent to this and he left her strolling about the garden in the sunlight while he went on to reconnoitre as agreed  it must not be supposed that jims dutiful echoes of margerys regret at her precipitate marriage were all gospel and there is no doubt that his private intention after telling the dairyfarmer what had happened was to ask his temporary assent to her caprice till in the course of time she should be reasoned out of her whims and induced to settle down with jim in a natural manner  he had it is true been somewhat nettled by her firm objection to him and her keen sorrow for what she had done to please another but he hoped for the best  but alas for the astute jims calculations  he drove on to the dairy whose white walls now gleamed in the morning sun made fast the horse to a ring in the wall and entered the barton  before knocking he perceived the dairyman walking across from a gate in the other direction as if he had just come in  jim went over to him since the unfortunate incident on the morning of the intended wedding they had merely been on nodding terms from a sense of awkwardness in their relations  whatis that thee said dairyman tucker in a voice which unmistakably startled jim by its abrupt fierceness  a pretty fellow thou best  it was a bad beginning for the young mans life as a soninlaw and augured ill for the delicate consultation he desired  whats the matter said jim  matter  i wish some folks would burn their lime without burning other folks property along wi it  you ought to be ashamed of yourself  you call yourself a man jim hayward and an honest lime burner and a respectable marketkeeping christen and yet at six oclock this morning instead o being where you ought to ha been at your work there was neither vell or mark o thee to be seen  faith i dont know what you are raving at said jim  whythe sparks from thy couchheap blew over upon my hayrick and the ricks burnt to ashes and all to come out o my wellsqueezed pocket  ill tell thee what it is young man  theres no business in thee  ive known silverthorn folk quick and dead for the last coupleoscore year and ive never knew one so threecunning for harm as thee my gentleman limeburner and i reckon it one o the luckiest days o my life when i scaped having thee in my family that maid of mine was right i was wrong  she seed thee to be a drawlacheting rogue and twas her wisdom to go off that morning and get rid o thee  i commend her fort and im going to fetch her home tomorrow  you neednt take the trouble  shes coming homealong tonight of her own accord  i have seen her this morning and she told me so  so much the better  ill welcome her warm  nation  id sooner see her married to the parish fool than thee  not youyou dont care for my hay  tarrying about where you shouldnt be in bed no doubt thats what you was adoing  now dont you darken my doors again and the sooner you be off my bit o ground the better i shall be pleased  jim looked as he felt stultified  if the rick had been really destroyed a little blame certainly attached to him but he could not understand how it had happened  however blame or none it was clear he could not with any selfrespect declare himself to be this peppery old gaffers soninlaw in the face of such an attack as this  for monthsalmost yearsthe one transaction that had seemed necessary to compose these two families satisfactorily was jims union with margery  no sooner had it been completed than it appeared on all sides as the gravest mishap for both  stating coldly that he would discover how much of the accident was to be attributed to his negligence and pay the damage he went out of the barton and returned the way he had come  margery had been keeping a lookout for him particularly wishing him not to enter the house lest others should see the seriousness of their interview and as soon as she heard wheels she went to the gate which was out of view  surely father has been speaking roughly to you she said on seeing his face  not the least doubt that he have said jim  but is he still angry with me  not in the least  hes waiting to welcome ee  ah because ive married you  because he thinks you have not married me  hes jawed me up hill and down  he hates me and for your sake i have not explained a word  margery looked towards home with a sad severe gaze  mr hayward she said we have made a great mistake and we are in a strange position  true but ill tell you what mistressi wont stand  he stopped suddenly  well well ive promised he quietly added  we must suffer for our mistake she went on  the way to suffer least is to keep our own counsel on what happened last evening and not to meet  i must now return to my father  he inclined his head in indifferent assent and she went indoors leaving him there    chapter xiv    margery returned home as she had decided and resumed her old life at silverthorn  and seeing her fathers animosity towards jim she told him not a word of the marriage  her inner life however was not what it once had been  she had suffered a mental and emotional displacementa shock which had set a shade of astonishment on her face as a permanent thing  her indignation with the baron for collusion with jim at first bitter lessened with the lapse of a few weeks and at length vanished in the interest of some tidings she received one day  the baron was not dead but he was no longer at the lodge  to the surprise of the physicians a sufficient improvement had taken place in his condition to permit of his removal before the cold weather came  his desire for removal had been such indeed that it was advisable to carry it out at almost any risk  the plan adopted had been to have him borne on mens shoulders in a sort of palanquin to the shore near idmouth a distance of several miles where a yacht lay awaiting him  by this means the noise and jolting of a carriage along irregular byeroads were avoided  the singular procession over the fields took place at night and was witnessed by but few people one being a labouring man who described the scene to margery  when the seaside was reached a long narrow gangway was laid from the deck of the yacht to the shore which was so steep as to allow the yacht to lie quite near  the men with their burden ascended by the light of lanterns the sick man was laid in the cabin and as soon as his bearers had returned to the shore the gangway was removed a rope was heard skirring over wood in the darkness the yacht quivered spread her woven wings to the air and moved away  soon she was but a small shapeless phantom upon the wide breast of the sea  it was said that the yacht was bound for algiers  when the inimical autumn and winter weather came on margery wondered if he were still alive  the house being shut up and the servants gone she had no means of knowing till on a particular saturday her father drove her to exonbury market  here in attending to his business he left her to herself for awhile  walking in a quiet street in the professional quarter of the town she saw coming towards her the solicitor who had been present at the wedding and who had acted for the baron in various small local matters during his brief residence at the lodge  she reddened to peony hues averted her eyes and would have passed him  but he crossed over and barred the pavement and when she met his glance he was looking with friendly severity at her  the street was quiet and he said in a low voice hows the husband  i dont know sir said she  whatand are your stipulations about secrecy and separate living still in force  they will always be she replied decisively  mr hayward and i agreed on the point and we have not the slightest wish to change the arrangement  hm  then tis miss tucker to the world mrs hayward to me and one or two others only  margery nodded  then she nerved herself by an effort and though blushing painfully asked may i put one question sir  is the baron dead  he is dead to you and to all of us  why should you ask  because if hes alive i am sorry i married james hayward  if he is dead i do not much mind my marriage  i repeat he is dead to you said the lawyer emphatically  ill tell you all i know  my professional services for him ended with his departure from this country but i think i should have heard from him if he had been alive still  i have not heard at all  and this taken in connection with the nature of his illness leaves no doubt in my mind that he is dead  margery sighed and thanking the lawyer she left him with a tear for the baron in her eye  after this incident she became more restful and the time drew on for her periodical visit to her grandmother  a few days subsequent to her arrival her aged relative asked her to go with a message to the gardener at mount lodge who still lived on there keeping the grounds in order for the landlord  margery hated that direction now but she went  the lodge which she saw over the trees was to her like a skull from which the warm and living flesh had vanished  it was twilight by the time she reached the cottage at the bottom of the lodge garden and the room being illuminated within she saw through the window a woman she had never seen before she was dark and rather handsome and when margery knocked she opened the door  it was the gardeners widowed daughter who had been advised to make friends with margery  she now found her opportunity  margerys errand was soon completed the young widow to her surprise treating her with preternatural respect and afterwards offering to accompany her home  margery was not sorry to have a companion in the gloom and they walked on together  the widow mrs peach was demonstrative and confidential and told margery all about herself  she had come quite recently to live with her fatherduring the barons illness in factand her husband had been captain of a ketch  i saw you one morning maam she said  but you didnt see me it was when you were crossing the hill in sight of the lodge  you looked at it and sighed  tis the lot of widows to sigh maam is it not  widowsyes i suppose but what do you mean  mrs peach lowered her voice  i cant say more maam with proper respect  but there seems to be no question of the poor barons death and though these foreign princes can take as my poor husband used to tell me what they call lefthanded wives and leave them behind when they go abroad widowhood is widowhood lefthanded or right  and really to be the lefthanded wife of a foreign baron is nobler than to be married all round to a common man  youll excuse my freedom maam but being a widow myself i have pitied you from my heart so young as you are and having to keep it a secret and excusing me having no money out of his vast riches because tis swallowed up by baroness number one  now margery did not understand a word more of this than the bare fact that mrs peach suspected her to be the barons undowered widow and such was the milkmaids nature that she did not deny the widows impeachment  the latter continued   but ah maam all your troubles are straight backward in your memorywhile i have troubles before as well as grief behind  what may they be mrs peach inquired margery with an air of the baroness  the other dropped her voice to revelation tones  i have been forgetful enough of my first man to lose my heart to a second  you shouldnt do thatit is wrong  you should control your feelings  but how am i to control my feelings  by going to your dead husbands grave and things of that sort  do you go to your dead husbands grave  how can i go to algiers  ahtoo true  well ive tried everything to cure myselfread the words against it gone to the table the first sunday of every month and all sorts  but avast my shipmateas my poor man used to say there tis just the same  in short ive made up my mind to encourage the new one  tis flattering that i a newcomer should have been found out by a young man so soon  who is he said margery listlessly  a master limeburner  a master limeburner  thats his profession  hes a partnerinco doing very well indeed  but whats his name  i dont like to tell you his name for though tis night that covers all shamefacedness my face is as hot as a talian iron i declare  do you just feel it  margery put her hand on mrs peachs face and sure enough hot it was  does he come courting she asked quickly  well only in the way of business  he never comes unless lime is wanted in the neighbourhood  hes in the yeomanry too and will look very fine when he comes out in regimentals for drill in may  ohin the yeomanry margery said with a slight relief  then it cantis he a young man  yes junior partnerinco  the description had an odd resemblance to jim of whom margery had not heard a word for months  he had promised silence and absence and had fulfilled his promise literally with a gratuitous addition that was rather amazing if indeed it were jim whom the widow loved one point in the description puzzled margery  jim was not in the yeomanry unless by a surprising development of enterprise he had entered it recently  at parting margery said with an interest quite tender i should like to see you again mrs peach and hear of your attachment  when can you call  ohany time dear baroness im sureif you think i am good enough  indeed i do mrs peach  come as soon as youve seen the lime burner again    chapter xv    seeing that jim lived several miles from the widow margery was rather surprised and even felt a slight sinking of the heart when her new acquaintance appeared at her door so soon as the evening of the following monday  she asked margery to walk out with her which the young woman readily did  i am come at once said the widow breathlessly as soon as they were in the lane for it is so exciting that i cant keep it  i must tell it to somebody if only a bird or a cat or a garden snail  what is it asked her companion  ive pulled grass from my husbands grave to cure itwove the blades into true lovers knots took off my shoes upon the sod but avast my shipmate  upon the sodwhy  to feel the damp earth hes in and make the sense of it enter my soul  but no  it has swelled to a head he is going to meet me at the yeomanry review  the master limeburner  the widow nodded  when is it to be  tomorrow  he looks so lovely in his accoutrements  hes such a splendid soldier that was the last straw that kindled my soul to say yes  hes home from exonbury for a night between the drills continued mrs peach  he goes back tomorrow morning for the review and when its over hes going to meet me  but guide my heart there he is  her exclamation had rise in the sudden appearance of a brilliant red uniform through the trees and the tramp of a horse carrying the wearer thereof  in another halfminute the military gentleman would have turned the corner and faced them  hed better not see me hell think i know too much said margery precipitately  ill go up here  the widow whose thoughts had been of the same cast seemed much relieved to see margery disappear in the plantation in the midst of a spring chorus of birds  once among the trees margery turned her head and before she could see the riders person she recognized the horse as tony the lightest of three that jim and his partner owned for the purpose of carting out lime to their customers  jim then had joined the yeomanry since his estrangement from margery  a man who had worn the young queen victorias uniform for seven days only could not be expected to look as if it were part of his person in the manner of longtrained soldiers but he was a wellformed young fellow and of an age when few positions came amiss to one who has the capacity to adapt himself to circumstances  meeting the blushing mrs peach to whom margery in her mind sternly denied the right to blush at all jim alighted and moved on with her probably at mrs peachs own suggestion so that what they said how long they remained together and how they parted margery knew not  she might have known some of these things by waiting but the presence of jim had bred in her heart a sudden disgust for the widow and a general sense of discomfiture  she went away in an opposite direction turning her head and saying to the unconscious jim theres a fine rod in pickle for you my gentleman if you carry out that pretty scheme  jims military coup had decidedly astonished her   what he might do next she could not conjecture  the idea of his doing anything sufficiently brilliant to arrest her attention would have seemed ludicrous had not jim by entering the yeomanry revealed a capacity for dazzling exploits which made it unsafe to predict any limitation to his powers  margery was now excited  the daring of the wretched jim in bursting into scarlet amazed her as much as his doubtful acquaintanceship with the demonstrative mrs peach  to go to that review to watch the pair to eclipse mrs peach in brilliancy to meet and pass them in withering contemptif she only could do it  but alas she was a forsaken woman  if the baron were alive or in england she said to herself for sometimes she thought he might possibly be alive and he were to take me to this review wouldnt i show that forward mrs peach what a lady is like and keep among the select company and not mix with the common people at all  it might at first sight be thought that the best course for margery at this juncture would have been to go to jim and nip the intrigue in the bud without further scruple  but her own declaration in after days was that whoever could say that was far from realizing her situation  it was hard to break such ice as divided their two lives now and to attempt it at that moment was a too humiliating proclamation of defeat  the only plan she could think ofperhaps not a wise one in the circumstanceswas to go to the review herself and be the gayest there  a method of doing this with some propriety soon occurred to her  she dared not ask her father who scorned to waste time in sightseeing and whose animosity towards jim knew no abatement but she might call on her old acquaintance mr vine jims partner who would probably be going with the rest of the holidayfolk and ask if she might accompany him in his springtrap  she had no sooner perceived the feasibility of this through her being at her grandmothers than she decided to meet with the old man early the next morning  in the meantime jim and mrs peach had walked slowly along the road together jim leading the horse and mrs peach informing him that her father the gardener was at jims village further on and that she had come to meet him  jim for reasons of his own was going to sleep at his partners that night and thus their route was the same the shades of eve closed in upon them as they walked and by the time they reached the limekiln which it was necessary to pass to get to the village it was quite dark  jim stopped at the kiln to see if matters had progressed rightly in his seven days absence and mrs peach who stuck to him like a teazle stopped also saying she would wait for her father there  she held the horse while he ascended to the top of the kiln  then rejoining her and not quite knowing what to do he stood beside her looking at the flames which tonight burnt up brightly shining a long way into the dark air even up to the ramparts of the earthwork above them and overhead into the bosoms of the clouds  it was during this proceeding that a carriage drawn by a pair of dark horses came along the turnpike road  the light of the kiln caused the horses to swerve a little and the occupant of the carriage looked out  he saw the bluish lightninglike flames from the limestone rising from the top of the furnace and hard by the figures of jim hayward the widow and the horse standing out with spectral distinctness against the mass of night behind  the scene wore the aspect of some unholy assignation in pandaemonium and it was all the more impressive from the fact that both jim and the woman were quite unconscious of the striking spectacle they presented  the gentleman in the carriage watched them till he was borne out of sight  having seen to the kiln jim and the widow walked on again and soon mrs peachs father met them and relieved jim of the lady  when they had parted jim with an expiration not unlike a breath of relief went on to mr vines and having put the horse into the stable entered the house  his partner was seated at the table solacing himself after the labours of the day by luxurious alternations between a long clay pipe and a mug of perry  well said jim eagerly whats the newshow do she take it  sit downsit down said vine  tis working well not but that i deserve something o thee for the trouble ive had in watching her the soldiering was a fine move but the woman is a betterwho invented it  i myself said jim modestly  well jealousy is making her rise like a thunderstorm and in a day or two youll have her for the asking my sonny  whats the next step  the widow is getting rather a weight upon a feller worse luck said jim  but i must keep it up until tomorrow at any rate  i have promised to see her at the review and now the great thing is that margery should see we asmiling togetheri in my fulldress uniform and clinking arms o war  twill be a good strong sting and will end the business i hope  couldnt you manage to put the hoss in and drive her there  shed go if you were to ask her  with all my heart said mr vine moistening the end of a new pipe in his perry  i can call at her grammers for hertwill be all in my way    chapter xvi    margery duly followed up her intention by arraying herself the next morning in her loveliest guise and keeping watch for mr vines appearance upon the high road feeling certain that his would form one in the procession of carts and carriages which set in towards exonbury that day  jim had gone by at a very early hour and she did not see him pass  her anticipation was verified by the advent of mr vine about eleven oclock dressed to his highest effort but margery was surprised to find that instead of her having to stop him he pulled in towards the gate of his own accord  the invitation planned between jim and the old man on the previous night was now promptly given and as may be supposed as promptly accepted  such a strange coincidence she had never before known  she was quite ready and they drove onward at once  the review was held on some high ground a little way out of the city and her conductor suggested that they should put up the horse at the inn and walk to the fielda plan which pleased her well for it was more easy to take preliminary observations on foot without being seen herself than when sitting elevated in a vehicle  they were just in time to secure a good place near the front and in a few minutes after their arrival the reviewing officer came on the ground  margerys eye had rapidly run over the troop in which jim was enrolled and she discerned him in one of the ranks looking remarkably new and bright both as to uniform and countenance indeed if she had not worked herself into such a desperate state of mind she would have felt proud of him then and there  his shapely upright figure was quite noteworthy in the row of rotund yeomen on his right and left while his charger tony expressed by his bearing even more than jim that he knew nothing about limecarts whatever and everything about trumpets and glory  how jim could have scrubbed tony to such shining blackness she could not tell for the horse in his natural state was ingrained with limedust that burnt the colour out of his coat as it did out of jims hair  now he pranced martially and was a warhorse every inch of him  having discovered jim her next search was for mrs peach and by dint of some oblique glancing margery indignantly discovered the widow in the most forward place of all her head and bright face conspicuously advanced and what was more shocking she had abandoned her mourning for a violet drawnbonnet and a gay spencer together with a parasol luxuriously fringed in a way margery had never before seen  where did she get the money said margery under her breath  and to forget that poor sailor so soon  these general reflections were precipitately postponed by her discovering that jim and the widow were perfectly alive to each others whereabouts and in the interchange of telegraphic signs of affection which on the latters part took the form of a playful fluttering of her handkerchief or waving of her parasol  richard vine had placed margery in front of him to protect her from the crowd as he said he himself surveying the scene over her bonnet margery would have been even more surprised than she was if she had known that jim was not only aware of mrs peachs presence but also of her own the treacherous mr vine having drawn out his flame coloured handkerchief and waved it to jim over the young womans head as soon as they had taken up their position  my partner makes a tidy soldier ehmiss tucker said the senior limeburner  it is my belief as a christian that hes got a party here that hes making signs tothat handsome figure o fun straight overright him  perhaps so she said  and its growing warm between em if i dont mistake continued the merciless vine  margery was silent biting her lip and the troops being now set in motion all signalling ceased for the present between soldier hayward and his pretended sweetheart  have you a piece of paper that i could make a memorandum on mr vine asked margery  vine took out his pocketbook and tore a leaf from it which he handed her with a pencil  dont move from hereill return in a minute she continued with the innocence of a woman who means mischief  and withdrawing herself to the back where the grass was clear she pencilled down the words   jims married   armed with this document she crept into the throng behind the unsuspecting mrs peach slipped the paper into her pocket on the top of her handkerchief and withdrew unobserved rejoining mr vine with a bearing of nonchalance  byandby the troops were in different order jim taking a lefthand position almost close to mrs peach  he bent down and said a few words to her  from her manner of nodding assent it was surely some arrangement about a meeting byandby when jims drill was over and margery was more certain of the fact when the review having ended and the people having strolled off to another part of the field where sports were to take place mrs peach tripped away in the direction of the city  ill just say a word to my partner afore he goes off the ground if youll spare me a minute said the old limeburner  please stay here till im back again  he edged along the front till he reached jim  how is she said the latter  in a trimming sweat said mr vine  and my counsel to ee is to carry this larry no further  twill do no good  shes as ready to make friends with ee as any wife can be and more showing off can only do harm  but i must finish off with a spurt said jim  and this is how i am going to do it  i have arranged with mrs peach that as soon as we soldiers have entered the town and been dismissed ill meet her there  it is really to say goodbye but she dont know that and i wanted it to look like a lopement to margerys eyes  when im clear of mrs peach ill come back here and make it up with margery on the spot  but dont say im coming or she may be inclined to throw off again  just hint to her that i may be meaning to be off to london with the widow  the old man still insisted that this was going too far  no no it isnt said jim  i know how to manage her  twill just mellow her heart nicely by the time i come back  i must bring her down real tender or twill all fail  his senior reluctantly gave in and returned to margery  a short time afterwards the yeomanry hand struck up and jim with the regiment followed towards exonbury  yes yes they are going to meet said margery to herself perceiving that mrs peach had so timed her departure as to be in the town at jims dismounting  now we will go and see the games said mr vine they are really worth seeing  theres greasy poles and jumping in sacks and other trials of the intellect that nobody ought to miss who wants to be abreast of his generation  margery felt so indignant at the apparent assignation which seemed about to take place despite her anonymous writing that she helplessly assented to go anywhere dropping behind vine that he might not see her mood  jim followed out his programme with literal exactness  no sooner was the troop dismissed in the city than he sent tony to stable and joined mrs peach who stood on the edge of the pavement expecting him  but this acquaintance was to end  he meant to part from her for ever and in the quickest time though civilly for it was important to be with margery as soon as possible  he had nearly completed the manoeuvre to his satisfaction when in drawing her handkerchief from her pocket to wipe the tears from her eyes mrs peachs hand grasped the paper which she read at once  what is that true she said holding it out to jim  jim started and admitted that it was beginning an elaborate explanation and apologies  but mrs peach was thoroughly roused and then overcome  hes married hes married she said and swooned or feigned to swoon so that jim was obliged to support her  hes married hes married said a boy hard by who watched the scene with interest  hes married hes married said a hilarious group of other boys near with smiles several inches broad and shining teeth and so the exclamation echoed down the street  jim cursed his illluck the loss of time that this dilemma entailed grew serious for mrs peach was now in such a hysterical state that he could not leave her with any good grace or feeling  it was necessary to take her to a refreshment room lavish restoratives upon her and altogether to waste nearly half an hour  when she had kept him as long as she chose she forgave him and thus at last he got away his heart swelling with tenderness towards margery  he at once hurried up the street to effect the reconciliation with her  how shall i do it he said to himself  why ill step round to her side fish for her hand draw it through my arm as if i wasnt aware of it  then shell look in my face i shall look in hers and we shall march off the field triumphant and the thing will be done without takings or tears  he entered the field and went straight as an arrow to the place appointed for the meeting  it was at the back of a refreshment tent outside the mass of spectators and divided from their view by the tent itself  he turned the corner of the canvas and there beheld vine at the indicated spot  but margery was not with him  vines hat was thrust back into his poll  his face was pale and his manner bewildered  hullo whats the matter said jim  wheres my margery  youve carried this footy game too far my man exclaimed vine with the air of a friend who has always told you so  you ought to have dropped it several days ago when she would have come to ee like a cooing dove  now this is the end ot  hey what my margery  has anything happened for gods sake  shes gone  where to  thats more than earthly man can tell  i never see such a thing twas a stroke o the black artas if she were sperrited away  when we got to the games i saidmind you told me toi said jim hayward thinks o going off to london with that widow womanmind you told me to  she showed no wonderment though a seemed very low then she said to me i dont like standing here in this slummocky crowd  i shall feel more at home among the gentlepeople  and then she went to where the carriages were drawn up and near her there was a grand coach ablazing with lions and unicorns and hauled by two coalblack horses  i hardly thought much of it then and by degrees lost sight of her behind it  presently the other carriages moved off and i thought still to see her standing there  but no she had vanished and then i saw the grand coach rolling away and glimpsed margery in it beside a fine dark gentleman with black mustachios and a very pale princelike face  as soon as the horses got into the hard road they rattled on like hellandskimmer and went out of sight in the dust andthats all  if youd come back a little sooner youd ha caught her  jim had turned whiter than his pipeclay  o this is too badtoo bad he cried in anguish striking his brow  that paper and that fainting woman kept me so long  who could have done it  but tis my fault  ive stung her too much  i shouldnt have carried it so far  you shouldntjust what i said replied his senior  she thinks ive gone off with that cust widow and to spite me shes gone off with the man  do you know who that stranger wi the lions and unicorns is  why tis that foreigner who calls himself a baron and took mount lodge for six months last year to make mischiefa villain  o my margerythat it should come to this  shes lost shes ruinedwhich way did they go  jim turned to follow in the direction indicated when behold there stood at his back her father dairyman tucker  now look here young man said dairyman tucker  ive just heard all that wailingand straightway will ask ee to stop it sharp tis like your brazen impudence to teave and wail when you be another womans husband yes faith i seed her afainting in yer arms when you wanted to get away from her and honest folk astanding round who knew youd married her and said so  i heard it though you didnt see me  hes married says they  some sly registeroffice business no doubt but sly doings will out  as for margerywhos to be called higher titles in these parts henceforardim her father and i say its all right what shes done  dont i know private news hey  havent i just learnt that secret weddings of high people can happen at expected deathbeds by special licence as well as low people at registrars offices  and cant husbands come back and claim their own when they choose  begone young man and leave noblemens wives alone and i thank god i shall be rid of a numskull  swift words of explanation rose to jims lips but they paused there and died  at that last moment he could not as margerys husband announce margerys shame and his own and transform her fathers triumph to wretchedness at a blow  iimust leave here he stammered  going from the place in an opposite course to that of the fugitives he doubled when out of sight and in an incredibly short space had entered the town  here he made inquiries for the emblazoned carriage and gained from one or two persons a general idea of its route  they thought it had taken the highway to london  saddling poor tony before he had half eaten his corn jim galloped along the same road    chapter xvii    now jim was quite mistaken in supposing that by leaving the field in a roundabout manner he had deceived dairyman tucker as to his object that astute old man immediately divined that jim was meaning to track the fugitives in ignorance as the dairyman supposed of their lawful relation  he was soon assured of the fact for creeping to a remote angle of the field he saw jim hastening into the town vowing vengeance on the young limeburner for his mischievous interference between a nobleman and his secretlywedded wife the dairyfarmer determined to balk him  tucker had ridden on to the review ground so that there was no necessity for him as there had been for poor jim to reenter the town before starting  the dairyman hastily untied his mare from the row of other horses mounted and descended to a bridlepath which would take him obliquely into the london road a mile or so ahead the old mans route being along one side of an equilateral triangle while jims was along two sides of the same the former was at the point of intersection long before hayward  arrived here the dairyman pulled up and looked around  it was a spot at which the highway forked the left arm the more important led on through sherton abbas and melchester to london the right to idmouth and the coast  nothing was visible on the white track to london but on the other there appeared the back of a carriage which rapidly ascended a distant hill and vanished under the trees  it was the barons who according to the sworn information of the gardener at mount lodge had made margery his wife  the carriage having vanished the dairyman gazed in the opposite direction towards exonbury  here he beheld jim in his regimentals laboriously approaching on tonys back  soon he reached the forking roads and saw the dairyman by the wayside  but jim did not halt  then the dairyman practised the greatest duplicity of his life  right along the london road if you want to catch em he said  thank ee dairyman thank ee cried jim his pale face lighting up with gratitude for he believed that tucker had learnt his mistake from vine and had come to his assistance  without drawing rein he diminished along the road not taken by the flying pair  the dairyman rubbed his hands with delight and returned to the city as the cathedral clock struck five  jim pursued his way through the dust up hill and down hill but never saw ahead of him the vehicle of his search  that vehicle was passing along a diverging way at a distance of many miles from where he rode  still he sped onwards till tony showed signs of breaking down and then jim gathered from inquiries he made that he had come the wrong way  it burst upon his mind that the dairyman still ignorant of the truth had misinformed him  heavier in his heart than words can describe he turned tonys drooping head and resolved to drag his way home  but the horse was now so jaded that it was impossible to proceed far having gone about half a mile back he came again to a small roadside hamlet and inn where he put up tony for a rest and feed  as for himself there was no quiet in him  he tried to sit and eat in the inn kitchen but he could not stay there  he went out and paced up and down the road  standing in sight of the white way by which he had come he beheld advancing towards him the horses and carriage he sought now black and daemonic against the slanting fires of the western sun  the why and wherefore of this sudden appearance he did not pause to consider  his resolve to intercept the carriage was instantaneous he ran forward and doggedly waiting barred the way to the advancing equipage  the barons coachman shouted but jim stood firm as a rock and on the former attempting to push past him jim drew his sword resolving to cut the horses down rather than be displaced  the animals were thrown nearly back upon their haunches and at this juncture a gentleman looked out of the window  it was the baron himself  whos there he inquired  james hayward replied the young man fiercely and he demands his wife  the baron leapt out and told the coachman to drive back out of sight and wait for him  i was hastening to find you he said to jim  your wife is where she ought to be and where you ought to be alsoby your own fireside  wheres the other woman  jim without replying looked incredulously into the carriage as it turned  margery was certainly not there  the other woman is nothing to me he said bitterly  i used her to warm up margery  i have now done with her  the question i ask my lord is what business had you with margery today  my business was to help her to regain the husband she had seemingly lost  i saw her she told me you had eloped by the london road with another  i who havemostlyhad her happiness at heart told her i would help her to follow you if she wished  she gladly agreed we drove after but could hear no tidings of you in front of us  then i took herto your houseand there she awaits you  i promised to send you to her if human effort could do it and was tracking you for that purpose  then youve been apursuing after me  you and the widow  and ive been pursuing after you and margery  my noble lord your actions seem to show that i ought to believe you in this and when you say youve her happiness at heart i dont forget that youve formerly proved it to be so  well heaven forbid that i should think wrongfully of you if you dont deserve it  a mystery to me you have always been my noble lord and in this business more than in any  i am glad to hear you say no worse  in one hour youll have proof of my conductgood and bad  can i do anything more  say the word and ill try  jim reflected  baron he said i am a plain man and wish only to lead a quiet life with my wife as a man should  you have great power over herpower to any extent for good or otherwise  if you command her anything on earth righteous or questionable that shell do  so that since you ask me if you can do more for me ill answer this you can promise never to see her again  i mean no harm my lord but your presence can do no good you will trouble us  if i return to her will you for ever stay away  hayward said the baron i swear to you that i will disturb you and your wife by my presence no more  and he took jims hand and pressed it within his own upon the hilt of jims sword  in relating this incident to the present narrator jim used to declare that to his fancy the ruddy light of the setting sun burned with more than earthly fire on the barons face as the words were spoken and that the ruby flash of his eye in the same light was what he never witnessed before nor since in the eye of mortal man  after this there was nothing more to do or say in that place  jim accompanied his nevertobeforgotten acquaintance to the carriage closed the door after him waved his hat to him and from that hour he and the baron met not again on earth  a few words will suffice to explain the fortunes of margery while the foregoing events were in action elsewhere  on leaving her companion vine she had gone distractedly among the carriages the rather to escape his observation than of any set purpose  standing here she thought she heard her name pronounced and turning saw her foreign friend whom she had supposed to be if not dead a thousand miles off  he beckoned and she went close  you are illyou are wretched he said looking keenly in her face  wheres your husband  she told him her sad suspicion that jim had run away from her  the baron reflected and inquired a few other particulars of her late life  then he said  you and i must find him  come with me  at this word of command from the baron she had entered the carriage as docilely as a child and there she sat beside him till he chose to speak which was not till they were some way out of the town at the forking ways and the baron had discovered that jim was certainly not as they had supposed making off from margery along that particular branch of the fork that led to london  to pursue him in this way is useless i perceive he said  and the proper course now is that i should take you to his house  that done i will return and bring him to you if mortal persuasion can do it  i didnt want to go to his house without him sir said she tremblingly  didnt want to he answered  let me remind you margery hayward that your place is in your husbands house  till you are there you have no right to criticize his conduct however wild it may be  why have you not been there before  i dont know sir she murmured her tears falling silently upon her hand  dont you think you ought to be there  she did not answer  of course you ought  still she did not speak  the baron sank into silence and allowed his eye to rest on her what thoughts were all at once engaging his mind after those moments of reproof  margery had given herself into his hands without a remonstrance her husband had apparently deserted her  she was absolutely in his power and they were on the high road  that his first impulse in inviting her to accompany him had been the legitimate one denoted by his words cannot reasonably be doubted that his second was otherwise soon became revealed though not at first to her for she was too bewildered to notice where they were going  instead of turning and taking the road to jims the baron as if influenced suddenly by her reluctance to return thither if jim was playing truant signalled to the coachman to take the branch road to the right as her father had discerned  they soon approached the coast near idmouth  the carriage stopped margery awoke from her reverie  where are we she said looking out of the window with a start before her was an inlet of the sea and in the middle of the inlet rode a yacht its masts repeating as if from memory the rocking they had practised in their native forest  at a little seaside nook where my yacht lies at anchor he said tentatively  now margery in five minutes we can be aboard and in half an hour we can be sailing away all the world over  will you come  i cannot decide she said in low tones  why not  because  then on a sudden margery seemed to see all contingencies  she became white as a fleece and a bewildered look came into her eyes with clasped hands she leant on the baron  baron von xanten observed her distracted look averted his face and coming to a decision opened the carriage door quickly mounted outside and in a second or two the carriage left the shore behind and ascended the road by which it had come  in about an hour they reached jim haywards home  the baron alighted and spoke to her through the window  margery can you forgive a lovers bad impulse which i swear was unpremeditated he asked  if you can shake my hand  she did not do it but eventually allowed him to help her out of the carriage  he seemed to feel the awkwardness keenly and seeing it she said of course i forgive you sir for i felt for a moment as you did  will you send my husband to me  i will if any man can said he  such penance is milder than i deserve  god bless you and give you happiness  i shall never see you again  he turned entered the carriage and was gone and having found out jims course came up with him upon the road as described  in due time the latter reached his lodging at his partners  the woman who took care of the house in vines absence at once told jim that a lady who had come in a carriage was waiting for him in his sittingroom  jim proceeded thither with agitation and beheld shrinkingly ensconced in the large slippery chair and surrounded by the brilliant articles that had so long awaited her his long estranged wife  margerys eyes were round and fearstricken  she essayed to speak but jim strangely enough found the readier tongue then  why did i do it you would ask he said  i cannot tell  do you forgive my deception  o margeryyou are my margery still  but how could you trust yourself in the barons hands this afternoon without knowing him better  he said i was to come and i went she said as well as she could for tearfulness  you obeyed him blindly  i did  but perhaps i was not justified in doing it  i dont know said jim musingly  i think hes a good man margery did not explain  and then a sunnier mood succeeded her tremblings and tears till old mr vine came into the house below and jim went down to declare that all was well and sent off his partner to break the news to margerys father who as yet remained unenlightened  the dairyman bore the intelligence of his daughters untitled state as best he could and punished her by not coming near her for several weeks though at last he grumbled his forgiveness and made up matters with jim  the handsome mrs peach vanished to plymouth and found another sailor not without a reasonable complaint against jim and margery both that she had been unfairly used  as for the mysterious gentleman who had exercised such an influence over their lives he kept his word and was a stranger to lower wessex thenceforward  baron or no baron englishman or foreigner he had shown a genuine interest in jim and real sorrow for a certain reckless phase of his acquaintance with margery  that he had a more tender feeling toward the young girl than he wished her or any one else to perceive there could be no doubt  that he was strongly tempted at times to adopt other than conventional courses with regard to her is also clear particularly at that critical hour when she rolled along the high road with him in the carriage after turning from the fancied pursuit of jim  but at other times he schooled impassioned sentiments into fair conduct which even erred on the side of harshness  in after years there was a report that another attempt on his life with a pistol during one of those fits of moodiness to which he seemed constitutionally liable had been effectual but nobody in silverthorn was in a position to ascertain the truth  there he is still regarded as one who had something about him magical and unearthly  in his mystery let him remain for a man no less than a landscape who awakens an interest under uncertain lights and touches of unfathomable shade may cut but a poor figure in a garish noontide shine  when she heard of his mournful death margery sat in her nursing chair gravely thinking for nearly ten minutes to the total neglect of her infant in the cradle  jim from the other side of the fire place said  you are sorry enough for him margery  i am sure of that  yes yes she murmured i am sorry  after a moment she added now that hes dead ill make a confession jim that i have never made to a soul  if he had pressed mewhich he did notto go with him when i was in the carriage that night beside his yacht i would have gone  and i was disappointed that he did not press me  suppose he were to suddenly appear now and say in a voice of command margery come with me  i believe i should have no power to disobey she returned with a mischievous look  he was like a magician to me  i think he was one  he could move me as a loadstone moves a speck of steel    yet no she added hearing the infant cry he would not move me now  it would be so unfair to baby  well said jim with no great concern for la jalousie retrospective as george sand calls it had nearly died out of him however he might move ee my love hell never come  he swore it to me  and he was a man of his word  midsummer 1883
